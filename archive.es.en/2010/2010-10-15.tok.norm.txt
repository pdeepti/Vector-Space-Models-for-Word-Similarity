some humanitarian organizations believe the president 's policy will end a growing trend toward the militarization of aid . for the first time in american history , a us administration has issued a global development policy .
president obama declared during his recent speech before the un millennium goals summit that development is not strictly an end in itself .
instead , it is a component of a wider national security strategy that defends us interests abroad . " my national security strategy recognizes development not only as a moral imperative , but a strategic and economic imperative , " obama said before the un general assembly .
in an era when the defense department is playing an increased role in development , some humanitarian organizations believe the president 's new policy will reverse the growing trend toward the militarization of aid .
new conflicts , new threats for decades , the us had trained its military to deter a conventional soviet military advance into western europe .
but in a wave of unexpected political upheaval , the eastern bloc imploded without a shot being fired .
as a consequence , political leaders in washington questioned the utility of bloated defense budgets in the belief that the " peace dividend " should free up resources for civilian ends .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : humanitarian interventions are designed to protect civilians although the cold war had ended , the peace dividend proved premature . the media broadcast images of social collapse from the battlefields of bosnia and somalia , documenting a growing trend toward war fought within nations instead of between them .
" the end of the cold war to some degree meant the lid came off that had suppressed internal conflicts in many countries , and as a result you then see the breakdown in weaker or failed states , " mark schneider , senior vice president of the international crisis group , told deutsche welle .
" you see the break down of institutions and internal conflicts grow and multiply , " schneider said . " it 's in that context that the united states and the european union view the consequences of failed states and instability as a potential for conflict that can affect their own citizens and interests . "
job of civilians or soldiers ?
as the us military intervened to contain these brutal civil wars , it began to adopt a new humanitarian mandate with the goal of protecting human life instead of destroying it .
the enemy was no longer a uniformed army , but instead the political and economic instability that had led to ethnic cleansing in bosnia and famine in somalia .
commanders on the ground recognized that a process of social collapse could not be reversed by airstrikes .
ultimately , long-term economic and political development would secure victory .
in an ad-hoc fashion , soldiers started taking on traditional civilian roles , acting as policemen , diplomats and social workers .
the front line had vanished , and the difference between military and development objectives had become muddled .
" meanwhile , more and more responsibilities have been delegated to the military , " david bosold , an expert on human security at the german council on foreign relations , told deutsche welle .
" since there is n't a stable security situation , sometimes it 's simply not possible to find development organizations that are willing to go there .
the main problem is that there 's nobody except for the military that can make an impact . "
military taking the lead after september 11 , the convergence of development and defense responsibilities took a new turn .
a transnational network of terrorists had launched an attack on the us from afghanistan , underscoring the dangers of failed states .
in response , policymakers in washington turned to development as a way to defeat terrorism by combating the poverty that leads to social instability and extremism .
the bush administration institutionalized this view by designating three pillars of american foreign policy : defense , diplomacy and development - the 3ds .
however , development agencies such as usaid remained poorly resourced while the defense department 's budget rapidly expanded .
as a result , the military started conducting its own development work .
the goal was not to altruistically satisfy human need , but to advance american interests and win the war on terror .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the military has become increasingly involved in humanitarian and development assistance " the politics of it are rather stark , " noam unger , the director of the foreign assistance reform program with the brookings institution , told deutsche welle .
" the defense industry and the department of defense have assets placed in every political district across the united states . "
" there are bases , manufacturers , suppliers and those are tied to political interests at the local level that feed up to capitol hill and effect funding , " unger continued . " the state department and usaid operate overseas and so the constituency is actually different and that affects the politics . "
development as a weapon of war as the us military struggled to contain growing insurgencies in afghanistan and iraq , military commanders looked for quick ways to win hearts and minds .
in response , the concept of the provincial reconstruction team -lrb- prt -rrb- was introduced .
prts would apply the 3ds by bringing military and civilian agencies together to conduct development work in regions at risk for extremism . the military , however , increasingly became the face of development to the local population .
" it creates a degree of confusion , " gregory adams , director of aid effectiveness at oxfam america , told deutsche welle .
" they -lrb- local population -rrb- do rightly question our intent when they see soldiers involved in this work .
it does n't necessarily increase their trust of troops to a large degree , but it does reduce their trust in civilians . "
the defense department was using development as a weapon of war .
as a consequence , aid agencies voiced concern that a militarization of development was taking place which would undermine their humanitarian objectives .
in search of balance by declaring development vital to us national security , obama 's new strategy - at least in word - makes development indispensible to achieving foreign policy goals .
development becomes important in its own right , not just as an instrument of defense department objectives .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us policy now views development as vital to the national interest " there 's a lot of people involved in development who argue for development for development 's sake , " beth ellen cole , an expert on post-conflict and peacekeeping activities with the united states peace institute , told deutsche welle .
" but in a resource-constrained environment where every dollar is under scrutiny , you have to make a case why development ... is important , " cole said . " if you 're going to elevate development , you have to make a strong case that it 's important to national security . "
the rebalancing of development and defense may signal a change in the way american foreign policy is conducted .
instead of planning how to win wars , policymakers in washington may start planning how to prevent them from ever breaking out .
and an institutional bias toward prevention could reduce the demand for military involvement in development work .
" if the president is going to be serious about the 3ds that define our national security strategy and how we pursue our foreign policy mission , then development needs to have a voice at the table for how those decisions are made , " adams said .
" if you do n't have a development voice at the table you 're basically deciding from the beginning that you 're not going to take a development approach . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : focus : midterm elections in the us eu and us ' must work together , ' says diplomat obama seeks to mobilize disappointed voters foreign donations spark row ahead of us midterm elections shift to the right in midterm elections could affect us foreign policy development policy -pipe- 15.10.2010 obama to give development a larger role in us foreign policy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama announced america 's first global development policy president obama has declared development assistance vital to us national security interests .
some humanitarian organizations believe the president 's policy will end a growing trend toward the militarization of aid . for the first time in american history , a us administration has issued a global development policy .
president obama declared during his recent speech before the un millennium goals summit that development is not strictly an end in itself .
instead , it is a component of a wider national security strategy that defends us interests abroad . " my national security strategy recognizes development not only as a moral imperative , but a strategic and economic imperative , " obama said before the un general assembly .
in an era when the defense department is playing an increased role in development , some humanitarian organizations believe the president 's new policy will reverse the growing trend toward the militarization of aid .
new conflicts , new threats for decades , the us had trained its military to deter a conventional soviet military advance into western europe .
but in a wave of unexpected political upheaval , the eastern bloc imploded without a shot being fired .
as a consequence , political leaders in washington questioned the utility of bloated defense budgets in the belief that the " peace dividend " should free up resources for civilian ends .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : humanitarian interventions are designed to protect civilians although the cold war had ended , the peace dividend proved premature . the media broadcast images of social collapse from the battlefields of bosnia and somalia , documenting a growing trend toward war fought within nations instead of between them .
" the end of the cold war to some degree meant the lid came off that had suppressed internal conflicts in many countries , and as a result you then see the breakdown in weaker or failed states , " mark schneider , senior vice president of the international crisis group , told deutsche welle .
" you see the break down of institutions and internal conflicts grow and multiply , " schneider said . " it 's in that context that the united states and the european union view the consequences of failed states and instability as a potential for conflict that can affect their own citizens and interests . "
job of civilians or soldiers ?
as the us military intervened to contain these brutal civil wars , it began to adopt a new humanitarian mandate with the goal of protecting human life instead of destroying it .
the enemy was no longer a uniformed army , but instead the political and economic instability that had led to ethnic cleansing in bosnia and famine in somalia .
commanders on the ground recognized that a process of social collapse could not be reversed by airstrikes .
ultimately , long-term economic and political development would secure victory .
in an ad-hoc fashion , soldiers started taking on traditional civilian roles , acting as policemen , diplomats and social workers .
the front line had vanished , and the difference between military and development objectives had become muddled .
" meanwhile , more and more responsibilities have been delegated to the military , " david bosold , an expert on human security at the german council on foreign relations , told deutsche welle .
" since there is n't a stable security situation , sometimes it 's simply not possible to find development organizations that are willing to go there .
the main problem is that there 's nobody except for the military that can make an impact . "
military taking the lead after september 11 , the convergence of development and defense responsibilities took a new turn .
a transnational network of terrorists had launched an attack on the us from afghanistan , underscoring the dangers of failed states .
in response , policymakers in washington turned to development as a way to defeat terrorism by combating the poverty that leads to social instability and extremism .
the bush administration institutionalized this view by designating three pillars of american foreign policy : defense , diplomacy and development - the 3ds .
however , development agencies such as usaid remained poorly resourced while the defense department 's budget rapidly expanded .
as a result , the military started conducting its own development work .
the goal was not to altruistically satisfy human need , but to advance american interests and win the war on terror .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the military has become increasingly involved in humanitarian and development assistance " the politics of it are rather stark , " noam unger , the director of the foreign assistance reform program with the brookings institution , told deutsche welle .
" the defense industry and the department of defense have assets placed in every political district across the united states . "
" there are bases , manufacturers , suppliers and those are tied to political interests at the local level that feed up to capitol hill and effect funding , " unger continued . " the state department and usaid operate overseas and so the constituency is actually different and that affects the politics . "
development as a weapon of war as the us military struggled to contain growing insurgencies in afghanistan and iraq , military commanders looked for quick ways to win hearts and minds .
in response , the concept of the provincial reconstruction team -lrb- prt -rrb- was introduced .
prts would apply the 3ds by bringing military and civilian agencies together to conduct development work in regions at risk for extremism . the military , however , increasingly became the face of development to the local population .
" it creates a degree of confusion , " gregory adams , director of aid effectiveness at oxfam america , told deutsche welle .
" they -lrb- local population -rrb- do rightly question our intent when they see soldiers involved in this work .
it does n't necessarily increase their trust of troops to a large degree , but it does reduce their trust in civilians . "
the defense department was using development as a weapon of war .
as a consequence , aid agencies voiced concern that a militarization of development was taking place which would undermine their humanitarian objectives .
in search of balance by declaring development vital to us national security , obama 's new strategy - at least in word - makes development indispensible to achieving foreign policy goals .
development becomes important in its own right , not just as an instrument of defense department objectives .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us policy now views development as vital to the national interest " there 's a lot of people involved in development who argue for development for development 's sake , " beth ellen cole , an expert on post-conflict and peacekeeping activities with the united states peace institute , told deutsche welle .
" but in a resource-constrained environment where every dollar is under scrutiny , you have to make a case why development ... is important , " cole said . " if you 're going to elevate development , you have to make a strong case that it 's important to national security . "
the rebalancing of development and defense may signal a change in the way american foreign policy is conducted .
instead of planning how to win wars , policymakers in washington may start planning how to prevent them from ever breaking out .
and an institutional bias toward prevention could reduce the demand for military involvement in development work .
" if the president is going to be serious about the 3ds that define our national security strategy and how we pursue our foreign policy mission , then development needs to have a voice at the table for how those decisions are made , " adams said .
" if you do n't have a development voice at the table you 're basically deciding from the beginning that you 're not going to take a development approach . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de balkans -pipe- 15.10.2010 serbian ultranationalists struggle against a changing homeland großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the football match was later called off because of the riots serbian ultranationalists who recently sparked football match riots in italy are trying to destabilize serbia , analysts say .
however , their voices are not representative of a country moving increasingly towards europe . it was more than brute violence : the recent heavy rioting at a european football match between italy and serbia in genoa on tuesday could not be put down solely to the actions of a few hooligans .
this tainting of the serbian national team was the result of ultranationalist groups who were bent on venting their discontent with the direction their country is taking , say experts from the brussels think-tank the centre for european policy studies -lrb- ceps -rrb- .
this small part of the serbian population feels unfairly treated and betrayed by the new orientation taken by their country towards europe . this underlying anger has used as its trigger the difficult economic conditions currently affecting serbia , as well as the high levels of unemployment - which stands at around 20 percent - and the still-raw memories of the breakup of yugoslavia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police detained 17 people after the riots the ultranationalists have seemingly set themselves the goal of making as much noise as possible , but , according to the ceps , this does not mean the movement enjoys support from the broader serbian community .
" serbia was and still is a traditional and orthodox country , where the influence of the church and history is big , " explains georg dura , an analyst with ceps .
" but above all , serbia must make peace with the past in order to move on with the future .
the majority of serbs agree with this . "
eye to europe dura says that only one minority within serbia was represented by the ultranationalists , who , he adds , are increasingly " losing ground . "
" they have now realized this and are reacting this way as a result , " dura says .
" they feel their leaders have sold them out by , for example , taking a more moderate approach towards -lsb- the breakaway region of -rsb- kosovo in recent months . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : serbia has not yet recognized kosovo as an independent state the ceps analyst says the government in belgrade has actively been trying to show the european union that it values the fundamental tenants of a free society such as tolerance and democracy through cooperation over kosovo , and by publicly supporting a recent gay pride parade .
traditionalist and nationalist groups in serbia have rejected both these overtures categorically .
according to ceps , the story of serbia over recent years has been unique , and has left the country deeply divided into backward-orientated and forward-looking factions .
for this reason , it is difficult to compare the country of around seven million with other european states .
" as time has passed opposition has disappeared , and the population has become more open and tolerant .
these have all been lessons learned on the way to the eu .
a society must be open , the citizens must have the freedom of speech , " he says , adding that social changes take time , especially when dealing with post-communist states like serbia .
eu support ' integral ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anti-gay protestors clashed with serbian riot police dura says that the european union has supported serbia in the days following the football riots in italy , and must continue to help the country on its path towards eu integration .
" the good relations with the eu have not been clouded by these events .
but the eu must give serbia membership candidate status to immediately shore up their support for democratic change in the country , " dura says .
" the eu must now support serbia politically and economically , " says the analyst , adding that this will provide serbian youth with a brighter future , and encourage the government to continue to make progress on social and political reforms .

jakub blaszczykowski netted the first goal , with nuri sahin scoring the winner in injury time . former champions league winners borussia dortmund have defeated struggling cologne 2-1 away from home in the pouring rain in friday night 's bundesliga clash .
the winner came through nuri sahin in the 91st minute after the midfielder found the back of the net from close range after a goalmouth scramble .
dortmund seized momentum from the outset and should have taken the lead on 17 minutes when a cross from sahin found the head of striker lucas barrios , but the paraguayan put the ball over with the goal at his mercy .
the black and yellow from dortmund did n't have to wait much longer , however , when three minutes later japan international shinji kagawa played the ball into the cologne box where barrios headed it onto the knee of pole jakub blaszczykowski , nicknamed kuba , from which it bounced over the goal line .
the goal sparked cologne into action , but dortmund keeper roman weidenfeller denied attempts from portuguese midfielder petit and german international lukas podolski .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sahin 's goal came late in the game cologne were finally rewarded for their efforts when they tied the match up with eight minutes remaining after a poor dortmund clearance fell to podolski on the edge of the area .
weidenfeller had no chance against his left-footed shot , which clocked at 110 kilometers per hour .
but just as cologne thought they had secured a much-needed point , dortmund struck back with the late winner through sahin .
the win moves dortmund to equal top of the bundesliga , along with mainz , on 21 points , while cologne languish in 16th place and risk dropping another position if either schalke or stuttgart come away with all three points in their saturday game against each other .

the all-pervasive violence has not only caused physical wounds . there is a part of kabul , the capital of afghanistan , which afghan taxi drivers normally try to avoid .
when foreigners ask them , " are there terrorists ? " , their simple answer is : " no , junkies " .
junkies were a totally unknown phenomenon in afghanistan until quite recently , which is why most people are at a loss to know how to deal with the growing number of addicts .
in a way , it is the same with traumatized or depressed people .
the society at large and even their own relatives mostly react to mentally disturbed people with a lack of understanding or even with shame .
bildunterschrift : female drug addicts at one of the few treatment centers in kabul hiding away the patients many try to cover up the problem , says ahmad shafiq behrozian from the western city of herat .
" we afghans have no idea how to interact with mentally ill persons .
mostly we treat them as dangerous and crazy individuals .
sometimes they are chained or locked away in a separate room by their own relatives . "
doctors reckon that the growing number of the mentally ill is due to a number of reasons : war , experience of violence and subsequent traumata .
in addition , poverty and malnutrition can also contribute to a disease , because physically healthy persons are more resilient when they experience emotional stress .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : afghanistan 's hospitals are ill equipped to treat psychiatric patients unbearable stress when the stress becomes unbearable or , as in the situation of permanent conflict in afghanistan , when it piles up and people have no chance of getting it out of their system , they can experience a breakdown .
tragically , this changed behavior is normally not recognized as an illness , explains fatema jafari , a member of the provincial council in herat .
" you can easily tell that there is a high number of mental disorders here in herat , simply from the high incidence of self-immolations , violent attacks in public as well as domestic violence .
but nobody is interested in the real causes , no one talks about it .
more than 60 percent of the population have mental problems . "
lack of psychiatric services making it worse , not even doctors diagnose the illness at times .
muhammad ghulam ali from herat says , " we have a mental patient in our family .
we took him to see several doctors , but to no avail .
he ca n't control himself and is violent .
only when we keep absolute silence in the room , he can relax to some extent . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : children are especially vulnerable in this situation , qualified doctors and especially psychiatrists are badly needed , as are psychiatric wards in the hospitals , says peter graaff from the world health organization , the who .
" and yet , investment in mental health services is very limited at best . "
for example , there are currently only about 200 beds for psychiatric services in the country . " and there are no services targeting children specifically , " he adds . in fact , it is the children who would need medical care most urgently .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 15.10.2010 ahead of match day eight , dw pundits are seeing stars großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if you look very hard , you might just find this constellation - promise this season , the dw sports team are predicting the results of all bundesliga matches .
after the last match day 's battering , our pundits hope they 've got their heads back for match day eight . after a two-week international break , match day eight is in ascendance and the dw bundesliga pundits are back at it .
after a poor set of predictions on the last match day -lrb- see below -rrb- , they 've resolved to look to the stars for guidance .
this week 's predictor hopes for the best , but has a ready excuse should things go awry : he 's a gemini , and can blame it on that other guy inhabiting his body .
friday , october 15 cologne-dortmund dortmund have gone from strength to strength this season , getting good individual performances from many a member of their young squad - and all the while , they 've been working for each other on the pitch .
cologne have been mostly hideous , managing a fortunate win over st. pauli and two backs-to-the-wall draws .
fan favorite and mercurial boy prince lukas podolski sounded off this week that his beloved fc was adrift , and hinted he would look for the exit if things did n't turn around soon .
off you go , then .
cologne deserve to be at the table 's foot as richly as dortmund do near the top , and the billygoats should get flogged on friday .
dortmund 3-0 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : van bommel and his , erm , passion will be missing form this match saturday , october 16 bayern-hanover the opening weeks of the season for hanover were surprisingly good - the team busted loose to a 13-point haul in their first six games .
they 're still in third place , but last week 's limp home loss to st. pauli highlighted their weakness : without a full-strength strike partnership of mohamad abdelloue and didier ya konan , hanover are far from dangerous .
ya konan was out two weeks ago , this time it 's abdelloue .
bayern do have injury problems of their own -lrb- diego contento , franck ribery and arjen robben are still out , and miroslav klose , mark van bommel and ivica olic picked up injuries on international duty -rrb- , but they should have more than enough quality to take this one .
bayern 3-1 schalke-stuttgart the bundesliga 's two most hapless sides were all set to square off in a contest to decide who would see their name inserted into a flurry of “ -lsb- insert club name here -rsb- in crisis ” headlines , and whose coach would see a greater flurry of speculation surrounding his future .
then stuttgart went and spoiled the fun , firing christian gross before the match had even been played .
probably for the best , really .
though there is n't much to separate these two in terms of form -lrb- both have been very poor -rrb- , schalke are at home and have a slightly better squad .
thus they should win .
schalke 2-1 werder bremen-freiburg freiburg have been puzzlingly strong this season , defying the odds to win four of their first seven -lrb- including two away -rrb- and have risen all the way to fifth place .
bremen , meanwhile , have been in a funk .
it 's been down to a mixture of injuries to key players like naldo , per mertesacker and claudio pizarro and the kind of sloppy defending bremen have become famous for in recent years .
now mertesacker is back in the starting line-up , pizarro might be able to play as a substitute , and sporting director klaus allof 's -lrb- possibly illegal -rrb- stunt of docking the players ' pay after the 4-1 loss to hanover in week six seems to have done the trick .
bremen could easily have won on the last matchday in leverkusen , and should win easily at home on saturday .
bremen 2-0 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : settle down , adam - your hat-trick came against san marino mainz-hamburg the little club that could may lose some steam from its engine following the international break , what with their young squad having had ample time to let success go to their heads .
then again striker adam szalai , who 's just hit four goals in two games for hungary , might just come back to mainz on a justified high that will fire him up for more .
hamburg , for their part , showed signs of living up to their considerable promise in a gutsy win over kaiserslautern in match day seven , and will be boosted by paolo guerrero 's return from injury .
on the other hand , they are still hobbled by 10 -lrb- ! -rrb- other players from the first-team squad laid low at the moment .
i smell a draw .
draw 2-2 st. pauli-nuremberg a tough one to call , in that not much separates these two sides .
both have punched above the weight of their rather thin squads thus far , nuremberg through a very organized defense , pauli through fitness and a willingness to fight to the very end of a match .
it 's been seven home games since hamburg 's skull-and-crossbones appreciation society has seen their team get a win , and just as many matches since der club has won away .
may the streaks continue .
draw 1-1 wolfsburg-leverkusen both these sides have n't got out of the gate as strongly as they 'd have liked , but neither the pharmaceuticals -lrb- in 4th place on 12 points -rrb- or the wolves -lrb- 8th place , 10pts . -rrb- are so far off the pace for panic to have set in , and in fact are on good form .
that 's in part because both are starting to get good production from strikers who had looked out of it at the season 's opening - wolfsburg 's grafite and leverkusen 's eren derdiyok .
i might have been inclined to go with the home side , but they will be missing goalkeeper diego benaglio , so a draw looks a good bet .
draw 2-2 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eintracht 's ultras are a real sharing , caring group of guys sunday , october 17 kaiserslautern-frankfurt it 's an intriguing match-up between a team that started poorly and may be beginning to fade -lrb- k-town -rrb- , and another that stumbled at first but that now might be finding its sea legs -lrb- eintracht -rrb- .
but nobody 's talking about the game , they 're talking about the potential for fan trouble .
these two clubs are not natural derby rivals , but they are historically the two strongest in their region , and have a history .
eintracht 's ultras , considered by many to be the nastiest " fans " in the bundesliga , certainly are trumpeting this as a trip to see hated rivals , virtually promising violence in internet forums .
much as i 'd like to see them disappointed , i see frankfurt taking the points .
frankfurt 2-1 hoffenheim-moenchengladbach gladbach lead the league by a comfortable margin in goals allowed with 20 , but showed signs in their 1-1 match day seven draw against the often potent wolfsburg that they might have found their way .
hoffenheim , meanwhile , have had a rough few weeks , losing at mainz and bayern -lrb- which is acceptable -rrb- , and drawing away to cologne -lrb- which is n't -rrb- .
a bright spot , however , has been the ice-cold free-kicks of their young icelandic newcomer , gylfi sigurdsson .
he 's scored them in substitute appearances thus far , and now he 's likely to get the start .
i like him to score , and for the hoff to win .
hoffenheim 3-1 last week 's result : 5 points hanover-st .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de corruption -pipe- 15.10.2010 tymoshenko hit by fraud accusations before ukrainian election großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tymoshenko is said to have misappropriated millions the former government of yulia tymoshenko has been accused of misappropriation , according to an audit ordered by ukrainian president viktor yanukovych .
tymoshenko 's aides say the audit was " politically motivated . " an audit ordered by ukrainian president viktor yanukovych 's government claims that the former government of yulia tymoshenko misappropriated at least 360 million euros -lrb- $ 505 million -rrb- while in power .
the publication of the audit done by us consultants came two weeks before scheduled elections .
according to the audit led by washington law firm trout cacheris , tymoshenko 's government used offshore shell companies , sham contracts and other money-laundering techniques .
for instance , money from selling carbon emission certificates had not been properly used to support environmental projects but to pay old-age pensions , the report claims .
" in a single instance involving the kyoto protocol , funding misapplication exceeded 200 million euros , " said us lawyer marc macdougall .
" in the case of national material reserves the amounts of loss are in the tens of millions of euro . "
" we will make sure ... that our partners around the world and the people of ukraine know their ' heroes ' have been robbing the country for years , " yanukovych said while on a visit to lithuania this week .
audit merely a political move ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aides of tymoshenko called the audit politically motivated aides of tymoshenko have dismissed the audit as being politically motivated , a tool used to tarnish the reputation of the opposition ahead of elections on october 31 .
" that 's an attempt to intimidate the opposition , among them yulia tymoshenko , " said hryhoriy nemyria , who served as tymoshenko 's deputy prime minister . " obviously they are trying to draw off attention from the ukrainian economy , which is not improving but declining .
and one wants to dispel the indignation of how yanukovych is monopolizing the power in ukraine . " susan stewart from the german institute for international and security affairs told deutsche welle that levels of corruption and embezzlement are quite high in ukraine due to the very close connections between politics and the business sector and the strong impact of special interests .
" considering how politics function in ukraine , i 'd say that it 's not unlikely that some of the accusations are indeed valid .
but i think equally important is that it 's just as likely that similar corruption cases took place when yanukovych was prime minister in 2006 and 2007 , " she said .
corruption levels not significantly changed unfortunately , she added , the levels of corruption and embezzlement have not changed significantly over the years .
" it could certainly be the case that money allocated for one purpose was used for another .
and this is actually one problem that the eu has often had with ukraine in terms of implementing agreements that were reached because you really have to do a close monitoring of the process , " said stewart .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the neutrality of yanukovych 's us consultants is being questioned yanukovych 's government allegedly spent 1.4 million euros on the audit done by two law firms and one forensic auditing company .
the us consultants have been criticized by tymoshenko 's aides , accusing them of bias .
" there have been allegations , incorrect though they may be , that this is a witch hunt , " said plato cacheris , one of the us consultants .
" that is not so .
this is a thorough , extensive review of available evidence which we strongly believe supports the conclusions in the audit report . "
neutrality in question but according to stewart , the neutrality of the consultants hired by yanukovych remains questionable .
" i think he hired us consultants primarily to give the impression of being neutral , because if he had used russian or ukrainian consultants , that would have left him open to accusations of bias by the population , " she said .
" i still think it 's an open question as to whether this neutrality is really present as there have been accusations that he and people close to him have worked with this company or a company that took part in the audit before . "
the upcoming election at the end of october is expected to be the first real test of yanukovych 's popularity since he defeated tymoshenko in the run-off for the presidency in february .
the popularity of yanukovych and his regions party has dropped significantly over in recent months as his government has implemented some unpopular economic reforms , such as raising the price of gas .

french government officials still hope to derail the planned deal . earlier this month , international rail services operator eurostar defied opposition from the french government to become the first affiliate of french state-owned train operator sncf to order high-speeds trains made outside of france .
on thursday , the country 's transportation minister stepped up government opposition to the planned 600 million euro -lrb- $ 845 million -rrb- order for german trains by claiming that only those built by france 's alstom could use the channel tunnel . french transportation minister dominique bussereau called eurostar 's selection of siemens " null and void " in an interview with lci television .
the minister repeated government claims that siemens ' trains represent a safety risk - claims that both the channel tunnel intergovernmental commission and eurostar have rejected . " purely safety concerns " bussereau added that the french government 's concerns are purely safety related and not a question of choosing alstom or any other manufacturer .
among the government 's chief concerns : only trains with power units at the front or rear of trains , known as " concentrated traction " systems , could manage fires in tunnels safely .
alstom trains are built with such systems .
siemens ' trains , by comparison , have motors equipped beneath each coach , a design referred to as " distributed traction . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : siemens ' velaro train could soon be running alongside alstom 's agv in early september , transportation ministers from france and germany said they had reached an agreement to modify the safety rules that have , so far , kept non-eurostar trains out of the chunnel . the remarks from the french minister came one day after a siemens high-speed train entered the tunnel for the first time on a trial run - and are certain to increase european commission concern over the french 's government 's opposition to the order .
the trip was part of a series of tests that germany 's deutsche bahn is conducting before it launches its planned service between frankfurt and london . competition for equipment and operations eurostar has decided to overhaul its existing equipment and buy new trains for its routes , which run between london and the continental cities of paris and brussels . the 10 trains that siemens is to deliver will be capable of reaching speeds of 320 kilometers per hour and carry more than 900 passengers , compared to 750 passengers in existing trains .
the new trains will be interoperable , meaning that they can operate across europe 's high-speed rail network . competition is heating up not only on the equipment side but on the operator side , too .
the eurostar fleet overhaul comes amid increasing competition from rival operators to use the channel tunnel .
the european union supports allowing other operators to use cross-border track , provided they fulfill all specifications .
currently , only the eurostar fleet meets the specifications required to use the tunnel . eurostar is 55 percent owned by sncf -lrb- societe national des chemins de fer francais -rrb- .
london & continental railways has a 40 percent stake while belgian railway operator sncb -lrb- societe nationale des chemins de fer belges -rrb- owns the remaining 5 percent . author : john blau -lrb- reuters , afp -rrb- editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 15.10.2010 ahead of match day eight , dw pundits are seeing stars großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if you look very hard , you might just find this constellation - promise this season , the dw sports team are predicting the results of all bundesliga matches .
after the last match day 's battering , our pundits hope they 've got their heads back for match day eight . after a two-week international break , match day eight is in ascendance and the dw bundesliga pundits are back at it .
after a poor set of predictions on the last match day -lrb- see below -rrb- , they 've resolved to look to the stars for guidance .
this week 's predictor hopes for the best , but has a ready excuse should things go awry : he 's a gemini , and can blame it on that other guy inhabiting his body .
friday , october 15 cologne-dortmund dortmund have gone from strength to strength this season , getting good individual performances from many a member of their young squad - and all the while , they 've been working for each other on the pitch .
cologne have been mostly hideous , managing a fortunate win over st. pauli and two backs-to-the-wall draws .
fan favorite and mercurial boy prince lukas podolski sounded off this week that his beloved fc was adrift , and hinted he would look for the exit if things did n't turn around soon .
off you go , then .
cologne deserve to be at the table 's foot as richly as dortmund do near the top , and the billygoats should get flogged on friday .
dortmund 3-0 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : van bommel and his , erm , passion will be missing form this match saturday , october 16 bayern-hanover the opening weeks of the season for hanover were surprisingly good - the team busted loose to a 13-point haul in their first six games .
they 're still in third place , but last week 's limp home loss to st. pauli highlighted their weakness : without a full-strength strike partnership of mohamad abdelloue and didier ya konan , hanover are far from dangerous .
ya konan was out two weeks ago , this time it 's abdelloue .
bayern do have injury problems of their own -lrb- diego contento , franck ribery and arjen robben are still out , and miroslav klose , mark van bommel and ivica olic picked up injuries on international duty -rrb- , but they should have more than enough quality to take this one .
bayern 3-1 schalke-stuttgart the bundesliga 's two most hapless sides were all set to square off in a contest to decide who would see their name inserted into a flurry of “ -lsb- insert club name here -rsb- in crisis ” headlines , and whose coach would see a greater flurry of speculation surrounding his future .
then stuttgart went and spoiled the fun , firing christian gross before the match had even been played .
probably for the best , really .
though there is n't much to separate these two in terms of form -lrb- both have been very poor -rrb- , schalke are at home and have a slightly better squad .
thus they should win .
schalke 2-1 werder bremen-freiburg freiburg have been puzzlingly strong this season , defying the odds to win four of their first seven -lrb- including two away -rrb- and have risen all the way to fifth place .
bremen , meanwhile , have been in a funk .
it 's been down to a mixture of injuries to key players like naldo , per mertesacker and claudio pizarro and the kind of sloppy defending bremen have become famous for in recent years .
now mertesacker is back in the starting line-up , pizarro might be able to play as a substitute , and sporting director klaus allof 's -lrb- possibly illegal -rrb- stunt of docking the players ' pay after the 4-1 loss to hanover in week six seems to have done the trick .
bremen could easily have won on the last matchday in leverkusen , and should win easily at home on saturday .
bremen 2-0 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : settle down , adam - your hat-trick came against san marino mainz-hamburg the little club that could may lose some steam from its engine following the international break , what with their young squad having had ample time to let success go to their heads .
then again striker adam szalai , who 's just hit four goals in two games for hungary , might just come back to mainz on a justified high that will fire him up for more .
hamburg , for their part , showed signs of living up to their considerable promise in a gutsy win over kaiserslautern in match day seven , and will be boosted by paolo guerrero 's return from injury .
on the other hand , they are still hobbled by 10 -lrb- ! -rrb- other players from the first-team squad laid low at the moment .
i smell a draw .
draw 2-2 st. pauli-nuremberg a tough one to call , in that not much separates these two sides .
both have punched above the weight of their rather thin squads thus far , nuremberg through a very organized defense , pauli through fitness and a willingness to fight to the very end of a match .
it 's been seven home games since hamburg 's skull-and-crossbones appreciation society has seen their team get a win , and just as many matches since der club has won away .
may the streaks continue .
draw 1-1 wolfsburg-leverkusen both these sides have n't got out of the gate as strongly as they 'd have liked , but neither the pharmaceuticals -lrb- in 4th place on 12 points -rrb- or the wolves -lrb- 8th place , 10pts . -rrb- are so far off the pace for panic to have set in , and in fact are on good form .
that 's in part because both are starting to get good production from strikers who had looked out of it at the season 's opening - wolfsburg 's grafite and leverkusen 's eren derdiyok .
i might have been inclined to go with the home side , but they will be missing goalkeeper diego benaglio , so a draw looks a good bet .
draw 2-2 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eintracht 's ultras are a real sharing , caring group of guys sunday , october 17 kaiserslautern-frankfurt it 's an intriguing match-up between a team that started poorly and may be beginning to fade -lrb- k-town -rrb- , and another that stumbled at first but that now might be finding its sea legs -lrb- eintracht -rrb- .
but nobody 's talking about the game , they 're talking about the potential for fan trouble .
these two clubs are not natural derby rivals , but they are historically the two strongest in their region , and have a history .
eintracht 's ultras , considered by many to be the nastiest " fans " in the bundesliga , certainly are trumpeting this as a trip to see hated rivals , virtually promising violence in internet forums .
much as i 'd like to see them disappointed , i see frankfurt taking the points .
frankfurt 2-1 hoffenheim-moenchengladbach gladbach lead the league by a comfortable margin in goals allowed with 20 , but showed signs in their 1-1 match day seven draw against the often potent wolfsburg that they might have found their way .
hoffenheim , meanwhile , have had a rough few weeks , losing at mainz and bayern -lrb- which is acceptable -rrb- , and drawing away to cologne -lrb- which is n't -rrb- .
a bright spot , however , has been the ice-cold free-kicks of their young icelandic newcomer , gylfi sigurdsson .
he 's scored them in substitute appearances thus far , and now he 's likely to get the start .
i like him to score , and for the hoff to win .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 15.10.2010 ahead of match day eight , dw pundits are seeing stars großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if you look very hard , you might just find this constellation - promise this season , the dw sports team are predicting the results of all bundesliga matches .
after the last match day 's battering , our pundits hope they 've got their heads back for match day eight . after a two-week international break , match day eight is in ascendance and the dw bundesliga pundits are back at it .
after a poor set of predictions on the last match day -lrb- see below -rrb- , they 've resolved to look to the stars for guidance .
this week 's predictor hopes for the best , but has a ready excuse should things go awry : he 's a gemini , and can blame it on that other guy inhabiting his body .
friday , october 15 cologne-dortmund dortmund have gone from strength to strength this season , getting good individual performances from many a member of their young squad - and all the while , they 've been working for each other on the pitch .
cologne have been mostly hideous , managing a fortunate win over st. pauli and two backs-to-the-wall draws .
fan favorite and mercurial boy prince lukas podolski sounded off this week that his beloved fc was adrift , and hinted he would look for the exit if things did n't turn around soon .
off you go , then .
cologne deserve to be at the table 's foot as richly as dortmund do near the top , and the billygoats should get flogged on friday .
dortmund 3-0 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : van bommel and his , erm , passion will be missing form this match saturday , october 16 bayern-hanover the opening weeks of the season for hanover were surprisingly good - the team busted loose to a 13-point haul in their first six games .
they 're still in third place , but last week 's limp home loss to st. pauli highlighted their weakness : without a full-strength strike partnership of mohamad abdelloue and didier ya konan , hanover are far from dangerous .
ya konan was out two weeks ago , this time it 's abdelloue .
bayern do have injury problems of their own -lrb- diego contento , franck ribery and arjen robben are still out , and miroslav klose , mark van bommel and ivica olic picked up injuries on international duty -rrb- , but they should have more than enough quality to take this one .
bayern 3-1 schalke-stuttgart the bundesliga 's two most hapless sides were all set to square off in a contest to decide who would see their name inserted into a flurry of “ -lsb- insert club name here -rsb- in crisis ” headlines , and whose coach would see a greater flurry of speculation surrounding his future .
then stuttgart went and spoiled the fun , firing christian gross before the match had even been played .
probably for the best , really .
though there is n't much to separate these two in terms of form -lrb- both have been very poor -rrb- , schalke are at home and have a slightly better squad .
thus they should win .
schalke 2-1 werder bremen-freiburg freiburg have been puzzlingly strong this season , defying the odds to win four of their first seven -lrb- including two away -rrb- and have risen all the way to fifth place .
bremen , meanwhile , have been in a funk .
it 's been down to a mixture of injuries to key players like naldo , per mertesacker and claudio pizarro and the kind of sloppy defending bremen have become famous for in recent years .
now mertesacker is back in the starting line-up , pizarro might be able to play as a substitute , and sporting director klaus allof 's -lrb- possibly illegal -rrb- stunt of docking the players ' pay after the 4-1 loss to hanover in week six seems to have done the trick .
bremen could easily have won on the last matchday in leverkusen , and should win easily at home on saturday .
bremen 2-0 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : settle down , adam - your hat-trick came against san marino mainz-hamburg the little club that could may lose some steam from its engine following the international break , what with their young squad having had ample time to let success go to their heads .
then again striker adam szalai , who 's just hit four goals in two games for hungary , might just come back to mainz on a justified high that will fire him up for more .
hamburg , for their part , showed signs of living up to their considerable promise in a gutsy win over kaiserslautern in match day seven , and will be boosted by paolo guerrero 's return from injury .
on the other hand , they are still hobbled by 10 -lrb- ! -rrb- other players from the first-team squad laid low at the moment .
i smell a draw .
draw 2-2 st. pauli-nuremberg a tough one to call , in that not much separates these two sides .
both have punched above the weight of their rather thin squads thus far , nuremberg through a very organized defense , pauli through fitness and a willingness to fight to the very end of a match .
it 's been seven home games since hamburg 's skull-and-crossbones appreciation society has seen their team get a win , and just as many matches since der club has won away .
may the streaks continue .
draw 1-1 wolfsburg-leverkusen both these sides have n't got out of the gate as strongly as they 'd have liked , but neither the pharmaceuticals -lrb- in 4th place on 12 points -rrb- or the wolves -lrb- 8th place , 10pts . -rrb- are so far off the pace for panic to have set in , and in fact are on good form .
that 's in part because both are starting to get good production from strikers who had looked out of it at the season 's opening - wolfsburg 's grafite and leverkusen 's eren derdiyok .
i might have been inclined to go with the home side , but they will be missing goalkeeper diego benaglio , so a draw looks a good bet .
draw 2-2 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eintracht 's ultras are a real sharing , caring group of guys sunday , october 17 kaiserslautern-frankfurt it 's an intriguing match-up between a team that started poorly and may be beginning to fade -lrb- k-town -rrb- , and another that stumbled at first but that now might be finding its sea legs -lrb- eintracht -rrb- .
but nobody 's talking about the game , they 're talking about the potential for fan trouble .
these two clubs are not natural derby rivals , but they are historically the two strongest in their region , and have a history .
eintracht 's ultras , considered by many to be the nastiest " fans " in the bundesliga , certainly are trumpeting this as a trip to see hated rivals , virtually promising violence in internet forums .
much as i 'd like to see them disappointed , i see frankfurt taking the points .
frankfurt 2-1 hoffenheim-moenchengladbach gladbach lead the league by a comfortable margin in goals allowed with 20 , but showed signs in their 1-1 match day seven draw against the often potent wolfsburg that they might have found their way .
hoffenheim , meanwhile , have had a rough few weeks , losing at mainz and bayern -lrb- which is acceptable -rrb- , and drawing away to cologne -lrb- which is n't -rrb- .
a bright spot , however , has been the ice-cold free-kicks of their young icelandic newcomer , gylfi sigurdsson .
he 's scored them in substitute appearances thus far , and now he 's likely to get the start .
i like him to score , and for the hoff to win .
hoffenheim 3-1 last week 's result : 5 points hanover-st .

immigrant organizations warned that doing so would lead to " stigmatization . " state education ministers in germany have dismissed calls for making german the obligatory language in the country 's schoolyards .
the ministers ended a two-day meeting in berlin on friday saying a ban on immigrants speaking their mother tongue was impossible to enforce and would be counterproductive in efforts to integrate foreign children .
" there will be no steps taken to either ban foreign languages from schoolyards or to impose german as the only language that can be spoken there , " said ludwig spaenle , education minster of bavaria .
the meeting brought together ministers from all 16 german states .
education in germany is not centralized but the responsibly of the regional state governments .
rhineland palatinate education minister doris ahnen said banning foreign languages from schoolyards was " in no way suited " to solve integration problems .
her berlin colleague juergen zoellner added that while there was no doubt that learning german was very important for successful integration , it was " not very helpful " to outright ban children from speaking their mother tongue .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : integration commissioner maria boehmer is in favor of a ban a number of conservative politicians , among them maria boehmer , the government 's commissioner for integration , had previously called for german to be fixed as the obligatory language in schools to help integrate students from immigrant families .
immigrant organizations warn of ' stigmatization ' boehmer 's suggestion was strongly dismissed by immigrant organizations .
in a joint statement , they warned of a " stigmatization of the immigrant languages . "
instead , they argued , multilingualism was to be supported as a basis for cultural diversity in germany .
" focusing on the german language alone only draws attention from the real problems - such as the selective education system , discrimination and the high levels of unemployment among those with an immigrant background , " the statement added .
" banning the mother tongue is not acceptable , " said kenan kolat , head of the turkish community in germany , after talks with the conference of education ministers .
" it was extremely important to me that this unspeakable discussion about german in schoolyards was stopped , " he added .
" this is a good signal for our cooperation in future . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the number of foreign children dropouts is down 30 percent school dropouts on the decline kolat was part of a delegation of immigrant organizations who met with the ministers on friday to discuss progress on a three-year old action plan to improve education for foreign children .
the plan includes , among other things , state-funded programs to foster children 's language skills , as well as measures to stop the rise in the number of children leaving school without any degree .
the average rate of school dropouts among foreign children is more than twice as high as that of german students - but the situation has markedly improved .
" we 've reduced the number of foreign children dropping out of school by up to 30 percent in the last three years , " berlin education minister zoellner said .
both the ministers and the immigrant groups demanded better funding for education programs from the central government .
more all-day schools and better language education in childcare facilities have proven successful in improving immigrants ' educational chances , they said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 15.10.2010 stuttgart need a reality check as gross takes the fall großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : holding gross accountable ignores deeper problems at vfb stuttgart packed off its third coach in three seasons when christian gross was shown the door after a woeful start to the season .
but the club 's position is unlikely to improve until deeper problems are resolved . given that vfb stuttgart never really get going in the bundesliga until after christmas , the sacking of christian gross after just seven games could be construed as jumping the gun slightly .
in the last few seasons , the opening months of the league campaign have always been a slog for vfb , only for the team to discover form and stability in the latter stages .
look at markus babbel 's tenure as coach : stuttgart was wallowing in the lower reaches of the bundesliga in autumn 2008 under armin veh , the coach who had won them the title two seasons prior .
veh was sacked , babbel took over and at the season 's end stuttgart had qualified for the champions league .
then again , look at markus babbel 's tenure as coach in another light .
the following season , babbel oversaw a similarly slow start to that which eventually undermined veh .
the former stuttgart defender was out of the door before the winter break with the team in the relegation zone with only two wins from 15 games and the fans carrying burning torches and threatening to storm the gates of the club - figuratively at least .
enter christian gross .
the swiss coach of great intellect and renown took over from babbel with stuttgart third from bottom and led them to a sixth place finish and qualification to the europa league .
vfb must have hoped that gross was the man to finally find a cure for the split personality which consistently renders the team useless in the run up to winter and sublime by the time spring had sprung .
the fact that stuttgart has endured an even worse start to this season than at any time in the previous three suggests that gross was equally at a loss to reverse the bi-polar nature of the team .
with just one win from seven games , gross is now looking for new employment while stuttgart 's management is once again left looking for answers .
stuttgart need to look beyond the coach bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : something is very wrong at the heart of the swabian club one yo-yo season can be excused .
two can be shrugged off as a coincidence .
three in a row becomes an alarming trend .
the fact that three different coaches , of varying style and experience , have failed to get a grip on stuttgart 's baffling schizophrenia suggests that something is rotten in the state of baden-wuerttemberg .
with assistant manager jens keller installed as caretaker boss for saturday 's basement showdown with fellow underachievers schalke 04 , the question is whether vfb will continue to believe that the choice of coach is at the heart of their seasonal problems , or if the powers-that-be will look closer to home for the source of the rising damp which is threatening to engulf the club .
at first glance , it appears that the club is set to don the blinkers again .
gross had shown " no signs of finding a solution " for the numerous problems plaguing the team , said sporting director fredi bobic , a statement which suggests vfb still believe that the quality of coaching is still the issue .
perhaps it would be more useful to look at the lack of depth and quality of the squad , the allocation of revenue and the boardroom rivalries which are unsettling the whole club .
thin squad , fat stadium investment stuttgart had a busy summer in the transfer market but it was the exit door which saw the most action .
real madrid snapped up sami khedira after his world cup exploits , veteran goalkeeper jens lehmann retired , and a host of adequate but uninspiring squad members -lrb- sebastian rudy , martin lanig , roberto hilbert , and so on -rrb- all trundled off to pastures new .
while many were unlikely to be missed , they did leave vfb short on numbers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stuttgart failed to find a quality replacement for khedira " in each of the past two years , vfb have sold their best player , " clark whitney , a bundesliga expert at goal.com international , told deutsche welle . " in 2009 , it was mario gomez and more recently , it was sami khedira .
khedira and gomez were club icons .
even when out of form , gomez was worth a goal every other game .
khedira , with his tremendous work rate and skill in transition , was a perfect fit for vfb .
pavel pogrebnyak and zdravko kuzmanovic just have n't been good enough as replacements . "
considering the acquistions stuttgart brought in to replace them , simple mathematics showed that stuttgart was in the minus column in terms of quality and cover before the season even began .
despite bringing in johan audel , philipp degen , mauro camoranesi and christian gentner , none of these players have made much impact .
audel and degen have yet to play for the club since arriving due to injuries while the italian camoranesi has found it hard to bed in .
gentner , brought back from a loan spell at vfl wolfsburg , has struggled for form and appears too inexperienced to step into the shoes of khedira and run the midfield .
some blame should then be passed onto fredi bobic , who may be a former club favorite due to his past efforts on the pitch but is still hugely inexperienced in his role as sporting director .
giving bobic the responsibility to conduct transfers has backfired and clashes between bobic and gross regularly brought up the differences between the two men over their demands in the transfer market .
bricks before legs ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stuttgart 's current crop of players do n't make the grade in his defense , bobic has been struggling himself to loosen the club 's purse strings , held possessively by a board committed to remodeling stuttgart 's home ground , the mercedes benz arena .
christian gross told the local stuttgarter zeitung in the days before his sacking that it was clear " the club 's priority has been pointed toward finishing stadium renovations . "
gross never said where he thought the 22 million euros accrued from last season 's champions league campaign went to .
perhaps he did n't need to - it was obvious this was a team built on the cheap .
" stuttgart 's decline has resulted primarily from a disconnection between the club 's sporting and financial goals , " said clark whitney .
" between the sales of gomez and khedira , stuttgart made nearly 50 million euros .
during the same period of time , stuttgart has been reluctant to reinvest .
if their 3.5 million-euro offer for mladen petric was n't laughable , their 1 million-euro maximum bid for andre ayew certainly was .
to further the comedy , stuttgart sent 20-year old rising star sebastian rudy to hoffenheim , and signed 33-year old mauro camoranesi as his replacement . " " naturally , one is led to ask what happened to vfb 's transfer earnings , as well as the 22 million euros earned in the 2009-10 champions league , " whitney added .
" the answer is quite a shock .
delusions of grandeur have prompted the management to invest 73.2 million euros in stadium renovations and expansion .
of course , the mercedes-benz arena could use a bit of refurbishing .
still , you have to wonder whether the management expect 60,000 fans to show up for a second division match . "
failure of leadership to blame the club 's hierarchy is to open another can of worms .
it is no simple matter to say that the board members responsible for the revenue at the club are wholly responsible for draining funds from the playing squad and pumping the euros into the crumbling stands and infrastructure .
in fact , it has been alleged that rivalries in the boardroom have been exacerbated over just this matter .
rather than the suits being all-for-one , one-for-all in their determination to give an ailing team a beautiful home , it appears that club president erwin staudt and chief financial office ulrich ruf were in favor of investing more in the squad this summer , but that their moves to divert cash budgeted for renovation into team building had been vetoed by chairman of the supervisory board dieter hundt .
it ’ s an accusation the hundt has strongly denied , arguing that the club had spent 12.5 million euros on new players , the fifth-highest figure in the bundesliga .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stuttgart 's hundt -lrb- l . -rrb- has some powerful friends perhaps it has less to do with how much is spent than which players the money is spent on .
stuttgart lack quality , and many players appear to have lost belief that they can rescue the season .
moreover , there are rumors of chaos in the dressing room .
one ex-vfb star claimed in a recent sports illustrated report on the team ’ s troubles that the current stuttgart squad is " a rowdy , undisciplined bunch . " it certainly sounds like stuttgart 's problems run far deeper than the inability to find a coach with the know-how to rescue the club from its momentary malaise .
time will tell if those with the power to save the club will realize in time what those problems are , and manage to solve them .
" i personally believe that the board should follow gross out the door , " concluded whitney . " in sporting terms , stuttgart have regressed in recent years while other teams have all improved . " " the relegation of hertha berlin in may was no mistake - they felt safe with the previous year 's fourth place finish , opted not to sign adequate replacements for andriy voronin and josip simunic , and paid the price a year later .

these days , the institution is fighting for funds and recognition . the imposing facade of the humboldt university is located in the heart of berlin 's historic mitte district - within a stone 's throw of the german historical museum and the state opera on the unter den linden boulevard .
a statue of founder wilhelm von humboldt looms high at the main entrance .
it shows the prussian education reformer and statesman sitting in an armchair , proudly gazing down at the students milling around .
his expression seems to demand respect for his achievements .
and wilhelm von humboldt had every reason to be proud of the institution established in 1810 .
known then as the berlin university , it aimed for the first time to unify instruction with research .
humboldt maintained that universities should n't just teach but also be centers of cutting-edge research .
it was a radically new idea in germany 's education landscape at the time and the humboldt university became a model for european and western universities , earning it the informal title " the mother of all modern universities . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the humboldt university has more than 34,000 students ' humboldt legend ' draws thousands that founding spirit still holds true until today , according to the current president of the university , christoph markschies .
" in 1809 , the university had neither tables nor chairs and the walls were full of mould .
the city of berlin did n't have much money .
now we have a bit more - at least we have tables and chairs and we 've managed to renovate the building , " markschies said .
" but this founding spirit - attempting things against all odds - still prevails . "
despite near-empty state coffers in 1810 , wilhelm von humboldt managed to get the first semester at the university going - with 256 students and 52 lecturers . from the outset , the university featured the four classical faculties of law , medicine , philosophy and theology .
partly under the influence of famous naturalist alexander von humboldt , a brother of founder wilhelm , the university later pioneered the introduction of several new disciplines .
today , it offers more than 240 programs ranging from african studies to dentistry .
some 13 percent of the university 's 34,000 students come from more than 100 nations .
uwe-jens nagel , the university 's vice president , said the " legendary reputation " of the humboldt university still draws thousands around the world .
" the university has translated wilhelm von humboldt 's ideal of education into the 21st century , " nagel said .
" it means that at our university there is no research without teaching and the other way around . "
the university has produced 29 nobel prize laureates since its founding 200 years ago .
they include albert einstein , max planck and fritz haber , who did some of their scientific work at the university .
other illustrious figures such as statesman otto von bismarck , poet heinrich heine , political theorist karl marx and writer kurt tucholsky , also enrolled as students at the university .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the book burnings near the humboldt university were a low-point in the institution 's history dark and shameful chapter until 1933 , the humboldt university was one of the leading universities in germany .
but things began to change under what was becoming an atmosphere of repression and brutality .
under the nazis , jewish and communist students were kicked out of the university .
the infamous nazi-organized book burnings on may 10 , 1933 at the nearby opernplatz square -lrb- now known as babelplatz -rrb- further plunged the university into a dark abyss .
this is how german author erich kaestner later remembered the incident .
" i stood in front of the university , wedged between students in sa uniforms , the torch-bearers of the nation .
i saw our books being flung into the roaring flames and heard the corny tirades of the wily liar -lsb- propaganda minister -rsb- josef goebbels .
an atmosphere of mourning hung over the city , " kaestner wrote .
the shameful period came to an end with the conclusion of world war two in 1945 , but the university then lurched into a new crisis .
the cold war led to a growing communist influence at the university .
between 1945 and 1948 , students who demanded a free university in the spirit of wilhelm von humboldt were arrested , deported and even executed .
in west berlin , students finally set up the free university with help from the united states .
communist east germany officially renamed its berlin university in 1949 as the humboldt university - but without the ideals championed by wilhelm von humboldt .
new challenges bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the humboldt university is struggling to attract funds and talent since german reunification in 1990 , humboldt 's founding philosophy is once again at the forefront of the university 's agenda .
but at the same time , new pressures are making it difficult for the university to live up to the ideals of giving equal importance to teaching and research .
new higher education reforms in germany aimed at encouraging students to get into universities and out into the job market at an earlier age have overstretched the university 's resources .
" we need more staff but that 's not going to happen any time soon in a poor city-state like berlin , " nagel said .
he added that the university was now thinking of a new mentoring concept to improve teaching .
" students would be trained in such a way that they could work as tutors .
they would n't get paid but would instead receive study points . "
the humboldt university also hopes to get millions in state funds by vying for the german government 's " excellence initiative " aimed at improving and encouraging high-level research and competition at the country 's higher-education institutions .
in 2007 , however , the humboldt university failed to earn the title of " elite university . "
if it fails yet again to secure those much-needed funds , the university could lose out in the global race to attract and nurture top talent .

but to further bolster its image and boost sales , the german department store chain has enlisted fashion designer wolfgang joop . galleria kaufhof , one of germany 's oldest department store chains , has found a new ally to help bolster its image : fashion designer wolfgang joop .
kaufhof has fared better than karstadt , another dominant department store that was rescued from insolvency in september by billionaire investor nicolas berggruen .
berggruen recently announced that karstadt will collaborate with californian designer max azria .
part of the reason why german department stores are grasping for outside help to attract customers is a changing commercial landscape that has challenged their very business model .
beyond the fact that inexpensive online offerings are grabbing business that has traditionally gone to department stores , experts say an increasing amount of smaller clothing stores housed in inner-city shopping centers are gaining market share .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang joop is likely to be actively involved with kaufhof a kaufhof spokeswoman said the company chose joop because he not only knows the german market but also brings international expertise with him , and also because he is creative and accessible .
the department store focuses on fashion , home and beauty , all areas of joop 's expertise , according to the spokeswoman .
“ a department store like galleria kaufhof also reflects the zeitgeist , and so we constantly have to be developing , ” she told deutsche welle .
“ we were n't just looking for a face .
instead , we were looking for someone who would really be a creative partner in developing new things . ”
targeted appeal needed according to commerzbank analyst juergen elfers , the current market situation requires department stores to do more than compete among each other .
“ department stores like kaufhof are no longer just in competition with one another , ” he told deutsche welle .
“ each new shopping center , which is built in inner cities , now has very many clothing stores as tenants .
and kaufhof has to compete with them , as well .
that 's why it 's important for them to enhance the image of their department stores , especially in major cities . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kaufhof 's lovro mandac and others have kept the company profitable unlike karstadt , kaufhof has remained profitable for a number of reasons , according to elfers .
kaufhof reduced its offerings in breadth and depth , tailoring what it does offer to satisfy demand . the company also effectively implemented its own brand of wares along with personnel management changes , which employees accepted .
“ karstadt has time and again had to use money to plug holes in its finances , ” elfers said .
“ the management has n't been able to fully concentrate on further developing the company , partly due to cash restraints . ”
no single approach boris hedde , director of the ifh market research institute in cologne , said kaufhof 's ability to tailor its offerings to specific clientele has been invaluable .
he pointed out that smaller non-chain department stores thrive in regions of germany to which they have adapted .
“ a comprehensive program wo n't work … we 've seen that from the past .
so a targeted approach is necessary , and the challenge will be to meet the needs of specific regions , ” he told deutsche welle .
“ the concept needs to start with the customer .
it will be interesting to see if joop can find an approach that brings together the individual target groups .
that remains to be seen . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the metro group plans to sell kaufhof hedde added that joop 's name is associated with “ high-value , design-orientation and modernity , ” and that he will likely “ want to set some things in motion rather than just having picked up a sponsorship . ”
metro to sell according to commerzbank 's elfers , the metro group is trying to sell kaufhof because of its international ambitions .
“ metro is very much internationally oriented , and department stores are difficult to internationalize , ” he said .
kaufhof 's turnover last year was roughly 3.5 billion euros .
the company employs some 25,000 people , and has about two million customers daily .
earlier this year there was speculation about a possible kaufhof-karstadt merger .

the " european green capitals " program aims to ensure cities rise in style to the environmental challenges facing them . healthy competition usually spurs contestants to outdo each other and brings the eventual winner fame and glory .
that 's probably what the 16 representatives from various european cities had in mind when they came together in tallinn , estonia , in may 2006 to launch the european green capital award scheme .
the aim was to encourage cities to achieve higher levels of environmental protection and improve the quality of the urban environment .
the first winner of the competition was stockholm , which served throughout 2010 as europe 's first green capital .
in 2011 , it will be passing the mantle to hamburg in northern germany .
a spirit of healthy competition when it comes to green urban development is long overdue : europe has become an essentially urban society , with four out of five europeans living in towns and cities .
it 's a development seen all over the world , with more than half the world 's population , or about 3.3 billion people , now living in towns and cities .
almost four fifths of greenhouses gases emitted every day originate in cities .
so with most of the environmental challenges facing our society arising in urban areas , the logical conclusion is that it is also these urban areas that need to muster up the commitment and innovation to resolve them .
hamburg meets the mark on several fronts so what 's needed to make cities more environmentally-friendly and liveable in the future ?
the european commission has drafted ten criteria that specifically pinpoint steps to solve environmental challenges in cities , improve the quality of life of its citizens and reduce their global carbon footprint .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : harbor city is a new quarter under development in the old harbor of hamburg , along the river elbe the criteria require the winning city to not just meet high environmental standards but also show it has what it takes to be a role model to inspire other cities and promote best practices .
according to the jury , hamburg won thanks to what it described as “ ambitious climate protection targets . ”
the northern german port city plans to slash its 1990 carbon emissions levels by 40 percent by 2020 , and by 80 percent by 2050 .
cynics might say hamburg won the coveted title because of its lofty goals rather than its current practices .
but that 's only partially true .
hamburg 's ambitious climate targets naturally played a role in its victory but the city already boasts lower per capita carbon emissions than freiburg - another german city that made it to the competition shortlist and one that sees itself as the cradle of the green movement in germany .
latest available official figures show that hamburg 's carbon emissions amounted to 8.84 tones per year per resident in 2006 , compared to 9.28 tones in freiburg in 2005 .
hamburg out-performed the other contestants on many fronts .
the jury deemed its water quality better than in bristol , oslo , freiburg and muenster .
it has equally excellent air quality and an efficient waste management system . the city has also apparently achieved good performance levels in terms of cycling and public transport indicators .
lost opportunities ?
yet some of the rating practices in the competition have raised eyebrows .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bike-friendly german city of muenster also made the shortlist for instance , amsterdam – a bicycle city if ever there was one – was awarded only one point more than hamburg for pro-cycling traffic infrastructure .
the jury commended amsterdam 's impressive achievement in getting more of its residents cycling than driving , noting that nine tenths of its roads are bike-friendly , and that anyone who needs to get in the driving seat now and then can use one of the city 's efficient car-sharing stations .
when it comes to promoting two wheels , amsterdam surely outstrips hamburg , and the german port city may not be making the most of opportunities to catch up .
even hamburg 's new waterfront district hafencity , which is currently being developed , is seen as having failed in some environmental aspects .
the new district will increase the inner city area by 40 percent through filling-up expendable harbor basins .
in itself , this is an exemplary way of preventing geographical expansion into surrounding areas , and one that provides plenty of scope for sustainable urban development .
but instead of integrating bike-friendly strategies into the concept , urban planners have come up with a design that suits first and foremost the needs of motorists .
on track to a greener future the issue has been seized upon by the hamburg future council , which is made up of citizens , companies and associations .
according to its press spokeswoman delia schindler , hamburg owes its european green capital victory less to politicians and more to grassroots activism and local ngos .
but the eu commission jury was n't splitting hairs .
it made a point of praising public commitment to environmental objectives , and hamburg garnered maximum points for its communication strategy .
the jury was impressed by the involvement of young people ; the many environmental networks in operation and the enthusiasm the city shows in cooperating with other environmental organizations within the eu .
it 's planning to spread some of this enthusiasm with the launch of a “ train of ideas . ”
this foresees interested cities within the european green capital award network ‘ owning ' a wagon and traveling around europe to promote their respective green ideas , achievements and future plans - on track to a greener future .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de corruption -pipe- 15.10.2010 tymoshenko hit by fraud accusations before ukrainian election großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tymoshenko is said to have misappropriated millions the former government of yulia tymoshenko has been accused of misappropriation , according to an audit ordered by ukrainian president viktor yanukovych .
tymoshenko 's aides say the audit was " politically motivated . " an audit ordered by ukrainian president viktor yanukovych 's government claims that the former government of yulia tymoshenko misappropriated at least 360 million euros -lrb- $ 505 million -rrb- while in power .
the publication of the audit done by us consultants came two weeks before scheduled elections .
according to the audit led by washington law firm trout cacheris , tymoshenko 's government used offshore shell companies , sham contracts and other money-laundering techniques .
for instance , money from selling carbon emission certificates had not been properly used to support environmental projects but to pay old-age pensions , the report claims .
" in a single instance involving the kyoto protocol , funding misapplication exceeded 200 million euros , " said us lawyer marc macdougall .
" in the case of national material reserves the amounts of loss are in the tens of millions of euro . "
" we will make sure ... that our partners around the world and the people of ukraine know their ' heroes ' have been robbing the country for years , " yanukovych said while on a visit to lithuania this week .
audit merely a political move ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aides of tymoshenko called the audit politically motivated aides of tymoshenko have dismissed the audit as being politically motivated , a tool used to tarnish the reputation of the opposition ahead of elections on october 31 .
" that 's an attempt to intimidate the opposition , among them yulia tymoshenko , " said hryhoriy nemyria , who served as tymoshenko 's deputy prime minister . " obviously they are trying to draw off attention from the ukrainian economy , which is not improving but declining .
and one wants to dispel the indignation of how yanukovych is monopolizing the power in ukraine . " susan stewart from the german institute for international and security affairs told deutsche welle that levels of corruption and embezzlement are quite high in ukraine due to the very close connections between politics and the business sector and the strong impact of special interests .
" considering how politics function in ukraine , i 'd say that it 's not unlikely that some of the accusations are indeed valid .
but i think equally important is that it 's just as likely that similar corruption cases took place when yanukovych was prime minister in 2006 and 2007 , " she said .
corruption levels not significantly changed unfortunately , she added , the levels of corruption and embezzlement have not changed significantly over the years .
" it could certainly be the case that money allocated for one purpose was used for another .
and this is actually one problem that the eu has often had with ukraine in terms of implementing agreements that were reached because you really have to do a close monitoring of the process , " said stewart .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the neutrality of yanukovych 's us consultants is being questioned yanukovych 's government allegedly spent 1.4 million euros on the audit done by two law firms and one forensic auditing company .
the us consultants have been criticized by tymoshenko 's aides , accusing them of bias .
" there have been allegations , incorrect though they may be , that this is a witch hunt , " said plato cacheris , one of the us consultants .
" that is not so .
this is a thorough , extensive review of available evidence which we strongly believe supports the conclusions in the audit report . "
neutrality in question but according to stewart , the neutrality of the consultants hired by yanukovych remains questionable .
" i think he hired us consultants primarily to give the impression of being neutral , because if he had used russian or ukrainian consultants , that would have left him open to accusations of bias by the population , " she said .
" i still think it 's an open question as to whether this neutrality is really present as there have been accusations that he and people close to him have worked with this company or a company that took part in the audit before . "
the upcoming election at the end of october is expected to be the first real test of yanukovych 's popularity since he defeated tymoshenko in the run-off for the presidency in february .
the popularity of yanukovych and his regions party has dropped significantly over in recent months as his government has implemented some unpopular economic reforms , such as raising the price of gas .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 15.10.2010 stuttgart need a reality check as gross takes the fall großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : holding gross accountable ignores deeper problems at vfb stuttgart packed off its third coach in three seasons when christian gross was shown the door after a woeful start to the season .
but the club 's position is unlikely to improve until deeper problems are resolved . given that vfb stuttgart never really get going in the bundesliga until after christmas , the sacking of christian gross after just seven games could be construed as jumping the gun slightly .
in the last few seasons , the opening months of the league campaign have always been a slog for vfb , only for the team to discover form and stability in the latter stages .
look at markus babbel 's tenure as coach : stuttgart was wallowing in the lower reaches of the bundesliga in autumn 2008 under armin veh , the coach who had won them the title two seasons prior .
veh was sacked , babbel took over and at the season 's end stuttgart had qualified for the champions league .
then again , look at markus babbel 's tenure as coach in another light .
the following season , babbel oversaw a similarly slow start to that which eventually undermined veh .
the former stuttgart defender was out of the door before the winter break with the team in the relegation zone with only two wins from 15 games and the fans carrying burning torches and threatening to storm the gates of the club - figuratively at least .
enter christian gross .
the swiss coach of great intellect and renown took over from babbel with stuttgart third from bottom and led them to a sixth place finish and qualification to the europa league .
vfb must have hoped that gross was the man to finally find a cure for the split personality which consistently renders the team useless in the run up to winter and sublime by the time spring had sprung .
the fact that stuttgart has endured an even worse start to this season than at any time in the previous three suggests that gross was equally at a loss to reverse the bi-polar nature of the team .
with just one win from seven games , gross is now looking for new employment while stuttgart 's management is once again left looking for answers .
stuttgart need to look beyond the coach bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : something is very wrong at the heart of the swabian club one yo-yo season can be excused .
two can be shrugged off as a coincidence .
three in a row becomes an alarming trend .
the fact that three different coaches , of varying style and experience , have failed to get a grip on stuttgart 's baffling schizophrenia suggests that something is rotten in the state of baden-wuerttemberg .
with assistant manager jens keller installed as caretaker boss for saturday 's basement showdown with fellow underachievers schalke 04 , the question is whether vfb will continue to believe that the choice of coach is at the heart of their seasonal problems , or if the powers-that-be will look closer to home for the source of the rising damp which is threatening to engulf the club .
at first glance , it appears that the club is set to don the blinkers again .
gross had shown " no signs of finding a solution " for the numerous problems plaguing the team , said sporting director fredi bobic , a statement which suggests vfb still believe that the quality of coaching is still the issue .
perhaps it would be more useful to look at the lack of depth and quality of the squad , the allocation of revenue and the boardroom rivalries which are unsettling the whole club .
thin squad , fat stadium investment stuttgart had a busy summer in the transfer market but it was the exit door which saw the most action .
real madrid snapped up sami khedira after his world cup exploits , veteran goalkeeper jens lehmann retired , and a host of adequate but uninspiring squad members -lrb- sebastian rudy , martin lanig , roberto hilbert , and so on -rrb- all trundled off to pastures new .
while many were unlikely to be missed , they did leave vfb short on numbers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stuttgart failed to find a quality replacement for khedira " in each of the past two years , vfb have sold their best player , " clark whitney , a bundesliga expert at goal.com international , told deutsche welle . " in 2009 , it was mario gomez and more recently , it was sami khedira .
khedira and gomez were club icons .
even when out of form , gomez was worth a goal every other game .
khedira , with his tremendous work rate and skill in transition , was a perfect fit for vfb .
pavel pogrebnyak and zdravko kuzmanovic just have n't been good enough as replacements . "
considering the acquistions stuttgart brought in to replace them , simple mathematics showed that stuttgart was in the minus column in terms of quality and cover before the season even began .
despite bringing in johan audel , philipp degen , mauro camoranesi and christian gentner , none of these players have made much impact .
audel and degen have yet to play for the club since arriving due to injuries while the italian camoranesi has found it hard to bed in .
gentner , brought back from a loan spell at vfl wolfsburg , has struggled for form and appears too inexperienced to step into the shoes of khedira and run the midfield .
some blame should then be passed onto fredi bobic , who may be a former club favorite due to his past efforts on the pitch but is still hugely inexperienced in his role as sporting director .
giving bobic the responsibility to conduct transfers has backfired and clashes between bobic and gross regularly brought up the differences between the two men over their demands in the transfer market .
bricks before legs ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stuttgart 's current crop of players do n't make the grade in his defense , bobic has been struggling himself to loosen the club 's purse strings , held possessively by a board committed to remodeling stuttgart 's home ground , the mercedes benz arena .
christian gross told the local stuttgarter zeitung in the days before his sacking that it was clear " the club 's priority has been pointed toward finishing stadium renovations . "
gross never said where he thought the 22 million euros accrued from last season 's champions league campaign went to .
perhaps he did n't need to - it was obvious this was a team built on the cheap .
" stuttgart 's decline has resulted primarily from a disconnection between the club 's sporting and financial goals , " said clark whitney .
" between the sales of gomez and khedira , stuttgart made nearly 50 million euros .
during the same period of time , stuttgart has been reluctant to reinvest .
if their 3.5 million-euro offer for mladen petric was n't laughable , their 1 million-euro maximum bid for andre ayew certainly was .
to further the comedy , stuttgart sent 20-year old rising star sebastian rudy to hoffenheim , and signed 33-year old mauro camoranesi as his replacement . " " naturally , one is led to ask what happened to vfb 's transfer earnings , as well as the 22 million euros earned in the 2009-10 champions league , " whitney added .
" the answer is quite a shock .
delusions of grandeur have prompted the management to invest 73.2 million euros in stadium renovations and expansion .
of course , the mercedes-benz arena could use a bit of refurbishing .
still , you have to wonder whether the management expect 60,000 fans to show up for a second division match . "
failure of leadership to blame the club 's hierarchy is to open another can of worms .
it is no simple matter to say that the board members responsible for the revenue at the club are wholly responsible for draining funds from the playing squad and pumping the euros into the crumbling stands and infrastructure .
in fact , it has been alleged that rivalries in the boardroom have been exacerbated over just this matter .
rather than the suits being all-for-one , one-for-all in their determination to give an ailing team a beautiful home , it appears that club president erwin staudt and chief financial office ulrich ruf were in favor of investing more in the squad this summer , but that their moves to divert cash budgeted for renovation into team building had been vetoed by chairman of the supervisory board dieter hundt .
it ’ s an accusation the hundt has strongly denied , arguing that the club had spent 12.5 million euros on new players , the fifth-highest figure in the bundesliga .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stuttgart 's hundt -lrb- l . -rrb- has some powerful friends perhaps it has less to do with how much is spent than which players the money is spent on .
stuttgart lack quality , and many players appear to have lost belief that they can rescue the season .
moreover , there are rumors of chaos in the dressing room .
one ex-vfb star claimed in a recent sports illustrated report on the team ’ s troubles that the current stuttgart squad is " a rowdy , undisciplined bunch . " it certainly sounds like stuttgart 's problems run far deeper than the inability to find a coach with the know-how to rescue the club from its momentary malaise .
time will tell if those with the power to save the club will realize in time what those problems are , and manage to solve them .
" i personally believe that the board should follow gross out the door , " concluded whitney . " in sporting terms , stuttgart have regressed in recent years while other teams have all improved . " " the relegation of hertha berlin in may was no mistake - they felt safe with the previous year 's fourth place finish , opted not to sign adequate replacements for andriy voronin and josip simunic , and paid the price a year later .

while muslims still face discrimination , many have successfully integrated and are a part of french society , which now has western europe 's largest muslim population .
amira beshallah is one such example of a successfully integrated second-generation french muslim .
after a day of classes at the sorbonne university in paris , she comes home to an apartment near the seine river , where she lives with her parents .
the 19-year-old is earning an undergraduate degree in literature and communications and wants to become a television journalist .
amira 's parents immigrated to france from the north african country of tunisia , but she says she identifies more with france than with the country of her parents ' birth .
" since i 've been little , i 've felt completely french , " she says .
" in fact , i did n't realize that i was any different from the typical french person until i was 15 years old and a man insulted me on the street . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of muslim families settled in france amira says the man called her dirty and then threatened to hit her .
four years on she still gets upset talking about the incident .
since that day , amira says she has understood that she might face discrimination when looking for a job .
but she says she tries to keep a positive attitude .
generation gap sitting beside her mother on the couch , the teenager 's long , dark hair and dangling earrings are a contrast to her mother 's neatly tucked muslim headscarf .
amira 's mother , 48-year-old samira beshallah , works as a licensed nanny and takes care of three preschool-aged children .
samira says the parents do n't mind that she wears a headscarf when she takes their children out for walks or to play in the park and that wearing a headscarf in france is not problematic .
" i feel very , very good here .
i feel completely at home in france , " samira says .
" i raised my children here .
they have all done their studies .
i work , my husband is retired and i feel great . "
a new direction bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france has recently passed a ban on the full-face islamic veil amira , meanwhile , says she is not religious and would never wear a headscarf , although she does refrain from eating and drinking during the islamic fasting month of ramadan .
she says her parents do n't pressure her or their two sons to practice their faith , although she knows they expect her to marry a muslim .
amira says she has only one friend who wears a headscarf , but that most of her friends are n't even muslim .
she admits , however , that political talk over the last few years concerning islamist extremism and the banning of burqas has made her feel uneasy .
" it 's true that , these days , there 's a spotlight on muslims , " she says .
" i guess , since september 11 , people are asking ' who are muslims . '
people want to know who they are .
i guess it worries me a little .
but still , i do n't feel targeted .
we are against terrorism like everybody else . "
both amira and samira say the beshallah family and thousands of other muslims are completely integrated into the french way of life - proof that muslims can be productive members of western societies .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de balkans -pipe- 15.10.2010 serbian ultranationalists struggle against a changing homeland großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the football match was later called off because of the riots serbian ultranationalists who recently sparked football match riots in italy are trying to destabilize serbia , analysts say .
however , their voices are not representative of a country moving increasingly towards europe . it was more than brute violence : the recent heavy rioting at a european football match between italy and serbia in genoa on tuesday could not be put down solely to the actions of a few hooligans .
this tainting of the serbian national team was the result of ultranationalist groups who were bent on venting their discontent with the direction their country is taking , say experts from the brussels think-tank the centre for european policy studies -lrb- ceps -rrb- .
this small part of the serbian population feels unfairly treated and betrayed by the new orientation taken by their country towards europe . this underlying anger has used as its trigger the difficult economic conditions currently affecting serbia , as well as the high levels of unemployment - which stands at around 20 percent - and the still-raw memories of the breakup of yugoslavia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police detained 17 people after the riots the ultranationalists have seemingly set themselves the goal of making as much noise as possible , but , according to the ceps , this does not mean the movement enjoys support from the broader serbian community .
" serbia was and still is a traditional and orthodox country , where the influence of the church and history is big , " explains georg dura , an analyst with ceps .

however , their voices are not representative of a country moving increasingly towards europe . it was more than brute violence : the recent heavy rioting at a european football match between italy and serbia in genoa on tuesday could not be put down solely to the actions of a few hooligans .
this tainting of the serbian national team was the result of ultranationalist groups who were bent on venting their discontent with the direction their country is taking , say experts from the brussels think-tank the centre for european policy studies -lrb- ceps -rrb- .
this small part of the serbian population feels unfairly treated and betrayed by the new orientation taken by their country towards europe . this underlying anger has used as its trigger the difficult economic conditions currently affecting serbia , as well as the high levels of unemployment - which stands at around 20 percent - and the still-raw memories of the breakup of yugoslavia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police detained 17 people after the riots the ultranationalists have seemingly set themselves the goal of making as much noise as possible , but , according to the ceps , this does not mean the movement enjoys support from the broader serbian community .

but to further bolster its image and boost sales , the german department store chain has enlisted fashion designer wolfgang joop . galleria kaufhof , one of germany 's oldest department store chains , has found a new ally to help bolster its image : fashion designer wolfgang joop .
kaufhof has fared better than karstadt , another dominant department store that was rescued from insolvency in september by billionaire investor nicolas berggruen .
berggruen recently announced that karstadt will collaborate with californian designer max azria .
part of the reason why german department stores are grasping for outside help to attract customers is a changing commercial landscape that has challenged their very business model .
beyond the fact that inexpensive online offerings are grabbing business that has traditionally gone to department stores , experts say an increasing amount of smaller clothing stores housed in inner-city shopping centers are gaining market share .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang joop is likely to be actively involved with kaufhof a kaufhof spokeswoman said the company chose joop because he not only knows the german market but also brings international expertise with him , and also because he is creative and accessible .
the department store focuses on fashion , home and beauty , all areas of joop 's expertise , according to the spokeswoman .
“ a department store like galleria kaufhof also reflects the zeitgeist , and so we constantly have to be developing , ” she told deutsche welle .
“ we were n't just looking for a face .
instead , we were looking for someone who would really be a creative partner in developing new things . ”
targeted appeal needed according to commerzbank analyst juergen elfers , the current market situation requires department stores to do more than compete among each other .
“ department stores like kaufhof are no longer just in competition with one another , ” he told deutsche welle .
“ each new shopping center , which is built in inner cities , now has very many clothing stores as tenants .
and kaufhof has to compete with them , as well .
that 's why it 's important for them to enhance the image of their department stores , especially in major cities . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kaufhof 's lovro mandac and others have kept the company profitable unlike karstadt , kaufhof has remained profitable for a number of reasons , according to elfers .
kaufhof reduced its offerings in breadth and depth , tailoring what it does offer to satisfy demand . the company also effectively implemented its own brand of wares along with personnel management changes , which employees accepted .
“ karstadt has time and again had to use money to plug holes in its finances , ” elfers said .
“ the management has n't been able to fully concentrate on further developing the company , partly due to cash restraints . ”
no single approach boris hedde , director of the ifh market research institute in cologne , said kaufhof 's ability to tailor its offerings to specific clientele has been invaluable .
he pointed out that smaller non-chain department stores thrive in regions of germany to which they have adapted .
“ a comprehensive program wo n't work … we 've seen that from the past .
so a targeted approach is necessary , and the challenge will be to meet the needs of specific regions , ” he told deutsche welle .
“ the concept needs to start with the customer .
it will be interesting to see if joop can find an approach that brings together the individual target groups .
that remains to be seen . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the metro group plans to sell kaufhof hedde added that joop 's name is associated with “ high-value , design-orientation and modernity , ” and that he will likely “ want to set some things in motion rather than just having picked up a sponsorship . ”
metro to sell according to commerzbank 's elfers , the metro group is trying to sell kaufhof because of its international ambitions .
“ metro is very much internationally oriented , and department stores are difficult to internationalize , ” he said .
kaufhof 's turnover last year was roughly 3.5 billion euros .
the company employs some 25,000 people , and has about two million customers daily .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de integration -pipe- 15.10.2010 ministers dismiss calls to make german mandatory in schoolyards großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : forcing children to speak german is counterproductive education ministers in germany have dismissed calls to force immigrant students to speak german in schoolyards .
immigrant organizations warned that doing so would lead to " stigmatization . " state education ministers in germany have dismissed calls for making german the obligatory language in the country 's schoolyards .
the ministers ended a two-day meeting in berlin on friday saying a ban on immigrants speaking their mother tongue was impossible to enforce and would be counterproductive in efforts to integrate foreign children .
" there will be no steps taken to either ban foreign languages from schoolyards or to impose german as the only language that can be spoken there , " said ludwig spaenle , education minster of bavaria .
the meeting brought together ministers from all 16 german states .
education in germany is not centralized but the responsibly of the regional state governments .
rhineland palatinate education minister doris ahnen said banning foreign languages from schoolyards was " in no way suited " to solve integration problems .
her berlin colleague juergen zoellner added that while there was no doubt that learning german was very important for successful integration , it was " not very helpful " to outright ban children from speaking their mother tongue .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : integration commissioner maria boehmer is in favor of a ban a number of conservative politicians , among them maria boehmer , the government 's commissioner for integration , had previously called for german to be fixed as the obligatory language in schools to help integrate students from immigrant families .
immigrant organizations warn of ' stigmatization ' boehmer 's suggestion was strongly dismissed by immigrant organizations .
in a joint statement , they warned of a " stigmatization of the immigrant languages . "
instead , they argued , multilingualism was to be supported as a basis for cultural diversity in germany .
" focusing on the german language alone only draws attention from the real problems - such as the selective education system , discrimination and the high levels of unemployment among those with an immigrant background , " the statement added .
" banning the mother tongue is not acceptable , " said kenan kolat , head of the turkish community in germany , after talks with the conference of education ministers .
" it was extremely important to me that this unspeakable discussion about german in schoolyards was stopped , " he added .
" this is a good signal for our cooperation in future . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the number of foreign children dropouts is down 30 percent school dropouts on the decline kolat was part of a delegation of immigrant organizations who met with the ministers on friday to discuss progress on a three-year old action plan to improve education for foreign children .
the plan includes , among other things , state-funded programs to foster children 's language skills , as well as measures to stop the rise in the number of children leaving school without any degree .
the average rate of school dropouts among foreign children is more than twice as high as that of german students - but the situation has markedly improved .
" we 've reduced the number of foreign children dropping out of school by up to 30 percent in the last three years , " berlin education minister zoellner said .

immigrant organizations warned that doing so would lead to " stigmatization . " state education ministers in germany have dismissed calls for making german the obligatory language in the country 's schoolyards .
the ministers ended a two-day meeting in berlin on friday saying a ban on immigrants speaking their mother tongue was impossible to enforce and would be counterproductive in efforts to integrate foreign children .
" there will be no steps taken to either ban foreign languages from schoolyards or to impose german as the only language that can be spoken there , " said ludwig spaenle , education minster of bavaria .
the meeting brought together ministers from all 16 german states .
education in germany is not centralized but the responsibly of the regional state governments .
rhineland palatinate education minister doris ahnen said banning foreign languages from schoolyards was " in no way suited " to solve integration problems .
her berlin colleague juergen zoellner added that while there was no doubt that learning german was very important for successful integration , it was " not very helpful " to outright ban children from speaking their mother tongue .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : integration commissioner maria boehmer is in favor of a ban a number of conservative politicians , among them maria boehmer , the government 's commissioner for integration , had previously called for german to be fixed as the obligatory language in schools to help integrate students from immigrant families .
immigrant organizations warn of ' stigmatization ' boehmer 's suggestion was strongly dismissed by immigrant organizations .
in a joint statement , they warned of a " stigmatization of the immigrant languages . "
instead , they argued , multilingualism was to be supported as a basis for cultural diversity in germany .
" focusing on the german language alone only draws attention from the real problems - such as the selective education system , discrimination and the high levels of unemployment among those with an immigrant background , " the statement added .
" banning the mother tongue is not acceptable , " said kenan kolat , head of the turkish community in germany , after talks with the conference of education ministers .
" it was extremely important to me that this unspeakable discussion about german in schoolyards was stopped , " he added .
" this is a good signal for our cooperation in future . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the number of foreign children dropouts is down 30 percent school dropouts on the decline kolat was part of a delegation of immigrant organizations who met with the ministers on friday to discuss progress on a three-year old action plan to improve education for foreign children .
the plan includes , among other things , state-funded programs to foster children 's language skills , as well as measures to stop the rise in the number of children leaving school without any degree .
the average rate of school dropouts among foreign children is more than twice as high as that of german students - but the situation has markedly improved .
" we 've reduced the number of foreign children dropping out of school by up to 30 percent in the last three years , " berlin education minister zoellner said .
both the ministers and the immigrant groups demanded better funding for education programs from the central government .
more all-day schools and better language education in childcare facilities have proven successful in improving immigrants ' educational chances , they said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de retail -pipe- 15.10.2010 kaufhof department store partners with fashion designer joop großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kaufhof has fared better than karstadt in a difficult market kaufhof has maintained a stable position in a tough market environment .
but to further bolster its image and boost sales , the german department store chain has enlisted fashion designer wolfgang joop . galleria kaufhof , one of germany 's oldest department store chains , has found a new ally to help bolster its image : fashion designer wolfgang joop .
kaufhof has fared better than karstadt , another dominant department store that was rescued from insolvency in september by billionaire investor nicolas berggruen .
berggruen recently announced that karstadt will collaborate with californian designer max azria .
part of the reason why german department stores are grasping for outside help to attract customers is a changing commercial landscape that has challenged their very business model .
beyond the fact that inexpensive online offerings are grabbing business that has traditionally gone to department stores , experts say an increasing amount of smaller clothing stores housed in inner-city shopping centers are gaining market share .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang joop is likely to be actively involved with kaufhof a kaufhof spokeswoman said the company chose joop because he not only knows the german market but also brings international expertise with him , and also because he is creative and accessible .
the department store focuses on fashion , home and beauty , all areas of joop 's expertise , according to the spokeswoman .
“ a department store like galleria kaufhof also reflects the zeitgeist , and so we constantly have to be developing , ” she told deutsche welle .
“ we were n't just looking for a face .
instead , we were looking for someone who would really be a creative partner in developing new things . ”
targeted appeal needed according to commerzbank analyst juergen elfers , the current market situation requires department stores to do more than compete among each other .
“ department stores like kaufhof are no longer just in competition with one another , ” he told deutsche welle .
“ each new shopping center , which is built in inner cities , now has very many clothing stores as tenants .
and kaufhof has to compete with them , as well .
that 's why it 's important for them to enhance the image of their department stores , especially in major cities . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kaufhof 's lovro mandac and others have kept the company profitable unlike karstadt , kaufhof has remained profitable for a number of reasons , according to elfers .
kaufhof reduced its offerings in breadth and depth , tailoring what it does offer to satisfy demand . the company also effectively implemented its own brand of wares along with personnel management changes , which employees accepted .
“ karstadt has time and again had to use money to plug holes in its finances , ” elfers said .
“ the management has n't been able to fully concentrate on further developing the company , partly due to cash restraints . ”
no single approach boris hedde , director of the ifh market research institute in cologne , said kaufhof 's ability to tailor its offerings to specific clientele has been invaluable .
he pointed out that smaller non-chain department stores thrive in regions of germany to which they have adapted .
“ a comprehensive program wo n't work … we 've seen that from the past .
so a targeted approach is necessary , and the challenge will be to meet the needs of specific regions , ” he told deutsche welle .
“ the concept needs to start with the customer .
it will be interesting to see if joop can find an approach that brings together the individual target groups .
that remains to be seen . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the metro group plans to sell kaufhof hedde added that joop 's name is associated with “ high-value , design-orientation and modernity , ” and that he will likely “ want to set some things in motion rather than just having picked up a sponsorship . ”
metro to sell according to commerzbank 's elfers , the metro group is trying to sell kaufhof because of its international ambitions .
“ metro is very much internationally oriented , and department stores are difficult to internationalize , ” he said .
kaufhof 's turnover last year was roughly 3.5 billion euros .
the company employs some 25,000 people , and has about two million customers daily .
earlier this year there was speculation about a possible kaufhof-karstadt merger .

french government officials still hope to derail the planned deal . earlier this month , international rail services operator eurostar defied opposition from the french government to become the first affiliate of french state-owned train operator sncf to order high-speeds trains made outside of france .
on thursday , the country 's transportation minister stepped up government opposition to the planned 600 million euro -lrb- $ 845 million -rrb- order for german trains by claiming that only those built by france 's alstom could use the channel tunnel . french transportation minister dominique bussereau called eurostar 's selection of siemens " null and void " in an interview with lci television .
the minister repeated government claims that siemens ' trains represent a safety risk - claims that both the channel tunnel intergovernmental commission and eurostar have rejected . " purely safety concerns " bussereau added that the french government 's concerns are purely safety related and not a question of choosing alstom or any other manufacturer .
among the government 's chief concerns : only trains with power units at the front or rear of trains , known as " concentrated traction " systems , could manage fires in tunnels safely .
alstom trains are built with such systems .
siemens ' trains , by comparison , have motors equipped beneath each coach , a design referred to as " distributed traction . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : siemens ' velaro train could soon be running alongside alstom 's agv in early september , transportation ministers from france and germany said they had reached an agreement to modify the safety rules that have , so far , kept non-eurostar trains out of the chunnel . the remarks from the french minister came one day after a siemens high-speed train entered the tunnel for the first time on a trial run - and are certain to increase european commission concern over the french 's government 's opposition to the order .
the trip was part of a series of tests that germany 's deutsche bahn is conducting before it launches its planned service between frankfurt and london . competition for equipment and operations eurostar has decided to overhaul its existing equipment and buy new trains for its routes , which run between london and the continental cities of paris and brussels . the 10 trains that siemens is to deliver will be capable of reaching speeds of 320 kilometers per hour and carry more than 900 passengers , compared to 750 passengers in existing trains .
the new trains will be interoperable , meaning that they can operate across europe 's high-speed rail network . competition is heating up not only on the equipment side but on the operator side , too .
the eurostar fleet overhaul comes amid increasing competition from rival operators to use the channel tunnel .
the european union supports allowing other operators to use cross-border track , provided they fulfill all specifications .
currently , only the eurostar fleet meets the specifications required to use the tunnel . eurostar is 55 percent owned by sncf -lrb- societe national des chemins de fer francais -rrb- .
london & continental railways has a 40 percent stake while belgian railway operator sncb -lrb- societe nationale des chemins de fer belges -rrb- owns the remaining 5 percent . author : john blau -lrb- reuters , afp -rrb- editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

tymoshenko 's aides say the audit was " politically motivated . " an audit ordered by ukrainian president viktor yanukovych 's government claims that the former government of yulia tymoshenko misappropriated at least 360 million euros -lrb- $ 505 million -rrb- while in power .
the publication of the audit done by us consultants came two weeks before scheduled elections .
according to the audit led by washington law firm trout cacheris , tymoshenko 's government used offshore shell companies , sham contracts and other money-laundering techniques .
for instance , money from selling carbon emission certificates had not been properly used to support environmental projects but to pay old-age pensions , the report claims .
" in a single instance involving the kyoto protocol , funding misapplication exceeded 200 million euros , " said us lawyer marc macdougall .
" in the case of national material reserves the amounts of loss are in the tens of millions of euro . "
" we will make sure ... that our partners around the world and the people of ukraine know their ' heroes ' have been robbing the country for years , " yanukovych said while on a visit to lithuania this week .
audit merely a political move ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aides of tymoshenko called the audit politically motivated aides of tymoshenko have dismissed the audit as being politically motivated , a tool used to tarnish the reputation of the opposition ahead of elections on october 31 .
" that 's an attempt to intimidate the opposition , among them yulia tymoshenko , " said hryhoriy nemyria , who served as tymoshenko 's deputy prime minister . " obviously they are trying to draw off attention from the ukrainian economy , which is not improving but declining .
and one wants to dispel the indignation of how yanukovych is monopolizing the power in ukraine . " susan stewart from the german institute for international and security affairs told deutsche welle that levels of corruption and embezzlement are quite high in ukraine due to the very close connections between politics and the business sector and the strong impact of special interests .
" considering how politics function in ukraine , i 'd say that it 's not unlikely that some of the accusations are indeed valid .
but i think equally important is that it 's just as likely that similar corruption cases took place when yanukovych was prime minister in 2006 and 2007 , " she said .
corruption levels not significantly changed unfortunately , she added , the levels of corruption and embezzlement have not changed significantly over the years .
" it could certainly be the case that money allocated for one purpose was used for another .
and this is actually one problem that the eu has often had with ukraine in terms of implementing agreements that were reached because you really have to do a close monitoring of the process , " said stewart .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the neutrality of yanukovych 's us consultants is being questioned yanukovych 's government allegedly spent 1.4 million euros on the audit done by two law firms and one forensic auditing company .
the us consultants have been criticized by tymoshenko 's aides , accusing them of bias .
" there have been allegations , incorrect though they may be , that this is a witch hunt , " said plato cacheris , one of the us consultants .
" that is not so .
this is a thorough , extensive review of available evidence which we strongly believe supports the conclusions in the audit report . "
neutrality in question but according to stewart , the neutrality of the consultants hired by yanukovych remains questionable .
" i think he hired us consultants primarily to give the impression of being neutral , because if he had used russian or ukrainian consultants , that would have left him open to accusations of bias by the population , " she said .
" i still think it 's an open question as to whether this neutrality is really present as there have been accusations that he and people close to him have worked with this company or a company that took part in the audit before . "
the upcoming election at the end of october is expected to be the first real test of yanukovych 's popularity since he defeated tymoshenko in the run-off for the presidency in february .
the popularity of yanukovych and his regions party has dropped significantly over in recent months as his government has implemented some unpopular economic reforms , such as raising the price of gas .

tolerance and openness have marked the arrival of migrants , but the second generation will be the litmus test of successful integration . arabic is often heard as you walk through the streets of lavapies in central madrid . here , traditional tapas bars and bakeries mix with shisha joints , bangaldeshi corner shops and african restaurants .
one of these , doing a swift trade in spicy fish , is run by ibrahima ndiaye .
he has two children with his spanish wife and has enjoyed financial success .
he started out as a night club bouncer and now runs a boutique and this popular restaurant .
he is part of spain 's diverse muslim population , which now numbers around 1.3 million people - just under 3 percent of the overall population of 45 million .
his restaurant is in the same neighborhood where islamic fundamentalists planned the train bombing that killed 191 people march 2004 .
but he says there was no backlash locally .
" i have lived here for many years .
my spanish neighbors know me , they know how i live . it 's true that terrorism has created problems .
when you travel or go to a public place people do look at you now .
but i have n't suffered consequences in my neighborhood . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ibrahima ndiaye runs a successful restaurant in lavapies , madrid minimal conflict an annual survey of the muslim community suggests he is not alone .
some 70 percent of muslims say they feel at home here , and 80 percent say they feel they have adapted well to the spanish way of life .
islam is now the second largest religious domination , with a range of liberal , progressive branches represented , from the moroccan maliki school of thought to the tarikat sufi order from west africa .
spain transformed into a multicultural society with spectacular speed . and yet conflict between communities has been minimal according to madrid 's leading expert on muslim communities , berbabe lopez .
" the person who comes adapts , although they keep the trappings of their culture especially the older generation .
people do n't live in ghettos ; they are spread out all over the country , throughout neighborhoods , " he told deutsche welle .
" and i think that the spanish population - from whom you might have expected more racism - has really absorbed immigrants well .
in almost 15 years - there has been 12 percent immigration .
that has n't happened at such great speed in any other country in europe . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muslim migration has benefitted sweet teeth in spain pix and mix lopez says there is no spanish government ' model of integration ' .
instead , the ruling socialist party has borrowed different policies from other european countries .
the result is neither the assimilation prototype of france nor the multicultural model of the uk .
social integration has been aided by national politicians refusing to talk down muslims .
their response to the terrorist attack was the ' alliance of civilizations ' , a diplomatic push for cooperation between mediterranean cultures that drew on spain 's shared history with morocco .
at home this was mirrored by social cohesion programs .
but in parallel – and perhaps more importantly – there were regular amnesties for the immigrant workers who had powered spain 's construction boom .
in the last ten years over a million people who could prove they were working were granted legal status .
meanwhile all residents – even those without papers – have access to health and education .
and immigrants have not been blamed for the current crisis – even if this may cost votes .
emigrant hosts one reason for this inclusive approach is that spaniards emigrated in living memory . " when i was young we did n't have immigrants .
people here were the migrants .
people came back from germany and switzerland and england at summertime to spend the holidays here , " said ana planet , an arab and islamic studies professor at the madrid autonoma university .
spain also has a legal commitment to religious freedom , which is enshrined in its constitution .
this law tends to foils isolated attempts by town halls to ban veils .
and although they live in a mainly secular society , spaniards still recognize the importance of faith .
" we still consider religion as an important part of life and we are familiar with the this idea that ' you have your religion ' , ' you do that because of your religion ' , " said planet .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : impromptu mosques are springing up across the capital a marginalized group but it is not all positive .
ana explained that full social acceptance is still some way off . catalonia is seeing conflict emerge over the construction of mosques .
and a far-right party plans to field candidates in mayoral elections .
moroccan migrants , who make up around 80 percent of muslims here , tend to bear the brunt of prejudice , and fall within the most marginalized sector of society .
the crisis has left 30 percent out of work , compared to the 20 percent spanish average .
" bear in mind that we immigrants have always had the lowest-qualified jobs .
we do the jobs that no one else wants .
we have very casual contracts , in very bad conditions - you can be fired at any time and all this complicates the process of integration , " said kamal rahmouni from moroccan immigrant association atime .
but rahmouni ended on at upbeat note .
he feels the " complex , long road to integration " is generally going in the right direction .
at the crossroads spain passed the arrivals test but now faces the challenge of meshing these new identities with its own as the children of immigrants come of age .
they will not measure their lives against relatives from their parents ' country of origin but with their peers .
restaurant owner ibrahima -lrb- like 90 percent of muslims surveyed -rrb- believes islam is no barrier to being spanish .
he is convinced his children will have the same chances as classmates .
" i think that opportunities depend on your studies and the abilities of a person .
these days it does n't depend on a person 's color , " he said .
the crisis has made immigrants vulnerable .
but it has also brought down new arrivals by 43 percent .
this may create space for the government to make sure that the second generation of immigrants does enjoy equality of opportunity in the future .

tymoshenko 's aides say the audit was " politically motivated . " an audit ordered by ukrainian president viktor yanukovych 's government claims that the former government of yulia tymoshenko misappropriated at least 360 million euros -lrb- $ 505 million -rrb- while in power .
the publication of the audit done by us consultants came two weeks before scheduled elections .
according to the audit led by washington law firm trout cacheris , tymoshenko 's government used offshore shell companies , sham contracts and other money-laundering techniques .
for instance , money from selling carbon emission certificates had not been properly used to support environmental projects but to pay old-age pensions , the report claims .
" in a single instance involving the kyoto protocol , funding misapplication exceeded 200 million euros , " said us lawyer marc macdougall .
" in the case of national material reserves the amounts of loss are in the tens of millions of euro . "
" we will make sure ... that our partners around the world and the people of ukraine know their ' heroes ' have been robbing the country for years , " yanukovych said while on a visit to lithuania this week .
audit merely a political move ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aides of tymoshenko called the audit politically motivated aides of tymoshenko have dismissed the audit as being politically motivated , a tool used to tarnish the reputation of the opposition ahead of elections on october 31 .
" that 's an attempt to intimidate the opposition , among them yulia tymoshenko , " said hryhoriy nemyria , who served as tymoshenko 's deputy prime minister . " obviously they are trying to draw off attention from the ukrainian economy , which is not improving but declining .
and one wants to dispel the indignation of how yanukovych is monopolizing the power in ukraine . " susan stewart from the german institute for international and security affairs told deutsche welle that levels of corruption and embezzlement are quite high in ukraine due to the very close connections between politics and the business sector and the strong impact of special interests .
" considering how politics function in ukraine , i 'd say that it 's not unlikely that some of the accusations are indeed valid .
but i think equally important is that it 's just as likely that similar corruption cases took place when yanukovych was prime minister in 2006 and 2007 , " she said .
corruption levels not significantly changed unfortunately , she added , the levels of corruption and embezzlement have not changed significantly over the years .
" it could certainly be the case that money allocated for one purpose was used for another .
and this is actually one problem that the eu has often had with ukraine in terms of implementing agreements that were reached because you really have to do a close monitoring of the process , " said stewart .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the neutrality of yanukovych 's us consultants is being questioned yanukovych 's government allegedly spent 1.4 million euros on the audit done by two law firms and one forensic auditing company .
the us consultants have been criticized by tymoshenko 's aides , accusing them of bias .
" there have been allegations , incorrect though they may be , that this is a witch hunt , " said plato cacheris , one of the us consultants .
" that is not so .
this is a thorough , extensive review of available evidence which we strongly believe supports the conclusions in the audit report . "
neutrality in question but according to stewart , the neutrality of the consultants hired by yanukovych remains questionable .
" i think he hired us consultants primarily to give the impression of being neutral , because if he had used russian or ukrainian consultants , that would have left him open to accusations of bias by the population , " she said .
" i still think it 's an open question as to whether this neutrality is really present as there have been accusations that he and people close to him have worked with this company or a company that took part in the audit before . "
the upcoming election at the end of october is expected to be the first real test of yanukovych 's popularity since he defeated tymoshenko in the run-off for the presidency in february .
the popularity of yanukovych and his regions party has dropped significantly over in recent months as his government has implemented some unpopular economic reforms , such as raising the price of gas .

french government officials still hope to derail the planned deal . earlier this month , international rail services operator eurostar defied opposition from the french government to become the first affiliate of french state-owned train operator sncf to order high-speeds trains made outside of france .
on thursday , the country 's transportation minister stepped up government opposition to the planned 600 million euro -lrb- $ 845 million -rrb- order for german trains by claiming that only those built by france 's alstom could use the channel tunnel . french transportation minister dominique bussereau called eurostar 's selection of siemens " null and void " in an interview with lci television .
the minister repeated government claims that siemens ' trains represent a safety risk - claims that both the channel tunnel intergovernmental commission and eurostar have rejected . " purely safety concerns " bussereau added that the french government 's concerns are purely safety related and not a question of choosing alstom or any other manufacturer .
among the government 's chief concerns : only trains with power units at the front or rear of trains , known as " concentrated traction " systems , could manage fires in tunnels safely .
alstom trains are built with such systems .
siemens ' trains , by comparison , have motors equipped beneath each coach , a design referred to as " distributed traction .

the trip was part of a series of tests that germany 's deutsche bahn is conducting before it launches its planned service between frankfurt and london . competition for equipment and operations eurostar has decided to overhaul its existing equipment and buy new trains for its routes , which run between london and the continental cities of paris and brussels . the 10 trains that siemens is to deliver will be capable of reaching speeds of 320 kilometers per hour and carry more than 900 passengers , compared to 750 passengers in existing trains .
the new trains will be interoperable , meaning that they can operate across europe 's high-speed rail network . competition is heating up not only on the equipment side but on the operator side , too .
the eurostar fleet overhaul comes amid increasing competition from rival operators to use the channel tunnel .
the european union supports allowing other operators to use cross-border track , provided they fulfill all specifications .
currently , only the eurostar fleet meets the specifications required to use the tunnel . eurostar is 55 percent owned by sncf -lrb- societe national des chemins de fer francais -rrb- .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : focus : muslims in europe french muslims break stereotype and show up integration skeptics islamic cultural center aims to build religious ' bridges ' in warsaw uk operates government-sponsored helpline for muslim youth chancellor merkel says german multiculturalism has ' utterly failed ' immigration -pipe- 15.10.2010 muslim migrants ' feel at home ' in spain großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain 's muslim population is growing rapidly can spain resist the wave of islamophobia sweeping through europe ?
tolerance and openness have marked the arrival of migrants , but the second generation will be the litmus test of successful integration . arabic is often heard as you walk through the streets of lavapies in central madrid . here , traditional tapas bars and bakeries mix with shisha joints , bangaldeshi corner shops and african restaurants .
one of these , doing a swift trade in spicy fish , is run by ibrahima ndiaye .
he has two children with his spanish wife and has enjoyed financial success .
he started out as a night club bouncer and now runs a boutique and this popular restaurant .
he is part of spain 's diverse muslim population , which now numbers around 1.3 million people - just under 3 percent of the overall population of 45 million .
his restaurant is in the same neighborhood where islamic fundamentalists planned the train bombing that killed 191 people march 2004 .
but he says there was no backlash locally .
" i have lived here for many years .
my spanish neighbors know me , they know how i live . it 's true that terrorism has created problems .
when you travel or go to a public place people do look at you now .
but i have n't suffered consequences in my neighborhood . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ibrahima ndiaye runs a successful restaurant in lavapies , madrid minimal conflict an annual survey of the muslim community suggests he is not alone .
some 70 percent of muslims say they feel at home here , and 80 percent say they feel they have adapted well to the spanish way of life .
islam is now the second largest religious domination , with a range of liberal , progressive branches represented , from the moroccan maliki school of thought to the tarikat sufi order from west africa .
spain transformed into a multicultural society with spectacular speed . and yet conflict between communities has been minimal according to madrid 's leading expert on muslim communities , berbabe lopez .
" the person who comes adapts , although they keep the trappings of their culture especially the older generation .
people do n't live in ghettos ; they are spread out all over the country , throughout neighborhoods , " he told deutsche welle .
" and i think that the spanish population - from whom you might have expected more racism - has really absorbed immigrants well .
in almost 15 years - there has been 12 percent immigration .
that has n't happened at such great speed in any other country in europe . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muslim migration has benefitted sweet teeth in spain pix and mix lopez says there is no spanish government ' model of integration ' .
instead , the ruling socialist party has borrowed different policies from other european countries .
the result is neither the assimilation prototype of france nor the multicultural model of the uk .
social integration has been aided by national politicians refusing to talk down muslims .
their response to the terrorist attack was the ' alliance of civilizations ' , a diplomatic push for cooperation between mediterranean cultures that drew on spain 's shared history with morocco .
at home this was mirrored by social cohesion programs .
but in parallel – and perhaps more importantly – there were regular amnesties for the immigrant workers who had powered spain 's construction boom .
in the last ten years over a million people who could prove they were working were granted legal status .
meanwhile all residents – even those without papers – have access to health and education .
and immigrants have not been blamed for the current crisis – even if this may cost votes .
emigrant hosts one reason for this inclusive approach is that spaniards emigrated in living memory . " when i was young we did n't have immigrants .
people here were the migrants .
people came back from germany and switzerland and england at summertime to spend the holidays here , " said ana planet , an arab and islamic studies professor at the madrid autonoma university .
spain also has a legal commitment to religious freedom , which is enshrined in its constitution .
this law tends to foils isolated attempts by town halls to ban veils .
and although they live in a mainly secular society , spaniards still recognize the importance of faith .
" we still consider religion as an important part of life and we are familiar with the this idea that ' you have your religion ' , ' you do that because of your religion ' , " said planet .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : impromptu mosques are springing up across the capital a marginalized group but it is not all positive .
ana explained that full social acceptance is still some way off . catalonia is seeing conflict emerge over the construction of mosques .
and a far-right party plans to field candidates in mayoral elections .
moroccan migrants , who make up around 80 percent of muslims here , tend to bear the brunt of prejudice , and fall within the most marginalized sector of society .
the crisis has left 30 percent out of work , compared to the 20 percent spanish average .
" bear in mind that we immigrants have always had the lowest-qualified jobs .
we do the jobs that no one else wants .
we have very casual contracts , in very bad conditions - you can be fired at any time and all this complicates the process of integration , " said kamal rahmouni from moroccan immigrant association atime .
but rahmouni ended on at upbeat note .
he feels the " complex , long road to integration " is generally going in the right direction .
at the crossroads spain passed the arrivals test but now faces the challenge of meshing these new identities with its own as the children of immigrants come of age .
they will not measure their lives against relatives from their parents ' country of origin but with their peers .
restaurant owner ibrahima -lrb- like 90 percent of muslims surveyed -rrb- believes islam is no barrier to being spanish .
he is convinced his children will have the same chances as classmates .
" i think that opportunities depend on your studies and the abilities of a person .
these days it does n't depend on a person 's color , " he said .
the crisis has made immigrants vulnerable .
but it has also brought down new arrivals by 43 percent .
this may create space for the government to make sure that the second generation of immigrants does enjoy equality of opportunity in the future .

tolerance and openness have marked the arrival of migrants , but the second generation will be the litmus test of successful integration . arabic is often heard as you walk through the streets of lavapies in central madrid . here , traditional tapas bars and bakeries mix with shisha joints , bangaldeshi corner shops and african restaurants .
one of these , doing a swift trade in spicy fish , is run by ibrahima ndiaye .
he has two children with his spanish wife and has enjoyed financial success .
he started out as a night club bouncer and now runs a boutique and this popular restaurant .
he is part of spain 's diverse muslim population , which now numbers around 1.3 million people - just under 3 percent of the overall population of 45 million .
his restaurant is in the same neighborhood where islamic fundamentalists planned the train bombing that killed 191 people march 2004 .
but he says there was no backlash locally .
" i have lived here for many years .
my spanish neighbors know me , they know how i live . it 's true that terrorism has created problems .
when you travel or go to a public place people do look at you now .
but i have n't suffered consequences in my neighborhood . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ibrahima ndiaye runs a successful restaurant in lavapies , madrid minimal conflict an annual survey of the muslim community suggests he is not alone .
some 70 percent of muslims say they feel at home here , and 80 percent say they feel they have adapted well to the spanish way of life .
islam is now the second largest religious domination , with a range of liberal , progressive branches represented , from the moroccan maliki school of thought to the tarikat sufi order from west africa .
spain transformed into a multicultural society with spectacular speed . and yet conflict between communities has been minimal according to madrid 's leading expert on muslim communities , berbabe lopez .
" the person who comes adapts , although they keep the trappings of their culture especially the older generation .
people do n't live in ghettos ; they are spread out all over the country , throughout neighborhoods , " he told deutsche welle .
" and i think that the spanish population - from whom you might have expected more racism - has really absorbed immigrants well .
in almost 15 years - there has been 12 percent immigration .
that has n't happened at such great speed in any other country in europe . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muslim migration has benefitted sweet teeth in spain pix and mix lopez says there is no spanish government ' model of integration ' .
instead , the ruling socialist party has borrowed different policies from other european countries .
the result is neither the assimilation prototype of france nor the multicultural model of the uk .
social integration has been aided by national politicians refusing to talk down muslims .
their response to the terrorist attack was the ' alliance of civilizations ' , a diplomatic push for cooperation between mediterranean cultures that drew on spain 's shared history with morocco .
at home this was mirrored by social cohesion programs .
but in parallel – and perhaps more importantly – there were regular amnesties for the immigrant workers who had powered spain 's construction boom .
in the last ten years over a million people who could prove they were working were granted legal status .
meanwhile all residents – even those without papers – have access to health and education .
and immigrants have not been blamed for the current crisis – even if this may cost votes .
emigrant hosts one reason for this inclusive approach is that spaniards emigrated in living memory . " when i was young we did n't have immigrants .
people here were the migrants .
people came back from germany and switzerland and england at summertime to spend the holidays here , " said ana planet , an arab and islamic studies professor at the madrid autonoma university .
spain also has a legal commitment to religious freedom , which is enshrined in its constitution .
this law tends to foils isolated attempts by town halls to ban veils .
and although they live in a mainly secular society , spaniards still recognize the importance of faith .
" we still consider religion as an important part of life and we are familiar with the this idea that ' you have your religion ' , ' you do that because of your religion ' , " said planet .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : impromptu mosques are springing up across the capital a marginalized group but it is not all positive .
ana explained that full social acceptance is still some way off . catalonia is seeing conflict emerge over the construction of mosques .
and a far-right party plans to field candidates in mayoral elections .
moroccan migrants , who make up around 80 percent of muslims here , tend to bear the brunt of prejudice , and fall within the most marginalized sector of society .
the crisis has left 30 percent out of work , compared to the 20 percent spanish average .
" bear in mind that we immigrants have always had the lowest-qualified jobs .
we do the jobs that no one else wants .
we have very casual contracts , in very bad conditions - you can be fired at any time and all this complicates the process of integration , " said kamal rahmouni from moroccan immigrant association atime .
but rahmouni ended on at upbeat note .
he feels the " complex , long road to integration " is generally going in the right direction .
at the crossroads spain passed the arrivals test but now faces the challenge of meshing these new identities with its own as the children of immigrants come of age .
they will not measure their lives against relatives from their parents ' country of origin but with their peers .
restaurant owner ibrahima -lrb- like 90 percent of muslims surveyed -rrb- believes islam is no barrier to being spanish .
he is convinced his children will have the same chances as classmates .
" i think that opportunities depend on your studies and the abilities of a person .
these days it does n't depend on a person 's color , " he said .
the crisis has made immigrants vulnerable .
but it has also brought down new arrivals by 43 percent .
this may create space for the government to make sure that the second generation of immigrants does enjoy equality of opportunity in the future .

amira 's parents immigrated to france from the north african country of tunisia , but she says she identifies more with france than with the country of her parents ' birth .
" since i 've been little , i 've felt completely french , " she says .
" in fact , i did n't realize that i was any different from the typical french person until i was 15 years old and a man insulted me on the street . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of muslim families settled in france amira says the man called her dirty and then threatened to hit her .
four years on she still gets upset talking about the incident .
since that day , amira says she has understood that she might face discrimination when looking for a job .
but she says she tries to keep a positive attitude .
generation gap sitting beside her mother on the couch , the teenager 's long , dark hair and dangling earrings are a contrast to her mother 's neatly tucked muslim headscarf .
amira 's mother , 48-year-old samira beshallah , works as a licensed nanny and takes care of three preschool-aged children .
samira says the parents do n't mind that she wears a headscarf when she takes their children out for walks or to play in the park and that wearing a headscarf in france is not problematic .
" i feel very , very good here .
i feel completely at home in france , " samira says .
" i raised my children here .
they have all done their studies .
i work , my husband is retired and i feel great . "
a new direction bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france has recently passed a ban on the full-face islamic veil amira , meanwhile , says she is not religious and would never wear a headscarf , although she does refrain from eating and drinking during the islamic fasting month of ramadan .
she says her parents do n't pressure her or their two sons to practice their faith , although she knows they expect her to marry a muslim .
amira says she has only one friend who wears a headscarf , but that most of her friends are n't even muslim .
she admits , however , that political talk over the last few years concerning islamist extremism and the banning of burqas has made her feel uneasy .
" it 's true that , these days , there 's a spotlight on muslims , " she says .
" i guess , since september 11 , people are asking ' who are muslims . '
people want to know who they are .
i guess it worries me a little .
but still , i do n't feel targeted .
we are against terrorism like everybody else . "
both amira and samira say the beshallah family and thousands of other muslims are completely integrated into the french way of life - proof that muslims can be productive members of western societies .

however , their voices are not representative of a country moving increasingly towards europe . it was more than brute violence : the recent heavy rioting at a european football match between italy and serbia in genoa on tuesday could not be put down solely to the actions of a few hooligans .
this tainting of the serbian national team was the result of ultranationalist groups who were bent on venting their discontent with the direction their country is taking , say experts from the brussels think-tank the centre for european policy studies -lrb- ceps -rrb- .
this small part of the serbian population feels unfairly treated and betrayed by the new orientation taken by their country towards europe . this underlying anger has used as its trigger the difficult economic conditions currently affecting serbia , as well as the high levels of unemployment - which stands at around 20 percent - and the still-raw memories of the breakup of yugoslavia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police detained 17 people after the riots the ultranationalists have seemingly set themselves the goal of making as much noise as possible , but , according to the ceps , this does not mean the movement enjoys support from the broader serbian community .
" serbia was and still is a traditional and orthodox country , where the influence of the church and history is big , " explains georg dura , an analyst with ceps .
" but above all , serbia must make peace with the past in order to move on with the future .
the majority of serbs agree with this . "
eye to europe dura says that only one minority within serbia was represented by the ultranationalists , who , he adds , are increasingly " losing ground . "
" they have now realized this and are reacting this way as a result , " dura says .
" they feel their leaders have sold them out by , for example , taking a more moderate approach towards -lsb- the breakaway region of -rsb- kosovo in recent months . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : serbia has not yet recognized kosovo as an independent state the ceps analyst says the government in belgrade has actively been trying to show the european union that it values the fundamental tenants of a free society such as tolerance and democracy through cooperation over kosovo , and by publicly supporting a recent gay pride parade .
traditionalist and nationalist groups in serbia have rejected both these overtures categorically .
according to ceps , the story of serbia over recent years has been unique , and has left the country deeply divided into backward-orientated and forward-looking factions .
for this reason , it is difficult to compare the country of around seven million with other european states .
" as time has passed opposition has disappeared , and the population has become more open and tolerant .
these have all been lessons learned on the way to the eu .

but the eu must give serbia membership candidate status to immediately shore up their support for democratic change in the country , " dura says .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 15.10.2010 ahead of match day eight , dw pundits are seeing stars großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if you look very hard , you might just find this constellation - promise this season , the dw sports team are predicting the results of all bundesliga matches .
after the last match day 's battering , our pundits hope they 've got their heads back for match day eight . after a two-week international break , match day eight is in ascendance and the dw bundesliga pundits are back at it .
after a poor set of predictions on the last match day -lrb- see below -rrb- , they 've resolved to look to the stars for guidance .
this week 's predictor hopes for the best , but has a ready excuse should things go awry : he 's a gemini , and can blame it on that other guy inhabiting his body .
friday , october 15 cologne-dortmund dortmund have gone from strength to strength this season , getting good individual performances from many a member of their young squad - and all the while , they 've been working for each other on the pitch .
cologne have been mostly hideous , managing a fortunate win over st. pauli and two backs-to-the-wall draws .
fan favorite and mercurial boy prince lukas podolski sounded off this week that his beloved fc was adrift , and hinted he would look for the exit if things did n't turn around soon .
off you go , then .
cologne deserve to be at the table 's foot as richly as dortmund do near the top , and the billygoats should get flogged on friday .
dortmund 3-0 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : van bommel and his , erm , passion will be missing form this match saturday , october 16 bayern-hanover the opening weeks of the season for hanover were surprisingly good - the team busted loose to a 13-point haul in their first six games .
they 're still in third place , but last week 's limp home loss to st. pauli highlighted their weakness : without a full-strength strike partnership of mohamad abdelloue and didier ya konan , hanover are far from dangerous .
ya konan was out two weeks ago , this time it 's abdelloue .
bayern do have injury problems of their own -lrb- diego contento , franck ribery and arjen robben are still out , and miroslav klose , mark van bommel and ivica olic picked up injuries on international duty -rrb- , but they should have more than enough quality to take this one .
bayern 3-1 schalke-stuttgart the bundesliga 's two most hapless sides were all set to square off in a contest to decide who would see their name inserted into a flurry of “ -lsb- insert club name here -rsb- in crisis ” headlines , and whose coach would see a greater flurry of speculation surrounding his future .
then stuttgart went and spoiled the fun , firing christian gross before the match had even been played .
probably for the best , really .
though there is n't much to separate these two in terms of form -lrb- both have been very poor -rrb- , schalke are at home and have a slightly better squad .
thus they should win .
schalke 2-1 werder bremen-freiburg freiburg have been puzzlingly strong this season , defying the odds to win four of their first seven -lrb- including two away -rrb- and have risen all the way to fifth place .
bremen , meanwhile , have been in a funk .
it 's been down to a mixture of injuries to key players like naldo , per mertesacker and claudio pizarro and the kind of sloppy defending bremen have become famous for in recent years .
now mertesacker is back in the starting line-up , pizarro might be able to play as a substitute , and sporting director klaus allof 's -lrb- possibly illegal -rrb- stunt of docking the players ' pay after the 4-1 loss to hanover in week six seems to have done the trick .
bremen could easily have won on the last matchday in leverkusen , and should win easily at home on saturday .
bremen 2-0 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : settle down , adam - your hat-trick came against san marino mainz-hamburg the little club that could may lose some steam from its engine following the international break , what with their young squad having had ample time to let success go to their heads .
then again striker adam szalai , who 's just hit four goals in two games for hungary , might just come back to mainz on a justified high that will fire him up for more .
hamburg , for their part , showed signs of living up to their considerable promise in a gutsy win over kaiserslautern in match day seven , and will be boosted by paolo guerrero 's return from injury .
on the other hand , they are still hobbled by 10 -lrb- ! -rrb- other players from the first-team squad laid low at the moment .
i smell a draw .
draw 2-2 st. pauli-nuremberg a tough one to call , in that not much separates these two sides .
both have punched above the weight of their rather thin squads thus far , nuremberg through a very organized defense , pauli through fitness and a willingness to fight to the very end of a match .
it 's been seven home games since hamburg 's skull-and-crossbones appreciation society has seen their team get a win , and just as many matches since der club has won away .
may the streaks continue .
draw 1-1 wolfsburg-leverkusen both these sides have n't got out of the gate as strongly as they 'd have liked , but neither the pharmaceuticals -lrb- in 4th place on 12 points -rrb- or the wolves -lrb- 8th place , 10pts . -rrb- are so far off the pace for panic to have set in , and in fact are on good form .
that 's in part because both are starting to get good production from strikers who had looked out of it at the season 's opening - wolfsburg 's grafite and leverkusen 's eren derdiyok .
i might have been inclined to go with the home side , but they will be missing goalkeeper diego benaglio , so a draw looks a good bet .
draw 2-2 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eintracht 's ultras are a real sharing , caring group of guys sunday , october 17 kaiserslautern-frankfurt it 's an intriguing match-up between a team that started poorly and may be beginning to fade -lrb- k-town -rrb- , and another that stumbled at first but that now might be finding its sea legs -lrb- eintracht -rrb- .
but nobody 's talking about the game , they 're talking about the potential for fan trouble .
these two clubs are not natural derby rivals , but they are historically the two strongest in their region , and have a history .
eintracht 's ultras , considered by many to be the nastiest " fans " in the bundesliga , certainly are trumpeting this as a trip to see hated rivals , virtually promising violence in internet forums .
much as i 'd like to see them disappointed , i see frankfurt taking the points .
frankfurt 2-1 hoffenheim-moenchengladbach gladbach lead the league by a comfortable margin in goals allowed with 20 , but showed signs in their 1-1 match day seven draw against the often potent wolfsburg that they might have found their way .
hoffenheim , meanwhile , have had a rough few weeks , losing at mainz and bayern -lrb- which is acceptable -rrb- , and drawing away to cologne -lrb- which is n't -rrb- .
a bright spot , however , has been the ice-cold free-kicks of their young icelandic newcomer , gylfi sigurdsson .
he 's scored them in substitute appearances thus far , and now he 's likely to get the start .
i like him to score , and for the hoff to win .
hoffenheim 3-1 last week 's result : 5 points hanover-st .

after the last match day 's battering , our pundits hope they 've got their heads back for match day eight . after a two-week international break , match day eight is in ascendance and the dw bundesliga pundits are back at it .
after a poor set of predictions on the last match day -lrb- see below -rrb- , they 've resolved to look to the stars for guidance .
this week 's predictor hopes for the best , but has a ready excuse should things go awry : he 's a gemini , and can blame it on that other guy inhabiting his body .
friday , october 15 cologne-dortmund dortmund have gone from strength to strength this season , getting good individual performances from many a member of their young squad - and all the while , they 've been working for each other on the pitch .
cologne have been mostly hideous , managing a fortunate win over st. pauli and two backs-to-the-wall draws .
fan favorite and mercurial boy prince lukas podolski sounded off this week that his beloved fc was adrift , and hinted he would look for the exit if things did n't turn around soon .
off you go , then .
cologne deserve to be at the table 's foot as richly as dortmund do near the top , and the billygoats should get flogged on friday .
dortmund 3-0 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : van bommel and his , erm , passion will be missing form this match saturday , october 16 bayern-hanover the opening weeks of the season for hanover were surprisingly good - the team busted loose to a 13-point haul in their first six games .
they 're still in third place , but last week 's limp home loss to st. pauli highlighted their weakness : without a full-strength strike partnership of mohamad abdelloue and didier ya konan , hanover are far from dangerous .
ya konan was out two weeks ago , this time it 's abdelloue .
bayern do have injury problems of their own -lrb- diego contento , franck ribery and arjen robben are still out , and miroslav klose , mark van bommel and ivica olic picked up injuries on international duty -rrb- , but they should have more than enough quality to take this one .
bayern 3-1 schalke-stuttgart the bundesliga 's two most hapless sides were all set to square off in a contest to decide who would see their name inserted into a flurry of “ -lsb- insert club name here -rsb- in crisis ” headlines , and whose coach would see a greater flurry of speculation surrounding his future .
then stuttgart went and spoiled the fun , firing christian gross before the match had even been played .
probably for the best , really .
though there is n't much to separate these two in terms of form -lrb- both have been very poor -rrb- , schalke are at home and have a slightly better squad .
thus they should win .
schalke 2-1 werder bremen-freiburg freiburg have been puzzlingly strong this season , defying the odds to win four of their first seven -lrb- including two away -rrb- and have risen all the way to fifth place .
bremen , meanwhile , have been in a funk .
it 's been down to a mixture of injuries to key players like naldo , per mertesacker and claudio pizarro and the kind of sloppy defending bremen have become famous for in recent years .
now mertesacker is back in the starting line-up , pizarro might be able to play as a substitute , and sporting director klaus allof 's -lrb- possibly illegal -rrb- stunt of docking the players ' pay after the 4-1 loss to hanover in week six seems to have done the trick .
bremen could easily have won on the last matchday in leverkusen , and should win easily at home on saturday .
bremen 2-0 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : settle down , adam - your hat-trick came against san marino mainz-hamburg the little club that could may lose some steam from its engine following the international break , what with their young squad having had ample time to let success go to their heads .
then again striker adam szalai , who 's just hit four goals in two games for hungary , might just come back to mainz on a justified high that will fire him up for more .
hamburg , for their part , showed signs of living up to their considerable promise in a gutsy win over kaiserslautern in match day seven , and will be boosted by paolo guerrero 's return from injury .
on the other hand , they are still hobbled by 10 -lrb- ! -rrb- other players from the first-team squad laid low at the moment .
i smell a draw .
draw 2-2 st. pauli-nuremberg a tough one to call , in that not much separates these two sides .
both have punched above the weight of their rather thin squads thus far , nuremberg through a very organized defense , pauli through fitness and a willingness to fight to the very end of a match .
it 's been seven home games since hamburg 's skull-and-crossbones appreciation society has seen their team get a win , and just as many matches since der club has won away .
may the streaks continue .
draw 1-1 wolfsburg-leverkusen both these sides have n't got out of the gate as strongly as they 'd have liked , but neither the pharmaceuticals -lrb- in 4th place on 12 points -rrb- or the wolves -lrb- 8th place , 10pts . -rrb- are so far off the pace for panic to have set in , and in fact are on good form .
that 's in part because both are starting to get good production from strikers who had looked out of it at the season 's opening - wolfsburg 's grafite and leverkusen 's eren derdiyok .
i might have been inclined to go with the home side , but they will be missing goalkeeper diego benaglio , so a draw looks a good bet .
draw 2-2 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eintracht 's ultras are a real sharing , caring group of guys sunday , october 17 kaiserslautern-frankfurt it 's an intriguing match-up between a team that started poorly and may be beginning to fade -lrb- k-town -rrb- , and another that stumbled at first but that now might be finding its sea legs -lrb- eintracht -rrb- .
but nobody 's talking about the game , they 're talking about the potential for fan trouble .
these two clubs are not natural derby rivals , but they are historically the two strongest in their region , and have a history .
eintracht 's ultras , considered by many to be the nastiest " fans " in the bundesliga , certainly are trumpeting this as a trip to see hated rivals , virtually promising violence in internet forums .
much as i 'd like to see them disappointed , i see frankfurt taking the points .
frankfurt 2-1 hoffenheim-moenchengladbach gladbach lead the league by a comfortable margin in goals allowed with 20 , but showed signs in their 1-1 match day seven draw against the often potent wolfsburg that they might have found their way .
hoffenheim , meanwhile , have had a rough few weeks , losing at mainz and bayern -lrb- which is acceptable -rrb- , and drawing away to cologne -lrb- which is n't -rrb- .
a bright spot , however , has been the ice-cold free-kicks of their young icelandic newcomer , gylfi sigurdsson .
he 's scored them in substitute appearances thus far , and now he 's likely to get the start .
i like him to score , and for the hoff to win .

kraft becomes the first woman to hold the bundesrat presidency . in a unanimous vote , germany 's upper house of parliament has elected hannelore kraft to be its president for the next year .
kraft 's nomination makes her the first woman to head the bundesrat , which represents germany 's 16 states at the federal level .
kraft is a member of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , which is in the minority at the national level .
she became the premier of germany 's most populous state , north-rhine westphalia , earlier this year after a very closely contested election that saw the spd make significant gains .
constitutionally , the bundesrat president ranks below the federal president and acts as his or her substitute .
current bundesrat president jens boehrnsen served as federal president in this capacity for one month after former president horst koehler stepped down in may .
boehrnsen called the bundesrat 's decision to nominate kraft ' historic . '
" what 's normal in society has finally reached another governmental organ , " he said .
kraft is scheduled to take over the bundesrat presidency on november 1 .
the term traditionally lasts one year .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de balkans -pipe- 15.10.2010 serbian ultranationalists struggle against a changing homeland großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the football match was later called off because of the riots serbian ultranationalists who recently sparked football match riots in italy are trying to destabilize serbia , analysts say .
however , their voices are not representative of a country moving increasingly towards europe . it was more than brute violence : the recent heavy rioting at a european football match between italy and serbia in genoa on tuesday could not be put down solely to the actions of a few hooligans .
this tainting of the serbian national team was the result of ultranationalist groups who were bent on venting their discontent with the direction their country is taking , say experts from the brussels think-tank the centre for european policy studies -lrb- ceps -rrb- .
this small part of the serbian population feels unfairly treated and betrayed by the new orientation taken by their country towards europe . this underlying anger has used as its trigger the difficult economic conditions currently affecting serbia , as well as the high levels of unemployment - which stands at around 20 percent - and the still-raw memories of the breakup of yugoslavia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police detained 17 people after the riots the ultranationalists have seemingly set themselves the goal of making as much noise as possible , but , according to the ceps , this does not mean the movement enjoys support from the broader serbian community .
" serbia was and still is a traditional and orthodox country , where the influence of the church and history is big , " explains georg dura , an analyst with ceps .
" but above all , serbia must make peace with the past in order to move on with the future .
the majority of serbs agree with this . "
eye to europe dura says that only one minority within serbia was represented by the ultranationalists , who , he adds , are increasingly " losing ground . "
" they have now realized this and are reacting this way as a result , " dura says .
" they feel their leaders have sold them out by , for example , taking a more moderate approach towards -lsb- the breakaway region of -rsb- kosovo in recent months . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : serbia has not yet recognized kosovo as an independent state the ceps analyst says the government in belgrade has actively been trying to show the european union that it values the fundamental tenants of a free society such as tolerance and democracy through cooperation over kosovo , and by publicly supporting a recent gay pride parade .
traditionalist and nationalist groups in serbia have rejected both these overtures categorically .
according to ceps , the story of serbia over recent years has been unique , and has left the country deeply divided into backward-orientated and forward-looking factions .
for this reason , it is difficult to compare the country of around seven million with other european states .
" as time has passed opposition has disappeared , and the population has become more open and tolerant .
these have all been lessons learned on the way to the eu .
a society must be open , the citizens must have the freedom of speech , " he says , adding that social changes take time , especially when dealing with post-communist states like serbia .
eu support ' integral ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anti-gay protestors clashed with serbian riot police dura says that the european union has supported serbia in the days following the football riots in italy , and must continue to help the country on its path towards eu integration .

the all-pervasive violence has not only caused physical wounds . there is a part of kabul , the capital of afghanistan , which afghan taxi drivers normally try to avoid .
when foreigners ask them , " are there terrorists ? " , their simple answer is : " no , junkies " .
junkies were a totally unknown phenomenon in afghanistan until quite recently , which is why most people are at a loss to know how to deal with the growing number of addicts .
in a way , it is the same with traumatized or depressed people .
the society at large and even their own relatives mostly react to mentally disturbed people with a lack of understanding or even with shame .
bildunterschrift : female drug addicts at one of the few treatment centers in kabul hiding away the patients many try to cover up the problem , says ahmad shafiq behrozian from the western city of herat .
" we afghans have no idea how to interact with mentally ill persons .
mostly we treat them as dangerous and crazy individuals .
sometimes they are chained or locked away in a separate room by their own relatives . "
doctors reckon that the growing number of the mentally ill is due to a number of reasons : war , experience of violence and subsequent traumata .
in addition , poverty and malnutrition can also contribute to a disease , because physically healthy persons are more resilient when they experience emotional stress .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : afghanistan 's hospitals are ill equipped to treat psychiatric patients unbearable stress when the stress becomes unbearable or , as in the situation of permanent conflict in afghanistan , when it piles up and people have no chance of getting it out of their system , they can experience a breakdown .
tragically , this changed behavior is normally not recognized as an illness , explains fatema jafari , a member of the provincial council in herat .
" you can easily tell that there is a high number of mental disorders here in herat , simply from the high incidence of self-immolations , violent attacks in public as well as domestic violence .
but nobody is interested in the real causes , no one talks about it .
more than 60 percent of the population have mental problems . "
lack of psychiatric services making it worse , not even doctors diagnose the illness at times .
muhammad ghulam ali from herat says , " we have a mental patient in our family .
we took him to see several doctors , but to no avail .
he ca n't control himself and is violent .
only when we keep absolute silence in the room , he can relax to some extent . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : children are especially vulnerable in this situation , qualified doctors and especially psychiatrists are badly needed , as are psychiatric wards in the hospitals , says peter graaff from the world health organization , the who .
" and yet , investment in mental health services is very limited at best . "
for example , there are currently only about 200 beds for psychiatric services in the country . " and there are no services targeting children specifically , " he adds . in fact , it is the children who would need medical care most urgently .

so far , lufthansa has decided to make their bread rolls a little more salty . why do so many people order tomato juice aboard airlines ?
over the last several months , the fraunhofer institute for building physics , in holzkirchen , just south of munich , has been trying to find the answer to this question - particulary given that lufthansa serves approximately 1.7 million liters of tomato juice each year .
more broadly , through a series of tests , researchers are trying to determine how flight conditions change the way food and drinks taste while in-flight .
the institute is conducting this research on behalf of lufthansa , which is one of the few airlines in the world that is currently undertaking airplane cuisine research - the final round in the testing series is due to be held in december .
reduced taste perception so far , scientists do know that once at a cruising altitude of approximately 10,000 meters -lrb- roughly 30,000 feet -rrb- , the cabin humidity drops by 15 percent , and the lowered air pressure forces bodily fluids upwards .
with less humidity , people get thirsty more easily as there is less moisture in their throat , which also slows the transport of odors to the brains smell and taste receptors .
" it 's like having a cold , " said florian mayer , the research team 's leader .
" when you have a cold all your nasal mucous swells up and you have reduced odor and taste perception . "
mayer and his team are conducting their research in a 30-meter -lrb- approximately 90 feet -rrb- low pressure tubular chamber , built around the front section of a decommissioned airbus a310 .
" we have typical temperatures of 20 degrees celsius -lrb- 68 degrees farenheit -rrb- , " mayer said .
" we have humidity of around 10 to 15 percent and we have a high air exchange rate – all the environmental conditions that are typical for flying aircraft , " mayer said .
" and what 's important we reduce the pressure from normal sea level or here it on ground it is about 950 -lsb- hectopascals -rsb- .
but onboard during cruise you have a normal pressure of around 750 - 800 -lsb- hectopascals -rsb- . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 30-meter low pressure chamber surrounds the front section of the plane inside , everything imitates a normal flight – the seats vibrate , the noise is the same and the human test subjects sniff , sip and munch their way through a long menu of airline food – some merely to taste of specific compounds , others similar to what is served in flight .
stronger spices work better so far , the researchers have already discovered that meals have to be more strongly flavored than those served on the ground .
" spicy food like thai and indian food goes very well because the spiciness does n't change because those dishes are very stable , " mayer said .
" whereas with fish with white sauce you have to and herbs to increase the taste . "
but while lufthansa is n't necessarily serving more curries on-board , its caterers have already been adding more salt to bread rolls as a result of the tests .
mayer noted that this conclusion may also explain the tomato juice observation , as it also lends itself to additives like salt and pepper .
" the flavor profile of tomato juice changes with pressure , " he said .
" so when they taste tomato juice on the ground and give it bad marks and if they do the same test under reduced pressure conditions they give the tomato better marks because tomato juice tastes better under low pressure conditions . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the simulator is built inside of a decommissioned airbus a310 such research remains uncommon industry analysts say that while this research is expensive - few other airlines have gone to such lengths to research airline food , particularly given the trend in low-cost , no-frills airlines that often only sell mediocre pre-packaged sandwiches at best - it may be a way for lufthansa to distinguish itself .

jakub blaszczykowski netted the first goal , with nuri sahin scoring the winner in injury time . former champions league winners borussia dortmund have defeated struggling cologne 2-1 away from home in the pouring rain in friday night 's bundesliga clash .
the winner came through nuri sahin in the 91st minute after the midfielder found the back of the net from close range after a goalmouth scramble .
dortmund seized momentum from the outset and should have taken the lead on 17 minutes when a cross from sahin found the head of striker lucas barrios , but the paraguayan put the ball over with the goal at his mercy .
the black and yellow from dortmund did n't have to wait much longer , however , when three minutes later japan international shinji kagawa played the ball into the cologne box where barrios headed it onto the knee of pole jakub blaszczykowski , nicknamed kuba , from which it bounced over the goal line .
the goal sparked cologne into action , but dortmund keeper roman weidenfeller denied attempts from portuguese midfielder petit and german international lukas podolski .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sahin 's goal came late in the game cologne were finally rewarded for their efforts when they tied the match up with eight minutes remaining after a poor dortmund clearance fell to podolski on the edge of the area .
weidenfeller had no chance against his left-footed shot , which clocked at 110 kilometers per hour .
but just as cologne thought they had secured a much-needed point , dortmund struck back with the late winner through sahin .
the win moves dortmund to equal top of the bundesliga , along with mainz , on 21 points , while cologne languish in 16th place and risk dropping another position if either schalke or stuttgart come away with all three points in their saturday game against each other .

prior to the meeting , open letters calling for political reforms have caused quite a stir . the results of the plenum of more than 300 members of the central committee will only be announced after it ends on monday .
according to china ’ s state news agency xinhua , president hu jintao and premier wen jiabao are among those attending . rumors have spread that the demand for political reforms will be on the agenda after two open letters to china ’ s leadership were published . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chinese president hu jintao has two years left in office focus on economic reform willy lam from the chinese university of hong kong doubts this .
he thinks that there will be discussions about consumer spending , particularly raising the living standards of workers and peasants .
" at this stage they are more interested in economic reform rather than political reform , " he explains . but the reform debate has recently intensified after jailed dissident liu xiaobo received this year ’ s nobel peace prize .
on friday , an open letter signed by over 200 intellectuals was published online .
initiated by xu youyu from the chinese academy of social sciences , a leading beijing think tank , the letter calls for more democracy and the release of liu xiaobo . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wen jiabao has spoken in favor of political reforms ' irresistible ' call for democracy and freedom it also demands democratic reform within the communist party .
in an interview broadcast by cnn television earlier this month , even premier wen jiabao called press freedom " indispensable " , adding that " the people 's wishes for and needs for democracy and freedom are irresistible . "
wen ’ s statement was later censored by chinese officials for domestic consumption and never made it to the chinese media . wen - who is viewed by some as more liberal-minded - is only in charge of economic issues , not political issues .
but he also lacks support within his own party .
" we don ’ t think that his remarks will trigger a process of fundamental reforms .
he only expresses his personal views on china ’ s future , " says xu youyu . power transition another reason why there won ’ t be any reforms is that china ’ s leadership has entered a phase of transition .
the central committee ’ s meeting is expected to mark the beginning of a power shift from president hu jintao to his potential successor xi jinping . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : current vice president xi jinping is widely seen as china 's next top leader the chinese regime is coming closer to the end of the current administration under hu jintao .
there will be a changing of the guards in october 2012 .
" there are only two years left for the current administration for this massive change of personnel at the top .
so at this stage the priority is basically on ensuring political stability , not on political change , " says lam . dominated by conservatives willy lam adds that for the reform process to pick up speed , the voices for reform in china and within the communist party in particular would have to grow louder .
as long as the central committee as well as the politburo are dominated by conservatives , he adds , " the open letters , which are very courageous , will not have any tangible impact on the development of chinese politics . " earlier this week , party veterans and retired journalists issued another open letter to the leadership , arguing that if the communist party does not reform itself , it will lose its vitality and die a natural death . author : chi viet giang editor : thomas baerthlein send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but the club 's position is unlikely to improve until deeper problems are resolved . given that vfb stuttgart never really get going in the bundesliga until after christmas , the sacking of christian gross after just seven games could be construed as jumping the gun slightly .
in the last few seasons , the opening months of the league campaign have always been a slog for vfb , only for the team to discover form and stability in the latter stages .
look at markus babbel 's tenure as coach : stuttgart was wallowing in the lower reaches of the bundesliga in autumn 2008 under armin veh , the coach who had won them the title two seasons prior .
veh was sacked , babbel took over and at the season 's end stuttgart had qualified for the champions league .
then again , look at markus babbel 's tenure as coach in another light .
the following season , babbel oversaw a similarly slow start to that which eventually undermined veh .
the former stuttgart defender was out of the door before the winter break with the team in the relegation zone with only two wins from 15 games and the fans carrying burning torches and threatening to storm the gates of the club - figuratively at least .
enter christian gross .
the swiss coach of great intellect and renown took over from babbel with stuttgart third from bottom and led them to a sixth place finish and qualification to the europa league .
vfb must have hoped that gross was the man to finally find a cure for the split personality which consistently renders the team useless in the run up to winter and sublime by the time spring had sprung .
the fact that stuttgart has endured an even worse start to this season than at any time in the previous three suggests that gross was equally at a loss to reverse the bi-polar nature of the team .
with just one win from seven games , gross is now looking for new employment while stuttgart 's management is once again left looking for answers .
stuttgart need to look beyond the coach bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : something is very wrong at the heart of the swabian club one yo-yo season can be excused .
two can be shrugged off as a coincidence .
three in a row becomes an alarming trend .
the fact that three different coaches , of varying style and experience , have failed to get a grip on stuttgart 's baffling schizophrenia suggests that something is rotten in the state of baden-wuerttemberg .
with assistant manager jens keller installed as caretaker boss for saturday 's basement showdown with fellow underachievers schalke 04 , the question is whether vfb will continue to believe that the choice of coach is at the heart of their seasonal problems , or if the powers-that-be will look closer to home for the source of the rising damp which is threatening to engulf the club .
at first glance , it appears that the club is set to don the blinkers again .
gross had shown " no signs of finding a solution " for the numerous problems plaguing the team , said sporting director fredi bobic , a statement which suggests vfb still believe that the quality of coaching is still the issue .
perhaps it would be more useful to look at the lack of depth and quality of the squad , the allocation of revenue and the boardroom rivalries which are unsettling the whole club .
thin squad , fat stadium investment stuttgart had a busy summer in the transfer market but it was the exit door which saw the most action .
real madrid snapped up sami khedira after his world cup exploits , veteran goalkeeper jens lehmann retired , and a host of adequate but uninspiring squad members -lrb- sebastian rudy , martin lanig , roberto hilbert , and so on -rrb- all trundled off to pastures new .
while many were unlikely to be missed , they did leave vfb short on numbers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stuttgart failed to find a quality replacement for khedira " in each of the past two years , vfb have sold their best player , " clark whitney , a bundesliga expert at goal.com international , told deutsche welle . " in 2009 , it was mario gomez and more recently , it was sami khedira .
khedira and gomez were club icons .
even when out of form , gomez was worth a goal every other game .
khedira , with his tremendous work rate and skill in transition , was a perfect fit for vfb .
pavel pogrebnyak and zdravko kuzmanovic just have n't been good enough as replacements . "
considering the acquistions stuttgart brought in to replace them , simple mathematics showed that stuttgart was in the minus column in terms of quality and cover before the season even began .
despite bringing in johan audel , philipp degen , mauro camoranesi and christian gentner , none of these players have made much impact .
audel and degen have yet to play for the club since arriving due to injuries while the italian camoranesi has found it hard to bed in .
gentner , brought back from a loan spell at vfl wolfsburg , has struggled for form and appears too inexperienced to step into the shoes of khedira and run the midfield .
some blame should then be passed onto fredi bobic , who may be a former club favorite due to his past efforts on the pitch but is still hugely inexperienced in his role as sporting director .
giving bobic the responsibility to conduct transfers has backfired and clashes between bobic and gross regularly brought up the differences between the two men over their demands in the transfer market .
bricks before legs ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stuttgart 's current crop of players do n't make the grade in his defense , bobic has been struggling himself to loosen the club 's purse strings , held possessively by a board committed to remodeling stuttgart 's home ground , the mercedes benz arena .
christian gross told the local stuttgarter zeitung in the days before his sacking that it was clear " the club 's priority has been pointed toward finishing stadium renovations . "
gross never said where he thought the 22 million euros accrued from last season 's champions league campaign went to .
perhaps he did n't need to - it was obvious this was a team built on the cheap .
" stuttgart 's decline has resulted primarily from a disconnection between the club 's sporting and financial goals , " said clark whitney .
" between the sales of gomez and khedira , stuttgart made nearly 50 million euros .
during the same period of time , stuttgart has been reluctant to reinvest .
if their 3.5 million-euro offer for mladen petric was n't laughable , their 1 million-euro maximum bid for andre ayew certainly was .
to further the comedy , stuttgart sent 20-year old rising star sebastian rudy to hoffenheim , and signed 33-year old mauro camoranesi as his replacement . " " naturally , one is led to ask what happened to vfb 's transfer earnings , as well as the 22 million euros earned in the 2009-10 champions league , " whitney added .
" the answer is quite a shock .
delusions of grandeur have prompted the management to invest 73.2 million euros in stadium renovations and expansion .
of course , the mercedes-benz arena could use a bit of refurbishing .
still , you have to wonder whether the management expect 60,000 fans to show up for a second division match . "
failure of leadership to blame the club 's hierarchy is to open another can of worms .
it is no simple matter to say that the board members responsible for the revenue at the club are wholly responsible for draining funds from the playing squad and pumping the euros into the crumbling stands and infrastructure .
in fact , it has been alleged that rivalries in the boardroom have been exacerbated over just this matter .
rather than the suits being all-for-one , one-for-all in their determination to give an ailing team a beautiful home , it appears that club president erwin staudt and chief financial office ulrich ruf were in favor of investing more in the squad this summer , but that their moves to divert cash budgeted for renovation into team building had been vetoed by chairman of the supervisory board dieter hundt .
it ’ s an accusation the hundt has strongly denied , arguing that the club had spent 12.5 million euros on new players , the fifth-highest figure in the bundesliga .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stuttgart 's hundt -lrb- l . -rrb- has some powerful friends perhaps it has less to do with how much is spent than which players the money is spent on .
stuttgart lack quality , and many players appear to have lost belief that they can rescue the season .
moreover , there are rumors of chaos in the dressing room .
one ex-vfb star claimed in a recent sports illustrated report on the team ’ s troubles that the current stuttgart squad is " a rowdy , undisciplined bunch . " it certainly sounds like stuttgart 's problems run far deeper than the inability to find a coach with the know-how to rescue the club from its momentary malaise .
time will tell if those with the power to save the club will realize in time what those problems are , and manage to solve them .
" i personally believe that the board should follow gross out the door , " concluded whitney . " in sporting terms , stuttgart have regressed in recent years while other teams have all improved . " " the relegation of hertha berlin in may was no mistake - they felt safe with the previous year 's fourth place finish , opted not to sign adequate replacements for andriy voronin and josip simunic , and paid the price a year later .
the stuttgart management have taken the same risk ; if vfb are relegated , they can only blame themselves . " author : nick amies editor : matt hermann send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stuttgart 's current crop of players do n't make the grade in his defense , bobic has been struggling himself to loosen the club 's purse strings , held possessively by a board committed to remodeling stuttgart 's home ground , the mercedes benz arena .
christian gross told the local stuttgarter zeitung in the days before his sacking that it was clear " the club 's priority has been pointed toward finishing stadium renovations . "
gross never said where he thought the 22 million euros accrued from last season 's champions league campaign went to .
perhaps he did n't need to - it was obvious this was a team built on the cheap .
" stuttgart 's decline has resulted primarily from a disconnection between the club 's sporting and financial goals , " said clark whitney .
" between the sales of gomez and khedira , stuttgart made nearly 50 million euros .
during the same period of time , stuttgart has been reluctant to reinvest .
if their 3.5 million-euro offer for mladen petric was n't laughable , their 1 million-euro maximum bid for andre ayew certainly was .
to further the comedy , stuttgart sent 20-year old rising star sebastian rudy to hoffenheim , and signed 33-year old mauro camoranesi as his replacement . " " naturally , one is led to ask what happened to vfb 's transfer earnings , as well as the 22 million euros earned in the 2009-10 champions league , " whitney added .
" the answer is quite a shock .
delusions of grandeur have prompted the management to invest 73.2 million euros in stadium renovations and expansion .
of course , the mercedes-benz arena could use a bit of refurbishing .
still , you have to wonder whether the management expect 60,000 fans to show up for a second division match . "
failure of leadership to blame the club 's hierarchy is to open another can of worms .
it is no simple matter to say that the board members responsible for the revenue at the club are wholly responsible for draining funds from the playing squad and pumping the euros into the crumbling stands and infrastructure .
in fact , it has been alleged that rivalries in the boardroom have been exacerbated over just this matter .
rather than the suits being all-for-one , one-for-all in their determination to give an ailing team a beautiful home , it appears that club president erwin staudt and chief financial office ulrich ruf were in favor of investing more in the squad this summer , but that their moves to divert cash budgeted for renovation into team building had been vetoed by chairman of the supervisory board dieter hundt .
it ’ s an accusation the hundt has strongly denied , arguing that the club had spent 12.5 million euros on new players , the fifth-highest figure in the bundesliga .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stuttgart 's hundt -lrb- l . -rrb- has some powerful friends perhaps it has less to do with how much is spent than which players the money is spent on .
stuttgart lack quality , and many players appear to have lost belief that they can rescue the season .
moreover , there are rumors of chaos in the dressing room .
one ex-vfb star claimed in a recent sports illustrated report on the team ’ s troubles that the current stuttgart squad is " a rowdy , undisciplined bunch . " it certainly sounds like stuttgart 's problems run far deeper than the inability to find a coach with the know-how to rescue the club from its momentary malaise .
time will tell if those with the power to save the club will realize in time what those problems are , and manage to solve them .
" i personally believe that the board should follow gross out the door , " concluded whitney . " in sporting terms , stuttgart have regressed in recent years while other teams have all improved . " " the relegation of hertha berlin in may was no mistake - they felt safe with the previous year 's fourth place finish , opted not to sign adequate replacements for andriy voronin and josip simunic , and paid the price a year later .
the stuttgart management have taken the same risk ; if vfb are relegated , they can only blame themselves . " author : nick amies editor : matt hermann send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

tolerance and openness have marked the arrival of migrants , but the second generation will be the litmus test of successful integration . arabic is often heard as you walk through the streets of lavapies in central madrid . here , traditional tapas bars and bakeries mix with shisha joints , bangaldeshi corner shops and african restaurants .
one of these , doing a swift trade in spicy fish , is run by ibrahima ndiaye .
he has two children with his spanish wife and has enjoyed financial success .
he started out as a night club bouncer and now runs a boutique and this popular restaurant .
he is part of spain 's diverse muslim population , which now numbers around 1.3 million people - just under 3 percent of the overall population of 45 million .
his restaurant is in the same neighborhood where islamic fundamentalists planned the train bombing that killed 191 people march 2004 .
but he says there was no backlash locally .
" i have lived here for many years .
my spanish neighbors know me , they know how i live . it 's true that terrorism has created problems .
when you travel or go to a public place people do look at you now .
but i have n't suffered consequences in my neighborhood . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ibrahima ndiaye runs a successful restaurant in lavapies , madrid minimal conflict an annual survey of the muslim community suggests he is not alone .
some 70 percent of muslims say they feel at home here , and 80 percent say they feel they have adapted well to the spanish way of life .
islam is now the second largest religious domination , with a range of liberal , progressive branches represented , from the moroccan maliki school of thought to the tarikat sufi order from west africa .
spain transformed into a multicultural society with spectacular speed . and yet conflict between communities has been minimal according to madrid 's leading expert on muslim communities , berbabe lopez .
" the person who comes adapts , although they keep the trappings of their culture especially the older generation .
people do n't live in ghettos ; they are spread out all over the country , throughout neighborhoods , " he told deutsche welle .
" and i think that the spanish population - from whom you might have expected more racism - has really absorbed immigrants well .
in almost 15 years - there has been 12 percent immigration .
that has n't happened at such great speed in any other country in europe . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muslim migration has benefitted sweet teeth in spain pix and mix lopez says there is no spanish government ' model of integration ' .
instead , the ruling socialist party has borrowed different policies from other european countries .
the result is neither the assimilation prototype of france nor the multicultural model of the uk .
social integration has been aided by national politicians refusing to talk down muslims .
their response to the terrorist attack was the ' alliance of civilizations ' , a diplomatic push for cooperation between mediterranean cultures that drew on spain 's shared history with morocco .
at home this was mirrored by social cohesion programs .
but in parallel – and perhaps more importantly – there were regular amnesties for the immigrant workers who had powered spain 's construction boom .
in the last ten years over a million people who could prove they were working were granted legal status .
meanwhile all residents – even those without papers – have access to health and education .
and immigrants have not been blamed for the current crisis – even if this may cost votes .
emigrant hosts one reason for this inclusive approach is that spaniards emigrated in living memory . " when i was young we did n't have immigrants .
people here were the migrants .
people came back from germany and switzerland and england at summertime to spend the holidays here , " said ana planet , an arab and islamic studies professor at the madrid autonoma university .
spain also has a legal commitment to religious freedom , which is enshrined in its constitution .
this law tends to foils isolated attempts by town halls to ban veils .
and although they live in a mainly secular society , spaniards still recognize the importance of faith .
" we still consider religion as an important part of life and we are familiar with the this idea that ' you have your religion ' , ' you do that because of your religion ' , " said planet .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : impromptu mosques are springing up across the capital a marginalized group but it is not all positive .
ana explained that full social acceptance is still some way off . catalonia is seeing conflict emerge over the construction of mosques .
and a far-right party plans to field candidates in mayoral elections .
moroccan migrants , who make up around 80 percent of muslims here , tend to bear the brunt of prejudice , and fall within the most marginalized sector of society .
the crisis has left 30 percent out of work , compared to the 20 percent spanish average .
" bear in mind that we immigrants have always had the lowest-qualified jobs .
we do the jobs that no one else wants .
we have very casual contracts , in very bad conditions - you can be fired at any time and all this complicates the process of integration , " said kamal rahmouni from moroccan immigrant association atime .
but rahmouni ended on at upbeat note .
he feels the " complex , long road to integration " is generally going in the right direction .
at the crossroads spain passed the arrivals test but now faces the challenge of meshing these new identities with its own as the children of immigrants come of age .
they will not measure their lives against relatives from their parents ' country of origin but with their peers .
restaurant owner ibrahima -lrb- like 90 percent of muslims surveyed -rrb- believes islam is no barrier to being spanish .
he is convinced his children will have the same chances as classmates .
" i think that opportunities depend on your studies and the abilities of a person .
these days it does n't depend on a person 's color , " he said .
the crisis has made immigrants vulnerable .
but it has also brought down new arrivals by 43 percent .
this may create space for the government to make sure that the second generation of immigrants does enjoy equality of opportunity in the future .

german workers in leipzig now worry that their baby , the pint-sized x1 , may be the next candidate for relocation . german luxury car giant bmw has unveiled plans to build a new production line at its plant in spartanburg , south carolina , for the next-generation of x3 sport-utility vehicles currently manufactured in graz , austria .
the german premium carmaker has been building spartanburg in city since 1994 , concentrating mainly on the larger x5 and x6 models .
bmw sells more cars in the us than in any other country except germany .
its sport-utility range , the x series , is in particularly high demand in america .
that explains why the company is investing 750 million dollars – or 540 million euros – to expand its one and only us plant .
less vulnerable to shifts in exchange rates " the united states is still the biggest market for premium cars , " said bmw chief executive norbert reithofer .
" there 's no doubt - we need to be active there .
and we need to have local production facilities to make ourselves less vulnerable to shifts in the euro-dollar exchange rate . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bmw ceo norbert reithofer says the us is " still the biggest market for premium cars " the addition of the x3 model will see spartanburg 's capacity climb from 160,000 to 240,000 cars per year .
and there 's still room for another production line for what the bavarian automaker describes as a “ high-volume ” model .
" before the crisis , the premium car market in the united states sold about two million vehicles annually , " reithofer said .
" we expect the market will probably reach that volume again in 2013 , so our target for us sales will be about 300,000 units . "
bmw 's plans have seen its south carolina workforce grow more than 25 percent as a result , from 6,000 to 7,600 employees .
regional leaders like senator lindsey graham are delighted .
" this is taking south carolina 's economy in a new direction – for every job created by bmw at this plant , three additional jobs are created to support this plant , " graham said .
" it 's hard to put a figure on it , but it 's meant the world to the state of south carolina . "
good reason to be there bmw is not the only german carmaker with a factory in the united states .
mercedes-benz builds its own suv range in tuscaloosa , alabama .
and volkswagen is constructing a massive production center in chattanooga , tennessee .
it 's no coincidence , analysts say , why these factories are located in the southern part of the us . because the southern states are not highly industrialized , their governments are offering high subsidies to attract new investment .
and the american autoworkers ' union – which is traditionally very strong in the north – does n't have a presence in the south , making it much easier for management to negotiate flexible shift times with the workers .
bildunterschrift : bmw will build its next-generation x3 in spartanburg , south carolina meanwhile , back in germany , unions are asking what the attractive conditions on the other side of the atlantic will mean for the future of bmw workers in germany .
could government subsidies see production of the x1 compact suv shift to south carolina as well ?
for now , bmw chief norbert reithofer says the answer is " no . "
" the main market for the x1 is europe , which is why we 're producing that model in leipzig , " reithofer said .
" and that is where it 's going to stay . "
analysts say that if bmw chooses to produce a fourth vehicle at spartanburg , it would likely be the carmaker 's best-seller 3-series compact .
the bavarian company has n't announced any concrete plans for further expansion , but a precedent already exists .
rival carmaker daimler announced last december that the new generation of mercedes c-class sedan would be built in alabama , ending the model 's assembly in the german town of sindelfingen after more than 25 years .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 15.10.2010 stuttgart need a reality check as gross takes the fall großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : holding gross accountable ignores deeper problems at vfb stuttgart packed off its third coach in three seasons when christian gross was shown the door after a woeful start to the season .
but the club 's position is unlikely to improve until deeper problems are resolved . given that vfb stuttgart never really get going in the bundesliga until after christmas , the sacking of christian gross after just seven games could be construed as jumping the gun slightly .
in the last few seasons , the opening months of the league campaign have always been a slog for vfb , only for the team to discover form and stability in the latter stages .
look at markus babbel 's tenure as coach : stuttgart was wallowing in the lower reaches of the bundesliga in autumn 2008 under armin veh , the coach who had won them the title two seasons prior .
veh was sacked , babbel took over and at the season 's end stuttgart had qualified for the champions league .
then again , look at markus babbel 's tenure as coach in another light .
the following season , babbel oversaw a similarly slow start to that which eventually undermined veh .
the former stuttgart defender was out of the door before the winter break with the team in the relegation zone with only two wins from 15 games and the fans carrying burning torches and threatening to storm the gates of the club - figuratively at least .
enter christian gross .
the swiss coach of great intellect and renown took over from babbel with stuttgart third from bottom and led them to a sixth place finish and qualification to the europa league .
vfb must have hoped that gross was the man to finally find a cure for the split personality which consistently renders the team useless in the run up to winter and sublime by the time spring had sprung .
the fact that stuttgart has endured an even worse start to this season than at any time in the previous three suggests that gross was equally at a loss to reverse the bi-polar nature of the team .
with just one win from seven games , gross is now looking for new employment while stuttgart 's management is once again left looking for answers .
stuttgart need to look beyond the coach bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : something is very wrong at the heart of the swabian club one yo-yo season can be excused .
two can be shrugged off as a coincidence .
three in a row becomes an alarming trend .
the fact that three different coaches , of varying style and experience , have failed to get a grip on stuttgart 's baffling schizophrenia suggests that something is rotten in the state of baden-wuerttemberg .
with assistant manager jens keller installed as caretaker boss for saturday 's basement showdown with fellow underachievers schalke 04 , the question is whether vfb will continue to believe that the choice of coach is at the heart of their seasonal problems , or if the powers-that-be will look closer to home for the source of the rising damp which is threatening to engulf the club .
at first glance , it appears that the club is set to don the blinkers again .
gross had shown " no signs of finding a solution " for the numerous problems plaguing the team , said sporting director fredi bobic , a statement which suggests vfb still believe that the quality of coaching is still the issue .
perhaps it would be more useful to look at the lack of depth and quality of the squad , the allocation of revenue and the boardroom rivalries which are unsettling the whole club .
thin squad , fat stadium investment stuttgart had a busy summer in the transfer market but it was the exit door which saw the most action .
real madrid snapped up sami khedira after his world cup exploits , veteran goalkeeper jens lehmann retired , and a host of adequate but uninspiring squad members -lrb- sebastian rudy , martin lanig , roberto hilbert , and so on -rrb- all trundled off to pastures new .
while many were unlikely to be missed , they did leave vfb short on numbers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stuttgart failed to find a quality replacement for khedira " in each of the past two years , vfb have sold their best player , " clark whitney , a bundesliga expert at goal.com international , told deutsche welle . " in 2009 , it was mario gomez and more recently , it was sami khedira .
khedira and gomez were club icons .
even when out of form , gomez was worth a goal every other game .
khedira , with his tremendous work rate and skill in transition , was a perfect fit for vfb .
pavel pogrebnyak and zdravko kuzmanovic just have n't been good enough as replacements . "
considering the acquistions stuttgart brought in to replace them , simple mathematics showed that stuttgart was in the minus column in terms of quality and cover before the season even began .
despite bringing in johan audel , philipp degen , mauro camoranesi and christian gentner , none of these players have made much impact .
audel and degen have yet to play for the club since arriving due to injuries while the italian camoranesi has found it hard to bed in .
gentner , brought back from a loan spell at vfl wolfsburg , has struggled for form and appears too inexperienced to step into the shoes of khedira and run the midfield .
some blame should then be passed onto fredi bobic , who may be a former club favorite due to his past efforts on the pitch but is still hugely inexperienced in his role as sporting director .
giving bobic the responsibility to conduct transfers has backfired and clashes between bobic and gross regularly brought up the differences between the two men over their demands in the transfer market .
bricks before legs ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stuttgart 's current crop of players do n't make the grade in his defense , bobic has been struggling himself to loosen the club 's purse strings , held possessively by a board committed to remodeling stuttgart 's home ground , the mercedes benz arena .
christian gross told the local stuttgarter zeitung in the days before his sacking that it was clear " the club 's priority has been pointed toward finishing stadium renovations . "
gross never said where he thought the 22 million euros accrued from last season 's champions league campaign went to .
perhaps he did n't need to - it was obvious this was a team built on the cheap .
" stuttgart 's decline has resulted primarily from a disconnection between the club 's sporting and financial goals , " said clark whitney .
" between the sales of gomez and khedira , stuttgart made nearly 50 million euros .
during the same period of time , stuttgart has been reluctant to reinvest .
if their 3.5 million-euro offer for mladen petric was n't laughable , their 1 million-euro maximum bid for andre ayew certainly was .
to further the comedy , stuttgart sent 20-year old rising star sebastian rudy to hoffenheim , and signed 33-year old mauro camoranesi as his replacement . " " naturally , one is led to ask what happened to vfb 's transfer earnings , as well as the 22 million euros earned in the 2009-10 champions league , " whitney added .
" the answer is quite a shock .
delusions of grandeur have prompted the management to invest 73.2 million euros in stadium renovations and expansion .
of course , the mercedes-benz arena could use a bit of refurbishing .
still , you have to wonder whether the management expect 60,000 fans to show up for a second division match . "
failure of leadership to blame the club 's hierarchy is to open another can of worms .
it is no simple matter to say that the board members responsible for the revenue at the club are wholly responsible for draining funds from the playing squad and pumping the euros into the crumbling stands and infrastructure .
in fact , it has been alleged that rivalries in the boardroom have been exacerbated over just this matter .
rather than the suits being all-for-one , one-for-all in their determination to give an ailing team a beautiful home , it appears that club president erwin staudt and chief financial office ulrich ruf were in favor of investing more in the squad this summer , but that their moves to divert cash budgeted for renovation into team building had been vetoed by chairman of the supervisory board dieter hundt .
it ’ s an accusation the hundt has strongly denied , arguing that the club had spent 12.5 million euros on new players , the fifth-highest figure in the bundesliga .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stuttgart 's hundt -lrb- l . -rrb- has some powerful friends perhaps it has less to do with how much is spent than which players the money is spent on .
stuttgart lack quality , and many players appear to have lost belief that they can rescue the season .
moreover , there are rumors of chaos in the dressing room .
one ex-vfb star claimed in a recent sports illustrated report on the team ’ s troubles that the current stuttgart squad is " a rowdy , undisciplined bunch .

jakub blaszczykowski netted the first goal , with nuri sahin scoring the winner in injury time . former champions league winners borussia dortmund have defeated struggling cologne 2-1 away from home in the pouring rain in friday night 's bundesliga clash .
the winner came through nuri sahin in the 91st minute after the midfielder found the back of the net from close range after a goalmouth scramble .
dortmund seized momentum from the outset and should have taken the lead on 17 minutes when a cross from sahin found the head of striker lucas barrios , but the paraguayan put the ball over with the goal at his mercy .
the black and yellow from dortmund did n't have to wait much longer , however , when three minutes later japan international shinji kagawa played the ball into the cologne box where barrios headed it onto the knee of pole jakub blaszczykowski , nicknamed kuba , from which it bounced over the goal line .
the goal sparked cologne into action , but dortmund keeper roman weidenfeller denied attempts from portuguese midfielder petit and german international lukas podolski .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sahin 's goal came late in the game cologne were finally rewarded for their efforts when they tied the match up with eight minutes remaining after a poor dortmund clearance fell to podolski on the edge of the area .
weidenfeller had no chance against his left-footed shot , which clocked at 110 kilometers per hour .
but just as cologne thought they had secured a much-needed point , dortmund struck back with the late winner through sahin .
the win moves dortmund to equal top of the bundesliga , along with mainz , on 21 points , while cologne languish in 16th place and risk dropping another position if either schalke or stuttgart come away with all three points in their saturday game against each other .

speaking to reporters before the meeting , baden-wuerttemberg state premier stefan mappus said he wanted to make the debate over the project " more transparent . "
" we want to show people why we see stuttgart 21 as an important project for baden-wuerttemberg , why it 's a project that will last for generations , " he said .
" we also want to back everything up with facts and move beyond emotions , so that everyone can understand it based on concrete arguments . "
two hours into the discussions , project opponents broke them off to confer with each other before resuming them later in the afternoon .
sources close to the talks said both sides disagreed on the conditions for how to proceed .
public fact-check hannes rockenbauch , spokesman for the opposition to the project , said on wednesday morning that he was looking forward to speaking directly to the project 's supporters .
" we 're really excited , because we want to have this public fact-check , " he told public television ard .
" we 're hoping that the state government and rail authorities are really ready for this , because for us it means that they wo n't be allowed to create any more ' facts ' while this public fact-check is ongoing . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protestors had previously demanded a construction halt before talks he added that he wanted to give the state , federal and rail authorities a final chance to explain " disproportionate police actions " that took place on september 30 , when police used water cannons , tear gas and pepper spray against protestors that they said had turned violent .
despite the negotiations , rockenbauch said another demonstration against the project would go ahead as planned on the weekend .
rockenbauch is joined by six other opponents of stuttgart 21 , including environmental activists and state green party and social democrat politicians .
the other side includes mappus , state transport minister tanja goenner and volker kefer from the german rail company deutsche bahn .
sticking points the state-appointed arbitrator in the debate , veteran politician heiner geissler of angela merkel 's christian democratic union , announced thursday evening after four hours of talks with the project 's opponents that negotiations between both sides would take place .
up until that point the opposition had refused to hold any negotiations with the state authorities until all construction work on the project was put on hold .
on october 5 , mappus instead ordered a moratorium on demolition work to last until november .
a major sticking point for opponents remains in the construction of a cement tank for underground water management , as well as the degree of public access to the disussions .
rockenbauch and other opponents have called for the video of future meetings to be carried live on the internet .
legal reprimand for builders in a parallel development , a stuttgart administrative court found on thursday that the project 's leaders had incorrectly filed their application to cut down trees in the city 's palace gardens as part of the project .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the project would move the train station underground the environmental group friends of the earth germany had filed an emergency application to halt the tree-cutting , claiming it would endanger a rare species of beetle that lives in the trees .
the court said it may have granted the emergency stop , but the federal railway authority did not provide proper documentation of the project 's environmental protection plans , which included research on how the tree-cutting would affect the beetle .
meanwhile the renovation project , which would move the rail station underground and turn it from a terminus to a through-station , gained public support from european commission transport minister siim kallas .
" the high-speed route between paris and bratislava is an extremely important trans-european west-east axis , " kallas told the rheinische post newspaper .
" stuttgart 21 represents a key element of this thoroughfare . "

the " european green capitals " program aims to ensure cities rise in style to the environmental challenges facing them . healthy competition usually spurs contestants to outdo each other and brings the eventual winner fame and glory .
that 's probably what the 16 representatives from various european cities had in mind when they came together in tallinn , estonia , in may 2006 to launch the european green capital award scheme .
the aim was to encourage cities to achieve higher levels of environmental protection and improve the quality of the urban environment .
the first winner of the competition was stockholm , which served throughout 2010 as europe 's first green capital .
in 2011 , it will be passing the mantle to hamburg in northern germany .
a spirit of healthy competition when it comes to green urban development is long overdue : europe has become an essentially urban society , with four out of five europeans living in towns and cities .
it 's a development seen all over the world , with more than half the world 's population , or about 3.3 billion people , now living in towns and cities .
almost four fifths of greenhouses gases emitted every day originate in cities .
so with most of the environmental challenges facing our society arising in urban areas , the logical conclusion is that it is also these urban areas that need to muster up the commitment and innovation to resolve them .
hamburg meets the mark on several fronts so what 's needed to make cities more environmentally-friendly and liveable in the future ?
the european commission has drafted ten criteria that specifically pinpoint steps to solve environmental challenges in cities , improve the quality of life of its citizens and reduce their global carbon footprint .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : harbor city is a new quarter under development in the old harbor of hamburg , along the river elbe the criteria require the winning city to not just meet high environmental standards but also show it has what it takes to be a role model to inspire other cities and promote best practices .
according to the jury , hamburg won thanks to what it described as “ ambitious climate protection targets . ”
the northern german port city plans to slash its 1990 carbon emissions levels by 40 percent by 2020 , and by 80 percent by 2050 .
cynics might say hamburg won the coveted title because of its lofty goals rather than its current practices .
but that 's only partially true .
hamburg 's ambitious climate targets naturally played a role in its victory but the city already boasts lower per capita carbon emissions than freiburg - another german city that made it to the competition shortlist and one that sees itself as the cradle of the green movement in germany .
latest available official figures show that hamburg 's carbon emissions amounted to 8.84 tones per year per resident in 2006 , compared to 9.28 tones in freiburg in 2005 .
hamburg out-performed the other contestants on many fronts .
the jury deemed its water quality better than in bristol , oslo , freiburg and muenster .
it has equally excellent air quality and an efficient waste management system . the city has also apparently achieved good performance levels in terms of cycling and public transport indicators .
lost opportunities ?
yet some of the rating practices in the competition have raised eyebrows .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bike-friendly german city of muenster also made the shortlist for instance , amsterdam – a bicycle city if ever there was one – was awarded only one point more than hamburg for pro-cycling traffic infrastructure .
the jury commended amsterdam 's impressive achievement in getting more of its residents cycling than driving , noting that nine tenths of its roads are bike-friendly , and that anyone who needs to get in the driving seat now and then can use one of the city 's efficient car-sharing stations .
when it comes to promoting two wheels , amsterdam surely outstrips hamburg , and the german port city may not be making the most of opportunities to catch up .
even hamburg 's new waterfront district hafencity , which is currently being developed , is seen as having failed in some environmental aspects .
the new district will increase the inner city area by 40 percent through filling-up expendable harbor basins .
in itself , this is an exemplary way of preventing geographical expansion into surrounding areas , and one that provides plenty of scope for sustainable urban development .
but instead of integrating bike-friendly strategies into the concept , urban planners have come up with a design that suits first and foremost the needs of motorists .
on track to a greener future the issue has been seized upon by the hamburg future council , which is made up of citizens , companies and associations .
according to its press spokeswoman delia schindler , hamburg owes its european green capital victory less to politicians and more to grassroots activism and local ngos .
but the eu commission jury was n't splitting hairs .
it made a point of praising public commitment to environmental objectives , and hamburg garnered maximum points for its communication strategy .
the jury was impressed by the involvement of young people ; the many environmental networks in operation and the enthusiasm the city shows in cooperating with other environmental organizations within the eu .

german workers in leipzig now worry that their baby , the pint-sized x1 , may be the next candidate for relocation . german luxury car giant bmw has unveiled plans to build a new production line at its plant in spartanburg , south carolina , for the next-generation of x3 sport-utility vehicles currently manufactured in graz , austria .
the german premium carmaker has been building spartanburg in city since 1994 , concentrating mainly on the larger x5 and x6 models .
bmw sells more cars in the us than in any other country except germany .
its sport-utility range , the x series , is in particularly high demand in america .
that explains why the company is investing 750 million dollars – or 540 million euros – to expand its one and only us plant .
less vulnerable to shifts in exchange rates " the united states is still the biggest market for premium cars , " said bmw chief executive norbert reithofer .
" there 's no doubt - we need to be active there .
and we need to have local production facilities to make ourselves less vulnerable to shifts in the euro-dollar exchange rate . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bmw ceo norbert reithofer says the us is " still the biggest market for premium cars " the addition of the x3 model will see spartanburg 's capacity climb from 160,000 to 240,000 cars per year .
and there 's still room for another production line for what the bavarian automaker describes as a “ high-volume ” model .
" before the crisis , the premium car market in the united states sold about two million vehicles annually , " reithofer said .
" we expect the market will probably reach that volume again in 2013 , so our target for us sales will be about 300,000 units . "
bmw 's plans have seen its south carolina workforce grow more than 25 percent as a result , from 6,000 to 7,600 employees .
regional leaders like senator lindsey graham are delighted .
" this is taking south carolina 's economy in a new direction – for every job created by bmw at this plant , three additional jobs are created to support this plant , " graham said .
" it 's hard to put a figure on it , but it 's meant the world to the state of south carolina . "
good reason to be there bmw is not the only german carmaker with a factory in the united states .
mercedes-benz builds its own suv range in tuscaloosa , alabama .
and volkswagen is constructing a massive production center in chattanooga , tennessee .
it 's no coincidence , analysts say , why these factories are located in the southern part of the us . because the southern states are not highly industrialized , their governments are offering high subsidies to attract new investment .
and the american autoworkers ' union – which is traditionally very strong in the north – does n't have a presence in the south , making it much easier for management to negotiate flexible shift times with the workers .
bildunterschrift : bmw will build its next-generation x3 in spartanburg , south carolina meanwhile , back in germany , unions are asking what the attractive conditions on the other side of the atlantic will mean for the future of bmw workers in germany .
could government subsidies see production of the x1 compact suv shift to south carolina as well ?
for now , bmw chief norbert reithofer says the answer is " no . "
" the main market for the x1 is europe , which is why we 're producing that model in leipzig , " reithofer said .
" and that is where it 's going to stay . "
analysts say that if bmw chooses to produce a fourth vehicle at spartanburg , it would likely be the carmaker 's best-seller 3-series compact .
the bavarian company has n't announced any concrete plans for further expansion , but a precedent already exists .
rival carmaker daimler announced last december that the new generation of mercedes c-class sedan would be built in alabama , ending the model 's assembly in the german town of sindelfingen after more than 25 years .

her crew has initially been denied a film permit in bosnia , but is confident the misunderstanding will soon be resolved . actress and director angelina jolie told critics of her new film , set on the eve of the 1992 bosnian war , that they were likely to approve of it once they 'd seen it . " there are many twists in the plot that address the sensitive nature of the relationship between the main characters and that will be revealed once the film is released , " she said thursday in a statement .
" my hope is that people will hold judgment until they have seen the film . " bosnian war victims railed the film when it was reported in local press that the story focused on the love relationship between a young muslim rape victim and her serb rapist . " among thousands of testimonies by women raped during the war , there is not a single one that tells of a love story between a victim and her rapist , " said bakira hasecic , head of the women victims of war association in sarajevo , who urged officials to ban the film 's production . jolie responded in her statement , conceding that " any dramatic interpretation will always fail those who have had a real experience . " bildunterschrift : jolie traveled to bosnia earlier this year to speak with people , like this woman , who had been displaced from their homes during the 1992-1995 war jolie reapplying for filming permit it was made public on wednesday that jolie 's film crew had been denied permission to shoot in bosnia .
they are currently filming in budapest and intended to continue work in bosnia in november .

tolerance and openness have marked the arrival of migrants , but the second generation will be the litmus test of successful integration . arabic is often heard as you walk through the streets of lavapies in central madrid . here , traditional tapas bars and bakeries mix with shisha joints , bangaldeshi corner shops and african restaurants .
one of these , doing a swift trade in spicy fish , is run by ibrahima ndiaye .
he has two children with his spanish wife and has enjoyed financial success .
he started out as a night club bouncer and now runs a boutique and this popular restaurant .
he is part of spain 's diverse muslim population , which now numbers around 1.3 million people - just under 3 percent of the overall population of 45 million .
his restaurant is in the same neighborhood where islamic fundamentalists planned the train bombing that killed 191 people march 2004 .
but he says there was no backlash locally .
" i have lived here for many years .
my spanish neighbors know me , they know how i live . it 's true that terrorism has created problems .
when you travel or go to a public place people do look at you now .
but i have n't suffered consequences in my neighborhood . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ibrahima ndiaye runs a successful restaurant in lavapies , madrid minimal conflict an annual survey of the muslim community suggests he is not alone .
some 70 percent of muslims say they feel at home here , and 80 percent say they feel they have adapted well to the spanish way of life .
islam is now the second largest religious domination , with a range of liberal , progressive branches represented , from the moroccan maliki school of thought to the tarikat sufi order from west africa .
spain transformed into a multicultural society with spectacular speed . and yet conflict between communities has been minimal according to madrid 's leading expert on muslim communities , berbabe lopez .
" the person who comes adapts , although they keep the trappings of their culture especially the older generation .
people do n't live in ghettos ; they are spread out all over the country , throughout neighborhoods , " he told deutsche welle .
" and i think that the spanish population - from whom you might have expected more racism - has really absorbed immigrants well .
in almost 15 years - there has been 12 percent immigration .
that has n't happened at such great speed in any other country in europe . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muslim migration has benefitted sweet teeth in spain pix and mix lopez says there is no spanish government ' model of integration ' .
instead , the ruling socialist party has borrowed different policies from other european countries .
the result is neither the assimilation prototype of france nor the multicultural model of the uk .
social integration has been aided by national politicians refusing to talk down muslims .
their response to the terrorist attack was the ' alliance of civilizations ' , a diplomatic push for cooperation between mediterranean cultures that drew on spain 's shared history with morocco .
at home this was mirrored by social cohesion programs .
but in parallel – and perhaps more importantly – there were regular amnesties for the immigrant workers who had powered spain 's construction boom .
in the last ten years over a million people who could prove they were working were granted legal status .
meanwhile all residents – even those without papers – have access to health and education .
and immigrants have not been blamed for the current crisis – even if this may cost votes .
emigrant hosts one reason for this inclusive approach is that spaniards emigrated in living memory . " when i was young we did n't have immigrants .
people here were the migrants .
people came back from germany and switzerland and england at summertime to spend the holidays here , " said ana planet , an arab and islamic studies professor at the madrid autonoma university .
spain also has a legal commitment to religious freedom , which is enshrined in its constitution .
this law tends to foils isolated attempts by town halls to ban veils .
and although they live in a mainly secular society , spaniards still recognize the importance of faith .
" we still consider religion as an important part of life and we are familiar with the this idea that ' you have your religion ' , ' you do that because of your religion ' , " said planet .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : impromptu mosques are springing up across the capital a marginalized group but it is not all positive .
ana explained that full social acceptance is still some way off . catalonia is seeing conflict emerge over the construction of mosques .
and a far-right party plans to field candidates in mayoral elections .
moroccan migrants , who make up around 80 percent of muslims here , tend to bear the brunt of prejudice , and fall within the most marginalized sector of society .
the crisis has left 30 percent out of work , compared to the 20 percent spanish average .
" bear in mind that we immigrants have always had the lowest-qualified jobs .
we do the jobs that no one else wants .
we have very casual contracts , in very bad conditions - you can be fired at any time and all this complicates the process of integration , " said kamal rahmouni from moroccan immigrant association atime .
but rahmouni ended on at upbeat note .
he feels the " complex , long road to integration " is generally going in the right direction .
at the crossroads spain passed the arrivals test but now faces the challenge of meshing these new identities with its own as the children of immigrants come of age .
they will not measure their lives against relatives from their parents ' country of origin but with their peers .
restaurant owner ibrahima -lrb- like 90 percent of muslims surveyed -rrb- believes islam is no barrier to being spanish .
he is convinced his children will have the same chances as classmates .
" i think that opportunities depend on your studies and the abilities of a person .
these days it does n't depend on a person 's color , " he said .
the crisis has made immigrants vulnerable .
but it has also brought down new arrivals by 43 percent .
this may create space for the government to make sure that the second generation of immigrants does enjoy equality of opportunity in the future .

french government officials still hope to derail the planned deal . earlier this month , international rail services operator eurostar defied opposition from the french government to become the first affiliate of french state-owned train operator sncf to order high-speeds trains made outside of france .
on thursday , the country 's transportation minister stepped up government opposition to the planned 600 million euro -lrb- $ 845 million -rrb- order for german trains by claiming that only those built by france 's alstom could use the channel tunnel . french transportation minister dominique bussereau called eurostar 's selection of siemens " null and void " in an interview with lci television .
the minister repeated government claims that siemens ' trains represent a safety risk - claims that both the channel tunnel intergovernmental commission and eurostar have rejected . " purely safety concerns " bussereau added that the french government 's concerns are purely safety related and not a question of choosing alstom or any other manufacturer .
among the government 's chief concerns : only trains with power units at the front or rear of trains , known as " concentrated traction " systems , could manage fires in tunnels safely .
alstom trains are built with such systems .
siemens ' trains , by comparison , have motors equipped beneath each coach , a design referred to as " distributed traction . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : siemens ' velaro train could soon be running alongside alstom 's agv in early september , transportation ministers from france and germany said they had reached an agreement to modify the safety rules that have , so far , kept non-eurostar trains out of the chunnel . the remarks from the french minister came one day after a siemens high-speed train entered the tunnel for the first time on a trial run - and are certain to increase european commission concern over the french 's government 's opposition to the order .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de retail -pipe- 15.10.2010 kaufhof department store partners with fashion designer joop großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kaufhof has fared better than karstadt in a difficult market kaufhof has maintained a stable position in a tough market environment .
but to further bolster its image and boost sales , the german department store chain has enlisted fashion designer wolfgang joop . galleria kaufhof , one of germany 's oldest department store chains , has found a new ally to help bolster its image : fashion designer wolfgang joop .
kaufhof has fared better than karstadt , another dominant department store that was rescued from insolvency in september by billionaire investor nicolas berggruen .
berggruen recently announced that karstadt will collaborate with californian designer max azria .
part of the reason why german department stores are grasping for outside help to attract customers is a changing commercial landscape that has challenged their very business model .
beyond the fact that inexpensive online offerings are grabbing business that has traditionally gone to department stores , experts say an increasing amount of smaller clothing stores housed in inner-city shopping centers are gaining market share .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang joop is likely to be actively involved with kaufhof a kaufhof spokeswoman said the company chose joop because he not only knows the german market but also brings international expertise with him , and also because he is creative and accessible .
the department store focuses on fashion , home and beauty , all areas of joop 's expertise , according to the spokeswoman .
“ a department store like galleria kaufhof also reflects the zeitgeist , and so we constantly have to be developing , ” she told deutsche welle .
“ we were n't just looking for a face .
instead , we were looking for someone who would really be a creative partner in developing new things . ”
targeted appeal needed according to commerzbank analyst juergen elfers , the current market situation requires department stores to do more than compete among each other .
“ department stores like kaufhof are no longer just in competition with one another , ” he told deutsche welle .
“ each new shopping center , which is built in inner cities , now has very many clothing stores as tenants .
and kaufhof has to compete with them , as well .
that 's why it 's important for them to enhance the image of their department stores , especially in major cities . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kaufhof 's lovro mandac and others have kept the company profitable unlike karstadt , kaufhof has remained profitable for a number of reasons , according to elfers .
kaufhof reduced its offerings in breadth and depth , tailoring what it does offer to satisfy demand . the company also effectively implemented its own brand of wares along with personnel management changes , which employees accepted .
“ karstadt has time and again had to use money to plug holes in its finances , ” elfers said .
“ the management has n't been able to fully concentrate on further developing the company , partly due to cash restraints . ”
no single approach boris hedde , director of the ifh market research institute in cologne , said kaufhof 's ability to tailor its offerings to specific clientele has been invaluable .
he pointed out that smaller non-chain department stores thrive in regions of germany to which they have adapted .
“ a comprehensive program wo n't work … we 've seen that from the past .
so a targeted approach is necessary , and the challenge will be to meet the needs of specific regions , ” he told deutsche welle .
“ the concept needs to start with the customer .
it will be interesting to see if joop can find an approach that brings together the individual target groups .
that remains to be seen . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the metro group plans to sell kaufhof hedde added that joop 's name is associated with “ high-value , design-orientation and modernity , ” and that he will likely “ want to set some things in motion rather than just having picked up a sponsorship . ”
metro to sell according to commerzbank 's elfers , the metro group is trying to sell kaufhof because of its international ambitions .
“ metro is very much internationally oriented , and department stores are difficult to internationalize , ” he said .
kaufhof 's turnover last year was roughly 3.5 billion euros .
the company employs some 25,000 people , and has about two million customers daily .
earlier this year there was speculation about a possible kaufhof-karstadt merger .

dw-world.de two german retail chains up for grabs at ‘ clearance sale ’ major department store chains karstadt and kaufhof are up for sale .

after a day of classes at the sorbonne university in paris , she comes home to an apartment near the seine river , where she lives with her parents .
the 19-year-old is earning an undergraduate degree in literature and communications and wants to become a television journalist .
amira 's parents immigrated to france from the north african country of tunisia , but she says she identifies more with france than with the country of her parents ' birth .
" since i 've been little , i 've felt completely french , " she says .
" in fact , i did n't realize that i was any different from the typical french person until i was 15 years old and a man insulted me on the street . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of muslim families settled in france amira says the man called her dirty and then threatened to hit her .
four years on she still gets upset talking about the incident .
since that day , amira says she has understood that she might face discrimination when looking for a job .
but she says she tries to keep a positive attitude .
generation gap sitting beside her mother on the couch , the teenager 's long , dark hair and dangling earrings are a contrast to her mother 's neatly tucked muslim headscarf .
amira 's mother , 48-year-old samira beshallah , works as a licensed nanny and takes care of three preschool-aged children .
samira says the parents do n't mind that she wears a headscarf when she takes their children out for walks or to play in the park and that wearing a headscarf in france is not problematic .
" i feel very , very good here .
i feel completely at home in france , " samira says .
" i raised my children here .
they have all done their studies .
i work , my husband is retired and i feel great . "

she says her parents do n't pressure her or their two sons to practice their faith , although she knows they expect her to marry a muslim .
amira says she has only one friend who wears a headscarf , but that most of her friends are n't even muslim .
she admits , however , that political talk over the last few years concerning islamist extremism and the banning of burqas has made her feel uneasy .
" it 's true that , these days , there 's a spotlight on muslims , " she says .
" i guess , since september 11 , people are asking ' who are muslims . '
people want to know who they are .
i guess it worries me a little .
but still , i do n't feel targeted .
we are against terrorism like everybody else . "
both amira and samira say the beshallah family and thousands of other muslims are completely integrated into the french way of life - proof that muslims can be productive members of western societies .

immigrant organizations warned that doing so would lead to " stigmatization . " state education ministers in germany have dismissed calls for making german the obligatory language in the country 's schoolyards .
the ministers ended a two-day meeting in berlin on friday saying a ban on immigrants speaking their mother tongue was impossible to enforce and would be counterproductive in efforts to integrate foreign children .
" there will be no steps taken to either ban foreign languages from schoolyards or to impose german as the only language that can be spoken there , " said ludwig spaenle , education minster of bavaria .
the meeting brought together ministers from all 16 german states .
education in germany is not centralized but the responsibly of the regional state governments .
rhineland palatinate education minister doris ahnen said banning foreign languages from schoolyards was " in no way suited " to solve integration problems .
her berlin colleague juergen zoellner added that while there was no doubt that learning german was very important for successful integration , it was " not very helpful " to outright ban children from speaking their mother tongue .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : integration commissioner maria boehmer is in favor of a ban a number of conservative politicians , among them maria boehmer , the government 's commissioner for integration , had previously called for german to be fixed as the obligatory language in schools to help integrate students from immigrant families .
immigrant organizations warn of ' stigmatization ' boehmer 's suggestion was strongly dismissed by immigrant organizations .
in a joint statement , they warned of a " stigmatization of the immigrant languages . "
instead , they argued , multilingualism was to be supported as a basis for cultural diversity in germany .
" focusing on the german language alone only draws attention from the real problems - such as the selective education system , discrimination and the high levels of unemployment among those with an immigrant background , " the statement added .
" banning the mother tongue is not acceptable , " said kenan kolat , head of the turkish community in germany , after talks with the conference of education ministers .
" it was extremely important to me that this unspeakable discussion about german in schoolyards was stopped , " he added .
" this is a good signal for our cooperation in future . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the number of foreign children dropouts is down 30 percent school dropouts on the decline kolat was part of a delegation of immigrant organizations who met with the ministers on friday to discuss progress on a three-year old action plan to improve education for foreign children .
the plan includes , among other things , state-funded programs to foster children 's language skills , as well as measures to stop the rise in the number of children leaving school without any degree .
the average rate of school dropouts among foreign children is more than twice as high as that of german students - but the situation has markedly improved .
" we 've reduced the number of foreign children dropping out of school by up to 30 percent in the last three years , " berlin education minister zoellner said .
both the ministers and the immigrant groups demanded better funding for education programs from the central government .
more all-day schools and better language education in childcare facilities have proven successful in improving immigrants ' educational chances , they said .

jakub blaszczykowski netted the first goal , with nuri sahin scoring the winner in injury time . former champions league winners borussia dortmund have defeated struggling cologne 2-1 away from home in the pouring rain in friday night 's bundesliga clash .
the winner came through nuri sahin in the 91st minute after the midfielder found the back of the net from close range after a goalmouth scramble .
dortmund seized momentum from the outset and should have taken the lead on 17 minutes when a cross from sahin found the head of striker lucas barrios , but the paraguayan put the ball over with the goal at his mercy .
the black and yellow from dortmund did n't have to wait much longer , however , when three minutes later japan international shinji kagawa played the ball into the cologne box where barrios headed it onto the knee of pole jakub blaszczykowski , nicknamed kuba , from which it bounced over the goal line .
the goal sparked cologne into action , but dortmund keeper roman weidenfeller denied attempts from portuguese midfielder petit and german international lukas podolski .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sahin 's goal came late in the game cologne were finally rewarded for their efforts when they tied the match up with eight minutes remaining after a poor dortmund clearance fell to podolski on the edge of the area .
weidenfeller had no chance against his left-footed shot , which clocked at 110 kilometers per hour .
but just as cologne thought they had secured a much-needed point , dortmund struck back with the late winner through sahin .
the win moves dortmund to equal top of the bundesliga , along with mainz , on 21 points , while cologne languish in 16th place and risk dropping another position if either schalke or stuttgart come away with all three points in their saturday game against each other .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de education -pipe- 15.10.2010 german students cross atlantic for a different approach to education großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : choosing a university is only the first step in the 200 years since its inception , berlin 's humboldt university has frequently fallen prey to the reform whims of education ministers .
in recent years , that has meant moving closer to the us college model . with its vast marble staircase and lofty ceiling , the foyer of the humboldt in central berlin is an imposing space .
it has an air of prestige and learnedness about it .
but that is not all it has . in one corner there is something quite different : the university store , which is filled with shelves and rails of brightly colored clothes bearing the humboldt insignia .
one t-shirt boldly states " my mother wanted me to go to harvard , my father wanted me to go to cambridge , but i wanted to go my way " - that way being the humboldt . and while the university , which ranks among the top 10 in the country , is undoubtedly popular , some 8,000 germans are currently studying at colleges in the united states .
that is fewer than are on programs in the netherlands and austria , but still a large number given the prohibitively expensive fees synonymous with an american university education . ursula hans , director of the international office at the humboldt , said one of the major benefits of the us system is that it not only teaches its students , but is also willing to learn from them . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german professors are often responsible for too many students " this is a university system that for 200 years or more has been taking tuition from its students , and that has translated into services , and institutes and departments that are well planned and set up , " hans told deutsche welle . unbeatable resources it 's a view shared by german students who have experienced the american system first-hand .
ines eben von racknitz went to stanford university on a scholarship to study chinese , religion and comparative literature .
she was so taken with the whole experience that she said she probably would have done it even if it had meant leaving college with a mountain of debts .
she was amazed at the resources and the attitudes of those on campus . " everyone wants to help you to get a job afterwards ; people are looking after you , " said von racknitz .
" and you have amazing archives and libraries which are open all the time , and professors have open doors , so are always available . " but what stood out to her perhaps more than anything was the enthusiasm with which the academic staff went about their own work and encouraged her in hers . " they are delighted in what they do , they have passion and they are glowing from it , " she continued .
" if you are in academia , you are abandoning riches and fame , so you need to be passionate and delighted ; that is what they are , and it 's very inspiring . " overworked multi-taskers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stanford university : not just a pretty face although von racknitz was at pains to stress that the time she spent at german universities also provided her with an excellent education , she said professors here seem to lack that american elan which can be an invaluable source of inspiration and motivation for students .
the reason for that , experts agree , is that teaching staff at colleges in germany face a much heavier workload than their counterparts across the atlantic . while professors in the us can generally leave the administrative aspect of their work to someone else and concentrate fully on their teaching and research , in germany that is a luxury reserved for professors at well-financed masters programs .
the rest are left to multi-task , which , according to ursula hans , is a problem both for the teaching and the student body . " how can you talk to your advisor if he is responsible for 20 other people ? "
hans asked .
" and how is the advisor going to make time to take care of your student or phd needs if he is involved in other commissions and doing research and serving on other committees ? " aiming high barbara von bechtolsheim , who got her phd at stanford and has taught at colleges in both the states and germany , agrees that german staff are overloaded , but believes that german students could be pushed harder . " i came to stanford with an ma in german studies from munich and i had studied with one of the best professors there , " she said .
" however when i came to stanford , i learned i did n't know much in terms of academic standards . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no matter where you study , there 's no way to avoid hitting the books her four years in california were hard work , but they broadened her horizons and her expectations of herself .
they also left her in no doubt that a us university education has more to offer than a german one .
apart from the resources and the support on offer to students there , she says the first two years in which all undergraduates are given a solid grounding in history , literature and culture , are absolutely invaluable . " it 's a very good idea even if you want to major in math or geology that you have such a broad mind and reference points , " she said .
" in germany , you can go to medical school and if you have n't learned it at home or school , medicine and physics and chemistry is all that is on your mind . " but ursula hans , herself a former us college student , is not convinced of the merit of that approach .
she believes one of the greatest strengths of the german system is that it does not bombard young people with facts , but teaches them to think for themselves . as far as she is concerned , a university education from germany is of an extremely high standard .
she says if there is one thing colleges in germany could perhaps still learn from their american counterparts , it would be the fine art of marketing an identity . if the items for sale in the humboldt store are anything to go by , that lesson has already been taken on board . author : tamsin walker editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 15.10.2010 ahead of match day eight , dw pundits are seeing stars großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if you look very hard , you might just find this constellation - promise this season , the dw sports team are predicting the results of all bundesliga matches .
after the last match day 's battering , our pundits hope they 've got their heads back for match day eight . after a two-week international break , match day eight is in ascendance and the dw bundesliga pundits are back at it .
after a poor set of predictions on the last match day -lrb- see below -rrb- , they 've resolved to look to the stars for guidance .
this week 's predictor hopes for the best , but has a ready excuse should things go awry : he 's a gemini , and can blame it on that other guy inhabiting his body .
friday , october 15 cologne-dortmund dortmund have gone from strength to strength this season , getting good individual performances from many a member of their young squad - and all the while , they 've been working for each other on the pitch .
cologne have been mostly hideous , managing a fortunate win over st. pauli and two backs-to-the-wall draws .
fan favorite and mercurial boy prince lukas podolski sounded off this week that his beloved fc was adrift , and hinted he would look for the exit if things did n't turn around soon .
off you go , then .
cologne deserve to be at the table 's foot as richly as dortmund do near the top , and the billygoats should get flogged on friday .
dortmund 3-0 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : van bommel and his , erm , passion will be missing form this match saturday , october 16 bayern-hanover the opening weeks of the season for hanover were surprisingly good - the team busted loose to a 13-point haul in their first six games .
they 're still in third place , but last week 's limp home loss to st. pauli highlighted their weakness : without a full-strength strike partnership of mohamad abdelloue and didier ya konan , hanover are far from dangerous .
ya konan was out two weeks ago , this time it 's abdelloue .
bayern do have injury problems of their own -lrb- diego contento , franck ribery and arjen robben are still out , and miroslav klose , mark van bommel and ivica olic picked up injuries on international duty -rrb- , but they should have more than enough quality to take this one .
bayern 3-1 schalke-stuttgart the bundesliga 's two most hapless sides were all set to square off in a contest to decide who would see their name inserted into a flurry of “ -lsb- insert club name here -rsb- in crisis ” headlines , and whose coach would see a greater flurry of speculation surrounding his future .
then stuttgart went and spoiled the fun , firing christian gross before the match had even been played .
probably for the best , really .
though there is n't much to separate these two in terms of form -lrb- both have been very poor -rrb- , schalke are at home and have a slightly better squad .
thus they should win .
schalke 2-1 werder bremen-freiburg freiburg have been puzzlingly strong this season , defying the odds to win four of their first seven -lrb- including two away -rrb- and have risen all the way to fifth place .
bremen , meanwhile , have been in a funk .
it 's been down to a mixture of injuries to key players like naldo , per mertesacker and claudio pizarro and the kind of sloppy defending bremen have become famous for in recent years .
now mertesacker is back in the starting line-up , pizarro might be able to play as a substitute , and sporting director klaus allof 's -lrb- possibly illegal -rrb- stunt of docking the players ' pay after the 4-1 loss to hanover in week six seems to have done the trick .
bremen could easily have won on the last matchday in leverkusen , and should win easily at home on saturday .
bremen 2-0 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : settle down , adam - your hat-trick came against san marino mainz-hamburg the little club that could may lose some steam from its engine following the international break , what with their young squad having had ample time to let success go to their heads .
then again striker adam szalai , who 's just hit four goals in two games for hungary , might just come back to mainz on a justified high that will fire him up for more .
hamburg , for their part , showed signs of living up to their considerable promise in a gutsy win over kaiserslautern in match day seven , and will be boosted by paolo guerrero 's return from injury .
on the other hand , they are still hobbled by 10 -lrb- ! -rrb- other players from the first-team squad laid low at the moment .
i smell a draw .
draw 2-2 st. pauli-nuremberg a tough one to call , in that not much separates these two sides .
both have punched above the weight of their rather thin squads thus far , nuremberg through a very organized defense , pauli through fitness and a willingness to fight to the very end of a match .
it 's been seven home games since hamburg 's skull-and-crossbones appreciation society has seen their team get a win , and just as many matches since der club has won away .
may the streaks continue .
draw 1-1 wolfsburg-leverkusen both these sides have n't got out of the gate as strongly as they 'd have liked , but neither the pharmaceuticals -lrb- in 4th place on 12 points -rrb- or the wolves -lrb- 8th place , 10pts . -rrb- are so far off the pace for panic to have set in , and in fact are on good form .
that 's in part because both are starting to get good production from strikers who had looked out of it at the season 's opening - wolfsburg 's grafite and leverkusen 's eren derdiyok .
i might have been inclined to go with the home side , but they will be missing goalkeeper diego benaglio , so a draw looks a good bet .
draw 2-2 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eintracht 's ultras are a real sharing , caring group of guys sunday , october 17 kaiserslautern-frankfurt it 's an intriguing match-up between a team that started poorly and may be beginning to fade -lrb- k-town -rrb- , and another that stumbled at first but that now might be finding its sea legs -lrb- eintracht -rrb- .
but nobody 's talking about the game , they 're talking about the potential for fan trouble .
these two clubs are not natural derby rivals , but they are historically the two strongest in their region , and have a history .
eintracht 's ultras , considered by many to be the nastiest " fans " in the bundesliga , certainly are trumpeting this as a trip to see hated rivals , virtually promising violence in internet forums .
much as i 'd like to see them disappointed , i see frankfurt taking the points .
frankfurt 2-1 hoffenheim-moenchengladbach gladbach lead the league by a comfortable margin in goals allowed with 20 , but showed signs in their 1-1 match day seven draw against the often potent wolfsburg that they might have found their way .
hoffenheim , meanwhile , have had a rough few weeks , losing at mainz and bayern -lrb- which is acceptable -rrb- , and drawing away to cologne -lrb- which is n't -rrb- .
a bright spot , however , has been the ice-cold free-kicks of their young icelandic newcomer , gylfi sigurdsson .
he 's scored them in substitute appearances thus far , and now he 's likely to get the start .
i like him to score , and for the hoff to win .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : focus : midterm elections in the us eu and us ' must work together , ' says diplomat obama seeks to mobilize disappointed voters foreign donations spark row ahead of us midterm elections shift to the right in midterm elections could affect us foreign policy development policy -pipe- 15.10.2010 obama to give development a larger role in us foreign policy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama announced america 's first global development policy president obama has declared development assistance vital to us national security interests .
some humanitarian organizations believe the president 's policy will end a growing trend toward the militarization of aid . for the first time in american history , a us administration has issued a global development policy .
president obama declared during his recent speech before the un millennium goals summit that development is not strictly an end in itself .
instead , it is a component of a wider national security strategy that defends us interests abroad . " my national security strategy recognizes development not only as a moral imperative , but a strategic and economic imperative , " obama said before the un general assembly .
in an era when the defense department is playing an increased role in development , some humanitarian organizations believe the president 's new policy will reverse the growing trend toward the militarization of aid .
new conflicts , new threats for decades , the us had trained its military to deter a conventional soviet military advance into western europe .
but in a wave of unexpected political upheaval , the eastern bloc imploded without a shot being fired .
as a consequence , political leaders in washington questioned the utility of bloated defense budgets in the belief that the " peace dividend " should free up resources for civilian ends .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : humanitarian interventions are designed to protect civilians although the cold war had ended , the peace dividend proved premature . the media broadcast images of social collapse from the battlefields of bosnia and somalia , documenting a growing trend toward war fought within nations instead of between them .
" the end of the cold war to some degree meant the lid came off that had suppressed internal conflicts in many countries , and as a result you then see the breakdown in weaker or failed states , " mark schneider , senior vice president of the international crisis group , told deutsche welle .
" you see the break down of institutions and internal conflicts grow and multiply , " schneider said . " it 's in that context that the united states and the european union view the consequences of failed states and instability as a potential for conflict that can affect their own citizens and interests . "
job of civilians or soldiers ?
as the us military intervened to contain these brutal civil wars , it began to adopt a new humanitarian mandate with the goal of protecting human life instead of destroying it .
the enemy was no longer a uniformed army , but instead the political and economic instability that had led to ethnic cleansing in bosnia and famine in somalia .
commanders on the ground recognized that a process of social collapse could not be reversed by airstrikes .
ultimately , long-term economic and political development would secure victory .
in an ad-hoc fashion , soldiers started taking on traditional civilian roles , acting as policemen , diplomats and social workers .
the front line had vanished , and the difference between military and development objectives had become muddled .
" meanwhile , more and more responsibilities have been delegated to the military , " david bosold , an expert on human security at the german council on foreign relations , told deutsche welle .
" since there is n't a stable security situation , sometimes it 's simply not possible to find development organizations that are willing to go there .
the main problem is that there 's nobody except for the military that can make an impact . "
military taking the lead after september 11 , the convergence of development and defense responsibilities took a new turn .
a transnational network of terrorists had launched an attack on the us from afghanistan , underscoring the dangers of failed states .
in response , policymakers in washington turned to development as a way to defeat terrorism by combating the poverty that leads to social instability and extremism .
the bush administration institutionalized this view by designating three pillars of american foreign policy : defense , diplomacy and development - the 3ds .
however , development agencies such as usaid remained poorly resourced while the defense department 's budget rapidly expanded .
as a result , the military started conducting its own development work .
the goal was not to altruistically satisfy human need , but to advance american interests and win the war on terror .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the military has become increasingly involved in humanitarian and development assistance " the politics of it are rather stark , " noam unger , the director of the foreign assistance reform program with the brookings institution , told deutsche welle .
" the defense industry and the department of defense have assets placed in every political district across the united states . "
" there are bases , manufacturers , suppliers and those are tied to political interests at the local level that feed up to capitol hill and effect funding , " unger continued . " the state department and usaid operate overseas and so the constituency is actually different and that affects the politics . "
development as a weapon of war as the us military struggled to contain growing insurgencies in afghanistan and iraq , military commanders looked for quick ways to win hearts and minds .
in response , the concept of the provincial reconstruction team -lrb- prt -rrb- was introduced .
prts would apply the 3ds by bringing military and civilian agencies together to conduct development work in regions at risk for extremism . the military , however , increasingly became the face of development to the local population .
" it creates a degree of confusion , " gregory adams , director of aid effectiveness at oxfam america , told deutsche welle .
" they -lrb- local population -rrb- do rightly question our intent when they see soldiers involved in this work .
it does n't necessarily increase their trust of troops to a large degree , but it does reduce their trust in civilians . "
the defense department was using development as a weapon of war .
as a consequence , aid agencies voiced concern that a militarization of development was taking place which would undermine their humanitarian objectives .
in search of balance by declaring development vital to us national security , obama 's new strategy - at least in word - makes development indispensible to achieving foreign policy goals .
development becomes important in its own right , not just as an instrument of defense department objectives .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us policy now views development as vital to the national interest " there 's a lot of people involved in development who argue for development for development 's sake , " beth ellen cole , an expert on post-conflict and peacekeeping activities with the united states peace institute , told deutsche welle .
" but in a resource-constrained environment where every dollar is under scrutiny , you have to make a case why development ... is important , " cole said . " if you 're going to elevate development , you have to make a strong case that it 's important to national security . "
the rebalancing of development and defense may signal a change in the way american foreign policy is conducted .
instead of planning how to win wars , policymakers in washington may start planning how to prevent them from ever breaking out .
and an institutional bias toward prevention could reduce the demand for military involvement in development work .
" if the president is going to be serious about the 3ds that define our national security strategy and how we pursue our foreign policy mission , then development needs to have a voice at the table for how those decisions are made , " adams said .
" if you do n't have a development voice at the table you 're basically deciding from the beginning that you 're not going to take a development approach . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de education -pipe- 15.10.2010 berlin 's oldest university faces new challenges as it turns 200 großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wilhelm von humboldt greets students at the entrance to the university berlin 's humboldt university is best known for having an education model unifying research and teaching and its slew of nobel prize-winning alumni .
these days , the institution is fighting for funds and recognition . the imposing facade of the humboldt university is located in the heart of berlin 's historic mitte district - within a stone 's throw of the german historical museum and the state opera on the unter den linden boulevard .
a statue of founder wilhelm von humboldt looms high at the main entrance .
it shows the prussian education reformer and statesman sitting in an armchair , proudly gazing down at the students milling around .
his expression seems to demand respect for his achievements .
and wilhelm von humboldt had every reason to be proud of the institution established in 1810 .
known then as the berlin university , it aimed for the first time to unify instruction with research .
humboldt maintained that universities should n't just teach but also be centers of cutting-edge research .
it was a radically new idea in germany 's education landscape at the time and the humboldt university became a model for european and western universities , earning it the informal title " the mother of all modern universities . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the humboldt university has more than 34,000 students ' humboldt legend ' draws thousands that founding spirit still holds true until today , according to the current president of the university , christoph markschies .
" in 1809 , the university had neither tables nor chairs and the walls were full of mould .
the city of berlin did n't have much money .
now we have a bit more - at least we have tables and chairs and we 've managed to renovate the building , " markschies said .
" but this founding spirit - attempting things against all odds - still prevails . "
despite near-empty state coffers in 1810 , wilhelm von humboldt managed to get the first semester at the university going - with 256 students and 52 lecturers . from the outset , the university featured the four classical faculties of law , medicine , philosophy and theology .
partly under the influence of famous naturalist alexander von humboldt , a brother of founder wilhelm , the university later pioneered the introduction of several new disciplines .
today , it offers more than 240 programs ranging from african studies to dentistry .
some 13 percent of the university 's 34,000 students come from more than 100 nations .
uwe-jens nagel , the university 's vice president , said the " legendary reputation " of the humboldt university still draws thousands around the world .
" the university has translated wilhelm von humboldt 's ideal of education into the 21st century , " nagel said .
" it means that at our university there is no research without teaching and the other way around . "
the university has produced 29 nobel prize laureates since its founding 200 years ago .
they include albert einstein , max planck and fritz haber , who did some of their scientific work at the university .
other illustrious figures such as statesman otto von bismarck , poet heinrich heine , political theorist karl marx and writer kurt tucholsky , also enrolled as students at the university .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the book burnings near the humboldt university were a low-point in the institution 's history dark and shameful chapter until 1933 , the humboldt university was one of the leading universities in germany .
but things began to change under what was becoming an atmosphere of repression and brutality .
under the nazis , jewish and communist students were kicked out of the university .
the infamous nazi-organized book burnings on may 10 , 1933 at the nearby opernplatz square -lrb- now known as babelplatz -rrb- further plunged the university into a dark abyss .
this is how german author erich kaestner later remembered the incident .
" i stood in front of the university , wedged between students in sa uniforms , the torch-bearers of the nation .
i saw our books being flung into the roaring flames and heard the corny tirades of the wily liar -lsb- propaganda minister -rsb- josef goebbels .
an atmosphere of mourning hung over the city , " kaestner wrote .
the shameful period came to an end with the conclusion of world war two in 1945 , but the university then lurched into a new crisis .
the cold war led to a growing communist influence at the university .
between 1945 and 1948 , students who demanded a free university in the spirit of wilhelm von humboldt were arrested , deported and even executed .
in west berlin , students finally set up the free university with help from the united states .
communist east germany officially renamed its berlin university in 1949 as the humboldt university - but without the ideals championed by wilhelm von humboldt .
new challenges bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the humboldt university is struggling to attract funds and talent since german reunification in 1990 , humboldt 's founding philosophy is once again at the forefront of the university 's agenda .
but at the same time , new pressures are making it difficult for the university to live up to the ideals of giving equal importance to teaching and research .
new higher education reforms in germany aimed at encouraging students to get into universities and out into the job market at an earlier age have overstretched the university 's resources .
" we need more staff but that 's not going to happen any time soon in a poor city-state like berlin , " nagel said .
he added that the university was now thinking of a new mentoring concept to improve teaching .
" students would be trained in such a way that they could work as tutors .
they would n't get paid but would instead receive study points . "
the humboldt university also hopes to get millions in state funds by vying for the german government 's " excellence initiative " aimed at improving and encouraging high-level research and competition at the country 's higher-education institutions .
in 2007 , however , the humboldt university failed to earn the title of " elite university . "
if it fails yet again to secure those much-needed funds , the university could lose out in the global race to attract and nurture top talent .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de balkans -pipe- 15.10.2010 serbian ultranationalists struggle against a changing homeland großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the football match was later called off because of the riots serbian ultranationalists who recently sparked football match riots in italy are trying to destabilize serbia , analysts say .
however , their voices are not representative of a country moving increasingly towards europe . it was more than brute violence : the recent heavy rioting at a european football match between italy and serbia in genoa on tuesday could not be put down solely to the actions of a few hooligans .
this tainting of the serbian national team was the result of ultranationalist groups who were bent on venting their discontent with the direction their country is taking , say experts from the brussels think-tank the centre for european policy studies -lrb- ceps -rrb- .
this small part of the serbian population feels unfairly treated and betrayed by the new orientation taken by their country towards europe . this underlying anger has used as its trigger the difficult economic conditions currently affecting serbia , as well as the high levels of unemployment - which stands at around 20 percent - and the still-raw memories of the breakup of yugoslavia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police detained 17 people after the riots the ultranationalists have seemingly set themselves the goal of making as much noise as possible , but , according to the ceps , this does not mean the movement enjoys support from the broader serbian community .
" serbia was and still is a traditional and orthodox country , where the influence of the church and history is big , " explains georg dura , an analyst with ceps .
" but above all , serbia must make peace with the past in order to move on with the future .
the majority of serbs agree with this . "
eye to europe dura says that only one minority within serbia was represented by the ultranationalists , who , he adds , are increasingly " losing ground . "
" they have now realized this and are reacting this way as a result , " dura says .
" they feel their leaders have sold them out by , for example , taking a more moderate approach towards -lsb- the breakaway region of -rsb- kosovo in recent months . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : serbia has not yet recognized kosovo as an independent state the ceps analyst says the government in belgrade has actively been trying to show the european union that it values the fundamental tenants of a free society such as tolerance and democracy through cooperation over kosovo , and by publicly supporting a recent gay pride parade .
traditionalist and nationalist groups in serbia have rejected both these overtures categorically .
according to ceps , the story of serbia over recent years has been unique , and has left the country deeply divided into backward-orientated and forward-looking factions .
for this reason , it is difficult to compare the country of around seven million with other european states .
" as time has passed opposition has disappeared , and the population has become more open and tolerant .
these have all been lessons learned on the way to the eu .
a society must be open , the citizens must have the freedom of speech , " he says , adding that social changes take time , especially when dealing with post-communist states like serbia .
eu support ' integral ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anti-gay protestors clashed with serbian riot police dura says that the european union has supported serbia in the days following the football riots in italy , and must continue to help the country on its path towards eu integration .
" the good relations with the eu have not been clouded by these events .
but the eu must give serbia membership candidate status to immediately shore up their support for democratic change in the country , " dura says .
" the eu must now support serbia politically and economically , " says the analyst , adding that this will provide serbian youth with a brighter future , and encourage the government to continue to make progress on social and political reforms .

however , their voices are not representative of a country moving increasingly towards europe . it was more than brute violence : the recent heavy rioting at a european football match between italy and serbia in genoa on tuesday could not be put down solely to the actions of a few hooligans .
this tainting of the serbian national team was the result of ultranationalist groups who were bent on venting their discontent with the direction their country is taking , say experts from the brussels think-tank the centre for european policy studies -lrb- ceps -rrb- .
this small part of the serbian population feels unfairly treated and betrayed by the new orientation taken by their country towards europe . this underlying anger has used as its trigger the difficult economic conditions currently affecting serbia , as well as the high levels of unemployment - which stands at around 20 percent - and the still-raw memories of the breakup of yugoslavia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police detained 17 people after the riots the ultranationalists have seemingly set themselves the goal of making as much noise as possible , but , according to the ceps , this does not mean the movement enjoys support from the broader serbian community .
" serbia was and still is a traditional and orthodox country , where the influence of the church and history is big , " explains georg dura , an analyst with ceps .
" but above all , serbia must make peace with the past in order to move on with the future .
the majority of serbs agree with this . "
eye to europe dura says that only one minority within serbia was represented by the ultranationalists , who , he adds , are increasingly " losing ground . "
" they have now realized this and are reacting this way as a result , " dura says .
" they feel their leaders have sold them out by , for example , taking a more moderate approach towards -lsb- the breakaway region of -rsb- kosovo in recent months . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : serbia has not yet recognized kosovo as an independent state the ceps analyst says the government in belgrade has actively been trying to show the european union that it values the fundamental tenants of a free society such as tolerance and democracy through cooperation over kosovo , and by publicly supporting a recent gay pride parade .
traditionalist and nationalist groups in serbia have rejected both these overtures categorically .
according to ceps , the story of serbia over recent years has been unique , and has left the country deeply divided into backward-orientated and forward-looking factions .
for this reason , it is difficult to compare the country of around seven million with other european states .
" as time has passed opposition has disappeared , and the population has become more open and tolerant .
these have all been lessons learned on the way to the eu .
a society must be open , the citizens must have the freedom of speech , " he says , adding that social changes take time , especially when dealing with post-communist states like serbia .
eu support ' integral ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anti-gay protestors clashed with serbian riot police dura says that the european union has supported serbia in the days following the football riots in italy , and must continue to help the country on its path towards eu integration .
" the good relations with the eu have not been clouded by these events .
but the eu must give serbia membership candidate status to immediately shore up their support for democratic change in the country , " dura says .
" the eu must now support serbia politically and economically , " says the analyst , adding that this will provide serbian youth with a brighter future , and encourage the government to continue to make progress on social and political reforms .

while muslims still face discrimination , many have successfully integrated and are a part of french society , which now has western europe 's largest muslim population .
amira beshallah is one such example of a successfully integrated second-generation french muslim .
after a day of classes at the sorbonne university in paris , she comes home to an apartment near the seine river , where she lives with her parents .
the 19-year-old is earning an undergraduate degree in literature and communications and wants to become a television journalist .
amira 's parents immigrated to france from the north african country of tunisia , but she says she identifies more with france than with the country of her parents ' birth .
" since i 've been little , i 've felt completely french , " she says .
" in fact , i did n't realize that i was any different from the typical french person until i was 15 years old and a man insulted me on the street . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of muslim families settled in france amira says the man called her dirty and then threatened to hit her .
four years on she still gets upset talking about the incident .
since that day , amira says she has understood that she might face discrimination when looking for a job .
but she says she tries to keep a positive attitude .
generation gap sitting beside her mother on the couch , the teenager 's long , dark hair and dangling earrings are a contrast to her mother 's neatly tucked muslim headscarf .
amira 's mother , 48-year-old samira beshallah , works as a licensed nanny and takes care of three preschool-aged children .
samira says the parents do n't mind that she wears a headscarf when she takes their children out for walks or to play in the park and that wearing a headscarf in france is not problematic .
" i feel very , very good here .
i feel completely at home in france , " samira says .
" i raised my children here .
they have all done their studies .
i work , my husband is retired and i feel great . "
a new direction bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france has recently passed a ban on the full-face islamic veil amira , meanwhile , says she is not religious and would never wear a headscarf , although she does refrain from eating and drinking during the islamic fasting month of ramadan .
she says her parents do n't pressure her or their two sons to practice their faith , although she knows they expect her to marry a muslim .
amira says she has only one friend who wears a headscarf , but that most of her friends are n't even muslim .
she admits , however , that political talk over the last few years concerning islamist extremism and the banning of burqas has made her feel uneasy .
" it 's true that , these days , there 's a spotlight on muslims , " she says .
" i guess , since september 11 , people are asking ' who are muslims . '
people want to know who they are .
i guess it worries me a little .
but still , i do n't feel targeted .
we are against terrorism like everybody else . "
both amira and samira say the beshallah family and thousands of other muslims are completely integrated into the french way of life - proof that muslims can be productive members of western societies .

tolerance and openness have marked the arrival of migrants , but the second generation will be the litmus test of successful integration . arabic is often heard as you walk through the streets of lavapies in central madrid . here , traditional tapas bars and bakeries mix with shisha joints , bangaldeshi corner shops and african restaurants .
one of these , doing a swift trade in spicy fish , is run by ibrahima ndiaye .
he has two children with his spanish wife and has enjoyed financial success .
he started out as a night club bouncer and now runs a boutique and this popular restaurant .
he is part of spain 's diverse muslim population , which now numbers around 1.3 million people - just under 3 percent of the overall population of 45 million .
his restaurant is in the same neighborhood where islamic fundamentalists planned the train bombing that killed 191 people march 2004 .
but he says there was no backlash locally .
" i have lived here for many years .
my spanish neighbors know me , they know how i live . it 's true that terrorism has created problems .
when you travel or go to a public place people do look at you now .
but i have n't suffered consequences in my neighborhood . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ibrahima ndiaye runs a successful restaurant in lavapies , madrid minimal conflict an annual survey of the muslim community suggests he is not alone .
some 70 percent of muslims say they feel at home here , and 80 percent say they feel they have adapted well to the spanish way of life .
islam is now the second largest religious domination , with a range of liberal , progressive branches represented , from the moroccan maliki school of thought to the tarikat sufi order from west africa .
spain transformed into a multicultural society with spectacular speed . and yet conflict between communities has been minimal according to madrid 's leading expert on muslim communities , berbabe lopez .
" the person who comes adapts , although they keep the trappings of their culture especially the older generation .
people do n't live in ghettos ; they are spread out all over the country , throughout neighborhoods , " he told deutsche welle .
" and i think that the spanish population - from whom you might have expected more racism - has really absorbed immigrants well .
in almost 15 years - there has been 12 percent immigration .
that has n't happened at such great speed in any other country in europe . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muslim migration has benefitted sweet teeth in spain pix and mix lopez says there is no spanish government ' model of integration ' .
instead , the ruling socialist party has borrowed different policies from other european countries .
the result is neither the assimilation prototype of france nor the multicultural model of the uk .
social integration has been aided by national politicians refusing to talk down muslims .
their response to the terrorist attack was the ' alliance of civilizations ' , a diplomatic push for cooperation between mediterranean cultures that drew on spain 's shared history with morocco .
at home this was mirrored by social cohesion programs .
but in parallel – and perhaps more importantly – there were regular amnesties for the immigrant workers who had powered spain 's construction boom .
in the last ten years over a million people who could prove they were working were granted legal status .
meanwhile all residents – even those without papers – have access to health and education .
and immigrants have not been blamed for the current crisis – even if this may cost votes .
emigrant hosts one reason for this inclusive approach is that spaniards emigrated in living memory . " when i was young we did n't have immigrants .
people here were the migrants .
people came back from germany and switzerland and england at summertime to spend the holidays here , " said ana planet , an arab and islamic studies professor at the madrid autonoma university .
spain also has a legal commitment to religious freedom , which is enshrined in its constitution .
this law tends to foils isolated attempts by town halls to ban veils .
and although they live in a mainly secular society , spaniards still recognize the importance of faith .
" we still consider religion as an important part of life and we are familiar with the this idea that ' you have your religion ' , ' you do that because of your religion ' , " said planet .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : impromptu mosques are springing up across the capital a marginalized group but it is not all positive .
ana explained that full social acceptance is still some way off . catalonia is seeing conflict emerge over the construction of mosques .
and a far-right party plans to field candidates in mayoral elections .
moroccan migrants , who make up around 80 percent of muslims here , tend to bear the brunt of prejudice , and fall within the most marginalized sector of society .
the crisis has left 30 percent out of work , compared to the 20 percent spanish average .
" bear in mind that we immigrants have always had the lowest-qualified jobs .
we do the jobs that no one else wants .
we have very casual contracts , in very bad conditions - you can be fired at any time and all this complicates the process of integration , " said kamal rahmouni from moroccan immigrant association atime .
but rahmouni ended on at upbeat note .
he feels the " complex , long road to integration " is generally going in the right direction .
at the crossroads spain passed the arrivals test but now faces the challenge of meshing these new identities with its own as the children of immigrants come of age .
they will not measure their lives against relatives from their parents ' country of origin but with their peers .
restaurant owner ibrahima -lrb- like 90 percent of muslims surveyed -rrb- believes islam is no barrier to being spanish .
he is convinced his children will have the same chances as classmates .
" i think that opportunities depend on your studies and the abilities of a person .
these days it does n't depend on a person 's color , " he said .
the crisis has made immigrants vulnerable .
but it has also brought down new arrivals by 43 percent .
this may create space for the government to make sure that the second generation of immigrants does enjoy equality of opportunity in the future .

french government officials still hope to derail the planned deal . earlier this month , international rail services operator eurostar defied opposition from the french government to become the first affiliate of french state-owned train operator sncf to order high-speeds trains made outside of france .
on thursday , the country 's transportation minister stepped up government opposition to the planned 600 million euro -lrb- $ 845 million -rrb- order for german trains by claiming that only those built by france 's alstom could use the channel tunnel . french transportation minister dominique bussereau called eurostar 's selection of siemens " null and void " in an interview with lci television .
the minister repeated government claims that siemens ' trains represent a safety risk - claims that both the channel tunnel intergovernmental commission and eurostar have rejected . " purely safety concerns " bussereau added that the french government 's concerns are purely safety related and not a question of choosing alstom or any other manufacturer .
among the government 's chief concerns : only trains with power units at the front or rear of trains , known as " concentrated traction " systems , could manage fires in tunnels safely .
alstom trains are built with such systems .
siemens ' trains , by comparison , have motors equipped beneath each coach , a design referred to as " distributed traction . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : siemens ' velaro train could soon be running alongside alstom 's agv in early september , transportation ministers from france and germany said they had reached an agreement to modify the safety rules that have , so far , kept non-eurostar trains out of the chunnel . the remarks from the french minister came one day after a siemens high-speed train entered the tunnel for the first time on a trial run - and are certain to increase european commission concern over the french 's government 's opposition to the order .
the trip was part of a series of tests that germany 's deutsche bahn is conducting before it launches its planned service between frankfurt and london . competition for equipment and operations eurostar has decided to overhaul its existing equipment and buy new trains for its routes , which run between london and the continental cities of paris and brussels . the 10 trains that siemens is to deliver will be capable of reaching speeds of 320 kilometers per hour and carry more than 900 passengers , compared to 750 passengers in existing trains .
the new trains will be interoperable , meaning that they can operate across europe 's high-speed rail network . competition is heating up not only on the equipment side but on the operator side , too .
the eurostar fleet overhaul comes amid increasing competition from rival operators to use the channel tunnel .
the european union supports allowing other operators to use cross-border track , provided they fulfill all specifications .
currently , only the eurostar fleet meets the specifications required to use the tunnel . eurostar is 55 percent owned by sncf -lrb- societe national des chemins de fer francais -rrb- .
london & continental railways has a 40 percent stake while belgian railway operator sncb -lrb- societe nationale des chemins de fer belges -rrb- owns the remaining 5 percent . author : john blau -lrb- reuters , afp -rrb- editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

immigrant organizations warned that doing so would lead to " stigmatization . " state education ministers in germany have dismissed calls for making german the obligatory language in the country 's schoolyards .
the ministers ended a two-day meeting in berlin on friday saying a ban on immigrants speaking their mother tongue was impossible to enforce and would be counterproductive in efforts to integrate foreign children .
" there will be no steps taken to either ban foreign languages from schoolyards or to impose german as the only language that can be spoken there , " said ludwig spaenle , education minster of bavaria .
the meeting brought together ministers from all 16 german states .
education in germany is not centralized but the responsibly of the regional state governments .
rhineland palatinate education minister doris ahnen said banning foreign languages from schoolyards was " in no way suited " to solve integration problems .
her berlin colleague juergen zoellner added that while there was no doubt that learning german was very important for successful integration , it was " not very helpful " to outright ban children from speaking their mother tongue .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : integration commissioner maria boehmer is in favor of a ban a number of conservative politicians , among them maria boehmer , the government 's commissioner for integration , had previously called for german to be fixed as the obligatory language in schools to help integrate students from immigrant families .
immigrant organizations warn of ' stigmatization ' boehmer 's suggestion was strongly dismissed by immigrant organizations .
in a joint statement , they warned of a " stigmatization of the immigrant languages . "
instead , they argued , multilingualism was to be supported as a basis for cultural diversity in germany .
" focusing on the german language alone only draws attention from the real problems - such as the selective education system , discrimination and the high levels of unemployment among those with an immigrant background , " the statement added .
" banning the mother tongue is not acceptable , " said kenan kolat , head of the turkish community in germany , after talks with the conference of education ministers .
" it was extremely important to me that this unspeakable discussion about german in schoolyards was stopped , " he added .
" this is a good signal for our cooperation in future . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the number of foreign children dropouts is down 30 percent school dropouts on the decline kolat was part of a delegation of immigrant organizations who met with the ministers on friday to discuss progress on a three-year old action plan to improve education for foreign children .
the plan includes , among other things , state-funded programs to foster children 's language skills , as well as measures to stop the rise in the number of children leaving school without any degree .
the average rate of school dropouts among foreign children is more than twice as high as that of german students - but the situation has markedly improved .
" we 've reduced the number of foreign children dropping out of school by up to 30 percent in the last three years , " berlin education minister zoellner said .
both the ministers and the immigrant groups demanded better funding for education programs from the central government .
more all-day schools and better language education in childcare facilities have proven successful in improving immigrants ' educational chances , they said .

the all-pervasive violence has not only caused physical wounds . there is a part of kabul , the capital of afghanistan , which afghan taxi drivers normally try to avoid .
when foreigners ask them , " are there terrorists ? " , their simple answer is : " no , junkies " .
junkies were a totally unknown phenomenon in afghanistan until quite recently , which is why most people are at a loss to know how to deal with the growing number of addicts .
in a way , it is the same with traumatized or depressed people .
the society at large and even their own relatives mostly react to mentally disturbed people with a lack of understanding or even with shame .
bildunterschrift : female drug addicts at one of the few treatment centers in kabul hiding away the patients many try to cover up the problem , says ahmad shafiq behrozian from the western city of herat .
" we afghans have no idea how to interact with mentally ill persons .
mostly we treat them as dangerous and crazy individuals .
sometimes they are chained or locked away in a separate room by their own relatives . "
doctors reckon that the growing number of the mentally ill is due to a number of reasons : war , experience of violence and subsequent traumata .
in addition , poverty and malnutrition can also contribute to a disease , because physically healthy persons are more resilient when they experience emotional stress .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : afghanistan 's hospitals are ill equipped to treat psychiatric patients unbearable stress when the stress becomes unbearable or , as in the situation of permanent conflict in afghanistan , when it piles up and people have no chance of getting it out of their system , they can experience a breakdown .
tragically , this changed behavior is normally not recognized as an illness , explains fatema jafari , a member of the provincial council in herat .
" you can easily tell that there is a high number of mental disorders here in herat , simply from the high incidence of self-immolations , violent attacks in public as well as domestic violence .
but nobody is interested in the real causes , no one talks about it .
more than 60 percent of the population have mental problems . "
lack of psychiatric services making it worse , not even doctors diagnose the illness at times .
muhammad ghulam ali from herat says , " we have a mental patient in our family .
we took him to see several doctors , but to no avail .
he ca n't control himself and is violent .
only when we keep absolute silence in the room , he can relax to some extent . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : children are especially vulnerable in this situation , qualified doctors and especially psychiatrists are badly needed , as are psychiatric wards in the hospitals , says peter graaff from the world health organization , the who .
" and yet , investment in mental health services is very limited at best . "
for example , there are currently only about 200 beds for psychiatric services in the country . " and there are no services targeting children specifically , " he adds . in fact , it is the children who would need medical care most urgently .

jakub blaszczykowski netted the first goal , with nuri sahin scoring the winner in injury time . former champions league winners borussia dortmund have defeated struggling cologne 2-1 away from home in the pouring rain in friday night 's bundesliga clash .
the winner came through nuri sahin in the 91st minute after the midfielder found the back of the net from close range after a goalmouth scramble .
dortmund seized momentum from the outset and should have taken the lead on 17 minutes when a cross from sahin found the head of striker lucas barrios , but the paraguayan put the ball over with the goal at his mercy .
the black and yellow from dortmund did n't have to wait much longer , however , when three minutes later japan international shinji kagawa played the ball into the cologne box where barrios headed it onto the knee of pole jakub blaszczykowski , nicknamed kuba , from which it bounced over the goal line .
the goal sparked cologne into action , but dortmund keeper roman weidenfeller denied attempts from portuguese midfielder petit and german international lukas podolski .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sahin 's goal came late in the game cologne were finally rewarded for their efforts when they tied the match up with eight minutes remaining after a poor dortmund clearance fell to podolski on the edge of the area .
weidenfeller had no chance against his left-footed shot , which clocked at 110 kilometers per hour .
but just as cologne thought they had secured a much-needed point , dortmund struck back with the late winner through sahin .
the win moves dortmund to equal top of the bundesliga , along with mainz , on 21 points , while cologne languish in 16th place and risk dropping another position if either schalke or stuttgart come away with all three points in their saturday game against each other .

some humanitarian organizations believe the president 's policy will end a growing trend toward the militarization of aid . for the first time in american history , a us administration has issued a global development policy .
president obama declared during his recent speech before the un millennium goals summit that development is not strictly an end in itself .
instead , it is a component of a wider national security strategy that defends us interests abroad . " my national security strategy recognizes development not only as a moral imperative , but a strategic and economic imperative , " obama said before the un general assembly .
in an era when the defense department is playing an increased role in development , some humanitarian organizations believe the president 's new policy will reverse the growing trend toward the militarization of aid .
new conflicts , new threats for decades , the us had trained its military to deter a conventional soviet military advance into western europe .
but in a wave of unexpected political upheaval , the eastern bloc imploded without a shot being fired .
as a consequence , political leaders in washington questioned the utility of bloated defense budgets in the belief that the " peace dividend " should free up resources for civilian ends .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : humanitarian interventions are designed to protect civilians although the cold war had ended , the peace dividend proved premature . the media broadcast images of social collapse from the battlefields of bosnia and somalia , documenting a growing trend toward war fought within nations instead of between them .
" the end of the cold war to some degree meant the lid came off that had suppressed internal conflicts in many countries , and as a result you then see the breakdown in weaker or failed states , " mark schneider , senior vice president of the international crisis group , told deutsche welle .
" you see the break down of institutions and internal conflicts grow and multiply , " schneider said . " it 's in that context that the united states and the european union view the consequences of failed states and instability as a potential for conflict that can affect their own citizens and interests . "
job of civilians or soldiers ?
as the us military intervened to contain these brutal civil wars , it began to adopt a new humanitarian mandate with the goal of protecting human life instead of destroying it .
the enemy was no longer a uniformed army , but instead the political and economic instability that had led to ethnic cleansing in bosnia and famine in somalia .
commanders on the ground recognized that a process of social collapse could not be reversed by airstrikes .
ultimately , long-term economic and political development would secure victory .
in an ad-hoc fashion , soldiers started taking on traditional civilian roles , acting as policemen , diplomats and social workers .
the front line had vanished , and the difference between military and development objectives had become muddled .
" meanwhile , more and more responsibilities have been delegated to the military , " david bosold , an expert on human security at the german council on foreign relations , told deutsche welle .
" since there is n't a stable security situation , sometimes it 's simply not possible to find development organizations that are willing to go there .
the main problem is that there 's nobody except for the military that can make an impact . "
military taking the lead after september 11 , the convergence of development and defense responsibilities took a new turn .
a transnational network of terrorists had launched an attack on the us from afghanistan , underscoring the dangers of failed states .
in response , policymakers in washington turned to development as a way to defeat terrorism by combating the poverty that leads to social instability and extremism .
the bush administration institutionalized this view by designating three pillars of american foreign policy : defense , diplomacy and development - the 3ds .
however , development agencies such as usaid remained poorly resourced while the defense department 's budget rapidly expanded .
as a result , the military started conducting its own development work .
the goal was not to altruistically satisfy human need , but to advance american interests and win the war on terror .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the military has become increasingly involved in humanitarian and development assistance " the politics of it are rather stark , " noam unger , the director of the foreign assistance reform program with the brookings institution , told deutsche welle .
" the defense industry and the department of defense have assets placed in every political district across the united states . "
" there are bases , manufacturers , suppliers and those are tied to political interests at the local level that feed up to capitol hill and effect funding , " unger continued . " the state department and usaid operate overseas and so the constituency is actually different and that affects the politics . "
development as a weapon of war as the us military struggled to contain growing insurgencies in afghanistan and iraq , military commanders looked for quick ways to win hearts and minds .
in response , the concept of the provincial reconstruction team -lrb- prt -rrb- was introduced .
prts would apply the 3ds by bringing military and civilian agencies together to conduct development work in regions at risk for extremism . the military , however , increasingly became the face of development to the local population .
" it creates a degree of confusion , " gregory adams , director of aid effectiveness at oxfam america , told deutsche welle .
" they -lrb- local population -rrb- do rightly question our intent when they see soldiers involved in this work .
it does n't necessarily increase their trust of troops to a large degree , but it does reduce their trust in civilians . "
the defense department was using development as a weapon of war .
as a consequence , aid agencies voiced concern that a militarization of development was taking place which would undermine their humanitarian objectives .
in search of balance by declaring development vital to us national security , obama 's new strategy - at least in word - makes development indispensible to achieving foreign policy goals .
development becomes important in its own right , not just as an instrument of defense department objectives .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us policy now views development as vital to the national interest " there 's a lot of people involved in development who argue for development for development 's sake , " beth ellen cole , an expert on post-conflict and peacekeeping activities with the united states peace institute , told deutsche welle .
" but in a resource-constrained environment where every dollar is under scrutiny , you have to make a case why development ... is important , " cole said . " if you 're going to elevate development , you have to make a strong case that it 's important to national security . "
the rebalancing of development and defense may signal a change in the way american foreign policy is conducted .
instead of planning how to win wars , policymakers in washington may start planning how to prevent them from ever breaking out .
and an institutional bias toward prevention could reduce the demand for military involvement in development work .
" if the president is going to be serious about the 3ds that define our national security strategy and how we pursue our foreign policy mission , then development needs to have a voice at the table for how those decisions are made , " adams said .
" if you do n't have a development voice at the table you 're basically deciding from the beginning that you 're not going to take a development approach . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 15.10.2010 stuttgart need a reality check as gross takes the fall großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : holding gross accountable ignores deeper problems at vfb stuttgart packed off its third coach in three seasons when christian gross was shown the door after a woeful start to the season .
but the club 's position is unlikely to improve until deeper problems are resolved . given that vfb stuttgart never really get going in the bundesliga until after christmas , the sacking of christian gross after just seven games could be construed as jumping the gun slightly .
in the last few seasons , the opening months of the league campaign have always been a slog for vfb , only for the team to discover form and stability in the latter stages .
look at markus babbel 's tenure as coach : stuttgart was wallowing in the lower reaches of the bundesliga in autumn 2008 under armin veh , the coach who had won them the title two seasons prior .
veh was sacked , babbel took over and at the season 's end stuttgart had qualified for the champions league .
then again , look at markus babbel 's tenure as coach in another light .
the following season , babbel oversaw a similarly slow start to that which eventually undermined veh .
the former stuttgart defender was out of the door before the winter break with the team in the relegation zone with only two wins from 15 games and the fans carrying burning torches and threatening to storm the gates of the club - figuratively at least .
enter christian gross .
the swiss coach of great intellect and renown took over from babbel with stuttgart third from bottom and led them to a sixth place finish and qualification to the europa league .
vfb must have hoped that gross was the man to finally find a cure for the split personality which consistently renders the team useless in the run up to winter and sublime by the time spring had sprung .
the fact that stuttgart has endured an even worse start to this season than at any time in the previous three suggests that gross was equally at a loss to reverse the bi-polar nature of the team .
with just one win from seven games , gross is now looking for new employment while stuttgart 's management is once again left looking for answers .
stuttgart need to look beyond the coach bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : something is very wrong at the heart of the swabian club one yo-yo season can be excused .
two can be shrugged off as a coincidence .
three in a row becomes an alarming trend .
the fact that three different coaches , of varying style and experience , have failed to get a grip on stuttgart 's baffling schizophrenia suggests that something is rotten in the state of baden-wuerttemberg .
with assistant manager jens keller installed as caretaker boss for saturday 's basement showdown with fellow underachievers schalke 04 , the question is whether vfb will continue to believe that the choice of coach is at the heart of their seasonal problems , or if the powers-that-be will look closer to home for the source of the rising damp which is threatening to engulf the club .
at first glance , it appears that the club is set to don the blinkers again .
gross had shown " no signs of finding a solution " for the numerous problems plaguing the team , said sporting director fredi bobic , a statement which suggests vfb still believe that the quality of coaching is still the issue .
perhaps it would be more useful to look at the lack of depth and quality of the squad , the allocation of revenue and the boardroom rivalries which are unsettling the whole club .
thin squad , fat stadium investment stuttgart had a busy summer in the transfer market but it was the exit door which saw the most action .
real madrid snapped up sami khedira after his world cup exploits , veteran goalkeeper jens lehmann retired , and a host of adequate but uninspiring squad members -lrb- sebastian rudy , martin lanig , roberto hilbert , and so on -rrb- all trundled off to pastures new .
while many were unlikely to be missed , they did leave vfb short on numbers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stuttgart failed to find a quality replacement for khedira " in each of the past two years , vfb have sold their best player , " clark whitney , a bundesliga expert at goal.com international , told deutsche welle . " in 2009 , it was mario gomez and more recently , it was sami khedira .
khedira and gomez were club icons .
even when out of form , gomez was worth a goal every other game .
khedira , with his tremendous work rate and skill in transition , was a perfect fit for vfb .
pavel pogrebnyak and zdravko kuzmanovic just have n't been good enough as replacements . "
considering the acquistions stuttgart brought in to replace them , simple mathematics showed that stuttgart was in the minus column in terms of quality and cover before the season even began .
despite bringing in johan audel , philipp degen , mauro camoranesi and christian gentner , none of these players have made much impact .
audel and degen have yet to play for the club since arriving due to injuries while the italian camoranesi has found it hard to bed in .
gentner , brought back from a loan spell at vfl wolfsburg , has struggled for form and appears too inexperienced to step into the shoes of khedira and run the midfield .
some blame should then be passed onto fredi bobic , who may be a former club favorite due to his past efforts on the pitch but is still hugely inexperienced in his role as sporting director .
giving bobic the responsibility to conduct transfers has backfired and clashes between bobic and gross regularly brought up the differences between the two men over their demands in the transfer market .
bricks before legs ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stuttgart 's current crop of players do n't make the grade in his defense , bobic has been struggling himself to loosen the club 's purse strings , held possessively by a board committed to remodeling stuttgart 's home ground , the mercedes benz arena .
christian gross told the local stuttgarter zeitung in the days before his sacking that it was clear " the club 's priority has been pointed toward finishing stadium renovations . "
gross never said where he thought the 22 million euros accrued from last season 's champions league campaign went to .
perhaps he did n't need to - it was obvious this was a team built on the cheap .
" stuttgart 's decline has resulted primarily from a disconnection between the club 's sporting and financial goals , " said clark whitney .
" between the sales of gomez and khedira , stuttgart made nearly 50 million euros .
during the same period of time , stuttgart has been reluctant to reinvest .
if their 3.5 million-euro offer for mladen petric was n't laughable , their 1 million-euro maximum bid for andre ayew certainly was .
to further the comedy , stuttgart sent 20-year old rising star sebastian rudy to hoffenheim , and signed 33-year old mauro camoranesi as his replacement . " " naturally , one is led to ask what happened to vfb 's transfer earnings , as well as the 22 million euros earned in the 2009-10 champions league , " whitney added .
" the answer is quite a shock .
delusions of grandeur have prompted the management to invest 73.2 million euros in stadium renovations and expansion .
of course , the mercedes-benz arena could use a bit of refurbishing .
still , you have to wonder whether the management expect 60,000 fans to show up for a second division match . "
failure of leadership to blame the club 's hierarchy is to open another can of worms .
it is no simple matter to say that the board members responsible for the revenue at the club are wholly responsible for draining funds from the playing squad and pumping the euros into the crumbling stands and infrastructure .
in fact , it has been alleged that rivalries in the boardroom have been exacerbated over just this matter .
rather than the suits being all-for-one , one-for-all in their determination to give an ailing team a beautiful home , it appears that club president erwin staudt and chief financial office ulrich ruf were in favor of investing more in the squad this summer , but that their moves to divert cash budgeted for renovation into team building had been vetoed by chairman of the supervisory board dieter hundt .
it ’ s an accusation the hundt has strongly denied , arguing that the club had spent 12.5 million euros on new players , the fifth-highest figure in the bundesliga .

" it certainly sounds like stuttgart 's problems run far deeper than the inability to find a coach with the know-how to rescue the club from its momentary malaise .
time will tell if those with the power to save the club will realize in time what those problems are , and manage to solve them .

but the club 's position is unlikely to improve until deeper problems are resolved . given that vfb stuttgart never really get going in the bundesliga until after christmas , the sacking of christian gross after just seven games could be construed as jumping the gun slightly .
in the last few seasons , the opening months of the league campaign have always been a slog for vfb , only for the team to discover form and stability in the latter stages .
look at markus babbel 's tenure as coach : stuttgart was wallowing in the lower reaches of the bundesliga in autumn 2008 under armin veh , the coach who had won them the title two seasons prior .
veh was sacked , babbel took over and at the season 's end stuttgart had qualified for the champions league .
then again , look at markus babbel 's tenure as coach in another light .
the following season , babbel oversaw a similarly slow start to that which eventually undermined veh .
the former stuttgart defender was out of the door before the winter break with the team in the relegation zone with only two wins from 15 games and the fans carrying burning torches and threatening to storm the gates of the club - figuratively at least .
enter christian gross .
the swiss coach of great intellect and renown took over from babbel with stuttgart third from bottom and led them to a sixth place finish and qualification to the europa league .
vfb must have hoped that gross was the man to finally find a cure for the split personality which consistently renders the team useless in the run up to winter and sublime by the time spring had sprung .
the fact that stuttgart has endured an even worse start to this season than at any time in the previous three suggests that gross was equally at a loss to reverse the bi-polar nature of the team .
with just one win from seven games , gross is now looking for new employment while stuttgart 's management is once again left looking for answers .
stuttgart need to look beyond the coach bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : something is very wrong at the heart of the swabian club one yo-yo season can be excused .
two can be shrugged off as a coincidence .
three in a row becomes an alarming trend .
the fact that three different coaches , of varying style and experience , have failed to get a grip on stuttgart 's baffling schizophrenia suggests that something is rotten in the state of baden-wuerttemberg .
with assistant manager jens keller installed as caretaker boss for saturday 's basement showdown with fellow underachievers schalke 04 , the question is whether vfb will continue to believe that the choice of coach is at the heart of their seasonal problems , or if the powers-that-be will look closer to home for the source of the rising damp which is threatening to engulf the club .
at first glance , it appears that the club is set to don the blinkers again .
gross had shown " no signs of finding a solution " for the numerous problems plaguing the team , said sporting director fredi bobic , a statement which suggests vfb still believe that the quality of coaching is still the issue .
perhaps it would be more useful to look at the lack of depth and quality of the squad , the allocation of revenue and the boardroom rivalries which are unsettling the whole club .
thin squad , fat stadium investment stuttgart had a busy summer in the transfer market but it was the exit door which saw the most action .
real madrid snapped up sami khedira after his world cup exploits , veteran goalkeeper jens lehmann retired , and a host of adequate but uninspiring squad members -lrb- sebastian rudy , martin lanig , roberto hilbert , and so on -rrb- all trundled off to pastures new .
while many were unlikely to be missed , they did leave vfb short on numbers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stuttgart failed to find a quality replacement for khedira " in each of the past two years , vfb have sold their best player , " clark whitney , a bundesliga expert at goal.com international , told deutsche welle . " in 2009 , it was mario gomez and more recently , it was sami khedira .
khedira and gomez were club icons .
even when out of form , gomez was worth a goal every other game .
khedira , with his tremendous work rate and skill in transition , was a perfect fit for vfb .
pavel pogrebnyak and zdravko kuzmanovic just have n't been good enough as replacements . "
considering the acquistions stuttgart brought in to replace them , simple mathematics showed that stuttgart was in the minus column in terms of quality and cover before the season even began .
despite bringing in johan audel , philipp degen , mauro camoranesi and christian gentner , none of these players have made much impact .
audel and degen have yet to play for the club since arriving due to injuries while the italian camoranesi has found it hard to bed in .
gentner , brought back from a loan spell at vfl wolfsburg , has struggled for form and appears too inexperienced to step into the shoes of khedira and run the midfield .
some blame should then be passed onto fredi bobic , who may be a former club favorite due to his past efforts on the pitch but is still hugely inexperienced in his role as sporting director .
giving bobic the responsibility to conduct transfers has backfired and clashes between bobic and gross regularly brought up the differences between the two men over their demands in the transfer market .
bricks before legs ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stuttgart 's current crop of players do n't make the grade in his defense , bobic has been struggling himself to loosen the club 's purse strings , held possessively by a board committed to remodeling stuttgart 's home ground , the mercedes benz arena .
christian gross told the local stuttgarter zeitung in the days before his sacking that it was clear " the club 's priority has been pointed toward finishing stadium renovations . "
gross never said where he thought the 22 million euros accrued from last season 's champions league campaign went to .
perhaps he did n't need to - it was obvious this was a team built on the cheap .
" stuttgart 's decline has resulted primarily from a disconnection between the club 's sporting and financial goals , " said clark whitney .

while muslims still face discrimination , many have successfully integrated and are a part of french society , which now has western europe 's largest muslim population .
amira beshallah is one such example of a successfully integrated second-generation french muslim .
after a day of classes at the sorbonne university in paris , she comes home to an apartment near the seine river , where she lives with her parents .
the 19-year-old is earning an undergraduate degree in literature and communications and wants to become a television journalist .
amira 's parents immigrated to france from the north african country of tunisia , but she says she identifies more with france than with the country of her parents ' birth .
" since i 've been little , i 've felt completely french , " she says .
" in fact , i did n't realize that i was any different from the typical french person until i was 15 years old and a man insulted me on the street . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of muslim families settled in france amira says the man called her dirty and then threatened to hit her .
four years on she still gets upset talking about the incident .
since that day , amira says she has understood that she might face discrimination when looking for a job .
but she says she tries to keep a positive attitude .
generation gap sitting beside her mother on the couch , the teenager 's long , dark hair and dangling earrings are a contrast to her mother 's neatly tucked muslim headscarf .
amira 's mother , 48-year-old samira beshallah , works as a licensed nanny and takes care of three preschool-aged children .
samira says the parents do n't mind that she wears a headscarf when she takes their children out for walks or to play in the park and that wearing a headscarf in france is not problematic .
" i feel very , very good here .
i feel completely at home in france , " samira says .
" i raised my children here .
they have all done their studies .
i work , my husband is retired and i feel great . "
a new direction bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france has recently passed a ban on the full-face islamic veil amira , meanwhile , says she is not religious and would never wear a headscarf , although she does refrain from eating and drinking during the islamic fasting month of ramadan .
she says her parents do n't pressure her or their two sons to practice their faith , although she knows they expect her to marry a muslim .
amira says she has only one friend who wears a headscarf , but that most of her friends are n't even muslim .
she admits , however , that political talk over the last few years concerning islamist extremism and the banning of burqas has made her feel uneasy .
" it 's true that , these days , there 's a spotlight on muslims , " she says .
" i guess , since september 11 , people are asking ' who are muslims . '
people want to know who they are .
i guess it worries me a little .
but still , i do n't feel targeted .
we are against terrorism like everybody else . "
both amira and samira say the beshallah family and thousands of other muslims are completely integrated into the french way of life - proof that muslims can be productive members of western societies .

generation gap sitting beside her mother on the couch , the teenager 's long , dark hair and dangling earrings are a contrast to her mother 's neatly tucked muslim headscarf .
amira 's mother , 48-year-old samira beshallah , works as a licensed nanny and takes care of three preschool-aged children .
samira says the parents do n't mind that she wears a headscarf when she takes their children out for walks or to play in the park and that wearing a headscarf in france is not problematic .
" i feel very , very good here .
i feel completely at home in france , " samira says .
" i raised my children here .
they have all done their studies .
i work , my husband is retired and i feel great . "
a new direction bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france has recently passed a ban on the full-face islamic veil amira , meanwhile , says she is not religious and would never wear a headscarf , although she does refrain from eating and drinking during the islamic fasting month of ramadan .
she says her parents do n't pressure her or their two sons to practice their faith , although she knows they expect her to marry a muslim .
amira says she has only one friend who wears a headscarf , but that most of her friends are n't even muslim .
she admits , however , that political talk over the last few years concerning islamist extremism and the banning of burqas has made her feel uneasy .
" it 's true that , these days , there 's a spotlight on muslims , " she says .
" i guess , since september 11 , people are asking ' who are muslims . '
people want to know who they are .
i guess it worries me a little .
but still , i do n't feel targeted .
we are against terrorism like everybody else . "
both amira and samira say the beshallah family and thousands of other muslims are completely integrated into the french way of life - proof that muslims can be productive members of western societies .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 15.10.2010 ahead of match day eight , dw pundits are seeing stars großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if you look very hard , you might just find this constellation - promise this season , the dw sports team are predicting the results of all bundesliga matches .
after the last match day 's battering , our pundits hope they 've got their heads back for match day eight . after a two-week international break , match day eight is in ascendance and the dw bundesliga pundits are back at it .
after a poor set of predictions on the last match day -lrb- see below -rrb- , they 've resolved to look to the stars for guidance .
this week 's predictor hopes for the best , but has a ready excuse should things go awry : he 's a gemini , and can blame it on that other guy inhabiting his body .
friday , october 15 cologne-dortmund dortmund have gone from strength to strength this season , getting good individual performances from many a member of their young squad - and all the while , they 've been working for each other on the pitch .
cologne have been mostly hideous , managing a fortunate win over st. pauli and two backs-to-the-wall draws .
fan favorite and mercurial boy prince lukas podolski sounded off this week that his beloved fc was adrift , and hinted he would look for the exit if things did n't turn around soon .
off you go , then .
cologne deserve to be at the table 's foot as richly as dortmund do near the top , and the billygoats should get flogged on friday .
dortmund 3-0 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : van bommel and his , erm , passion will be missing form this match saturday , october 16 bayern-hanover the opening weeks of the season for hanover were surprisingly good - the team busted loose to a 13-point haul in their first six games .
they 're still in third place , but last week 's limp home loss to st. pauli highlighted their weakness : without a full-strength strike partnership of mohamad abdelloue and didier ya konan , hanover are far from dangerous .
ya konan was out two weeks ago , this time it 's abdelloue .
bayern do have injury problems of their own -lrb- diego contento , franck ribery and arjen robben are still out , and miroslav klose , mark van bommel and ivica olic picked up injuries on international duty -rrb- , but they should have more than enough quality to take this one .
bayern 3-1 schalke-stuttgart the bundesliga 's two most hapless sides were all set to square off in a contest to decide who would see their name inserted into a flurry of “ -lsb- insert club name here -rsb- in crisis ” headlines , and whose coach would see a greater flurry of speculation surrounding his future .
then stuttgart went and spoiled the fun , firing christian gross before the match had even been played .
probably for the best , really .
though there is n't much to separate these two in terms of form -lrb- both have been very poor -rrb- , schalke are at home and have a slightly better squad .
thus they should win .
schalke 2-1 werder bremen-freiburg freiburg have been puzzlingly strong this season , defying the odds to win four of their first seven -lrb- including two away -rrb- and have risen all the way to fifth place .
bremen , meanwhile , have been in a funk .
it 's been down to a mixture of injuries to key players like naldo , per mertesacker and claudio pizarro and the kind of sloppy defending bremen have become famous for in recent years .
now mertesacker is back in the starting line-up , pizarro might be able to play as a substitute , and sporting director klaus allof 's -lrb- possibly illegal -rrb- stunt of docking the players ' pay after the 4-1 loss to hanover in week six seems to have done the trick .
bremen could easily have won on the last matchday in leverkusen , and should win easily at home on saturday .
bremen 2-0 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : settle down , adam - your hat-trick came against san marino mainz-hamburg the little club that could may lose some steam from its engine following the international break , what with their young squad having had ample time to let success go to their heads .
then again striker adam szalai , who 's just hit four goals in two games for hungary , might just come back to mainz on a justified high that will fire him up for more .
hamburg , for their part , showed signs of living up to their considerable promise in a gutsy win over kaiserslautern in match day seven , and will be boosted by paolo guerrero 's return from injury .
on the other hand , they are still hobbled by 10 -lrb- ! -rrb- other players from the first-team squad laid low at the moment .
i smell a draw .
draw 2-2 st. pauli-nuremberg a tough one to call , in that not much separates these two sides .
both have punched above the weight of their rather thin squads thus far , nuremberg through a very organized defense , pauli through fitness and a willingness to fight to the very end of a match .
it 's been seven home games since hamburg 's skull-and-crossbones appreciation society has seen their team get a win , and just as many matches since der club has won away .
may the streaks continue .
draw 1-1 wolfsburg-leverkusen both these sides have n't got out of the gate as strongly as they 'd have liked , but neither the pharmaceuticals -lrb- in 4th place on 12 points -rrb- or the wolves -lrb- 8th place , 10pts . -rrb- are so far off the pace for panic to have set in , and in fact are on good form .
that 's in part because both are starting to get good production from strikers who had looked out of it at the season 's opening - wolfsburg 's grafite and leverkusen 's eren derdiyok .
i might have been inclined to go with the home side , but they will be missing goalkeeper diego benaglio , so a draw looks a good bet .
draw 2-2 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eintracht 's ultras are a real sharing , caring group of guys sunday , october 17 kaiserslautern-frankfurt it 's an intriguing match-up between a team that started poorly and may be beginning to fade -lrb- k-town -rrb- , and another that stumbled at first but that now might be finding its sea legs -lrb- eintracht -rrb- .
but nobody 's talking about the game , they 're talking about the potential for fan trouble .
these two clubs are not natural derby rivals , but they are historically the two strongest in their region , and have a history .
eintracht 's ultras , considered by many to be the nastiest " fans " in the bundesliga , certainly are trumpeting this as a trip to see hated rivals , virtually promising violence in internet forums .
much as i 'd like to see them disappointed , i see frankfurt taking the points .
frankfurt 2-1 hoffenheim-moenchengladbach gladbach lead the league by a comfortable margin in goals allowed with 20 , but showed signs in their 1-1 match day seven draw against the often potent wolfsburg that they might have found their way .
hoffenheim , meanwhile , have had a rough few weeks , losing at mainz and bayern -lrb- which is acceptable -rrb- , and drawing away to cologne -lrb- which is n't -rrb- .
a bright spot , however , has been the ice-cold free-kicks of their young icelandic newcomer , gylfi sigurdsson .
he 's scored them in substitute appearances thus far , and now he 's likely to get the start .
i like him to score , and for the hoff to win .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de aviation -pipe- 15.10.2010 lufthansa investigates the science of airline food großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the final fraunhofer airline food test is in december in a series of tests , german scientists take on how flavor profiles change while in-flight .
so far , lufthansa has decided to make their bread rolls a little more salty . why do so many people order tomato juice aboard airlines ?
over the last several months , the fraunhofer institute for building physics , in holzkirchen , just south of munich , has been trying to find the answer to this question - particulary given that lufthansa serves approximately 1.7 million liters of tomato juice each year .
more broadly , through a series of tests , researchers are trying to determine how flight conditions change the way food and drinks taste while in-flight .
the institute is conducting this research on behalf of lufthansa , which is one of the few airlines in the world that is currently undertaking airplane cuisine research - the final round in the testing series is due to be held in december .
reduced taste perception so far , scientists do know that once at a cruising altitude of approximately 10,000 meters -lrb- roughly 30,000 feet -rrb- , the cabin humidity drops by 15 percent , and the lowered air pressure forces bodily fluids upwards .
with less humidity , people get thirsty more easily as there is less moisture in their throat , which also slows the transport of odors to the brains smell and taste receptors .
" it 's like having a cold , " said florian mayer , the research team 's leader .
" when you have a cold all your nasal mucous swells up and you have reduced odor and taste perception . "
mayer and his team are conducting their research in a 30-meter -lrb- approximately 90 feet -rrb- low pressure tubular chamber , built around the front section of a decommissioned airbus a310 .
" we have typical temperatures of 20 degrees celsius -lrb- 68 degrees farenheit -rrb- , " mayer said .
" we have humidity of around 10 to 15 percent and we have a high air exchange rate – all the environmental conditions that are typical for flying aircraft , " mayer said .
" and what 's important we reduce the pressure from normal sea level or here it on ground it is about 950 -lsb- hectopascals -rsb- .
but onboard during cruise you have a normal pressure of around 750 - 800 -lsb- hectopascals -rsb- . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 30-meter low pressure chamber surrounds the front section of the plane inside , everything imitates a normal flight – the seats vibrate , the noise is the same and the human test subjects sniff , sip and munch their way through a long menu of airline food – some merely to taste of specific compounds , others similar to what is served in flight .
stronger spices work better so far , the researchers have already discovered that meals have to be more strongly flavored than those served on the ground .
" spicy food like thai and indian food goes very well because the spiciness does n't change because those dishes are very stable , " mayer said .
" whereas with fish with white sauce you have to and herbs to increase the taste . "
but while lufthansa is n't necessarily serving more curries on-board , its caterers have already been adding more salt to bread rolls as a result of the tests .
mayer noted that this conclusion may also explain the tomato juice observation , as it also lends itself to additives like salt and pepper .
" the flavor profile of tomato juice changes with pressure , " he said .
" so when they taste tomato juice on the ground and give it bad marks and if they do the same test under reduced pressure conditions they give the tomato better marks because tomato juice tastes better under low pressure conditions . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the simulator is built inside of a decommissioned airbus a310 such research remains uncommon industry analysts say that while this research is expensive - few other airlines have gone to such lengths to research airline food , particularly given the trend in low-cost , no-frills airlines that often only sell mediocre pre-packaged sandwiches at best - it may be a way for lufthansa to distinguish itself .
" there are airlines like singapore and lufthansa and others that do put a lot of time and attention to meals , " said henry harteveldt , a travel industry analyst with forrester research in san francisco . " and not only in first and business class but also in economy .
it is the small details that can have a big impact on customer loyalty , satisfaction and willingness to buy again and even to pay more for a ticket . "

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 30-meter low pressure chamber surrounds the front section of the plane inside , everything imitates a normal flight – the seats vibrate , the noise is the same and the human test subjects sniff , sip and munch their way through a long menu of airline food – some merely to taste of specific compounds , others similar to what is served in flight .
stronger spices work better so far , the researchers have already discovered that meals have to be more strongly flavored than those served on the ground .
" spicy food like thai and indian food goes very well because the spiciness does n't change because those dishes are very stable , " mayer said .
" whereas with fish with white sauce you have to and herbs to increase the taste . "
but while lufthansa is n't necessarily serving more curries on-board , its caterers have already been adding more salt to bread rolls as a result of the tests .
mayer noted that this conclusion may also explain the tomato juice observation , as it also lends itself to additives like salt and pepper .
" the flavor profile of tomato juice changes with pressure , " he said .
" so when they taste tomato juice on the ground and give it bad marks and if they do the same test under reduced pressure conditions they give the tomato better marks because tomato juice tastes better under low pressure conditions . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the simulator is built inside of a decommissioned airbus a310 such research remains uncommon industry analysts say that while this research is expensive - few other airlines have gone to such lengths to research airline food , particularly given the trend in low-cost , no-frills airlines that often only sell mediocre pre-packaged sandwiches at best - it may be a way for lufthansa to distinguish itself .
" there are airlines like singapore and lufthansa and others that do put a lot of time and attention to meals , " said henry harteveldt , a travel industry analyst with forrester research in san francisco . " and not only in first and business class but also in economy .
it is the small details that can have a big impact on customer loyalty , satisfaction and willingness to buy again and even to pay more for a ticket . "

german workers in leipzig now worry that their baby , the pint-sized x1 , may be the next candidate for relocation . german luxury car giant bmw has unveiled plans to build a new production line at its plant in spartanburg , south carolina , for the next-generation of x3 sport-utility vehicles currently manufactured in graz , austria .
the german premium carmaker has been building spartanburg in city since 1994 , concentrating mainly on the larger x5 and x6 models .
bmw sells more cars in the us than in any other country except germany .
its sport-utility range , the x series , is in particularly high demand in america .
that explains why the company is investing 750 million dollars – or 540 million euros – to expand its one and only us plant .
less vulnerable to shifts in exchange rates " the united states is still the biggest market for premium cars , " said bmw chief executive norbert reithofer .
" there 's no doubt - we need to be active there .
and we need to have local production facilities to make ourselves less vulnerable to shifts in the euro-dollar exchange rate . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bmw ceo norbert reithofer says the us is " still the biggest market for premium cars " the addition of the x3 model will see spartanburg 's capacity climb from 160,000 to 240,000 cars per year .
and there 's still room for another production line for what the bavarian automaker describes as a “ high-volume ” model .
" before the crisis , the premium car market in the united states sold about two million vehicles annually , " reithofer said .
" we expect the market will probably reach that volume again in 2013 , so our target for us sales will be about 300,000 units . "
bmw 's plans have seen its south carolina workforce grow more than 25 percent as a result , from 6,000 to 7,600 employees .
regional leaders like senator lindsey graham are delighted .
" this is taking south carolina 's economy in a new direction – for every job created by bmw at this plant , three additional jobs are created to support this plant , " graham said .
" it 's hard to put a figure on it , but it 's meant the world to the state of south carolina . "
good reason to be there bmw is not the only german carmaker with a factory in the united states .
mercedes-benz builds its own suv range in tuscaloosa , alabama .
and volkswagen is constructing a massive production center in chattanooga , tennessee .
it 's no coincidence , analysts say , why these factories are located in the southern part of the us . because the southern states are not highly industrialized , their governments are offering high subsidies to attract new investment .
and the american autoworkers ' union – which is traditionally very strong in the north – does n't have a presence in the south , making it much easier for management to negotiate flexible shift times with the workers .
bildunterschrift : bmw will build its next-generation x3 in spartanburg , south carolina meanwhile , back in germany , unions are asking what the attractive conditions on the other side of the atlantic will mean for the future of bmw workers in germany .
could government subsidies see production of the x1 compact suv shift to south carolina as well ?
for now , bmw chief norbert reithofer says the answer is " no . "
" the main market for the x1 is europe , which is why we 're producing that model in leipzig , " reithofer said .
" and that is where it 's going to stay . "
analysts say that if bmw chooses to produce a fourth vehicle at spartanburg , it would likely be the carmaker 's best-seller 3-series compact .
the bavarian company has n't announced any concrete plans for further expansion , but a precedent already exists .
rival carmaker daimler announced last december that the new generation of mercedes c-class sedan would be built in alabama , ending the model 's assembly in the german town of sindelfingen after more than 25 years .

tolerance and openness have marked the arrival of migrants , but the second generation will be the litmus test of successful integration . arabic is often heard as you walk through the streets of lavapies in central madrid . here , traditional tapas bars and bakeries mix with shisha joints , bangaldeshi corner shops and african restaurants .
one of these , doing a swift trade in spicy fish , is run by ibrahima ndiaye .
he has two children with his spanish wife and has enjoyed financial success .
he started out as a night club bouncer and now runs a boutique and this popular restaurant .
he is part of spain 's diverse muslim population , which now numbers around 1.3 million people - just under 3 percent of the overall population of 45 million .
his restaurant is in the same neighborhood where islamic fundamentalists planned the train bombing that killed 191 people march 2004 .
but he says there was no backlash locally .
" i have lived here for many years .
my spanish neighbors know me , they know how i live . it 's true that terrorism has created problems .
when you travel or go to a public place people do look at you now .
but i have n't suffered consequences in my neighborhood . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ibrahima ndiaye runs a successful restaurant in lavapies , madrid minimal conflict an annual survey of the muslim community suggests he is not alone .
some 70 percent of muslims say they feel at home here , and 80 percent say they feel they have adapted well to the spanish way of life .
islam is now the second largest religious domination , with a range of liberal , progressive branches represented , from the moroccan maliki school of thought to the tarikat sufi order from west africa .
spain transformed into a multicultural society with spectacular speed . and yet conflict between communities has been minimal according to madrid 's leading expert on muslim communities , berbabe lopez .
" the person who comes adapts , although they keep the trappings of their culture especially the older generation .
people do n't live in ghettos ; they are spread out all over the country , throughout neighborhoods , " he told deutsche welle .
" and i think that the spanish population - from whom you might have expected more racism - has really absorbed immigrants well .
in almost 15 years - there has been 12 percent immigration .
that has n't happened at such great speed in any other country in europe . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muslim migration has benefitted sweet teeth in spain pix and mix lopez says there is no spanish government ' model of integration ' .
instead , the ruling socialist party has borrowed different policies from other european countries .
the result is neither the assimilation prototype of france nor the multicultural model of the uk .
social integration has been aided by national politicians refusing to talk down muslims .
their response to the terrorist attack was the ' alliance of civilizations ' , a diplomatic push for cooperation between mediterranean cultures that drew on spain 's shared history with morocco .
at home this was mirrored by social cohesion programs .
but in parallel – and perhaps more importantly – there were regular amnesties for the immigrant workers who had powered spain 's construction boom .
in the last ten years over a million people who could prove they were working were granted legal status .
meanwhile all residents – even those without papers – have access to health and education .
and immigrants have not been blamed for the current crisis – even if this may cost votes .
emigrant hosts one reason for this inclusive approach is that spaniards emigrated in living memory . " when i was young we did n't have immigrants .
people here were the migrants .
people came back from germany and switzerland and england at summertime to spend the holidays here , " said ana planet , an arab and islamic studies professor at the madrid autonoma university .
spain also has a legal commitment to religious freedom , which is enshrined in its constitution .
this law tends to foils isolated attempts by town halls to ban veils .
and although they live in a mainly secular society , spaniards still recognize the importance of faith .
" we still consider religion as an important part of life and we are familiar with the this idea that ' you have your religion ' , ' you do that because of your religion ' , " said planet .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : impromptu mosques are springing up across the capital a marginalized group but it is not all positive .
ana explained that full social acceptance is still some way off . catalonia is seeing conflict emerge over the construction of mosques .
and a far-right party plans to field candidates in mayoral elections .
moroccan migrants , who make up around 80 percent of muslims here , tend to bear the brunt of prejudice , and fall within the most marginalized sector of society .
the crisis has left 30 percent out of work , compared to the 20 percent spanish average .
" bear in mind that we immigrants have always had the lowest-qualified jobs .
we do the jobs that no one else wants .
we have very casual contracts , in very bad conditions - you can be fired at any time and all this complicates the process of integration , " said kamal rahmouni from moroccan immigrant association atime .
but rahmouni ended on at upbeat note .
he feels the " complex , long road to integration " is generally going in the right direction .
at the crossroads spain passed the arrivals test but now faces the challenge of meshing these new identities with its own as the children of immigrants come of age .
they will not measure their lives against relatives from their parents ' country of origin but with their peers .
restaurant owner ibrahima -lrb- like 90 percent of muslims surveyed -rrb- believes islam is no barrier to being spanish .
he is convinced his children will have the same chances as classmates .
" i think that opportunities depend on your studies and the abilities of a person .
these days it does n't depend on a person 's color , " he said .
the crisis has made immigrants vulnerable .
but it has also brought down new arrivals by 43 percent .
this may create space for the government to make sure that the second generation of immigrants does enjoy equality of opportunity in the future .

immigrant organizations warned that doing so would lead to " stigmatization . " state education ministers in germany have dismissed calls for making german the obligatory language in the country 's schoolyards .
the ministers ended a two-day meeting in berlin on friday saying a ban on immigrants speaking their mother tongue was impossible to enforce and would be counterproductive in efforts to integrate foreign children .
" there will be no steps taken to either ban foreign languages from schoolyards or to impose german as the only language that can be spoken there , " said ludwig spaenle , education minster of bavaria .
the meeting brought together ministers from all 16 german states .
education in germany is not centralized but the responsibly of the regional state governments .
rhineland palatinate education minister doris ahnen said banning foreign languages from schoolyards was " in no way suited " to solve integration problems .
her berlin colleague juergen zoellner added that while there was no doubt that learning german was very important for successful integration , it was " not very helpful " to outright ban children from speaking their mother tongue .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : integration commissioner maria boehmer is in favor of a ban a number of conservative politicians , among them maria boehmer , the government 's commissioner for integration , had previously called for german to be fixed as the obligatory language in schools to help integrate students from immigrant families .
immigrant organizations warn of ' stigmatization ' boehmer 's suggestion was strongly dismissed by immigrant organizations .
in a joint statement , they warned of a " stigmatization of the immigrant languages . "
instead , they argued , multilingualism was to be supported as a basis for cultural diversity in germany .
" focusing on the german language alone only draws attention from the real problems - such as the selective education system , discrimination and the high levels of unemployment among those with an immigrant background , " the statement added .
" banning the mother tongue is not acceptable , " said kenan kolat , head of the turkish community in germany , after talks with the conference of education ministers .
" it was extremely important to me that this unspeakable discussion about german in schoolyards was stopped , " he added .
" this is a good signal for our cooperation in future . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the number of foreign children dropouts is down 30 percent school dropouts on the decline kolat was part of a delegation of immigrant organizations who met with the ministers on friday to discuss progress on a three-year old action plan to improve education for foreign children .
the plan includes , among other things , state-funded programs to foster children 's language skills , as well as measures to stop the rise in the number of children leaving school without any degree .
the average rate of school dropouts among foreign children is more than twice as high as that of german students - but the situation has markedly improved .
" we 've reduced the number of foreign children dropping out of school by up to 30 percent in the last three years , " berlin education minister zoellner said .
both the ministers and the immigrant groups demanded better funding for education programs from the central government .
more all-day schools and better language education in childcare facilities have proven successful in improving immigrants ' educational chances , they said .

jakub blaszczykowski netted the first goal , with nuri sahin scoring the winner in injury time . former champions league winners borussia dortmund have defeated struggling cologne 2-1 away from home in the pouring rain in friday night 's bundesliga clash .
the winner came through nuri sahin in the 91st minute after the midfielder found the back of the net from close range after a goalmouth scramble .
dortmund seized momentum from the outset and should have taken the lead on 17 minutes when a cross from sahin found the head of striker lucas barrios , but the paraguayan put the ball over with the goal at his mercy .
the black and yellow from dortmund did n't have to wait much longer , however , when three minutes later japan international shinji kagawa played the ball into the cologne box where barrios headed it onto the knee of pole jakub blaszczykowski , nicknamed kuba , from which it bounced over the goal line .
the goal sparked cologne into action , but dortmund keeper roman weidenfeller denied attempts from portuguese midfielder petit and german international lukas podolski .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sahin 's goal came late in the game cologne were finally rewarded for their efforts when they tied the match up with eight minutes remaining after a poor dortmund clearance fell to podolski on the edge of the area .

but just as cologne thought they had secured a much-needed point , dortmund struck back with the late winner through sahin .
the win moves dortmund to equal top of the bundesliga , along with mainz , on 21 points , while cologne languish in 16th place and risk dropping another position if either schalke or stuttgart come away with all three points in their saturday game against each other .

but he has big shoes to fill : after a successful tenure , former conductor ingo metzmacher left the orchestra over funding disputes . the dso berlin -lrb- deutsches symphonie orchester -rrb- named 33-year-old , russian-born tugan sokhiev as its new principal conductor on september 6 .
sokhiev succeeds conductor ingo metzmacher in the position . sokhiev signed a four-year contract to begin in the 2012-2013 season with the dso , an orchestra he has already conducted three times .
until his official start , he will carry the title of designated principal conductor and will help decide who joins the orchestra and what projects it takes on . " the relationship that has developed between me and the dso berlin in recent years is very positive - at its core are respect and the mutual aspiration to make the best possible music , " said sokhiev upon signing his contract with the ensemble . since the 2008-2009 season , sokhiev has served as principal conductor of the orchestre national du capitole in toulose , france .
he also maintains partnerships with the philharmonia orchester london , the mahler chamber orchestra and the vienna philharmonic . uncertainty ahead bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : now 33 years old , sokhiev made his dso debut at just 25 years old in 2003 previous conductor metzmacher left the dso this year in protest against inadequate funding for the orchestra .
his tenure included a number of successful programs , including the casual concerts series , performed in casual clothes and jeans with concert explanations from the stage for audience members less well-versed in classical . sokhiev 's own vision for the ensemble is not yet clear , said dso spokesman benjamin dries , since sokhiev has n't yet presented concrete plans for his seasons starting in 2012 . but sokhiev has said he wo n't be deterred by the orchestra 's financial problems that once led organizers to propose fusing the dso with another berlin orchestra .
those plans have since been pulled from the table . a tradition of renewal the dso has long stood for renewal .
the orchestra was founded in 1946 following the end of the second world war by a radio station in the american sector of berlin .
the dso was a means of giving the country back one of its major cultural outlets : music . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : metzmacher chose not to renew his contract with the dso this year in protest ingo metzmacher 's tenure from 2007-2010 took up a similar theme with the series " from the german soul . "
in 2009 , he told deutsche welle that he was especially interested in the relationship of german culture to music and how to convey that relationship to others .
critics and audiences in berlin and beyond met his efforts with praise . sokhiev first made a name for himself at the dso in 2003 as a 25-year-old as part of a radio series in which young musicians and conductors were given the chance to perform with major orchestras .
recognizing his talent , the dso quickly booked the young conductor for a second concert .
now he 'll have the chance to shape the orchestra more than ever , even if it means steering the ensemble through some financially tough times . " i 'm excitedly looking forward to all of the demands that accompany directing this great orchestra in one of europe 's most important centers of music , " sokhiev said . author : greg wiser -lrb- dpa -rrb- editor : rick fulker send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but starting friday , supporters and opponents begin mediated talks about the project 's future . the first round of mediated discussions on stuttgart 's train station renovation project is set to begin on friday .
the talks between leaders and opponents of the project are to be mediated by heiner geissler , an experienced conflict mediator former general secretary of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union party .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : geissler will mediate the meeting seven representatives from each side are taking part in the round-table discussions on the project , known as ' stuttgart 21 . '
among the supporters of stuttgart 21 participating are stefan mappus , premier of the state of baden wuertemburg , the state 's transport minister , tanja goenner , and volker kefer from the german rail company deutsche bahn .
the opponents ' representatives are still undecided .
initial progress in the talks could be hindered by a particular sticking point that has yet to be settled between the two sides .
opponents of stuttgart 21 have called for construction to stop while the mediation takes place , while deutsche bahn and the project supporters do not want to stop .
support from european commission bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the station would link to a tran-european high-speed line plans for the stuttgart 21 project have been in the mix for years .
the current project calls for the station to be moved underground , with a tunnel system adding a high speed link between stuttgart and the nearby city of ulm .
the project would also connect stuttgart to a high-speed trans-european rail link between paris and bratislava .
in an interview with the rheinische post newspaper , the european commission 's transport minister , siim kallas , has expressed his support for stuttgart 21 .
" the high-speed route between paris and bratislava is an extremely important trans-european west-east axis , " kallas said .
" stuttgart 21 represents a key element of this thoroughfare -lrb- magistrale -rrb- . "
cease-fire the negotiations with geissler also serve as a cease-fire between the two sides of the issue .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the protests on septermber 30 turned violent many protests for and against the project have been carried out in stuttgart in recent weeks .
a protest on september 30 turned violent when opponents of the project gathered in a park near the station to hinder the removal of several trees .
police used water cannons and tear gas to disperse the crowd so the tree removal could continue and were criticized for their use of force .
however , the chief of police said the action of the officers was appropriate as they were provoked by protesters .
state premier mappus has said repeatedly that there can not be a repeat of the violent scenes from september 30 .

his restaurant is in the same neighborhood where islamic fundamentalists planned the train bombing that killed 191 people march 2004 .
but he says there was no backlash locally .
" i have lived here for many years .
my spanish neighbors know me , they know how i live . it 's true that terrorism has created problems .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ibrahima ndiaye runs a successful restaurant in lavapies , madrid minimal conflict an annual survey of the muslim community suggests he is not alone .
some 70 percent of muslims say they feel at home here , and 80 percent say they feel they have adapted well to the spanish way of life .
islam is now the second largest religious domination , with a range of liberal , progressive branches represented , from the moroccan maliki school of thought to the tarikat sufi order from west africa .
spain transformed into a multicultural society with spectacular speed . and yet conflict between communities has been minimal according to madrid 's leading expert on muslim communities , berbabe lopez .

people here were the migrants .
people came back from germany and switzerland and england at summertime to spend the holidays here , " said ana planet , an arab and islamic studies professor at the madrid autonoma university .
spain also has a legal commitment to religious freedom , which is enshrined in its constitution .
this law tends to foils isolated attempts by town halls to ban veils .
and although they live in a mainly secular society , spaniards still recognize the importance of faith .

moroccan migrants , who make up around 80 percent of muslims here , tend to bear the brunt of prejudice , and fall within the most marginalized sector of society .
the crisis has left 30 percent out of work , compared to the 20 percent spanish average .
" bear in mind that we immigrants have always had the lowest-qualified jobs .
we do the jobs that no one else wants .
we have very casual contracts , in very bad conditions - you can be fired at any time and all this complicates the process of integration , " said kamal rahmouni from moroccan immigrant association atime .
but rahmouni ended on at upbeat note .
he feels the " complex , long road to integration " is generally going in the right direction .
at the crossroads spain passed the arrivals test but now faces the challenge of meshing these new identities with its own as the children of immigrants come of age .
they will not measure their lives against relatives from their parents ' country of origin but with their peers .
restaurant owner ibrahima -lrb- like 90 percent of muslims surveyed -rrb- believes islam is no barrier to being spanish .
he is convinced his children will have the same chances as classmates .
" i think that opportunities depend on your studies and the abilities of a person .
these days it does n't depend on a person 's color , " he said .
the crisis has made immigrants vulnerable .
but it has also brought down new arrivals by 43 percent .
this may create space for the government to make sure that the second generation of immigrants does enjoy equality of opportunity in the future .

but in parallel – and perhaps more importantly – there were regular amnesties for the immigrant workers who had powered spain 's construction boom .
in the last ten years over a million people who could prove they were working were granted legal status .
meanwhile all residents – even those without papers – have access to health and education .
and immigrants have not been blamed for the current crisis – even if this may cost votes .
emigrant hosts one reason for this inclusive approach is that spaniards emigrated in living memory . " when i was young we did n't have immigrants .
people here were the migrants .
people came back from germany and switzerland and england at summertime to spend the holidays here , " said ana planet , an arab and islamic studies professor at the madrid autonoma university .
spain also has a legal commitment to religious freedom , which is enshrined in its constitution .
this law tends to foils isolated attempts by town halls to ban veils .
and although they live in a mainly secular society , spaniards still recognize the importance of faith .
" we still consider religion as an important part of life and we are familiar with the this idea that ' you have your religion ' , ' you do that because of your religion ' , " said planet .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : impromptu mosques are springing up across the capital a marginalized group but it is not all positive .
ana explained that full social acceptance is still some way off . catalonia is seeing conflict emerge over the construction of mosques .
and a far-right party plans to field candidates in mayoral elections .
moroccan migrants , who make up around 80 percent of muslims here , tend to bear the brunt of prejudice , and fall within the most marginalized sector of society .
the crisis has left 30 percent out of work , compared to the 20 percent spanish average .
" bear in mind that we immigrants have always had the lowest-qualified jobs .
we do the jobs that no one else wants .
we have very casual contracts , in very bad conditions - you can be fired at any time and all this complicates the process of integration , " said kamal rahmouni from moroccan immigrant association atime .
but rahmouni ended on at upbeat note .
he feels the " complex , long road to integration " is generally going in the right direction .
at the crossroads spain passed the arrivals test but now faces the challenge of meshing these new identities with its own as the children of immigrants come of age .
they will not measure their lives against relatives from their parents ' country of origin but with their peers .
restaurant owner ibrahima -lrb- like 90 percent of muslims surveyed -rrb- believes islam is no barrier to being spanish .
he is convinced his children will have the same chances as classmates .
" i think that opportunities depend on your studies and the abilities of a person .
these days it does n't depend on a person 's color , " he said .
the crisis has made immigrants vulnerable .
but it has also brought down new arrivals by 43 percent .
this may create space for the government to make sure that the second generation of immigrants does enjoy equality of opportunity in the future .

german workers in leipzig now worry that their baby , the pint-sized x1 , may be the next candidate for relocation . german luxury car giant bmw has unveiled plans to build a new production line at its plant in spartanburg , south carolina , for the next-generation of x3 sport-utility vehicles currently manufactured in graz , austria .
the german premium carmaker has been building spartanburg in city since 1994 , concentrating mainly on the larger x5 and x6 models .
bmw sells more cars in the us than in any other country except germany .
its sport-utility range , the x series , is in particularly high demand in america .
that explains why the company is investing 750 million dollars – or 540 million euros – to expand its one and only us plant .
less vulnerable to shifts in exchange rates " the united states is still the biggest market for premium cars , " said bmw chief executive norbert reithofer .
" there 's no doubt - we need to be active there .
and we need to have local production facilities to make ourselves less vulnerable to shifts in the euro-dollar exchange rate . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bmw ceo norbert reithofer says the us is " still the biggest market for premium cars " the addition of the x3 model will see spartanburg 's capacity climb from 160,000 to 240,000 cars per year .
and there 's still room for another production line for what the bavarian automaker describes as a “ high-volume ” model .
" before the crisis , the premium car market in the united states sold about two million vehicles annually , " reithofer said .
" we expect the market will probably reach that volume again in 2013 , so our target for us sales will be about 300,000 units . "
bmw 's plans have seen its south carolina workforce grow more than 25 percent as a result , from 6,000 to 7,600 employees .
regional leaders like senator lindsey graham are delighted .
" this is taking south carolina 's economy in a new direction – for every job created by bmw at this plant , three additional jobs are created to support this plant , " graham said .
" it 's hard to put a figure on it , but it 's meant the world to the state of south carolina . "
good reason to be there bmw is not the only german carmaker with a factory in the united states .
mercedes-benz builds its own suv range in tuscaloosa , alabama .
and volkswagen is constructing a massive production center in chattanooga , tennessee .
it 's no coincidence , analysts say , why these factories are located in the southern part of the us . because the southern states are not highly industrialized , their governments are offering high subsidies to attract new investment .
and the american autoworkers ' union – which is traditionally very strong in the north – does n't have a presence in the south , making it much easier for management to negotiate flexible shift times with the workers .
bildunterschrift : bmw will build its next-generation x3 in spartanburg , south carolina meanwhile , back in germany , unions are asking what the attractive conditions on the other side of the atlantic will mean for the future of bmw workers in germany .
could government subsidies see production of the x1 compact suv shift to south carolina as well ?
for now , bmw chief norbert reithofer says the answer is " no . "
" the main market for the x1 is europe , which is why we 're producing that model in leipzig , " reithofer said .
" and that is where it 's going to stay . "
analysts say that if bmw chooses to produce a fourth vehicle at spartanburg , it would likely be the carmaker 's best-seller 3-series compact .
the bavarian company has n't announced any concrete plans for further expansion , but a precedent already exists .
rival carmaker daimler announced last december that the new generation of mercedes c-class sedan would be built in alabama , ending the model 's assembly in the german town of sindelfingen after more than 25 years .

the " european green capitals " program aims to ensure cities rise in style to the environmental challenges facing them . healthy competition usually spurs contestants to outdo each other and brings the eventual winner fame and glory .
that 's probably what the 16 representatives from various european cities had in mind when they came together in tallinn , estonia , in may 2006 to launch the european green capital award scheme .
the aim was to encourage cities to achieve higher levels of environmental protection and improve the quality of the urban environment .
the first winner of the competition was stockholm , which served throughout 2010 as europe 's first green capital .
in 2011 , it will be passing the mantle to hamburg in northern germany .
a spirit of healthy competition when it comes to green urban development is long overdue : europe has become an essentially urban society , with four out of five europeans living in towns and cities .
it 's a development seen all over the world , with more than half the world 's population , or about 3.3 billion people , now living in towns and cities .
almost four fifths of greenhouses gases emitted every day originate in cities .
so with most of the environmental challenges facing our society arising in urban areas , the logical conclusion is that it is also these urban areas that need to muster up the commitment and innovation to resolve them .
hamburg meets the mark on several fronts so what 's needed to make cities more environmentally-friendly and liveable in the future ?
the european commission has drafted ten criteria that specifically pinpoint steps to solve environmental challenges in cities , improve the quality of life of its citizens and reduce their global carbon footprint .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : harbor city is a new quarter under development in the old harbor of hamburg , along the river elbe the criteria require the winning city to not just meet high environmental standards but also show it has what it takes to be a role model to inspire other cities and promote best practices .
according to the jury , hamburg won thanks to what it described as “ ambitious climate protection targets . ”
the northern german port city plans to slash its 1990 carbon emissions levels by 40 percent by 2020 , and by 80 percent by 2050 .
cynics might say hamburg won the coveted title because of its lofty goals rather than its current practices .
but that 's only partially true .
hamburg 's ambitious climate targets naturally played a role in its victory but the city already boasts lower per capita carbon emissions than freiburg - another german city that made it to the competition shortlist and one that sees itself as the cradle of the green movement in germany .
latest available official figures show that hamburg 's carbon emissions amounted to 8.84 tones per year per resident in 2006 , compared to 9.28 tones in freiburg in 2005 .
hamburg out-performed the other contestants on many fronts .
the jury deemed its water quality better than in bristol , oslo , freiburg and muenster .
it has equally excellent air quality and an efficient waste management system . the city has also apparently achieved good performance levels in terms of cycling and public transport indicators .
lost opportunities ?
yet some of the rating practices in the competition have raised eyebrows .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bike-friendly german city of muenster also made the shortlist for instance , amsterdam – a bicycle city if ever there was one – was awarded only one point more than hamburg for pro-cycling traffic infrastructure .
the jury commended amsterdam 's impressive achievement in getting more of its residents cycling than driving , noting that nine tenths of its roads are bike-friendly , and that anyone who needs to get in the driving seat now and then can use one of the city 's efficient car-sharing stations .
when it comes to promoting two wheels , amsterdam surely outstrips hamburg , and the german port city may not be making the most of opportunities to catch up .
even hamburg 's new waterfront district hafencity , which is currently being developed , is seen as having failed in some environmental aspects .
the new district will increase the inner city area by 40 percent through filling-up expendable harbor basins .
in itself , this is an exemplary way of preventing geographical expansion into surrounding areas , and one that provides plenty of scope for sustainable urban development .
but instead of integrating bike-friendly strategies into the concept , urban planners have come up with a design that suits first and foremost the needs of motorists .
on track to a greener future the issue has been seized upon by the hamburg future council , which is made up of citizens , companies and associations .
according to its press spokeswoman delia schindler , hamburg owes its european green capital victory less to politicians and more to grassroots activism and local ngos .
but the eu commission jury was n't splitting hairs .
it made a point of praising public commitment to environmental objectives , and hamburg garnered maximum points for its communication strategy .
the jury was impressed by the involvement of young people ; the many environmental networks in operation and the enthusiasm the city shows in cooperating with other environmental organizations within the eu .
it 's planning to spread some of this enthusiasm with the launch of a “ train of ideas . ”
this foresees interested cities within the european green capital award network ‘ owning ' a wagon and traveling around europe to promote their respective green ideas , achievements and future plans - on track to a greener future .

that 's probably what the 16 representatives from various european cities had in mind when they came together in tallinn , estonia , in may 2006 to launch the european green capital award scheme .
the aim was to encourage cities to achieve higher levels of environmental protection and improve the quality of the urban environment .
the first winner of the competition was stockholm , which served throughout 2010 as europe 's first green capital .
in 2011 , it will be passing the mantle to hamburg in northern germany .
a spirit of healthy competition when it comes to green urban development is long overdue : europe has become an essentially urban society , with four out of five europeans living in towns and cities .
it 's a development seen all over the world , with more than half the world 's population , or about 3.3 billion people , now living in towns and cities .
almost four fifths of greenhouses gases emitted every day originate in cities .
so with most of the environmental challenges facing our society arising in urban areas , the logical conclusion is that it is also these urban areas that need to muster up the commitment and innovation to resolve them .
hamburg meets the mark on several fronts so what 's needed to make cities more environmentally-friendly and liveable in the future ?
the european commission has drafted ten criteria that specifically pinpoint steps to solve environmental challenges in cities , improve the quality of life of its citizens and reduce their global carbon footprint .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : harbor city is a new quarter under development in the old harbor of hamburg , along the river elbe the criteria require the winning city to not just meet high environmental standards but also show it has what it takes to be a role model to inspire other cities and promote best practices .
according to the jury , hamburg won thanks to what it described as “ ambitious climate protection targets . ”
the northern german port city plans to slash its 1990 carbon emissions levels by 40 percent by 2020 , and by 80 percent by 2050 .
cynics might say hamburg won the coveted title because of its lofty goals rather than its current practices .
but that 's only partially true .
hamburg 's ambitious climate targets naturally played a role in its victory but the city already boasts lower per capita carbon emissions than freiburg - another german city that made it to the competition shortlist and one that sees itself as the cradle of the green movement in germany .
latest available official figures show that hamburg 's carbon emissions amounted to 8.84 tones per year per resident in 2006 , compared to 9.28 tones in freiburg in 2005 .
hamburg out-performed the other contestants on many fronts .
the jury deemed its water quality better than in bristol , oslo , freiburg and muenster .
it has equally excellent air quality and an efficient waste management system . the city has also apparently achieved good performance levels in terms of cycling and public transport indicators .
lost opportunities ?
yet some of the rating practices in the competition have raised eyebrows .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bike-friendly german city of muenster also made the shortlist for instance , amsterdam – a bicycle city if ever there was one – was awarded only one point more than hamburg for pro-cycling traffic infrastructure .
the jury commended amsterdam 's impressive achievement in getting more of its residents cycling than driving , noting that nine tenths of its roads are bike-friendly , and that anyone who needs to get in the driving seat now and then can use one of the city 's efficient car-sharing stations .
when it comes to promoting two wheels , amsterdam surely outstrips hamburg , and the german port city may not be making the most of opportunities to catch up .
even hamburg 's new waterfront district hafencity , which is currently being developed , is seen as having failed in some environmental aspects .
the new district will increase the inner city area by 40 percent through filling-up expendable harbor basins .
in itself , this is an exemplary way of preventing geographical expansion into surrounding areas , and one that provides plenty of scope for sustainable urban development .
but instead of integrating bike-friendly strategies into the concept , urban planners have come up with a design that suits first and foremost the needs of motorists .
on track to a greener future the issue has been seized upon by the hamburg future council , which is made up of citizens , companies and associations .
according to its press spokeswoman delia schindler , hamburg owes its european green capital victory less to politicians and more to grassroots activism and local ngos .
but the eu commission jury was n't splitting hairs .
it made a point of praising public commitment to environmental objectives , and hamburg garnered maximum points for its communication strategy .
the jury was impressed by the involvement of young people ; the many environmental networks in operation and the enthusiasm the city shows in cooperating with other environmental organizations within the eu .
it 's planning to spread some of this enthusiasm with the launch of a “ train of ideas . ”
this foresees interested cities within the european green capital award network ‘ owning ' a wagon and traveling around europe to promote their respective green ideas , achievements and future plans - on track to a greener future .

speaking to reporters before the meeting , baden-wuerttemberg state premier stefan mappus said he wanted to make the debate over the project " more transparent . "
" we want to show people why we see stuttgart 21 as an important project for baden-wuerttemberg , why it 's a project that will last for generations , " he said .
" we also want to back everything up with facts and move beyond emotions , so that everyone can understand it based on concrete arguments . "
two hours into the discussions , project opponents broke them off to confer with each other before resuming them later in the afternoon .
sources close to the talks said both sides disagreed on the conditions for how to proceed .
public fact-check hannes rockenbauch , spokesman for the opposition to the project , said on wednesday morning that he was looking forward to speaking directly to the project 's supporters .
" we 're really excited , because we want to have this public fact-check , " he told public television ard .

despite the negotiations , rockenbauch said another demonstration against the project would go ahead as planned on the weekend .
rockenbauch is joined by six other opponents of stuttgart 21 , including environmental activists and state green party and social democrat politicians .

up until that point the opposition had refused to hold any negotiations with the state authorities until all construction work on the project was put on hold .
on october 5 , mappus instead ordered a moratorium on demolition work to last until november .
a major sticking point for opponents remains in the construction of a cement tank for underground water management , as well as the degree of public access to the disussions .
rockenbauch and other opponents have called for the video of future meetings to be carried live on the internet .

speaking to reporters before the meeting , baden-wuerttemberg state premier stefan mappus said he wanted to make the debate over the project " more transparent . "
" we want to show people why we see stuttgart 21 as an important project for baden-wuerttemberg , why it 's a project that will last for generations , " he said .
" we also want to back everything up with facts and move beyond emotions , so that everyone can understand it based on concrete arguments . "
two hours into the discussions , project opponents broke them off to confer with each other before resuming them later in the afternoon .
sources close to the talks said both sides disagreed on the conditions for how to proceed .
public fact-check hannes rockenbauch , spokesman for the opposition to the project , said on wednesday morning that he was looking forward to speaking directly to the project 's supporters .
" we 're really excited , because we want to have this public fact-check , " he told public television ard .
" we 're hoping that the state government and rail authorities are really ready for this , because for us it means that they wo n't be allowed to create any more ' facts ' while this public fact-check is ongoing . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protestors had previously demanded a construction halt before talks he added that he wanted to give the state , federal and rail authorities a final chance to explain " disproportionate police actions " that took place on september 30 , when police used water cannons , tear gas and pepper spray against protestors that they said had turned violent .
despite the negotiations , rockenbauch said another demonstration against the project would go ahead as planned on the weekend .
rockenbauch is joined by six other opponents of stuttgart 21 , including environmental activists and state green party and social democrat politicians .
the other side includes mappus , state transport minister tanja goenner and volker kefer from the german rail company deutsche bahn .
sticking points the state-appointed arbitrator in the debate , veteran politician heiner geissler of angela merkel 's christian democratic union , announced thursday evening after four hours of talks with the project 's opponents that negotiations between both sides would take place .
up until that point the opposition had refused to hold any negotiations with the state authorities until all construction work on the project was put on hold .
on october 5 , mappus instead ordered a moratorium on demolition work to last until november .
a major sticking point for opponents remains in the construction of a cement tank for underground water management , as well as the degree of public access to the disussions .
rockenbauch and other opponents have called for the video of future meetings to be carried live on the internet .
legal reprimand for builders in a parallel development , a stuttgart administrative court found on thursday that the project 's leaders had incorrectly filed their application to cut down trees in the city 's palace gardens as part of the project .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the project would move the train station underground the environmental group friends of the earth germany had filed an emergency application to halt the tree-cutting , claiming it would endanger a rare species of beetle that lives in the trees .
the court said it may have granted the emergency stop , but the federal railway authority did not provide proper documentation of the project 's environmental protection plans , which included research on how the tree-cutting would affect the beetle .
meanwhile the renovation project , which would move the rail station underground and turn it from a terminus to a through-station , gained public support from european commission transport minister siim kallas .
" the high-speed route between paris and bratislava is an extremely important trans-european west-east axis , " kallas told the rheinische post newspaper .
" stuttgart 21 represents a key element of this thoroughfare . "

so far , lufthansa has decided to make their bread rolls a little more salty . why do so many people order tomato juice aboard airlines ?
over the last several months , the fraunhofer institute for building physics , in holzkirchen , just south of munich , has been trying to find the answer to this question - particulary given that lufthansa serves approximately 1.7 million liters of tomato juice each year .
more broadly , through a series of tests , researchers are trying to determine how flight conditions change the way food and drinks taste while in-flight .
the institute is conducting this research on behalf of lufthansa , which is one of the few airlines in the world that is currently undertaking airplane cuisine research - the final round in the testing series is due to be held in december .
reduced taste perception so far , scientists do know that once at a cruising altitude of approximately 10,000 meters -lrb- roughly 30,000 feet -rrb- , the cabin humidity drops by 15 percent , and the lowered air pressure forces bodily fluids upwards .
with less humidity , people get thirsty more easily as there is less moisture in their throat , which also slows the transport of odors to the brains smell and taste receptors .
" it 's like having a cold , " said florian mayer , the research team 's leader .
" when you have a cold all your nasal mucous swells up and you have reduced odor and taste perception . "
mayer and his team are conducting their research in a 30-meter -lrb- approximately 90 feet -rrb- low pressure tubular chamber , built around the front section of a decommissioned airbus a310 .
" we have typical temperatures of 20 degrees celsius -lrb- 68 degrees farenheit -rrb- , " mayer said .
" we have humidity of around 10 to 15 percent and we have a high air exchange rate – all the environmental conditions that are typical for flying aircraft , " mayer said .
" and what 's important we reduce the pressure from normal sea level or here it on ground it is about 950 -lsb- hectopascals -rsb- .
but onboard during cruise you have a normal pressure of around 750 - 800 -lsb- hectopascals -rsb- . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 30-meter low pressure chamber surrounds the front section of the plane inside , everything imitates a normal flight – the seats vibrate , the noise is the same and the human test subjects sniff , sip and munch their way through a long menu of airline food – some merely to taste of specific compounds , others similar to what is served in flight .
stronger spices work better so far , the researchers have already discovered that meals have to be more strongly flavored than those served on the ground .
" spicy food like thai and indian food goes very well because the spiciness does n't change because those dishes are very stable , " mayer said .
" whereas with fish with white sauce you have to and herbs to increase the taste . "
but while lufthansa is n't necessarily serving more curries on-board , its caterers have already been adding more salt to bread rolls as a result of the tests .
mayer noted that this conclusion may also explain the tomato juice observation , as it also lends itself to additives like salt and pepper .
" the flavor profile of tomato juice changes with pressure , " he said .
" so when they taste tomato juice on the ground and give it bad marks and if they do the same test under reduced pressure conditions they give the tomato better marks because tomato juice tastes better under low pressure conditions . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the simulator is built inside of a decommissioned airbus a310 such research remains uncommon industry analysts say that while this research is expensive - few other airlines have gone to such lengths to research airline food , particularly given the trend in low-cost , no-frills airlines that often only sell mediocre pre-packaged sandwiches at best - it may be a way for lufthansa to distinguish itself .
" there are airlines like singapore and lufthansa and others that do put a lot of time and attention to meals , " said henry harteveldt , a travel industry analyst with forrester research in san francisco . " and not only in first and business class but also in economy .
it is the small details that can have a big impact on customer loyalty , satisfaction and willingness to buy again and even to pay more for a ticket . "

after the last match day 's battering , our pundits hope they 've got their heads back for match day eight . after a two-week international break , match day eight is in ascendance and the dw bundesliga pundits are back at it .
after a poor set of predictions on the last match day -lrb- see below -rrb- , they 've resolved to look to the stars for guidance .
this week 's predictor hopes for the best , but has a ready excuse should things go awry : he 's a gemini , and can blame it on that other guy inhabiting his body .
friday , october 15 cologne-dortmund dortmund have gone from strength to strength this season , getting good individual performances from many a member of their young squad - and all the while , they 've been working for each other on the pitch .
cologne have been mostly hideous , managing a fortunate win over st. pauli and two backs-to-the-wall draws .
fan favorite and mercurial boy prince lukas podolski sounded off this week that his beloved fc was adrift , and hinted he would look for the exit if things did n't turn around soon .
off you go , then .
cologne deserve to be at the table 's foot as richly as dortmund do near the top , and the billygoats should get flogged on friday .
dortmund 3-0 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : van bommel and his , erm , passion will be missing form this match saturday , october 16 bayern-hanover the opening weeks of the season for hanover were surprisingly good - the team busted loose to a 13-point haul in their first six games .
they 're still in third place , but last week 's limp home loss to st. pauli highlighted their weakness : without a full-strength strike partnership of mohamad abdelloue and didier ya konan , hanover are far from dangerous .
ya konan was out two weeks ago , this time it 's abdelloue .
bayern do have injury problems of their own -lrb- diego contento , franck ribery and arjen robben are still out , and miroslav klose , mark van bommel and ivica olic picked up injuries on international duty -rrb- , but they should have more than enough quality to take this one .
bayern 3-1 schalke-stuttgart the bundesliga 's two most hapless sides were all set to square off in a contest to decide who would see their name inserted into a flurry of “ -lsb- insert club name here -rsb- in crisis ” headlines , and whose coach would see a greater flurry of speculation surrounding his future .
then stuttgart went and spoiled the fun , firing christian gross before the match had even been played .
probably for the best , really .
though there is n't much to separate these two in terms of form -lrb- both have been very poor -rrb- , schalke are at home and have a slightly better squad .
thus they should win .
schalke 2-1 werder bremen-freiburg freiburg have been puzzlingly strong this season , defying the odds to win four of their first seven -lrb- including two away -rrb- and have risen all the way to fifth place .
bremen , meanwhile , have been in a funk .
it 's been down to a mixture of injuries to key players like naldo , per mertesacker and claudio pizarro and the kind of sloppy defending bremen have become famous for in recent years .
now mertesacker is back in the starting line-up , pizarro might be able to play as a substitute , and sporting director klaus allof 's -lrb- possibly illegal -rrb- stunt of docking the players ' pay after the 4-1 loss to hanover in week six seems to have done the trick .
bremen could easily have won on the last matchday in leverkusen , and should win easily at home on saturday .
bremen 2-0 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : settle down , adam - your hat-trick came against san marino mainz-hamburg the little club that could may lose some steam from its engine following the international break , what with their young squad having had ample time to let success go to their heads .
then again striker adam szalai , who 's just hit four goals in two games for hungary , might just come back to mainz on a justified high that will fire him up for more .
hamburg , for their part , showed signs of living up to their considerable promise in a gutsy win over kaiserslautern in match day seven , and will be boosted by paolo guerrero 's return from injury .
on the other hand , they are still hobbled by 10 -lrb- ! -rrb- other players from the first-team squad laid low at the moment .
i smell a draw .
draw 2-2 st. pauli-nuremberg a tough one to call , in that not much separates these two sides .
both have punched above the weight of their rather thin squads thus far , nuremberg through a very organized defense , pauli through fitness and a willingness to fight to the very end of a match .
it 's been seven home games since hamburg 's skull-and-crossbones appreciation society has seen their team get a win , and just as many matches since der club has won away .
may the streaks continue .
draw 1-1 wolfsburg-leverkusen both these sides have n't got out of the gate as strongly as they 'd have liked , but neither the pharmaceuticals -lrb- in 4th place on 12 points -rrb- or the wolves -lrb- 8th place , 10pts . -rrb- are so far off the pace for panic to have set in , and in fact are on good form .
that 's in part because both are starting to get good production from strikers who had looked out of it at the season 's opening - wolfsburg 's grafite and leverkusen 's eren derdiyok .
i might have been inclined to go with the home side , but they will be missing goalkeeper diego benaglio , so a draw looks a good bet .
draw 2-2 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eintracht 's ultras are a real sharing , caring group of guys sunday , october 17 kaiserslautern-frankfurt it 's an intriguing match-up between a team that started poorly and may be beginning to fade -lrb- k-town -rrb- , and another that stumbled at first but that now might be finding its sea legs -lrb- eintracht -rrb- .
but nobody 's talking about the game , they 're talking about the potential for fan trouble .
these two clubs are not natural derby rivals , but they are historically the two strongest in their region , and have a history .
eintracht 's ultras , considered by many to be the nastiest " fans " in the bundesliga , certainly are trumpeting this as a trip to see hated rivals , virtually promising violence in internet forums .
much as i 'd like to see them disappointed , i see frankfurt taking the points .
frankfurt 2-1 hoffenheim-moenchengladbach gladbach lead the league by a comfortable margin in goals allowed with 20 , but showed signs in their 1-1 match day seven draw against the often potent wolfsburg that they might have found their way .
hoffenheim , meanwhile , have had a rough few weeks , losing at mainz and bayern -lrb- which is acceptable -rrb- , and drawing away to cologne -lrb- which is n't -rrb- .
a bright spot , however , has been the ice-cold free-kicks of their young icelandic newcomer , gylfi sigurdsson .
he 's scored them in substitute appearances thus far , and now he 's likely to get the start .
i like him to score , and for the hoff to win .
hoffenheim 3-1 last week 's result : 5 points hanover-st .

dortmund 3-0 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : van bommel and his , erm , passion will be missing form this match saturday , october 16 bayern-hanover the opening weeks of the season for hanover were surprisingly good - the team busted loose to a 13-point haul in their first six games .
they 're still in third place , but last week 's limp home loss to st. pauli highlighted their weakness : without a full-strength strike partnership of mohamad abdelloue and didier ya konan , hanover are far from dangerous .
ya konan was out two weeks ago , this time it 's abdelloue .
bayern do have injury problems of their own -lrb- diego contento , franck ribery and arjen robben are still out , and miroslav klose , mark van bommel and ivica olic picked up injuries on international duty -rrb- , but they should have more than enough quality to take this one .
bayern 3-1 schalke-stuttgart the bundesliga 's two most hapless sides were all set to square off in a contest to decide who would see their name inserted into a flurry of “ -lsb- insert club name here -rsb- in crisis ” headlines , and whose coach would see a greater flurry of speculation surrounding his future .
then stuttgart went and spoiled the fun , firing christian gross before the match had even been played .
probably for the best , really .
though there is n't much to separate these two in terms of form -lrb- both have been very poor -rrb- , schalke are at home and have a slightly better squad .
thus they should win .
schalke 2-1 werder bremen-freiburg freiburg have been puzzlingly strong this season , defying the odds to win four of their first seven -lrb- including two away -rrb- and have risen all the way to fifth place .
bremen , meanwhile , have been in a funk .
it 's been down to a mixture of injuries to key players like naldo , per mertesacker and claudio pizarro and the kind of sloppy defending bremen have become famous for in recent years .
now mertesacker is back in the starting line-up , pizarro might be able to play as a substitute , and sporting director klaus allof 's -lrb- possibly illegal -rrb- stunt of docking the players ' pay after the 4-1 loss to hanover in week six seems to have done the trick .
bremen could easily have won on the last matchday in leverkusen , and should win easily at home on saturday .
bremen 2-0 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : settle down , adam - your hat-trick came against san marino mainz-hamburg the little club that could may lose some steam from its engine following the international break , what with their young squad having had ample time to let success go to their heads .
then again striker adam szalai , who 's just hit four goals in two games for hungary , might just come back to mainz on a justified high that will fire him up for more .
hamburg , for their part , showed signs of living up to their considerable promise in a gutsy win over kaiserslautern in match day seven , and will be boosted by paolo guerrero 's return from injury .
on the other hand , they are still hobbled by 10 -lrb- ! -rrb- other players from the first-team squad laid low at the moment .
i smell a draw .
draw 2-2 st. pauli-nuremberg a tough one to call , in that not much separates these two sides .
both have punched above the weight of their rather thin squads thus far , nuremberg through a very organized defense , pauli through fitness and a willingness to fight to the very end of a match .
it 's been seven home games since hamburg 's skull-and-crossbones appreciation society has seen their team get a win , and just as many matches since der club has won away .
may the streaks continue .
draw 1-1 wolfsburg-leverkusen both these sides have n't got out of the gate as strongly as they 'd have liked , but neither the pharmaceuticals -lrb- in 4th place on 12 points -rrb- or the wolves -lrb- 8th place , 10pts . -rrb- are so far off the pace for panic to have set in , and in fact are on good form .

but nobody 's talking about the game , they 're talking about the potential for fan trouble .
these two clubs are not natural derby rivals , but they are historically the two strongest in their region , and have a history .
eintracht 's ultras , considered by many to be the nastiest " fans " in the bundesliga , certainly are trumpeting this as a trip to see hated rivals , virtually promising violence in internet forums .
much as i 'd like to see them disappointed , i see frankfurt taking the points .
frankfurt 2-1 hoffenheim-moenchengladbach gladbach lead the league by a comfortable margin in goals allowed with 20 , but showed signs in their 1-1 match day seven draw against the often potent wolfsburg that they might have found their way .
hoffenheim , meanwhile , have had a rough few weeks , losing at mainz and bayern -lrb- which is acceptable -rrb- , and drawing away to cologne -lrb- which is n't -rrb- .
a bright spot , however , has been the ice-cold free-kicks of their young icelandic newcomer , gylfi sigurdsson .

in recent years , that has meant moving closer to the us college model . with its vast marble staircase and lofty ceiling , the foyer of the humboldt in central berlin is an imposing space .
it has an air of prestige and learnedness about it .
but that is not all it has . in one corner there is something quite different : the university store , which is filled with shelves and rails of brightly colored clothes bearing the humboldt insignia .
one t-shirt boldly states " my mother wanted me to go to harvard , my father wanted me to go to cambridge , but i wanted to go my way " - that way being the humboldt . and while the university , which ranks among the top 10 in the country , is undoubtedly popular , some 8,000 germans are currently studying at colleges in the united states .
that is fewer than are on programs in the netherlands and austria , but still a large number given the prohibitively expensive fees synonymous with an american university education . ursula hans , director of the international office at the humboldt , said one of the major benefits of the us system is that it not only teaches its students , but is also willing to learn from them . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german professors are often responsible for too many students " this is a university system that for 200 years or more has been taking tuition from its students , and that has translated into services , and institutes and departments that are well planned and set up , " hans told deutsche welle . unbeatable resources it 's a view shared by german students who have experienced the american system first-hand .
ines eben von racknitz went to stanford university on a scholarship to study chinese , religion and comparative literature .
she was so taken with the whole experience that she said she probably would have done it even if it had meant leaving college with a mountain of debts .
she was amazed at the resources and the attitudes of those on campus . " everyone wants to help you to get a job afterwards ; people are looking after you , " said von racknitz .
" and you have amazing archives and libraries which are open all the time , and professors have open doors , so are always available . " but what stood out to her perhaps more than anything was the enthusiasm with which the academic staff went about their own work and encouraged her in hers . " they are delighted in what they do , they have passion and they are glowing from it , " she continued .
" if you are in academia , you are abandoning riches and fame , so you need to be passionate and delighted ; that is what they are , and it 's very inspiring . " overworked multi-taskers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stanford university : not just a pretty face although von racknitz was at pains to stress that the time she spent at german universities also provided her with an excellent education , she said professors here seem to lack that american elan which can be an invaluable source of inspiration and motivation for students .
the reason for that , experts agree , is that teaching staff at colleges in germany face a much heavier workload than their counterparts across the atlantic . while professors in the us can generally leave the administrative aspect of their work to someone else and concentrate fully on their teaching and research , in germany that is a luxury reserved for professors at well-financed masters programs .
the rest are left to multi-task , which , according to ursula hans , is a problem both for the teaching and the student body . " how can you talk to your advisor if he is responsible for 20 other people ? "
hans asked .
" and how is the advisor going to make time to take care of your student or phd needs if he is involved in other commissions and doing research and serving on other committees ? " aiming high barbara von bechtolsheim , who got her phd at stanford and has taught at colleges in both the states and germany , agrees that german staff are overloaded , but believes that german students could be pushed harder . " i came to stanford with an ma in german studies from munich and i had studied with one of the best professors there , " she said .
" however when i came to stanford , i learned i did n't know much in terms of academic standards . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no matter where you study , there 's no way to avoid hitting the books her four years in california were hard work , but they broadened her horizons and her expectations of herself .
they also left her in no doubt that a us university education has more to offer than a german one .
apart from the resources and the support on offer to students there , she says the first two years in which all undergraduates are given a solid grounding in history , literature and culture , are absolutely invaluable . " it 's a very good idea even if you want to major in math or geology that you have such a broad mind and reference points , " she said .
" in germany , you can go to medical school and if you have n't learned it at home or school , medicine and physics and chemistry is all that is on your mind . " but ursula hans , herself a former us college student , is not convinced of the merit of that approach .
she believes one of the greatest strengths of the german system is that it does not bombard young people with facts , but teaches them to think for themselves . as far as she is concerned , a university education from germany is of an extremely high standard .
she says if there is one thing colleges in germany could perhaps still learn from their american counterparts , it would be the fine art of marketing an identity . if the items for sale in the humboldt store are anything to go by , that lesson has already been taken on board . author : tamsin walker editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in recent years , that has meant moving closer to the us college model . with its vast marble staircase and lofty ceiling , the foyer of the humboldt in central berlin is an imposing space .
it has an air of prestige and learnedness about it .
but that is not all it has . in one corner there is something quite different : the university store , which is filled with shelves and rails of brightly colored clothes bearing the humboldt insignia .
one t-shirt boldly states " my mother wanted me to go to harvard , my father wanted me to go to cambridge , but i wanted to go my way " - that way being the humboldt . and while the university , which ranks among the top 10 in the country , is undoubtedly popular , some 8,000 germans are currently studying at colleges in the united states .
that is fewer than are on programs in the netherlands and austria , but still a large number given the prohibitively expensive fees synonymous with an american university education . ursula hans , director of the international office at the humboldt , said one of the major benefits of the us system is that it not only teaches its students , but is also willing to learn from them . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german professors are often responsible for too many students " this is a university system that for 200 years or more has been taking tuition from its students , and that has translated into services , and institutes and departments that are well planned and set up , " hans told deutsche welle . unbeatable resources it 's a view shared by german students who have experienced the american system first-hand .
ines eben von racknitz went to stanford university on a scholarship to study chinese , religion and comparative literature .
she was so taken with the whole experience that she said she probably would have done it even if it had meant leaving college with a mountain of debts .
she was amazed at the resources and the attitudes of those on campus . " everyone wants to help you to get a job afterwards ; people are looking after you , " said von racknitz .
" and you have amazing archives and libraries which are open all the time , and professors have open doors , so are always available . " but what stood out to her perhaps more than anything was the enthusiasm with which the academic staff went about their own work and encouraged her in hers . " they are delighted in what they do , they have passion and they are glowing from it , " she continued .
" if you are in academia , you are abandoning riches and fame , so you need to be passionate and delighted ; that is what they are , and it 's very inspiring . " overworked multi-taskers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stanford university : not just a pretty face although von racknitz was at pains to stress that the time she spent at german universities also provided her with an excellent education , she said professors here seem to lack that american elan which can be an invaluable source of inspiration and motivation for students .
the reason for that , experts agree , is that teaching staff at colleges in germany face a much heavier workload than their counterparts across the atlantic . while professors in the us can generally leave the administrative aspect of their work to someone else and concentrate fully on their teaching and research , in germany that is a luxury reserved for professors at well-financed masters programs .
the rest are left to multi-task , which , according to ursula hans , is a problem both for the teaching and the student body . " how can you talk to your advisor if he is responsible for 20 other people ? "
hans asked .
" and how is the advisor going to make time to take care of your student or phd needs if he is involved in other commissions and doing research and serving on other committees ? " aiming high barbara von bechtolsheim , who got her phd at stanford and has taught at colleges in both the states and germany , agrees that german staff are overloaded , but believes that german students could be pushed harder . " i came to stanford with an ma in german studies from munich and i had studied with one of the best professors there , " she said .
" however when i came to stanford , i learned i did n't know much in terms of academic standards . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no matter where you study , there 's no way to avoid hitting the books her four years in california were hard work , but they broadened her horizons and her expectations of herself .
they also left her in no doubt that a us university education has more to offer than a german one .
apart from the resources and the support on offer to students there , she says the first two years in which all undergraduates are given a solid grounding in history , literature and culture , are absolutely invaluable . " it 's a very good idea even if you want to major in math or geology that you have such a broad mind and reference points , " she said .
" in germany , you can go to medical school and if you have n't learned it at home or school , medicine and physics and chemistry is all that is on your mind . " but ursula hans , herself a former us college student , is not convinced of the merit of that approach .
she believes one of the greatest strengths of the german system is that it does not bombard young people with facts , but teaches them to think for themselves . as far as she is concerned , a university education from germany is of an extremely high standard .
she says if there is one thing colleges in germany could perhaps still learn from their american counterparts , it would be the fine art of marketing an identity . if the items for sale in the humboldt store are anything to go by , that lesson has already been taken on board . author : tamsin walker editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

while muslims still face discrimination , many have successfully integrated and are a part of french society , which now has western europe 's largest muslim population .
amira beshallah is one such example of a successfully integrated second-generation french muslim .
after a day of classes at the sorbonne university in paris , she comes home to an apartment near the seine river , where she lives with her parents .
the 19-year-old is earning an undergraduate degree in literature and communications and wants to become a television journalist .
amira 's parents immigrated to france from the north african country of tunisia , but she says she identifies more with france than with the country of her parents ' birth .
" since i 've been little , i 've felt completely french , " she says .
" in fact , i did n't realize that i was any different from the typical french person until i was 15 years old and a man insulted me on the street . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of muslim families settled in france amira says the man called her dirty and then threatened to hit her .
four years on she still gets upset talking about the incident .
since that day , amira says she has understood that she might face discrimination when looking for a job .
but she says she tries to keep a positive attitude .
generation gap sitting beside her mother on the couch , the teenager 's long , dark hair and dangling earrings are a contrast to her mother 's neatly tucked muslim headscarf .
amira 's mother , 48-year-old samira beshallah , works as a licensed nanny and takes care of three preschool-aged children .
samira says the parents do n't mind that she wears a headscarf when she takes their children out for walks or to play in the park and that wearing a headscarf in france is not problematic .
" i feel very , very good here .
i feel completely at home in france , " samira says .
" i raised my children here .
they have all done their studies .
i work , my husband is retired and i feel great . "
a new direction bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france has recently passed a ban on the full-face islamic veil amira , meanwhile , says she is not religious and would never wear a headscarf , although she does refrain from eating and drinking during the islamic fasting month of ramadan .
she says her parents do n't pressure her or their two sons to practice their faith , although she knows they expect her to marry a muslim .
amira says she has only one friend who wears a headscarf , but that most of her friends are n't even muslim .
she admits , however , that political talk over the last few years concerning islamist extremism and the banning of burqas has made her feel uneasy .
" it 's true that , these days , there 's a spotlight on muslims , " she says .
" i guess , since september 11 , people are asking ' who are muslims . '
people want to know who they are .
i guess it worries me a little .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de balkans -pipe- 15.10.2010 serbian ultranationalists struggle against a changing homeland großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the football match was later called off because of the riots serbian ultranationalists who recently sparked football match riots in italy are trying to destabilize serbia , analysts say .
however , their voices are not representative of a country moving increasingly towards europe . it was more than brute violence : the recent heavy rioting at a european football match between italy and serbia in genoa on tuesday could not be put down solely to the actions of a few hooligans .
this tainting of the serbian national team was the result of ultranationalist groups who were bent on venting their discontent with the direction their country is taking , say experts from the brussels think-tank the centre for european policy studies -lrb- ceps -rrb- .
this small part of the serbian population feels unfairly treated and betrayed by the new orientation taken by their country towards europe . this underlying anger has used as its trigger the difficult economic conditions currently affecting serbia , as well as the high levels of unemployment - which stands at around 20 percent - and the still-raw memories of the breakup of yugoslavia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police detained 17 people after the riots the ultranationalists have seemingly set themselves the goal of making as much noise as possible , but , according to the ceps , this does not mean the movement enjoys support from the broader serbian community .
" serbia was and still is a traditional and orthodox country , where the influence of the church and history is big , " explains georg dura , an analyst with ceps .
" but above all , serbia must make peace with the past in order to move on with the future .
the majority of serbs agree with this . "
eye to europe dura says that only one minority within serbia was represented by the ultranationalists , who , he adds , are increasingly " losing ground . "
" they have now realized this and are reacting this way as a result , " dura says .
" they feel their leaders have sold them out by , for example , taking a more moderate approach towards -lsb- the breakaway region of -rsb- kosovo in recent months . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : serbia has not yet recognized kosovo as an independent state the ceps analyst says the government in belgrade has actively been trying to show the european union that it values the fundamental tenants of a free society such as tolerance and democracy through cooperation over kosovo , and by publicly supporting a recent gay pride parade .
traditionalist and nationalist groups in serbia have rejected both these overtures categorically .
according to ceps , the story of serbia over recent years has been unique , and has left the country deeply divided into backward-orientated and forward-looking factions .
for this reason , it is difficult to compare the country of around seven million with other european states .
" as time has passed opposition has disappeared , and the population has become more open and tolerant .
these have all been lessons learned on the way to the eu .
a society must be open , the citizens must have the freedom of speech , " he says , adding that social changes take time , especially when dealing with post-communist states like serbia .
eu support ' integral ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anti-gay protestors clashed with serbian riot police dura says that the european union has supported serbia in the days following the football riots in italy , and must continue to help the country on its path towards eu integration .
" the good relations with the eu have not been clouded by these events .
but the eu must give serbia membership candidate status to immediately shore up their support for democratic change in the country , " dura says .
" the eu must now support serbia politically and economically , " says the analyst , adding that this will provide serbian youth with a brighter future , and encourage the government to continue to make progress on social and political reforms .

however , their voices are not representative of a country moving increasingly towards europe . it was more than brute violence : the recent heavy rioting at a european football match between italy and serbia in genoa on tuesday could not be put down solely to the actions of a few hooligans .
this tainting of the serbian national team was the result of ultranationalist groups who were bent on venting their discontent with the direction their country is taking , say experts from the brussels think-tank the centre for european policy studies -lrb- ceps -rrb- .
this small part of the serbian population feels unfairly treated and betrayed by the new orientation taken by their country towards europe . this underlying anger has used as its trigger the difficult economic conditions currently affecting serbia , as well as the high levels of unemployment - which stands at around 20 percent - and the still-raw memories of the breakup of yugoslavia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police detained 17 people after the riots the ultranationalists have seemingly set themselves the goal of making as much noise as possible , but , according to the ceps , this does not mean the movement enjoys support from the broader serbian community .
" serbia was and still is a traditional and orthodox country , where the influence of the church and history is big , " explains georg dura , an analyst with ceps .
" but above all , serbia must make peace with the past in order to move on with the future .
the majority of serbs agree with this . "
eye to europe dura says that only one minority within serbia was represented by the ultranationalists , who , he adds , are increasingly " losing ground . "
" they have now realized this and are reacting this way as a result , " dura says .
" they feel their leaders have sold them out by , for example , taking a more moderate approach towards -lsb- the breakaway region of -rsb- kosovo in recent months . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : serbia has not yet recognized kosovo as an independent state the ceps analyst says the government in belgrade has actively been trying to show the european union that it values the fundamental tenants of a free society such as tolerance and democracy through cooperation over kosovo , and by publicly supporting a recent gay pride parade .
traditionalist and nationalist groups in serbia have rejected both these overtures categorically .
according to ceps , the story of serbia over recent years has been unique , and has left the country deeply divided into backward-orientated and forward-looking factions .
for this reason , it is difficult to compare the country of around seven million with other european states .
" as time has passed opposition has disappeared , and the population has become more open and tolerant .
these have all been lessons learned on the way to the eu .

" the good relations with the eu have not been clouded by these events .
but the eu must give serbia membership candidate status to immediately shore up their support for democratic change in the country , " dura says .
" the eu must now support serbia politically and economically , " says the analyst , adding that this will provide serbian youth with a brighter future , and encourage the government to continue to make progress on social and political reforms .

dw 's susan stone , however , has discovered the city 's newly flourishing spice scene . it used to be that dining out in germany 's capital meant tepid thai , tasteless tandoori , and so-called salsa that was more at home on tortelloni than tortillas .
adventurous diners were told apologetically , " sorry , we make it mild because germans do n't like hot food , " by waiters who willingly brought supplemental sauces to the table to make up for the blandification of their dishes . so lacking was the welcome warmth of spicy food that chili lovers took to smuggling habaneros , cinnamon gum and hot pepper vinegar from home in our suitcases , and posting plaintive laments online that outline our desperation for flavor . but now , it seems berlin is turning up the heat .
to the relief of many pepper poppers , during the last couple of years , authentically spicy mexican , korean , cajun and indian restaurants have popped up , from hole-in-the-wall greasy but delicious mini cafes , to hip and trendy soju and kimchi bars that let you bibimbap -lrb- rice with mixed vegetables and sometimes meat , topped with a fried egg and hot pepper sauce -rrb- ' til you drop . and , you can now purchase berlin-made chili sauces from burner 's at kreuzberg 's turkish market , as well as tacos from an occasionally roaming food truck . some do n't like it hot bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : potatoes are a staple , even if they 're not the only thing germans eat to its credit , however , german food does not only consist of mindlessly bland potatos .
there are horseradish soft-cheese spreads , pungent mustards , and sharp ginger gummy candies to be found on grocery store shelves - not to mention the currywurst , berlin 's signature fast food dish featuring a sausage doused with ketchup and curry powder . what 's more , a search of your local lakritz shop will probably turn up licorice that will give you a kick in the pants .
but german versions of foreign tongue-tinglers mean that the heat is often lost in translation .
there 's simply no excuse for " sweet chili " potato chips that are more sugar than spice , and jarred salsas that put you to sleep rather than wake up your taste buds . so it 's been quite a tangy surprise to find a host of native-born capsaholics , self-named after capsicum , a botanical word for pepper .
i recently stumbled across felix eichholtz 's spacious pfefferhaus -lrb- pepper house -rrb- hidden in a row of shops behind the monstrous pink alexa mall near berlin 's alexanderplatz .
the shop , the second in a mini-chain started in hannover , stocks such appealingly named concoctions as dave 's burnin ' hot nuts , ass-kickin ' microwave popcorn , and atomic fireballs , as well as a plethora of pepper sauces . imports and inventions a large number of pfefferhaus ' goods come from the caribbean .
most , however , hail from the us , which is a logical source for salsa , as it dethroned ketchup for most consumed condiment in america back in 1991 . still , a good range are home grown , like the best-selling suicide sauces , from grasellenbach in the central german state of hesse , which blend heat with unusual combos like cranberry and cinnamon or apple and curry . then there 's hamburg 's own cola rebell , a cola energy drink flavored with chili and ginger that comes in three strengths .
the story goes that the developers were craving something spicy while out at a bar , and poured some chili sauce into a glass of coke .
they went on to create a drink range , and now even a " solid cola " - a hard-candy version of the beverage . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a double portion , please according to the sales assistant , a majority of pfefferhaus customers are germans .
and one of the store 's partners is a restaurant called el loco that claims to be the hottest restaurant in berlin - but since it touts itself with a tour that includes a strip show , the spice may not be to everyone 's taste . a taste for the chase even as the good -lrb- hot -rrb- stuff becomes more available , for some , it 's the thrill of the chase as much as the thrill of the taste that makes it all worthwhile .
so , many will continue swapping tales of true scorchers , combing the corners of the city for authentic korean food in a dark hole-in-the-wall , ordering tortillas and salsa for delivery from a mexican guy on a bike , and searching out scotch bonnet peppers in asian markets . as for me , i 'm going to keep importing texas pete pepper sauce and thanking my lucky stars for care packages stuffed with red hots and ghost pepper spicy watermelon candy - even though i 'm still shaking chili lime salt out of the lining of my suitcase . author : susan stone editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 15.10.2010 stuttgart need a reality check as gross takes the fall großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : holding gross accountable ignores deeper problems at vfb stuttgart packed off its third coach in three seasons when christian gross was shown the door after a woeful start to the season .
but the club 's position is unlikely to improve until deeper problems are resolved . given that vfb stuttgart never really get going in the bundesliga until after christmas , the sacking of christian gross after just seven games could be construed as jumping the gun slightly .
in the last few seasons , the opening months of the league campaign have always been a slog for vfb , only for the team to discover form and stability in the latter stages .
look at markus babbel 's tenure as coach : stuttgart was wallowing in the lower reaches of the bundesliga in autumn 2008 under armin veh , the coach who had won them the title two seasons prior .
veh was sacked , babbel took over and at the season 's end stuttgart had qualified for the champions league .
then again , look at markus babbel 's tenure as coach in another light .
the following season , babbel oversaw a similarly slow start to that which eventually undermined veh .
the former stuttgart defender was out of the door before the winter break with the team in the relegation zone with only two wins from 15 games and the fans carrying burning torches and threatening to storm the gates of the club - figuratively at least .
enter christian gross .
the swiss coach of great intellect and renown took over from babbel with stuttgart third from bottom and led them to a sixth place finish and qualification to the europa league .
vfb must have hoped that gross was the man to finally find a cure for the split personality which consistently renders the team useless in the run up to winter and sublime by the time spring had sprung .
the fact that stuttgart has endured an even worse start to this season than at any time in the previous three suggests that gross was equally at a loss to reverse the bi-polar nature of the team .
with just one win from seven games , gross is now looking for new employment while stuttgart 's management is once again left looking for answers .
stuttgart need to look beyond the coach bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : something is very wrong at the heart of the swabian club one yo-yo season can be excused .
two can be shrugged off as a coincidence .
three in a row becomes an alarming trend .
the fact that three different coaches , of varying style and experience , have failed to get a grip on stuttgart 's baffling schizophrenia suggests that something is rotten in the state of baden-wuerttemberg .
with assistant manager jens keller installed as caretaker boss for saturday 's basement showdown with fellow underachievers schalke 04 , the question is whether vfb will continue to believe that the choice of coach is at the heart of their seasonal problems , or if the powers-that-be will look closer to home for the source of the rising damp which is threatening to engulf the club .
at first glance , it appears that the club is set to don the blinkers again .
gross had shown " no signs of finding a solution " for the numerous problems plaguing the team , said sporting director fredi bobic , a statement which suggests vfb still believe that the quality of coaching is still the issue .
perhaps it would be more useful to look at the lack of depth and quality of the squad , the allocation of revenue and the boardroom rivalries which are unsettling the whole club .
thin squad , fat stadium investment stuttgart had a busy summer in the transfer market but it was the exit door which saw the most action .
real madrid snapped up sami khedira after his world cup exploits , veteran goalkeeper jens lehmann retired , and a host of adequate but uninspiring squad members -lrb- sebastian rudy , martin lanig , roberto hilbert , and so on -rrb- all trundled off to pastures new .
while many were unlikely to be missed , they did leave vfb short on numbers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stuttgart failed to find a quality replacement for khedira " in each of the past two years , vfb have sold their best player , " clark whitney , a bundesliga expert at goal.com international , told deutsche welle . " in 2009 , it was mario gomez and more recently , it was sami khedira .
khedira and gomez were club icons .
even when out of form , gomez was worth a goal every other game .
khedira , with his tremendous work rate and skill in transition , was a perfect fit for vfb .
pavel pogrebnyak and zdravko kuzmanovic just have n't been good enough as replacements . "
considering the acquistions stuttgart brought in to replace them , simple mathematics showed that stuttgart was in the minus column in terms of quality and cover before the season even began .
despite bringing in johan audel , philipp degen , mauro camoranesi and christian gentner , none of these players have made much impact .
audel and degen have yet to play for the club since arriving due to injuries while the italian camoranesi has found it hard to bed in .
gentner , brought back from a loan spell at vfl wolfsburg , has struggled for form and appears too inexperienced to step into the shoes of khedira and run the midfield .
some blame should then be passed onto fredi bobic , who may be a former club favorite due to his past efforts on the pitch but is still hugely inexperienced in his role as sporting director .
giving bobic the responsibility to conduct transfers has backfired and clashes between bobic and gross regularly brought up the differences between the two men over their demands in the transfer market .
bricks before legs ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stuttgart 's current crop of players do n't make the grade in his defense , bobic has been struggling himself to loosen the club 's purse strings , held possessively by a board committed to remodeling stuttgart 's home ground , the mercedes benz arena .
christian gross told the local stuttgarter zeitung in the days before his sacking that it was clear " the club 's priority has been pointed toward finishing stadium renovations . "
gross never said where he thought the 22 million euros accrued from last season 's champions league campaign went to .
perhaps he did n't need to - it was obvious this was a team built on the cheap .
" stuttgart 's decline has resulted primarily from a disconnection between the club 's sporting and financial goals , " said clark whitney .
" between the sales of gomez and khedira , stuttgart made nearly 50 million euros .
during the same period of time , stuttgart has been reluctant to reinvest .
if their 3.5 million-euro offer for mladen petric was n't laughable , their 1 million-euro maximum bid for andre ayew certainly was .
to further the comedy , stuttgart sent 20-year old rising star sebastian rudy to hoffenheim , and signed 33-year old mauro camoranesi as his replacement . " " naturally , one is led to ask what happened to vfb 's transfer earnings , as well as the 22 million euros earned in the 2009-10 champions league , " whitney added .
" the answer is quite a shock .
delusions of grandeur have prompted the management to invest 73.2 million euros in stadium renovations and expansion .
of course , the mercedes-benz arena could use a bit of refurbishing .
still , you have to wonder whether the management expect 60,000 fans to show up for a second division match . "
failure of leadership to blame the club 's hierarchy is to open another can of worms .
it is no simple matter to say that the board members responsible for the revenue at the club are wholly responsible for draining funds from the playing squad and pumping the euros into the crumbling stands and infrastructure .
in fact , it has been alleged that rivalries in the boardroom have been exacerbated over just this matter .
rather than the suits being all-for-one , one-for-all in their determination to give an ailing team a beautiful home , it appears that club president erwin staudt and chief financial office ulrich ruf were in favor of investing more in the squad this summer , but that their moves to divert cash budgeted for renovation into team building had been vetoed by chairman of the supervisory board dieter hundt .
it ’ s an accusation the hundt has strongly denied , arguing that the club had spent 12.5 million euros on new players , the fifth-highest figure in the bundesliga .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stuttgart 's hundt -lrb- l . -rrb- has some powerful friends perhaps it has less to do with how much is spent than which players the money is spent on .
stuttgart lack quality , and many players appear to have lost belief that they can rescue the season .
moreover , there are rumors of chaos in the dressing room .
one ex-vfb star claimed in a recent sports illustrated report on the team ’ s troubles that the current stuttgart squad is " a rowdy , undisciplined bunch . " it certainly sounds like stuttgart 's problems run far deeper than the inability to find a coach with the know-how to rescue the club from its momentary malaise .
time will tell if those with the power to save the club will realize in time what those problems are , and manage to solve them .
" i personally believe that the board should follow gross out the door , " concluded whitney . " in sporting terms , stuttgart have regressed in recent years while other teams have all improved . " " the relegation of hertha berlin in may was no mistake - they felt safe with the previous year 's fourth place finish , opted not to sign adequate replacements for andriy voronin and josip simunic , and paid the price a year later .
the stuttgart management have taken the same risk ; if vfb are relegated , they can only blame themselves . " author : nick amies editor : matt hermann send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but the club 's position is unlikely to improve until deeper problems are resolved . given that vfb stuttgart never really get going in the bundesliga until after christmas , the sacking of christian gross after just seven games could be construed as jumping the gun slightly .
in the last few seasons , the opening months of the league campaign have always been a slog for vfb , only for the team to discover form and stability in the latter stages .
look at markus babbel 's tenure as coach : stuttgart was wallowing in the lower reaches of the bundesliga in autumn 2008 under armin veh , the coach who had won them the title two seasons prior .
veh was sacked , babbel took over and at the season 's end stuttgart had qualified for the champions league .
then again , look at markus babbel 's tenure as coach in another light .
the following season , babbel oversaw a similarly slow start to that which eventually undermined veh .
the former stuttgart defender was out of the door before the winter break with the team in the relegation zone with only two wins from 15 games and the fans carrying burning torches and threatening to storm the gates of the club - figuratively at least .
enter christian gross .
the swiss coach of great intellect and renown took over from babbel with stuttgart third from bottom and led them to a sixth place finish and qualification to the europa league .
vfb must have hoped that gross was the man to finally find a cure for the split personality which consistently renders the team useless in the run up to winter and sublime by the time spring had sprung .
the fact that stuttgart has endured an even worse start to this season than at any time in the previous three suggests that gross was equally at a loss to reverse the bi-polar nature of the team .
with just one win from seven games , gross is now looking for new employment while stuttgart 's management is once again left looking for answers .
stuttgart need to look beyond the coach bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : something is very wrong at the heart of the swabian club one yo-yo season can be excused .
two can be shrugged off as a coincidence .
three in a row becomes an alarming trend .
the fact that three different coaches , of varying style and experience , have failed to get a grip on stuttgart 's baffling schizophrenia suggests that something is rotten in the state of baden-wuerttemberg .
with assistant manager jens keller installed as caretaker boss for saturday 's basement showdown with fellow underachievers schalke 04 , the question is whether vfb will continue to believe that the choice of coach is at the heart of their seasonal problems , or if the powers-that-be will look closer to home for the source of the rising damp which is threatening to engulf the club .
at first glance , it appears that the club is set to don the blinkers again .
gross had shown " no signs of finding a solution " for the numerous problems plaguing the team , said sporting director fredi bobic , a statement which suggests vfb still believe that the quality of coaching is still the issue .
perhaps it would be more useful to look at the lack of depth and quality of the squad , the allocation of revenue and the boardroom rivalries which are unsettling the whole club .
thin squad , fat stadium investment stuttgart had a busy summer in the transfer market but it was the exit door which saw the most action .
real madrid snapped up sami khedira after his world cup exploits , veteran goalkeeper jens lehmann retired , and a host of adequate but uninspiring squad members -lrb- sebastian rudy , martin lanig , roberto hilbert , and so on -rrb- all trundled off to pastures new .

gentner , brought back from a loan spell at vfl wolfsburg , has struggled for form and appears too inexperienced to step into the shoes of khedira and run the midfield .
some blame should then be passed onto fredi bobic , who may be a former club favorite due to his past efforts on the pitch but is still hugely inexperienced in his role as sporting director .
giving bobic the responsibility to conduct transfers has backfired and clashes between bobic and gross regularly brought up the differences between the two men over their demands in the transfer market .

christian gross told the local stuttgarter zeitung in the days before his sacking that it was clear " the club 's priority has been pointed toward finishing stadium renovations . "
gross never said where he thought the 22 million euros accrued from last season 's champions league campaign went to .
perhaps he did n't need to - it was obvious this was a team built on the cheap .
" stuttgart 's decline has resulted primarily from a disconnection between the club 's sporting and financial goals , " said clark whitney .
" between the sales of gomez and khedira , stuttgart made nearly 50 million euros .
during the same period of time , stuttgart has been reluctant to reinvest .
if their 3.5 million-euro offer for mladen petric was n't laughable , their 1 million-euro maximum bid for andre ayew certainly was .
to further the comedy , stuttgart sent 20-year old rising star sebastian rudy to hoffenheim , and signed 33-year old mauro camoranesi as his replacement . " " naturally , one is led to ask what happened to vfb 's transfer earnings , as well as the 22 million euros earned in the 2009-10 champions league , " whitney added .
" the answer is quite a shock .
delusions of grandeur have prompted the management to invest 73.2 million euros in stadium renovations and expansion .
of course , the mercedes-benz arena could use a bit of refurbishing .
still , you have to wonder whether the management expect 60,000 fans to show up for a second division match . "
failure of leadership to blame the club 's hierarchy is to open another can of worms .
it is no simple matter to say that the board members responsible for the revenue at the club are wholly responsible for draining funds from the playing squad and pumping the euros into the crumbling stands and infrastructure .
in fact , it has been alleged that rivalries in the boardroom have been exacerbated over just this matter .
rather than the suits being all-for-one , one-for-all in their determination to give an ailing team a beautiful home , it appears that club president erwin staudt and chief financial office ulrich ruf were in favor of investing more in the squad this summer , but that their moves to divert cash budgeted for renovation into team building had been vetoed by chairman of the supervisory board dieter hundt .
it ’ s an accusation the hundt has strongly denied , arguing that the club had spent 12.5 million euros on new players , the fifth-highest figure in the bundesliga .

gross never said where he thought the 22 million euros accrued from last season 's champions league campaign went to .
perhaps he did n't need to - it was obvious this was a team built on the cheap .
" stuttgart 's decline has resulted primarily from a disconnection between the club 's sporting and financial goals , " said clark whitney .
" between the sales of gomez and khedira , stuttgart made nearly 50 million euros .
during the same period of time , stuttgart has been reluctant to reinvest .
if their 3.5 million-euro offer for mladen petric was n't laughable , their 1 million-euro maximum bid for andre ayew certainly was .
to further the comedy , stuttgart sent 20-year old rising star sebastian rudy to hoffenheim , and signed 33-year old mauro camoranesi as his replacement . " " naturally , one is led to ask what happened to vfb 's transfer earnings , as well as the 22 million euros earned in the 2009-10 champions league , " whitney added .
" the answer is quite a shock .
delusions of grandeur have prompted the management to invest 73.2 million euros in stadium renovations and expansion .
of course , the mercedes-benz arena could use a bit of refurbishing .
still , you have to wonder whether the management expect 60,000 fans to show up for a second division match . "
failure of leadership to blame the club 's hierarchy is to open another can of worms .
it is no simple matter to say that the board members responsible for the revenue at the club are wholly responsible for draining funds from the playing squad and pumping the euros into the crumbling stands and infrastructure .
in fact , it has been alleged that rivalries in the boardroom have been exacerbated over just this matter .
rather than the suits being all-for-one , one-for-all in their determination to give an ailing team a beautiful home , it appears that club president erwin staudt and chief financial office ulrich ruf were in favor of investing more in the squad this summer , but that their moves to divert cash budgeted for renovation into team building had been vetoed by chairman of the supervisory board dieter hundt .
it ’ s an accusation the hundt has strongly denied , arguing that the club had spent 12.5 million euros on new players , the fifth-highest figure in the bundesliga .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stuttgart 's hundt -lrb- l . -rrb- has some powerful friends perhaps it has less to do with how much is spent than which players the money is spent on .
stuttgart lack quality , and many players appear to have lost belief that they can rescue the season .
moreover , there are rumors of chaos in the dressing room .
one ex-vfb star claimed in a recent sports illustrated report on the team ’ s troubles that the current stuttgart squad is " a rowdy , undisciplined bunch . " it certainly sounds like stuttgart 's problems run far deeper than the inability to find a coach with the know-how to rescue the club from its momentary malaise .
time will tell if those with the power to save the club will realize in time what those problems are , and manage to solve them .
" i personally believe that the board should follow gross out the door , " concluded whitney . " in sporting terms , stuttgart have regressed in recent years while other teams have all improved . " " the relegation of hertha berlin in may was no mistake - they felt safe with the previous year 's fourth place finish , opted not to sign adequate replacements for andriy voronin and josip simunic , and paid the price a year later .
the stuttgart management have taken the same risk ; if vfb are relegated , they can only blame themselves . " author : nick amies editor : matt hermann send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

some humanitarian organizations believe the president 's policy will end a growing trend toward the militarization of aid . for the first time in american history , a us administration has issued a global development policy .
president obama declared during his recent speech before the un millennium goals summit that development is not strictly an end in itself .
instead , it is a component of a wider national security strategy that defends us interests abroad . " my national security strategy recognizes development not only as a moral imperative , but a strategic and economic imperative , " obama said before the un general assembly .
in an era when the defense department is playing an increased role in development , some humanitarian organizations believe the president 's new policy will reverse the growing trend toward the militarization of aid .
new conflicts , new threats for decades , the us had trained its military to deter a conventional soviet military advance into western europe .
but in a wave of unexpected political upheaval , the eastern bloc imploded without a shot being fired .
as a consequence , political leaders in washington questioned the utility of bloated defense budgets in the belief that the " peace dividend " should free up resources for civilian ends .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : humanitarian interventions are designed to protect civilians although the cold war had ended , the peace dividend proved premature . the media broadcast images of social collapse from the battlefields of bosnia and somalia , documenting a growing trend toward war fought within nations instead of between them .
" the end of the cold war to some degree meant the lid came off that had suppressed internal conflicts in many countries , and as a result you then see the breakdown in weaker or failed states , " mark schneider , senior vice president of the international crisis group , told deutsche welle .
" you see the break down of institutions and internal conflicts grow and multiply , " schneider said . " it 's in that context that the united states and the european union view the consequences of failed states and instability as a potential for conflict that can affect their own citizens and interests . "
job of civilians or soldiers ?
as the us military intervened to contain these brutal civil wars , it began to adopt a new humanitarian mandate with the goal of protecting human life instead of destroying it .
the enemy was no longer a uniformed army , but instead the political and economic instability that had led to ethnic cleansing in bosnia and famine in somalia .
commanders on the ground recognized that a process of social collapse could not be reversed by airstrikes .
ultimately , long-term economic and political development would secure victory .
in an ad-hoc fashion , soldiers started taking on traditional civilian roles , acting as policemen , diplomats and social workers .
the front line had vanished , and the difference between military and development objectives had become muddled .
" meanwhile , more and more responsibilities have been delegated to the military , " david bosold , an expert on human security at the german council on foreign relations , told deutsche welle .
" since there is n't a stable security situation , sometimes it 's simply not possible to find development organizations that are willing to go there .
the main problem is that there 's nobody except for the military that can make an impact . "
military taking the lead after september 11 , the convergence of development and defense responsibilities took a new turn .
a transnational network of terrorists had launched an attack on the us from afghanistan , underscoring the dangers of failed states .
in response , policymakers in washington turned to development as a way to defeat terrorism by combating the poverty that leads to social instability and extremism .
the bush administration institutionalized this view by designating three pillars of american foreign policy : defense , diplomacy and development - the 3ds .
however , development agencies such as usaid remained poorly resourced while the defense department 's budget rapidly expanded .
as a result , the military started conducting its own development work .
the goal was not to altruistically satisfy human need , but to advance american interests and win the war on terror .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the military has become increasingly involved in humanitarian and development assistance " the politics of it are rather stark , " noam unger , the director of the foreign assistance reform program with the brookings institution , told deutsche welle .
" the defense industry and the department of defense have assets placed in every political district across the united states . "
" there are bases , manufacturers , suppliers and those are tied to political interests at the local level that feed up to capitol hill and effect funding , " unger continued . " the state department and usaid operate overseas and so the constituency is actually different and that affects the politics . "
development as a weapon of war as the us military struggled to contain growing insurgencies in afghanistan and iraq , military commanders looked for quick ways to win hearts and minds .
in response , the concept of the provincial reconstruction team -lrb- prt -rrb- was introduced .
prts would apply the 3ds by bringing military and civilian agencies together to conduct development work in regions at risk for extremism . the military , however , increasingly became the face of development to the local population .
" it creates a degree of confusion , " gregory adams , director of aid effectiveness at oxfam america , told deutsche welle .
" they -lrb- local population -rrb- do rightly question our intent when they see soldiers involved in this work .
it does n't necessarily increase their trust of troops to a large degree , but it does reduce their trust in civilians . "
the defense department was using development as a weapon of war .
as a consequence , aid agencies voiced concern that a militarization of development was taking place which would undermine their humanitarian objectives .
in search of balance by declaring development vital to us national security , obama 's new strategy - at least in word - makes development indispensible to achieving foreign policy goals .
development becomes important in its own right , not just as an instrument of defense department objectives .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us policy now views development as vital to the national interest " there 's a lot of people involved in development who argue for development for development 's sake , " beth ellen cole , an expert on post-conflict and peacekeeping activities with the united states peace institute , told deutsche welle .
" but in a resource-constrained environment where every dollar is under scrutiny , you have to make a case why development ... is important , " cole said . " if you 're going to elevate development , you have to make a strong case that it 's important to national security . "
the rebalancing of development and defense may signal a change in the way american foreign policy is conducted .
instead of planning how to win wars , policymakers in washington may start planning how to prevent them from ever breaking out .
and an institutional bias toward prevention could reduce the demand for military involvement in development work .
" if the president is going to be serious about the 3ds that define our national security strategy and how we pursue our foreign policy mission , then development needs to have a voice at the table for how those decisions are made , " adams said .
" if you do n't have a development voice at the table you 're basically deciding from the beginning that you 're not going to take a development approach . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : focus : midterm elections in the us eu and us ' must work together , ' says diplomat obama seeks to mobilize disappointed voters foreign donations spark row ahead of us midterm elections shift to the right in midterm elections could affect us foreign policy development policy -pipe- 15.10.2010 obama to give development a larger role in us foreign policy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama announced america 's first global development policy president obama has declared development assistance vital to us national security interests .
some humanitarian organizations believe the president 's policy will end a growing trend toward the militarization of aid . for the first time in american history , a us administration has issued a global development policy .
president obama declared during his recent speech before the un millennium goals summit that development is not strictly an end in itself .
instead , it is a component of a wider national security strategy that defends us interests abroad . " my national security strategy recognizes development not only as a moral imperative , but a strategic and economic imperative , " obama said before the un general assembly .
in an era when the defense department is playing an increased role in development , some humanitarian organizations believe the president 's new policy will reverse the growing trend toward the militarization of aid .
new conflicts , new threats for decades , the us had trained its military to deter a conventional soviet military advance into western europe .
but in a wave of unexpected political upheaval , the eastern bloc imploded without a shot being fired .
as a consequence , political leaders in washington questioned the utility of bloated defense budgets in the belief that the " peace dividend " should free up resources for civilian ends .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : humanitarian interventions are designed to protect civilians although the cold war had ended , the peace dividend proved premature . the media broadcast images of social collapse from the battlefields of bosnia and somalia , documenting a growing trend toward war fought within nations instead of between them .
" the end of the cold war to some degree meant the lid came off that had suppressed internal conflicts in many countries , and as a result you then see the breakdown in weaker or failed states , " mark schneider , senior vice president of the international crisis group , told deutsche welle .
" you see the break down of institutions and internal conflicts grow and multiply , " schneider said . " it 's in that context that the united states and the european union view the consequences of failed states and instability as a potential for conflict that can affect their own citizens and interests . "
job of civilians or soldiers ?
as the us military intervened to contain these brutal civil wars , it began to adopt a new humanitarian mandate with the goal of protecting human life instead of destroying it .
the enemy was no longer a uniformed army , but instead the political and economic instability that had led to ethnic cleansing in bosnia and famine in somalia .
commanders on the ground recognized that a process of social collapse could not be reversed by airstrikes .
ultimately , long-term economic and political development would secure victory .
in an ad-hoc fashion , soldiers started taking on traditional civilian roles , acting as policemen , diplomats and social workers .
the front line had vanished , and the difference between military and development objectives had become muddled .
" meanwhile , more and more responsibilities have been delegated to the military , " david bosold , an expert on human security at the german council on foreign relations , told deutsche welle .
" since there is n't a stable security situation , sometimes it 's simply not possible to find development organizations that are willing to go there .
the main problem is that there 's nobody except for the military that can make an impact . "
military taking the lead after september 11 , the convergence of development and defense responsibilities took a new turn .
a transnational network of terrorists had launched an attack on the us from afghanistan , underscoring the dangers of failed states .
in response , policymakers in washington turned to development as a way to defeat terrorism by combating the poverty that leads to social instability and extremism .
the bush administration institutionalized this view by designating three pillars of american foreign policy : defense , diplomacy and development - the 3ds .
however , development agencies such as usaid remained poorly resourced while the defense department 's budget rapidly expanded .
as a result , the military started conducting its own development work .
the goal was not to altruistically satisfy human need , but to advance american interests and win the war on terror .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the military has become increasingly involved in humanitarian and development assistance " the politics of it are rather stark , " noam unger , the director of the foreign assistance reform program with the brookings institution , told deutsche welle .
" the defense industry and the department of defense have assets placed in every political district across the united states . "
" there are bases , manufacturers , suppliers and those are tied to political interests at the local level that feed up to capitol hill and effect funding , " unger continued . " the state department and usaid operate overseas and so the constituency is actually different and that affects the politics . "
development as a weapon of war as the us military struggled to contain growing insurgencies in afghanistan and iraq , military commanders looked for quick ways to win hearts and minds .
in response , the concept of the provincial reconstruction team -lrb- prt -rrb- was introduced .
prts would apply the 3ds by bringing military and civilian agencies together to conduct development work in regions at risk for extremism . the military , however , increasingly became the face of development to the local population .
" it creates a degree of confusion , " gregory adams , director of aid effectiveness at oxfam america , told deutsche welle .
" they -lrb- local population -rrb- do rightly question our intent when they see soldiers involved in this work .
it does n't necessarily increase their trust of troops to a large degree , but it does reduce their trust in civilians . "
the defense department was using development as a weapon of war .
as a consequence , aid agencies voiced concern that a militarization of development was taking place which would undermine their humanitarian objectives .
in search of balance by declaring development vital to us national security , obama 's new strategy - at least in word - makes development indispensible to achieving foreign policy goals .
development becomes important in its own right , not just as an instrument of defense department objectives .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us policy now views development as vital to the national interest " there 's a lot of people involved in development who argue for development for development 's sake , " beth ellen cole , an expert on post-conflict and peacekeeping activities with the united states peace institute , told deutsche welle .
" but in a resource-constrained environment where every dollar is under scrutiny , you have to make a case why development ... is important , " cole said . " if you 're going to elevate development , you have to make a strong case that it 's important to national security . "
the rebalancing of development and defense may signal a change in the way american foreign policy is conducted .
instead of planning how to win wars , policymakers in washington may start planning how to prevent them from ever breaking out .
and an institutional bias toward prevention could reduce the demand for military involvement in development work .
" if the president is going to be serious about the 3ds that define our national security strategy and how we pursue our foreign policy mission , then development needs to have a voice at the table for how those decisions are made , " adams said .
" if you do n't have a development voice at the table you 're basically deciding from the beginning that you 're not going to take a development approach . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de auto industry -pipe- 15.10.2010 bmw shifts into high gear in south carolina großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bmw will expand production at its us plant bmw is moving production of yet another of its sport-utility vehicles , the x3 , to the united states .
german workers in leipzig now worry that their baby , the pint-sized x1 , may be the next candidate for relocation . german luxury car giant bmw has unveiled plans to build a new production line at its plant in spartanburg , south carolina , for the next-generation of x3 sport-utility vehicles currently manufactured in graz , austria .
the german premium carmaker has been building spartanburg in city since 1994 , concentrating mainly on the larger x5 and x6 models .
bmw sells more cars in the us than in any other country except germany .
its sport-utility range , the x series , is in particularly high demand in america .
that explains why the company is investing 750 million dollars – or 540 million euros – to expand its one and only us plant .
less vulnerable to shifts in exchange rates " the united states is still the biggest market for premium cars , " said bmw chief executive norbert reithofer .
" there 's no doubt - we need to be active there .
and we need to have local production facilities to make ourselves less vulnerable to shifts in the euro-dollar exchange rate . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bmw ceo norbert reithofer says the us is " still the biggest market for premium cars " the addition of the x3 model will see spartanburg 's capacity climb from 160,000 to 240,000 cars per year .
and there 's still room for another production line for what the bavarian automaker describes as a “ high-volume ” model .
" before the crisis , the premium car market in the united states sold about two million vehicles annually , " reithofer said .
" we expect the market will probably reach that volume again in 2013 , so our target for us sales will be about 300,000 units . "
bmw 's plans have seen its south carolina workforce grow more than 25 percent as a result , from 6,000 to 7,600 employees .
regional leaders like senator lindsey graham are delighted .
" this is taking south carolina 's economy in a new direction – for every job created by bmw at this plant , three additional jobs are created to support this plant , " graham said .
" it 's hard to put a figure on it , but it 's meant the world to the state of south carolina . "
good reason to be there bmw is not the only german carmaker with a factory in the united states .
mercedes-benz builds its own suv range in tuscaloosa , alabama .
and volkswagen is constructing a massive production center in chattanooga , tennessee .
it 's no coincidence , analysts say , why these factories are located in the southern part of the us . because the southern states are not highly industrialized , their governments are offering high subsidies to attract new investment .
and the american autoworkers ' union – which is traditionally very strong in the north – does n't have a presence in the south , making it much easier for management to negotiate flexible shift times with the workers .
bildunterschrift : bmw will build its next-generation x3 in spartanburg , south carolina meanwhile , back in germany , unions are asking what the attractive conditions on the other side of the atlantic will mean for the future of bmw workers in germany .
could government subsidies see production of the x1 compact suv shift to south carolina as well ?
for now , bmw chief norbert reithofer says the answer is " no . "
" the main market for the x1 is europe , which is why we 're producing that model in leipzig , " reithofer said .
" and that is where it 's going to stay . "
analysts say that if bmw chooses to produce a fourth vehicle at spartanburg , it would likely be the carmaker 's best-seller 3-series compact .
the bavarian company has n't announced any concrete plans for further expansion , but a precedent already exists .
rival carmaker daimler announced last december that the new generation of mercedes c-class sedan would be built in alabama , ending the model 's assembly in the german town of sindelfingen after more than 25 years .

tymoshenko 's aides say the audit was " politically motivated . " an audit ordered by ukrainian president viktor yanukovych 's government claims that the former government of yulia tymoshenko misappropriated at least 360 million euros -lrb- $ 505 million -rrb- while in power .
the publication of the audit done by us consultants came two weeks before scheduled elections .
according to the audit led by washington law firm trout cacheris , tymoshenko 's government used offshore shell companies , sham contracts and other money-laundering techniques .
for instance , money from selling carbon emission certificates had not been properly used to support environmental projects but to pay old-age pensions , the report claims .
" in a single instance involving the kyoto protocol , funding misapplication exceeded 200 million euros , " said us lawyer marc macdougall .
" in the case of national material reserves the amounts of loss are in the tens of millions of euro . "
" we will make sure ... that our partners around the world and the people of ukraine know their ' heroes ' have been robbing the country for years , " yanukovych said while on a visit to lithuania this week .
audit merely a political move ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aides of tymoshenko called the audit politically motivated aides of tymoshenko have dismissed the audit as being politically motivated , a tool used to tarnish the reputation of the opposition ahead of elections on october 31 .
" that 's an attempt to intimidate the opposition , among them yulia tymoshenko , " said hryhoriy nemyria , who served as tymoshenko 's deputy prime minister . " obviously they are trying to draw off attention from the ukrainian economy , which is not improving but declining .
and one wants to dispel the indignation of how yanukovych is monopolizing the power in ukraine . " susan stewart from the german institute for international and security affairs told deutsche welle that levels of corruption and embezzlement are quite high in ukraine due to the very close connections between politics and the business sector and the strong impact of special interests .
" considering how politics function in ukraine , i 'd say that it 's not unlikely that some of the accusations are indeed valid .
but i think equally important is that it 's just as likely that similar corruption cases took place when yanukovych was prime minister in 2006 and 2007 , " she said .
corruption levels not significantly changed unfortunately , she added , the levels of corruption and embezzlement have not changed significantly over the years .
" it could certainly be the case that money allocated for one purpose was used for another .
and this is actually one problem that the eu has often had with ukraine in terms of implementing agreements that were reached because you really have to do a close monitoring of the process , " said stewart .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the neutrality of yanukovych 's us consultants is being questioned yanukovych 's government allegedly spent 1.4 million euros on the audit done by two law firms and one forensic auditing company .
the us consultants have been criticized by tymoshenko 's aides , accusing them of bias .
" there have been allegations , incorrect though they may be , that this is a witch hunt , " said plato cacheris , one of the us consultants .
" that is not so .
this is a thorough , extensive review of available evidence which we strongly believe supports the conclusions in the audit report . "
neutrality in question but according to stewart , the neutrality of the consultants hired by yanukovych remains questionable .
" i think he hired us consultants primarily to give the impression of being neutral , because if he had used russian or ukrainian consultants , that would have left him open to accusations of bias by the population , " she said .
" i still think it 's an open question as to whether this neutrality is really present as there have been accusations that he and people close to him have worked with this company or a company that took part in the audit before . "
the upcoming election at the end of october is expected to be the first real test of yanukovych 's popularity since he defeated tymoshenko in the run-off for the presidency in february .
the popularity of yanukovych and his regions party has dropped significantly over in recent months as his government has implemented some unpopular economic reforms , such as raising the price of gas .

but i think equally important is that it 's just as likely that similar corruption cases took place when yanukovych was prime minister in 2006 and 2007 , " she said .
corruption levels not significantly changed unfortunately , she added , the levels of corruption and embezzlement have not changed significantly over the years .
" it could certainly be the case that money allocated for one purpose was used for another .
and this is actually one problem that the eu has often had with ukraine in terms of implementing agreements that were reached because you really have to do a close monitoring of the process , " said stewart .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the neutrality of yanukovych 's us consultants is being questioned yanukovych 's government allegedly spent 1.4 million euros on the audit done by two law firms and one forensic auditing company .
the us consultants have been criticized by tymoshenko 's aides , accusing them of bias .
" there have been allegations , incorrect though they may be , that this is a witch hunt , " said plato cacheris , one of the us consultants .
" that is not so .
this is a thorough , extensive review of available evidence which we strongly believe supports the conclusions in the audit report . "
neutrality in question but according to stewart , the neutrality of the consultants hired by yanukovych remains questionable .
" i think he hired us consultants primarily to give the impression of being neutral , because if he had used russian or ukrainian consultants , that would have left him open to accusations of bias by the population , " she said .
" i still think it 's an open question as to whether this neutrality is really present as there have been accusations that he and people close to him have worked with this company or a company that took part in the audit before . "
the upcoming election at the end of october is expected to be the first real test of yanukovych 's popularity since he defeated tymoshenko in the run-off for the presidency in february .
the popularity of yanukovych and his regions party has dropped significantly over in recent months as his government has implemented some unpopular economic reforms , such as raising the price of gas .

immigrant organizations warned that doing so would lead to " stigmatization . " state education ministers in germany have dismissed calls for making german the obligatory language in the country 's schoolyards .
the ministers ended a two-day meeting in berlin on friday saying a ban on immigrants speaking their mother tongue was impossible to enforce and would be counterproductive in efforts to integrate foreign children .
" there will be no steps taken to either ban foreign languages from schoolyards or to impose german as the only language that can be spoken there , " said ludwig spaenle , education minster of bavaria .
the meeting brought together ministers from all 16 german states .
education in germany is not centralized but the responsibly of the regional state governments .
rhineland palatinate education minister doris ahnen said banning foreign languages from schoolyards was " in no way suited " to solve integration problems .
her berlin colleague juergen zoellner added that while there was no doubt that learning german was very important for successful integration , it was " not very helpful " to outright ban children from speaking their mother tongue .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : integration commissioner maria boehmer is in favor of a ban a number of conservative politicians , among them maria boehmer , the government 's commissioner for integration , had previously called for german to be fixed as the obligatory language in schools to help integrate students from immigrant families .
immigrant organizations warn of ' stigmatization ' boehmer 's suggestion was strongly dismissed by immigrant organizations .
in a joint statement , they warned of a " stigmatization of the immigrant languages . "
instead , they argued , multilingualism was to be supported as a basis for cultural diversity in germany .
" focusing on the german language alone only draws attention from the real problems - such as the selective education system , discrimination and the high levels of unemployment among those with an immigrant background , " the statement added .
" banning the mother tongue is not acceptable , " said kenan kolat , head of the turkish community in germany , after talks with the conference of education ministers .
" it was extremely important to me that this unspeakable discussion about german in schoolyards was stopped , " he added .
" this is a good signal for our cooperation in future . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the number of foreign children dropouts is down 30 percent school dropouts on the decline kolat was part of a delegation of immigrant organizations who met with the ministers on friday to discuss progress on a three-year old action plan to improve education for foreign children .
the plan includes , among other things , state-funded programs to foster children 's language skills , as well as measures to stop the rise in the number of children leaving school without any degree .
the average rate of school dropouts among foreign children is more than twice as high as that of german students - but the situation has markedly improved .
" we 've reduced the number of foreign children dropping out of school by up to 30 percent in the last three years , " berlin education minister zoellner said .
both the ministers and the immigrant groups demanded better funding for education programs from the central government .
more all-day schools and better language education in childcare facilities have proven successful in improving immigrants ' educational chances , they said .

immigrant organizations warn of ' stigmatization ' boehmer 's suggestion was strongly dismissed by immigrant organizations .
in a joint statement , they warned of a " stigmatization of the immigrant languages . "
instead , they argued , multilingualism was to be supported as a basis for cultural diversity in germany .
" focusing on the german language alone only draws attention from the real problems - such as the selective education system , discrimination and the high levels of unemployment among those with an immigrant background , " the statement added .
" banning the mother tongue is not acceptable , " said kenan kolat , head of the turkish community in germany , after talks with the conference of education ministers .
" it was extremely important to me that this unspeakable discussion about german in schoolyards was stopped , " he added .

the plan includes , among other things , state-funded programs to foster children 's language skills , as well as measures to stop the rise in the number of children leaving school without any degree .
the average rate of school dropouts among foreign children is more than twice as high as that of german students - but the situation has markedly improved .
" we 've reduced the number of foreign children dropping out of school by up to 30 percent in the last three years , " berlin education minister zoellner said .
both the ministers and the immigrant groups demanded better funding for education programs from the central government .
more all-day schools and better language education in childcare facilities have proven successful in improving immigrants ' educational chances , they said .

immigrant organizations warned that doing so would lead to " stigmatization . " state education ministers in germany have dismissed calls for making german the obligatory language in the country 's schoolyards .
the ministers ended a two-day meeting in berlin on friday saying a ban on immigrants speaking their mother tongue was impossible to enforce and would be counterproductive in efforts to integrate foreign children .
" there will be no steps taken to either ban foreign languages from schoolyards or to impose german as the only language that can be spoken there , " said ludwig spaenle , education minster of bavaria .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de auto industry -pipe- 15.10.2010 bmw shifts into high gear in south carolina großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bmw will expand production at its us plant bmw is moving production of yet another of its sport-utility vehicles , the x3 , to the united states .
german workers in leipzig now worry that their baby , the pint-sized x1 , may be the next candidate for relocation . german luxury car giant bmw has unveiled plans to build a new production line at its plant in spartanburg , south carolina , for the next-generation of x3 sport-utility vehicles currently manufactured in graz , austria .
the german premium carmaker has been building spartanburg in city since 1994 , concentrating mainly on the larger x5 and x6 models .
bmw sells more cars in the us than in any other country except germany .
its sport-utility range , the x series , is in particularly high demand in america .
that explains why the company is investing 750 million dollars – or 540 million euros – to expand its one and only us plant .
less vulnerable to shifts in exchange rates " the united states is still the biggest market for premium cars , " said bmw chief executive norbert reithofer .
" there 's no doubt - we need to be active there .
and we need to have local production facilities to make ourselves less vulnerable to shifts in the euro-dollar exchange rate . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bmw ceo norbert reithofer says the us is " still the biggest market for premium cars " the addition of the x3 model will see spartanburg 's capacity climb from 160,000 to 240,000 cars per year .
and there 's still room for another production line for what the bavarian automaker describes as a “ high-volume ” model .
" before the crisis , the premium car market in the united states sold about two million vehicles annually , " reithofer said .
" we expect the market will probably reach that volume again in 2013 , so our target for us sales will be about 300,000 units . "
bmw 's plans have seen its south carolina workforce grow more than 25 percent as a result , from 6,000 to 7,600 employees .
regional leaders like senator lindsey graham are delighted .
" this is taking south carolina 's economy in a new direction – for every job created by bmw at this plant , three additional jobs are created to support this plant , " graham said .
" it 's hard to put a figure on it , but it 's meant the world to the state of south carolina . "
good reason to be there bmw is not the only german carmaker with a factory in the united states .
mercedes-benz builds its own suv range in tuscaloosa , alabama .
and volkswagen is constructing a massive production center in chattanooga , tennessee .
it 's no coincidence , analysts say , why these factories are located in the southern part of the us . because the southern states are not highly industrialized , their governments are offering high subsidies to attract new investment .
and the american autoworkers ' union – which is traditionally very strong in the north – does n't have a presence in the south , making it much easier for management to negotiate flexible shift times with the workers .
bildunterschrift : bmw will build its next-generation x3 in spartanburg , south carolina meanwhile , back in germany , unions are asking what the attractive conditions on the other side of the atlantic will mean for the future of bmw workers in germany .
could government subsidies see production of the x1 compact suv shift to south carolina as well ?
for now , bmw chief norbert reithofer says the answer is " no . "
" the main market for the x1 is europe , which is why we 're producing that model in leipzig , " reithofer said .
" and that is where it 's going to stay . "
analysts say that if bmw chooses to produce a fourth vehicle at spartanburg , it would likely be the carmaker 's best-seller 3-series compact .
the bavarian company has n't announced any concrete plans for further expansion , but a precedent already exists .
rival carmaker daimler announced last december that the new generation of mercedes c-class sedan would be built in alabama , ending the model 's assembly in the german town of sindelfingen after more than 25 years .

" before the crisis , the premium car market in the united states sold about two million vehicles annually , " reithofer said .
" we expect the market will probably reach that volume again in 2013 , so our target for us sales will be about 300,000 units . "
bmw 's plans have seen its south carolina workforce grow more than 25 percent as a result , from 6,000 to 7,600 employees .
regional leaders like senator lindsey graham are delighted .
" this is taking south carolina 's economy in a new direction – for every job created by bmw at this plant , three additional jobs are created to support this plant , " graham said .
" it 's hard to put a figure on it , but it 's meant the world to the state of south carolina . "
good reason to be there bmw is not the only german carmaker with a factory in the united states .
mercedes-benz builds its own suv range in tuscaloosa , alabama .
and volkswagen is constructing a massive production center in chattanooga , tennessee .
it 's no coincidence , analysts say , why these factories are located in the southern part of the us . because the southern states are not highly industrialized , their governments are offering high subsidies to attract new investment .
and the american autoworkers ' union – which is traditionally very strong in the north – does n't have a presence in the south , making it much easier for management to negotiate flexible shift times with the workers .
bildunterschrift : bmw will build its next-generation x3 in spartanburg , south carolina meanwhile , back in germany , unions are asking what the attractive conditions on the other side of the atlantic will mean for the future of bmw workers in germany .
could government subsidies see production of the x1 compact suv shift to south carolina as well ?
for now , bmw chief norbert reithofer says the answer is " no . "
" the main market for the x1 is europe , which is why we 're producing that model in leipzig , " reithofer said .
" and that is where it 's going to stay . "
analysts say that if bmw chooses to produce a fourth vehicle at spartanburg , it would likely be the carmaker 's best-seller 3-series compact .
the bavarian company has n't announced any concrete plans for further expansion , but a precedent already exists .
rival carmaker daimler announced last december that the new generation of mercedes c-class sedan would be built in alabama , ending the model 's assembly in the german town of sindelfingen after more than 25 years .

german workers in leipzig now worry that their baby , the pint-sized x1 , may be the next candidate for relocation . german luxury car giant bmw has unveiled plans to build a new production line at its plant in spartanburg , south carolina , for the next-generation of x3 sport-utility vehicles currently manufactured in graz , austria .
the german premium carmaker has been building spartanburg in city since 1994 , concentrating mainly on the larger x5 and x6 models .
bmw sells more cars in the us than in any other country except germany .
its sport-utility range , the x series , is in particularly high demand in america .
that explains why the company is investing 750 million dollars – or 540 million euros – to expand its one and only us plant .
less vulnerable to shifts in exchange rates " the united states is still the biggest market for premium cars , " said bmw chief executive norbert reithofer .
" there 's no doubt - we need to be active there .
and we need to have local production facilities to make ourselves less vulnerable to shifts in the euro-dollar exchange rate . "

kraft becomes the first woman to hold the bundesrat presidency . in a unanimous vote , germany 's upper house of parliament has elected hannelore kraft to be its president for the next year .
kraft 's nomination makes her the first woman to head the bundesrat , which represents germany 's 16 states at the federal level .
kraft is a member of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , which is in the minority at the national level .
she became the premier of germany 's most populous state , north-rhine westphalia , earlier this year after a very closely contested election that saw the spd make significant gains .
constitutionally , the bundesrat president ranks below the federal president and acts as his or her substitute .
current bundesrat president jens boehrnsen served as federal president in this capacity for one month after former president horst koehler stepped down in may .
boehrnsen called the bundesrat 's decision to nominate kraft ' historic . '
" what 's normal in society has finally reached another governmental organ , " he said .
kraft is scheduled to take over the bundesrat presidency on november 1 .
the term traditionally lasts one year .

kraft becomes the first woman to hold the bundesrat presidency . in a unanimous vote , germany 's upper house of parliament has elected hannelore kraft to be its president for the next year .
kraft 's nomination makes her the first woman to head the bundesrat , which represents germany 's 16 states at the federal level .
kraft is a member of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , which is in the minority at the national level .
she became the premier of germany 's most populous state , north-rhine westphalia , earlier this year after a very closely contested election that saw the spd make significant gains .
constitutionally , the bundesrat president ranks below the federal president and acts as his or her substitute .
current bundesrat president jens boehrnsen served as federal president in this capacity for one month after former president horst koehler stepped down in may .
boehrnsen called the bundesrat 's decision to nominate kraft ' historic . '
" what 's normal in society has finally reached another governmental organ , " he said .
kraft is scheduled to take over the bundesrat presidency on november 1 .
the term traditionally lasts one year .

the " european green capitals " program aims to ensure cities rise in style to the environmental challenges facing them . healthy competition usually spurs contestants to outdo each other and brings the eventual winner fame and glory .
that 's probably what the 16 representatives from various european cities had in mind when they came together in tallinn , estonia , in may 2006 to launch the european green capital award scheme .
the aim was to encourage cities to achieve higher levels of environmental protection and improve the quality of the urban environment .
the first winner of the competition was stockholm , which served throughout 2010 as europe 's first green capital .
in 2011 , it will be passing the mantle to hamburg in northern germany .
a spirit of healthy competition when it comes to green urban development is long overdue : europe has become an essentially urban society , with four out of five europeans living in towns and cities .
it 's a development seen all over the world , with more than half the world 's population , or about 3.3 billion people , now living in towns and cities .
almost four fifths of greenhouses gases emitted every day originate in cities .
so with most of the environmental challenges facing our society arising in urban areas , the logical conclusion is that it is also these urban areas that need to muster up the commitment and innovation to resolve them .
hamburg meets the mark on several fronts so what 's needed to make cities more environmentally-friendly and liveable in the future ?
the european commission has drafted ten criteria that specifically pinpoint steps to solve environmental challenges in cities , improve the quality of life of its citizens and reduce their global carbon footprint .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : harbor city is a new quarter under development in the old harbor of hamburg , along the river elbe the criteria require the winning city to not just meet high environmental standards but also show it has what it takes to be a role model to inspire other cities and promote best practices .
according to the jury , hamburg won thanks to what it described as “ ambitious climate protection targets . ”
the northern german port city plans to slash its 1990 carbon emissions levels by 40 percent by 2020 , and by 80 percent by 2050 .
cynics might say hamburg won the coveted title because of its lofty goals rather than its current practices .
but that 's only partially true .
hamburg 's ambitious climate targets naturally played a role in its victory but the city already boasts lower per capita carbon emissions than freiburg - another german city that made it to the competition shortlist and one that sees itself as the cradle of the green movement in germany .
latest available official figures show that hamburg 's carbon emissions amounted to 8.84 tones per year per resident in 2006 , compared to 9.28 tones in freiburg in 2005 .
hamburg out-performed the other contestants on many fronts .
the jury deemed its water quality better than in bristol , oslo , freiburg and muenster .
it has equally excellent air quality and an efficient waste management system . the city has also apparently achieved good performance levels in terms of cycling and public transport indicators .
lost opportunities ?
yet some of the rating practices in the competition have raised eyebrows .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bike-friendly german city of muenster also made the shortlist for instance , amsterdam – a bicycle city if ever there was one – was awarded only one point more than hamburg for pro-cycling traffic infrastructure .
the jury commended amsterdam 's impressive achievement in getting more of its residents cycling than driving , noting that nine tenths of its roads are bike-friendly , and that anyone who needs to get in the driving seat now and then can use one of the city 's efficient car-sharing stations .
when it comes to promoting two wheels , amsterdam surely outstrips hamburg , and the german port city may not be making the most of opportunities to catch up .
even hamburg 's new waterfront district hafencity , which is currently being developed , is seen as having failed in some environmental aspects .
the new district will increase the inner city area by 40 percent through filling-up expendable harbor basins .
in itself , this is an exemplary way of preventing geographical expansion into surrounding areas , and one that provides plenty of scope for sustainable urban development .
but instead of integrating bike-friendly strategies into the concept , urban planners have come up with a design that suits first and foremost the needs of motorists .
on track to a greener future the issue has been seized upon by the hamburg future council , which is made up of citizens , companies and associations .
according to its press spokeswoman delia schindler , hamburg owes its european green capital victory less to politicians and more to grassroots activism and local ngos .
but the eu commission jury was n't splitting hairs .
it made a point of praising public commitment to environmental objectives , and hamburg garnered maximum points for its communication strategy .
the jury was impressed by the involvement of young people ; the many environmental networks in operation and the enthusiasm the city shows in cooperating with other environmental organizations within the eu .
it 's planning to spread some of this enthusiasm with the launch of a “ train of ideas . ”
this foresees interested cities within the european green capital award network ‘ owning ' a wagon and traveling around europe to promote their respective green ideas , achievements and future plans - on track to a greener future .

the " european green capitals " program aims to ensure cities rise in style to the environmental challenges facing them . healthy competition usually spurs contestants to outdo each other and brings the eventual winner fame and glory .
that 's probably what the 16 representatives from various european cities had in mind when they came together in tallinn , estonia , in may 2006 to launch the european green capital award scheme .
the aim was to encourage cities to achieve higher levels of environmental protection and improve the quality of the urban environment .
the first winner of the competition was stockholm , which served throughout 2010 as europe 's first green capital .
in 2011 , it will be passing the mantle to hamburg in northern germany .
a spirit of healthy competition when it comes to green urban development is long overdue : europe has become an essentially urban society , with four out of five europeans living in towns and cities .
it 's a development seen all over the world , with more than half the world 's population , or about 3.3 billion people , now living in towns and cities .
almost four fifths of greenhouses gases emitted every day originate in cities .
so with most of the environmental challenges facing our society arising in urban areas , the logical conclusion is that it is also these urban areas that need to muster up the commitment and innovation to resolve them .
hamburg meets the mark on several fronts so what 's needed to make cities more environmentally-friendly and liveable in the future ?
the european commission has drafted ten criteria that specifically pinpoint steps to solve environmental challenges in cities , improve the quality of life of its citizens and reduce their global carbon footprint .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : harbor city is a new quarter under development in the old harbor of hamburg , along the river elbe the criteria require the winning city to not just meet high environmental standards but also show it has what it takes to be a role model to inspire other cities and promote best practices .
according to the jury , hamburg won thanks to what it described as “ ambitious climate protection targets . ”
the northern german port city plans to slash its 1990 carbon emissions levels by 40 percent by 2020 , and by 80 percent by 2050 .
cynics might say hamburg won the coveted title because of its lofty goals rather than its current practices .
but that 's only partially true .
hamburg 's ambitious climate targets naturally played a role in its victory but the city already boasts lower per capita carbon emissions than freiburg - another german city that made it to the competition shortlist and one that sees itself as the cradle of the green movement in germany .
latest available official figures show that hamburg 's carbon emissions amounted to 8.84 tones per year per resident in 2006 , compared to 9.28 tones in freiburg in 2005 .
hamburg out-performed the other contestants on many fronts .
the jury deemed its water quality better than in bristol , oslo , freiburg and muenster .
it has equally excellent air quality and an efficient waste management system . the city has also apparently achieved good performance levels in terms of cycling and public transport indicators .
lost opportunities ?
yet some of the rating practices in the competition have raised eyebrows .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bike-friendly german city of muenster also made the shortlist for instance , amsterdam – a bicycle city if ever there was one – was awarded only one point more than hamburg for pro-cycling traffic infrastructure .
the jury commended amsterdam 's impressive achievement in getting more of its residents cycling than driving , noting that nine tenths of its roads are bike-friendly , and that anyone who needs to get in the driving seat now and then can use one of the city 's efficient car-sharing stations .
when it comes to promoting two wheels , amsterdam surely outstrips hamburg , and the german port city may not be making the most of opportunities to catch up .
even hamburg 's new waterfront district hafencity , which is currently being developed , is seen as having failed in some environmental aspects .
the new district will increase the inner city area by 40 percent through filling-up expendable harbor basins .
in itself , this is an exemplary way of preventing geographical expansion into surrounding areas , and one that provides plenty of scope for sustainable urban development .
but instead of integrating bike-friendly strategies into the concept , urban planners have come up with a design that suits first and foremost the needs of motorists .
on track to a greener future the issue has been seized upon by the hamburg future council , which is made up of citizens , companies and associations .
according to its press spokeswoman delia schindler , hamburg owes its european green capital victory less to politicians and more to grassroots activism and local ngos .
but the eu commission jury was n't splitting hairs .
it made a point of praising public commitment to environmental objectives , and hamburg garnered maximum points for its communication strategy .
the jury was impressed by the involvement of young people ; the many environmental networks in operation and the enthusiasm the city shows in cooperating with other environmental organizations within the eu .
it 's planning to spread some of this enthusiasm with the launch of a “ train of ideas . ”
this foresees interested cities within the european green capital award network ‘ owning ' a wagon and traveling around europe to promote their respective green ideas , achievements and future plans - on track to a greener future .

lost opportunities ?
yet some of the rating practices in the competition have raised eyebrows .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bike-friendly german city of muenster also made the shortlist for instance , amsterdam – a bicycle city if ever there was one – was awarded only one point more than hamburg for pro-cycling traffic infrastructure .
the jury commended amsterdam 's impressive achievement in getting more of its residents cycling than driving , noting that nine tenths of its roads are bike-friendly , and that anyone who needs to get in the driving seat now and then can use one of the city 's efficient car-sharing stations .
when it comes to promoting two wheels , amsterdam surely outstrips hamburg , and the german port city may not be making the most of opportunities to catch up .
even hamburg 's new waterfront district hafencity , which is currently being developed , is seen as having failed in some environmental aspects .
the new district will increase the inner city area by 40 percent through filling-up expendable harbor basins .
in itself , this is an exemplary way of preventing geographical expansion into surrounding areas , and one that provides plenty of scope for sustainable urban development .
but instead of integrating bike-friendly strategies into the concept , urban planners have come up with a design that suits first and foremost the needs of motorists .
on track to a greener future the issue has been seized upon by the hamburg future council , which is made up of citizens , companies and associations .
according to its press spokeswoman delia schindler , hamburg owes its european green capital victory less to politicians and more to grassroots activism and local ngos .
but the eu commission jury was n't splitting hairs .
it made a point of praising public commitment to environmental objectives , and hamburg garnered maximum points for its communication strategy .
the jury was impressed by the involvement of young people ; the many environmental networks in operation and the enthusiasm the city shows in cooperating with other environmental organizations within the eu .
it 's planning to spread some of this enthusiasm with the launch of a “ train of ideas . ”
this foresees interested cities within the european green capital award network ‘ owning ' a wagon and traveling around europe to promote their respective green ideas , achievements and future plans - on track to a greener future .

speaking to reporters before the meeting , baden-wuerttemberg state premier stefan mappus said he wanted to make the debate over the project " more transparent . "
" we want to show people why we see stuttgart 21 as an important project for baden-wuerttemberg , why it 's a project that will last for generations , " he said .
" we also want to back everything up with facts and move beyond emotions , so that everyone can understand it based on concrete arguments . "
two hours into the discussions , project opponents broke them off to confer with each other before resuming them later in the afternoon .
sources close to the talks said both sides disagreed on the conditions for how to proceed .
public fact-check hannes rockenbauch , spokesman for the opposition to the project , said on wednesday morning that he was looking forward to speaking directly to the project 's supporters .
" we 're really excited , because we want to have this public fact-check , " he told public television ard .

despite the negotiations , rockenbauch said another demonstration against the project would go ahead as planned on the weekend .
rockenbauch is joined by six other opponents of stuttgart 21 , including environmental activists and state green party and social democrat politicians .
the other side includes mappus , state transport minister tanja goenner and volker kefer from the german rail company deutsche bahn .
sticking points the state-appointed arbitrator in the debate , veteran politician heiner geissler of angela merkel 's christian democratic union , announced thursday evening after four hours of talks with the project 's opponents that negotiations between both sides would take place .
up until that point the opposition had refused to hold any negotiations with the state authorities until all construction work on the project was put on hold .
on october 5 , mappus instead ordered a moratorium on demolition work to last until november .
a major sticking point for opponents remains in the construction of a cement tank for underground water management , as well as the degree of public access to the disussions .
rockenbauch and other opponents have called for the video of future meetings to be carried live on the internet .
legal reprimand for builders in a parallel development , a stuttgart administrative court found on thursday that the project 's leaders had incorrectly filed their application to cut down trees in the city 's palace gardens as part of the project .

meanwhile the renovation project , which would move the rail station underground and turn it from a terminus to a through-station , gained public support from european commission transport minister siim kallas .
" the high-speed route between paris and bratislava is an extremely important trans-european west-east axis , " kallas told the rheinische post newspaper .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de balkans -pipe- 15.10.2010 serbian ultranationalists struggle against a changing homeland großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the football match was later called off because of the riots serbian ultranationalists who recently sparked football match riots in italy are trying to destabilize serbia , analysts say .
however , their voices are not representative of a country moving increasingly towards europe . it was more than brute violence : the recent heavy rioting at a european football match between italy and serbia in genoa on tuesday could not be put down solely to the actions of a few hooligans .
this tainting of the serbian national team was the result of ultranationalist groups who were bent on venting their discontent with the direction their country is taking , say experts from the brussels think-tank the centre for european policy studies -lrb- ceps -rrb- .
this small part of the serbian population feels unfairly treated and betrayed by the new orientation taken by their country towards europe . this underlying anger has used as its trigger the difficult economic conditions currently affecting serbia , as well as the high levels of unemployment - which stands at around 20 percent - and the still-raw memories of the breakup of yugoslavia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police detained 17 people after the riots the ultranationalists have seemingly set themselves the goal of making as much noise as possible , but , according to the ceps , this does not mean the movement enjoys support from the broader serbian community .
" serbia was and still is a traditional and orthodox country , where the influence of the church and history is big , " explains georg dura , an analyst with ceps .
" but above all , serbia must make peace with the past in order to move on with the future .
the majority of serbs agree with this . "
eye to europe dura says that only one minority within serbia was represented by the ultranationalists , who , he adds , are increasingly " losing ground . "
" they have now realized this and are reacting this way as a result , " dura says .
" they feel their leaders have sold them out by , for example , taking a more moderate approach towards -lsb- the breakaway region of -rsb- kosovo in recent months . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : serbia has not yet recognized kosovo as an independent state the ceps analyst says the government in belgrade has actively been trying to show the european union that it values the fundamental tenants of a free society such as tolerance and democracy through cooperation over kosovo , and by publicly supporting a recent gay pride parade .
traditionalist and nationalist groups in serbia have rejected both these overtures categorically .
according to ceps , the story of serbia over recent years has been unique , and has left the country deeply divided into backward-orientated and forward-looking factions .
for this reason , it is difficult to compare the country of around seven million with other european states .
" as time has passed opposition has disappeared , and the population has become more open and tolerant .
these have all been lessons learned on the way to the eu .
a society must be open , the citizens must have the freedom of speech , " he says , adding that social changes take time , especially when dealing with post-communist states like serbia .
eu support ' integral ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anti-gay protestors clashed with serbian riot police dura says that the european union has supported serbia in the days following the football riots in italy , and must continue to help the country on its path towards eu integration .
" the good relations with the eu have not been clouded by these events .
but the eu must give serbia membership candidate status to immediately shore up their support for democratic change in the country , " dura says .
" the eu must now support serbia politically and economically , " says the analyst , adding that this will provide serbian youth with a brighter future , and encourage the government to continue to make progress on social and political reforms .

jakub blaszczykowski netted the first goal , with nuri sahin scoring the winner in injury time . former champions league winners borussia dortmund have defeated struggling cologne 2-1 away from home in the pouring rain in friday night 's bundesliga clash .
the winner came through nuri sahin in the 91st minute after the midfielder found the back of the net from close range after a goalmouth scramble .
dortmund seized momentum from the outset and should have taken the lead on 17 minutes when a cross from sahin found the head of striker lucas barrios , but the paraguayan put the ball over with the goal at his mercy .
the black and yellow from dortmund did n't have to wait much longer , however , when three minutes later japan international shinji kagawa played the ball into the cologne box where barrios headed it onto the knee of pole jakub blaszczykowski , nicknamed kuba , from which it bounced over the goal line .
the goal sparked cologne into action , but dortmund keeper roman weidenfeller denied attempts from portuguese midfielder petit and german international lukas podolski .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sahin 's goal came late in the game cologne were finally rewarded for their efforts when they tied the match up with eight minutes remaining after a poor dortmund clearance fell to podolski on the edge of the area .
weidenfeller had no chance against his left-footed shot , which clocked at 110 kilometers per hour .
but just as cologne thought they had secured a much-needed point , dortmund struck back with the late winner through sahin .
the win moves dortmund to equal top of the bundesliga , along with mainz , on 21 points , while cologne languish in 16th place and risk dropping another position if either schalke or stuttgart come away with all three points in their saturday game against each other .

jakub blaszczykowski netted the first goal , with nuri sahin scoring the winner in injury time . former champions league winners borussia dortmund have defeated struggling cologne 2-1 away from home in the pouring rain in friday night 's bundesliga clash .
the winner came through nuri sahin in the 91st minute after the midfielder found the back of the net from close range after a goalmouth scramble .
dortmund seized momentum from the outset and should have taken the lead on 17 minutes when a cross from sahin found the head of striker lucas barrios , but the paraguayan put the ball over with the goal at his mercy .
the black and yellow from dortmund did n't have to wait much longer , however , when three minutes later japan international shinji kagawa played the ball into the cologne box where barrios headed it onto the knee of pole jakub blaszczykowski , nicknamed kuba , from which it bounced over the goal line .
the goal sparked cologne into action , but dortmund keeper roman weidenfeller denied attempts from portuguese midfielder petit and german international lukas podolski .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sahin 's goal came late in the game cologne were finally rewarded for their efforts when they tied the match up with eight minutes remaining after a poor dortmund clearance fell to podolski on the edge of the area .
weidenfeller had no chance against his left-footed shot , which clocked at 110 kilometers per hour .
but just as cologne thought they had secured a much-needed point , dortmund struck back with the late winner through sahin .
the win moves dortmund to equal top of the bundesliga , along with mainz , on 21 points , while cologne languish in 16th place and risk dropping another position if either schalke or stuttgart come away with all three points in their saturday game against each other .

however , their voices are not representative of a country moving increasingly towards europe . it was more than brute violence : the recent heavy rioting at a european football match between italy and serbia in genoa on tuesday could not be put down solely to the actions of a few hooligans .
this tainting of the serbian national team was the result of ultranationalist groups who were bent on venting their discontent with the direction their country is taking , say experts from the brussels think-tank the centre for european policy studies -lrb- ceps -rrb- .
this small part of the serbian population feels unfairly treated and betrayed by the new orientation taken by their country towards europe . this underlying anger has used as its trigger the difficult economic conditions currently affecting serbia , as well as the high levels of unemployment - which stands at around 20 percent - and the still-raw memories of the breakup of yugoslavia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police detained 17 people after the riots the ultranationalists have seemingly set themselves the goal of making as much noise as possible , but , according to the ceps , this does not mean the movement enjoys support from the broader serbian community .
" serbia was and still is a traditional and orthodox country , where the influence of the church and history is big , " explains georg dura , an analyst with ceps .
" but above all , serbia must make peace with the past in order to move on with the future .
the majority of serbs agree with this . "
eye to europe dura says that only one minority within serbia was represented by the ultranationalists , who , he adds , are increasingly " losing ground . "
" they have now realized this and are reacting this way as a result , " dura says .
" they feel their leaders have sold them out by , for example , taking a more moderate approach towards -lsb- the breakaway region of -rsb- kosovo in recent months . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : serbia has not yet recognized kosovo as an independent state the ceps analyst says the government in belgrade has actively been trying to show the european union that it values the fundamental tenants of a free society such as tolerance and democracy through cooperation over kosovo , and by publicly supporting a recent gay pride parade .
traditionalist and nationalist groups in serbia have rejected both these overtures categorically .
according to ceps , the story of serbia over recent years has been unique , and has left the country deeply divided into backward-orientated and forward-looking factions .
for this reason , it is difficult to compare the country of around seven million with other european states .
" as time has passed opposition has disappeared , and the population has become more open and tolerant .
these have all been lessons learned on the way to the eu .
a society must be open , the citizens must have the freedom of speech , " he says , adding that social changes take time , especially when dealing with post-communist states like serbia .
eu support ' integral ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anti-gay protestors clashed with serbian riot police dura says that the european union has supported serbia in the days following the football riots in italy , and must continue to help the country on its path towards eu integration .
" the good relations with the eu have not been clouded by these events .
but the eu must give serbia membership candidate status to immediately shore up their support for democratic change in the country , " dura says .
" the eu must now support serbia politically and economically , " says the analyst , adding that this will provide serbian youth with a brighter future , and encourage the government to continue to make progress on social and political reforms .

while muslims still face discrimination , many have successfully integrated and are a part of french society , which now has western europe 's largest muslim population .
amira beshallah is one such example of a successfully integrated second-generation french muslim .
after a day of classes at the sorbonne university in paris , she comes home to an apartment near the seine river , where she lives with her parents .
the 19-year-old is earning an undergraduate degree in literature and communications and wants to become a television journalist .
amira 's parents immigrated to france from the north african country of tunisia , but she says she identifies more with france than with the country of her parents ' birth .
" since i 've been little , i 've felt completely french , " she says .
" in fact , i did n't realize that i was any different from the typical french person until i was 15 years old and a man insulted me on the street . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of muslim families settled in france amira says the man called her dirty and then threatened to hit her .
four years on she still gets upset talking about the incident .
since that day , amira says she has understood that she might face discrimination when looking for a job .
but she says she tries to keep a positive attitude .
generation gap sitting beside her mother on the couch , the teenager 's long , dark hair and dangling earrings are a contrast to her mother 's neatly tucked muslim headscarf .
amira 's mother , 48-year-old samira beshallah , works as a licensed nanny and takes care of three preschool-aged children .
samira says the parents do n't mind that she wears a headscarf when she takes their children out for walks or to play in the park and that wearing a headscarf in france is not problematic .
" i feel very , very good here .
i feel completely at home in france , " samira says .
" i raised my children here .
they have all done their studies .
i work , my husband is retired and i feel great . "
a new direction bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france has recently passed a ban on the full-face islamic veil amira , meanwhile , says she is not religious and would never wear a headscarf , although she does refrain from eating and drinking during the islamic fasting month of ramadan .
she says her parents do n't pressure her or their two sons to practice their faith , although she knows they expect her to marry a muslim .
amira says she has only one friend who wears a headscarf , but that most of her friends are n't even muslim .
she admits , however , that political talk over the last few years concerning islamist extremism and the banning of burqas has made her feel uneasy .
" it 's true that , these days , there 's a spotlight on muslims , " she says .
" i guess , since september 11 , people are asking ' who are muslims . '
people want to know who they are .
i guess it worries me a little .
but still , i do n't feel targeted .
we are against terrorism like everybody else . "
both amira and samira say the beshallah family and thousands of other muslims are completely integrated into the french way of life - proof that muslims can be productive members of western societies .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de aviation -pipe- 15.10.2010 lufthansa investigates the science of airline food großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the final fraunhofer airline food test is in december in a series of tests , german scientists take on how flavor profiles change while in-flight .
so far , lufthansa has decided to make their bread rolls a little more salty . why do so many people order tomato juice aboard airlines ?
over the last several months , the fraunhofer institute for building physics , in holzkirchen , just south of munich , has been trying to find the answer to this question - particulary given that lufthansa serves approximately 1.7 million liters of tomato juice each year .
more broadly , through a series of tests , researchers are trying to determine how flight conditions change the way food and drinks taste while in-flight .
the institute is conducting this research on behalf of lufthansa , which is one of the few airlines in the world that is currently undertaking airplane cuisine research - the final round in the testing series is due to be held in december .
reduced taste perception so far , scientists do know that once at a cruising altitude of approximately 10,000 meters -lrb- roughly 30,000 feet -rrb- , the cabin humidity drops by 15 percent , and the lowered air pressure forces bodily fluids upwards .
with less humidity , people get thirsty more easily as there is less moisture in their throat , which also slows the transport of odors to the brains smell and taste receptors .
" it 's like having a cold , " said florian mayer , the research team 's leader .
" when you have a cold all your nasal mucous swells up and you have reduced odor and taste perception . "

so far , lufthansa has decided to make their bread rolls a little more salty . why do so many people order tomato juice aboard airlines ?
over the last several months , the fraunhofer institute for building physics , in holzkirchen , just south of munich , has been trying to find the answer to this question - particulary given that lufthansa serves approximately 1.7 million liters of tomato juice each year .
more broadly , through a series of tests , researchers are trying to determine how flight conditions change the way food and drinks taste while in-flight .
the institute is conducting this research on behalf of lufthansa , which is one of the few airlines in the world that is currently undertaking airplane cuisine research - the final round in the testing series is due to be held in december .
reduced taste perception so far , scientists do know that once at a cruising altitude of approximately 10,000 meters -lrb- roughly 30,000 feet -rrb- , the cabin humidity drops by 15 percent , and the lowered air pressure forces bodily fluids upwards .
with less humidity , people get thirsty more easily as there is less moisture in their throat , which also slows the transport of odors to the brains smell and taste receptors .
" it 's like having a cold , " said florian mayer , the research team 's leader .
" when you have a cold all your nasal mucous swells up and you have reduced odor and taste perception . "

so far , lufthansa has decided to make their bread rolls a little more salty . why do so many people order tomato juice aboard airlines ?
over the last several months , the fraunhofer institute for building physics , in holzkirchen , just south of munich , has been trying to find the answer to this question - particulary given that lufthansa serves approximately 1.7 million liters of tomato juice each year .
more broadly , through a series of tests , researchers are trying to determine how flight conditions change the way food and drinks taste while in-flight .
the institute is conducting this research on behalf of lufthansa , which is one of the few airlines in the world that is currently undertaking airplane cuisine research - the final round in the testing series is due to be held in december .
reduced taste perception so far , scientists do know that once at a cruising altitude of approximately 10,000 meters -lrb- roughly 30,000 feet -rrb- , the cabin humidity drops by 15 percent , and the lowered air pressure forces bodily fluids upwards .
with less humidity , people get thirsty more easily as there is less moisture in their throat , which also slows the transport of odors to the brains smell and taste receptors .
" it 's like having a cold , " said florian mayer , the research team 's leader .
" when you have a cold all your nasal mucous swells up and you have reduced odor and taste perception . "
mayer and his team are conducting their research in a 30-meter -lrb- approximately 90 feet -rrb- low pressure tubular chamber , built around the front section of a decommissioned airbus a310 .
" we have typical temperatures of 20 degrees celsius -lrb- 68 degrees farenheit -rrb- , " mayer said .
" we have humidity of around 10 to 15 percent and we have a high air exchange rate – all the environmental conditions that are typical for flying aircraft , " mayer said .
" and what 's important we reduce the pressure from normal sea level or here it on ground it is about 950 -lsb- hectopascals -rsb- .
but onboard during cruise you have a normal pressure of around 750 - 800 -lsb- hectopascals -rsb- . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 30-meter low pressure chamber surrounds the front section of the plane inside , everything imitates a normal flight – the seats vibrate , the noise is the same and the human test subjects sniff , sip and munch their way through a long menu of airline food – some merely to taste of specific compounds , others similar to what is served in flight .
stronger spices work better so far , the researchers have already discovered that meals have to be more strongly flavored than those served on the ground .
" spicy food like thai and indian food goes very well because the spiciness does n't change because those dishes are very stable , " mayer said .
" whereas with fish with white sauce you have to and herbs to increase the taste . "
but while lufthansa is n't necessarily serving more curries on-board , its caterers have already been adding more salt to bread rolls as a result of the tests .
mayer noted that this conclusion may also explain the tomato juice observation , as it also lends itself to additives like salt and pepper .
" the flavor profile of tomato juice changes with pressure , " he said .
" so when they taste tomato juice on the ground and give it bad marks and if they do the same test under reduced pressure conditions they give the tomato better marks because tomato juice tastes better under low pressure conditions . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the simulator is built inside of a decommissioned airbus a310 such research remains uncommon industry analysts say that while this research is expensive - few other airlines have gone to such lengths to research airline food , particularly given the trend in low-cost , no-frills airlines that often only sell mediocre pre-packaged sandwiches at best - it may be a way for lufthansa to distinguish itself .
" there are airlines like singapore and lufthansa and others that do put a lot of time and attention to meals , " said henry harteveldt , a travel industry analyst with forrester research in san francisco . " and not only in first and business class but also in economy .
it is the small details that can have a big impact on customer loyalty , satisfaction and willingness to buy again and even to pay more for a ticket . "

while muslims still face discrimination , many have successfully integrated and are a part of french society , which now has western europe 's largest muslim population .
amira beshallah is one such example of a successfully integrated second-generation french muslim .
after a day of classes at the sorbonne university in paris , she comes home to an apartment near the seine river , where she lives with her parents .
the 19-year-old is earning an undergraduate degree in literature and communications and wants to become a television journalist .
amira 's parents immigrated to france from the north african country of tunisia , but she says she identifies more with france than with the country of her parents ' birth .
" since i 've been little , i 've felt completely french , " she says .
" in fact , i did n't realize that i was any different from the typical french person until i was 15 years old and a man insulted me on the street . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of muslim families settled in france amira says the man called her dirty and then threatened to hit her .
four years on she still gets upset talking about the incident .
since that day , amira says she has understood that she might face discrimination when looking for a job .
but she says she tries to keep a positive attitude .
generation gap sitting beside her mother on the couch , the teenager 's long , dark hair and dangling earrings are a contrast to her mother 's neatly tucked muslim headscarf .
amira 's mother , 48-year-old samira beshallah , works as a licensed nanny and takes care of three preschool-aged children .
samira says the parents do n't mind that she wears a headscarf when she takes their children out for walks or to play in the park and that wearing a headscarf in france is not problematic .
" i feel very , very good here .
i feel completely at home in france , " samira says .
" i raised my children here .
they have all done their studies .
i work , my husband is retired and i feel great . "
a new direction bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france has recently passed a ban on the full-face islamic veil amira , meanwhile , says she is not religious and would never wear a headscarf , although she does refrain from eating and drinking during the islamic fasting month of ramadan .
she says her parents do n't pressure her or their two sons to practice their faith , although she knows they expect her to marry a muslim .
amira says she has only one friend who wears a headscarf , but that most of her friends are n't even muslim .
she admits , however , that political talk over the last few years concerning islamist extremism and the banning of burqas has made her feel uneasy .
" it 's true that , these days , there 's a spotlight on muslims , " she says .
" i guess , since september 11 , people are asking ' who are muslims . '
people want to know who they are .
i guess it worries me a little .
but still , i do n't feel targeted .
we are against terrorism like everybody else . "
both amira and samira say the beshallah family and thousands of other muslims are completely integrated into the french way of life - proof that muslims can be productive members of western societies .

while muslims still face discrimination , many have successfully integrated and are a part of french society , which now has western europe 's largest muslim population .
amira beshallah is one such example of a successfully integrated second-generation french muslim .
after a day of classes at the sorbonne university in paris , she comes home to an apartment near the seine river , where she lives with her parents .
the 19-year-old is earning an undergraduate degree in literature and communications and wants to become a television journalist .
amira 's parents immigrated to france from the north african country of tunisia , but she says she identifies more with france than with the country of her parents ' birth .
" since i 've been little , i 've felt completely french , " she says .
" in fact , i did n't realize that i was any different from the typical french person until i was 15 years old and a man insulted me on the street . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of muslim families settled in france amira says the man called her dirty and then threatened to hit her .
four years on she still gets upset talking about the incident .
since that day , amira says she has understood that she might face discrimination when looking for a job .
but she says she tries to keep a positive attitude .
generation gap sitting beside her mother on the couch , the teenager 's long , dark hair and dangling earrings are a contrast to her mother 's neatly tucked muslim headscarf .
amira 's mother , 48-year-old samira beshallah , works as a licensed nanny and takes care of three preschool-aged children .
samira says the parents do n't mind that she wears a headscarf when she takes their children out for walks or to play in the park and that wearing a headscarf in france is not problematic .
" i feel very , very good here .
i feel completely at home in france , " samira says .
" i raised my children here .
they have all done their studies .
i work , my husband is retired and i feel great . "

she says her parents do n't pressure her or their two sons to practice their faith , although she knows they expect her to marry a muslim .
amira says she has only one friend who wears a headscarf , but that most of her friends are n't even muslim .
she admits , however , that political talk over the last few years concerning islamist extremism and the banning of burqas has made her feel uneasy .
" it 's true that , these days , there 's a spotlight on muslims , " she says .
" i guess , since september 11 , people are asking ' who are muslims . '
people want to know who they are .
i guess it worries me a little .
but still , i do n't feel targeted .
we are against terrorism like everybody else . "
both amira and samira say the beshallah family and thousands of other muslims are completely integrated into the french way of life - proof that muslims can be productive members of western societies .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de aviation -pipe- 15.10.2010 lufthansa investigates the science of airline food großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the final fraunhofer airline food test is in december in a series of tests , german scientists take on how flavor profiles change while in-flight .
so far , lufthansa has decided to make their bread rolls a little more salty . why do so many people order tomato juice aboard airlines ?
over the last several months , the fraunhofer institute for building physics , in holzkirchen , just south of munich , has been trying to find the answer to this question - particulary given that lufthansa serves approximately 1.7 million liters of tomato juice each year .
more broadly , through a series of tests , researchers are trying to determine how flight conditions change the way food and drinks taste while in-flight .
the institute is conducting this research on behalf of lufthansa , which is one of the few airlines in the world that is currently undertaking airplane cuisine research - the final round in the testing series is due to be held in december .
reduced taste perception so far , scientists do know that once at a cruising altitude of approximately 10,000 meters -lrb- roughly 30,000 feet -rrb- , the cabin humidity drops by 15 percent , and the lowered air pressure forces bodily fluids upwards .
with less humidity , people get thirsty more easily as there is less moisture in their throat , which also slows the transport of odors to the brains smell and taste receptors .
" it 's like having a cold , " said florian mayer , the research team 's leader .
" when you have a cold all your nasal mucous swells up and you have reduced odor and taste perception . "
mayer and his team are conducting their research in a 30-meter -lrb- approximately 90 feet -rrb- low pressure tubular chamber , built around the front section of a decommissioned airbus a310 .
" we have typical temperatures of 20 degrees celsius -lrb- 68 degrees farenheit -rrb- , " mayer said .
" we have humidity of around 10 to 15 percent and we have a high air exchange rate – all the environmental conditions that are typical for flying aircraft , " mayer said .
" and what 's important we reduce the pressure from normal sea level or here it on ground it is about 950 -lsb- hectopascals -rsb- .
but onboard during cruise you have a normal pressure of around 750 - 800 -lsb- hectopascals -rsb- . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 30-meter low pressure chamber surrounds the front section of the plane inside , everything imitates a normal flight – the seats vibrate , the noise is the same and the human test subjects sniff , sip and munch their way through a long menu of airline food – some merely to taste of specific compounds , others similar to what is served in flight .
stronger spices work better so far , the researchers have already discovered that meals have to be more strongly flavored than those served on the ground .
" spicy food like thai and indian food goes very well because the spiciness does n't change because those dishes are very stable , " mayer said .
" whereas with fish with white sauce you have to and herbs to increase the taste . "
but while lufthansa is n't necessarily serving more curries on-board , its caterers have already been adding more salt to bread rolls as a result of the tests .
mayer noted that this conclusion may also explain the tomato juice observation , as it also lends itself to additives like salt and pepper .
" the flavor profile of tomato juice changes with pressure , " he said .
" so when they taste tomato juice on the ground and give it bad marks and if they do the same test under reduced pressure conditions they give the tomato better marks because tomato juice tastes better under low pressure conditions . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the simulator is built inside of a decommissioned airbus a310 such research remains uncommon industry analysts say that while this research is expensive - few other airlines have gone to such lengths to research airline food , particularly given the trend in low-cost , no-frills airlines that often only sell mediocre pre-packaged sandwiches at best - it may be a way for lufthansa to distinguish itself .
" there are airlines like singapore and lufthansa and others that do put a lot of time and attention to meals , " said henry harteveldt , a travel industry analyst with forrester research in san francisco . " and not only in first and business class but also in economy .
it is the small details that can have a big impact on customer loyalty , satisfaction and willingness to buy again and even to pay more for a ticket . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 15.10.2010 ahead of match day eight , dw pundits are seeing stars großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if you look very hard , you might just find this constellation - promise this season , the dw sports team are predicting the results of all bundesliga matches .
after the last match day 's battering , our pundits hope they 've got their heads back for match day eight . after a two-week international break , match day eight is in ascendance and the dw bundesliga pundits are back at it .
after a poor set of predictions on the last match day -lrb- see below -rrb- , they 've resolved to look to the stars for guidance .
this week 's predictor hopes for the best , but has a ready excuse should things go awry : he 's a gemini , and can blame it on that other guy inhabiting his body .
friday , october 15 cologne-dortmund dortmund have gone from strength to strength this season , getting good individual performances from many a member of their young squad - and all the while , they 've been working for each other on the pitch .
cologne have been mostly hideous , managing a fortunate win over st. pauli and two backs-to-the-wall draws .
fan favorite and mercurial boy prince lukas podolski sounded off this week that his beloved fc was adrift , and hinted he would look for the exit if things did n't turn around soon .
off you go , then .
cologne deserve to be at the table 's foot as richly as dortmund do near the top , and the billygoats should get flogged on friday .
dortmund 3-0 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : van bommel and his , erm , passion will be missing form this match saturday , october 16 bayern-hanover the opening weeks of the season for hanover were surprisingly good - the team busted loose to a 13-point haul in their first six games .
they 're still in third place , but last week 's limp home loss to st. pauli highlighted their weakness : without a full-strength strike partnership of mohamad abdelloue and didier ya konan , hanover are far from dangerous .
ya konan was out two weeks ago , this time it 's abdelloue .
bayern do have injury problems of their own -lrb- diego contento , franck ribery and arjen robben are still out , and miroslav klose , mark van bommel and ivica olic picked up injuries on international duty -rrb- , but they should have more than enough quality to take this one .
bayern 3-1 schalke-stuttgart the bundesliga 's two most hapless sides were all set to square off in a contest to decide who would see their name inserted into a flurry of “ -lsb- insert club name here -rsb- in crisis ” headlines , and whose coach would see a greater flurry of speculation surrounding his future .
then stuttgart went and spoiled the fun , firing christian gross before the match had even been played .
probably for the best , really .
though there is n't much to separate these two in terms of form -lrb- both have been very poor -rrb- , schalke are at home and have a slightly better squad .
thus they should win .
schalke 2-1 werder bremen-freiburg freiburg have been puzzlingly strong this season , defying the odds to win four of their first seven -lrb- including two away -rrb- and have risen all the way to fifth place .
bremen , meanwhile , have been in a funk .
it 's been down to a mixture of injuries to key players like naldo , per mertesacker and claudio pizarro and the kind of sloppy defending bremen have become famous for in recent years .
now mertesacker is back in the starting line-up , pizarro might be able to play as a substitute , and sporting director klaus allof 's -lrb- possibly illegal -rrb- stunt of docking the players ' pay after the 4-1 loss to hanover in week six seems to have done the trick .
bremen could easily have won on the last matchday in leverkusen , and should win easily at home on saturday .
bremen 2-0 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : settle down , adam - your hat-trick came against san marino mainz-hamburg the little club that could may lose some steam from its engine following the international break , what with their young squad having had ample time to let success go to their heads .
then again striker adam szalai , who 's just hit four goals in two games for hungary , might just come back to mainz on a justified high that will fire him up for more .
hamburg , for their part , showed signs of living up to their considerable promise in a gutsy win over kaiserslautern in match day seven , and will be boosted by paolo guerrero 's return from injury .
on the other hand , they are still hobbled by 10 -lrb- ! -rrb- other players from the first-team squad laid low at the moment .
i smell a draw .
draw 2-2 st. pauli-nuremberg a tough one to call , in that not much separates these two sides .
both have punched above the weight of their rather thin squads thus far , nuremberg through a very organized defense , pauli through fitness and a willingness to fight to the very end of a match .
it 's been seven home games since hamburg 's skull-and-crossbones appreciation society has seen their team get a win , and just as many matches since der club has won away .
may the streaks continue .
draw 1-1 wolfsburg-leverkusen both these sides have n't got out of the gate as strongly as they 'd have liked , but neither the pharmaceuticals -lrb- in 4th place on 12 points -rrb- or the wolves -lrb- 8th place , 10pts . -rrb- are so far off the pace for panic to have set in , and in fact are on good form .
that 's in part because both are starting to get good production from strikers who had looked out of it at the season 's opening - wolfsburg 's grafite and leverkusen 's eren derdiyok .
i might have been inclined to go with the home side , but they will be missing goalkeeper diego benaglio , so a draw looks a good bet .
draw 2-2 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eintracht 's ultras are a real sharing , caring group of guys sunday , october 17 kaiserslautern-frankfurt it 's an intriguing match-up between a team that started poorly and may be beginning to fade -lrb- k-town -rrb- , and another that stumbled at first but that now might be finding its sea legs -lrb- eintracht -rrb- .
but nobody 's talking about the game , they 're talking about the potential for fan trouble .
these two clubs are not natural derby rivals , but they are historically the two strongest in their region , and have a history .
eintracht 's ultras , considered by many to be the nastiest " fans " in the bundesliga , certainly are trumpeting this as a trip to see hated rivals , virtually promising violence in internet forums .
much as i 'd like to see them disappointed , i see frankfurt taking the points .
frankfurt 2-1 hoffenheim-moenchengladbach gladbach lead the league by a comfortable margin in goals allowed with 20 , but showed signs in their 1-1 match day seven draw against the often potent wolfsburg that they might have found their way .
hoffenheim , meanwhile , have had a rough few weeks , losing at mainz and bayern -lrb- which is acceptable -rrb- , and drawing away to cologne -lrb- which is n't -rrb- .
a bright spot , however , has been the ice-cold free-kicks of their young icelandic newcomer , gylfi sigurdsson .
he 's scored them in substitute appearances thus far , and now he 's likely to get the start .
i like him to score , and for the hoff to win .
hoffenheim 3-1 last week 's result : 5 points hanover-st .
pauli 0-1 -lrb- dw prediction : 2-0 -rrb- hamburg-kaiserslautern 2-1 -lrb- dw prediction : 1-1 -rrb- mainz-hoffenhein 4-2 -lrb- dw prediction : 3-1 -rrb- moenchengladbach-wolfsburg 1-1 -lrb- dw prediction : 0-2 -rrb- freiburg-cologne 3-2 -lrb- dw prediction : 1-1 -rrb- nuremberg-schalke 2-1 -lrb- dw prediction : 0-1 -rrb- stuttgart-frankfurt 1-2 -lrb- dw prediction : 0-2 -rrb- leverkusen-bremen 2-2 -lrb- dw prediction : 3-4 -rrb- dortmund-bayern 2-0 -lrb- dw prediction : 3-1 -rrb- total for the season : 32 three points for a correct score prediction two points for a correct margin prediction one point for a correct winner prediction author : matt hermann editor : rob turner send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

after the last match day 's battering , our pundits hope they 've got their heads back for match day eight . after a two-week international break , match day eight is in ascendance and the dw bundesliga pundits are back at it .

friday , october 15 cologne-dortmund dortmund have gone from strength to strength this season , getting good individual performances from many a member of their young squad - and all the while , they 've been working for each other on the pitch .
cologne have been mostly hideous , managing a fortunate win over st. pauli and two backs-to-the-wall draws .
fan favorite and mercurial boy prince lukas podolski sounded off this week that his beloved fc was adrift , and hinted he would look for the exit if things did n't turn around soon .
off you go , then .
cologne deserve to be at the table 's foot as richly as dortmund do near the top , and the billygoats should get flogged on friday .
dortmund 3-0 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : van bommel and his , erm , passion will be missing form this match saturday , october 16 bayern-hanover the opening weeks of the season for hanover were surprisingly good - the team busted loose to a 13-point haul in their first six games .
they 're still in third place , but last week 's limp home loss to st. pauli highlighted their weakness : without a full-strength strike partnership of mohamad abdelloue and didier ya konan , hanover are far from dangerous .
ya konan was out two weeks ago , this time it 's abdelloue .
bayern do have injury problems of their own -lrb- diego contento , franck ribery and arjen robben are still out , and miroslav klose , mark van bommel and ivica olic picked up injuries on international duty -rrb- , but they should have more than enough quality to take this one .
bayern 3-1 schalke-stuttgart the bundesliga 's two most hapless sides were all set to square off in a contest to decide who would see their name inserted into a flurry of “ -lsb- insert club name here -rsb- in crisis ” headlines , and whose coach would see a greater flurry of speculation surrounding his future .
then stuttgart went and spoiled the fun , firing christian gross before the match had even been played .
probably for the best , really .
though there is n't much to separate these two in terms of form -lrb- both have been very poor -rrb- , schalke are at home and have a slightly better squad .
thus they should win .
schalke 2-1 werder bremen-freiburg freiburg have been puzzlingly strong this season , defying the odds to win four of their first seven -lrb- including two away -rrb- and have risen all the way to fifth place .
bremen , meanwhile , have been in a funk .
it 's been down to a mixture of injuries to key players like naldo , per mertesacker and claudio pizarro and the kind of sloppy defending bremen have become famous for in recent years .
now mertesacker is back in the starting line-up , pizarro might be able to play as a substitute , and sporting director klaus allof 's -lrb- possibly illegal -rrb- stunt of docking the players ' pay after the 4-1 loss to hanover in week six seems to have done the trick .
bremen could easily have won on the last matchday in leverkusen , and should win easily at home on saturday .
bremen 2-0 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : settle down , adam - your hat-trick came against san marino mainz-hamburg the little club that could may lose some steam from its engine following the international break , what with their young squad having had ample time to let success go to their heads .
then again striker adam szalai , who 's just hit four goals in two games for hungary , might just come back to mainz on a justified high that will fire him up for more .
hamburg , for their part , showed signs of living up to their considerable promise in a gutsy win over kaiserslautern in match day seven , and will be boosted by paolo guerrero 's return from injury .
on the other hand , they are still hobbled by 10 -lrb- ! -rrb- other players from the first-team squad laid low at the moment .
i smell a draw .
draw 2-2 st. pauli-nuremberg a tough one to call , in that not much separates these two sides .
both have punched above the weight of their rather thin squads thus far , nuremberg through a very organized defense , pauli through fitness and a willingness to fight to the very end of a match .
it 's been seven home games since hamburg 's skull-and-crossbones appreciation society has seen their team get a win , and just as many matches since der club has won away .
may the streaks continue .
draw 1-1 wolfsburg-leverkusen both these sides have n't got out of the gate as strongly as they 'd have liked , but neither the pharmaceuticals -lrb- in 4th place on 12 points -rrb- or the wolves -lrb- 8th place , 10pts . -rrb- are so far off the pace for panic to have set in , and in fact are on good form .
that 's in part because both are starting to get good production from strikers who had looked out of it at the season 's opening - wolfsburg 's grafite and leverkusen 's eren derdiyok .
i might have been inclined to go with the home side , but they will be missing goalkeeper diego benaglio , so a draw looks a good bet .
draw 2-2 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eintracht 's ultras are a real sharing , caring group of guys sunday , october 17 kaiserslautern-frankfurt it 's an intriguing match-up between a team that started poorly and may be beginning to fade -lrb- k-town -rrb- , and another that stumbled at first but that now might be finding its sea legs -lrb- eintracht -rrb- .
but nobody 's talking about the game , they 're talking about the potential for fan trouble .
these two clubs are not natural derby rivals , but they are historically the two strongest in their region , and have a history .
eintracht 's ultras , considered by many to be the nastiest " fans " in the bundesliga , certainly are trumpeting this as a trip to see hated rivals , virtually promising violence in internet forums .
much as i 'd like to see them disappointed , i see frankfurt taking the points .
frankfurt 2-1 hoffenheim-moenchengladbach gladbach lead the league by a comfortable margin in goals allowed with 20 , but showed signs in their 1-1 match day seven draw against the often potent wolfsburg that they might have found their way .
hoffenheim , meanwhile , have had a rough few weeks , losing at mainz and bayern -lrb- which is acceptable -rrb- , and drawing away to cologne -lrb- which is n't -rrb- .
a bright spot , however , has been the ice-cold free-kicks of their young icelandic newcomer , gylfi sigurdsson .
he 's scored them in substitute appearances thus far , and now he 's likely to get the start .
i like him to score , and for the hoff to win .

off you go , then .
cologne deserve to be at the table 's foot as richly as dortmund do near the top , and the billygoats should get flogged on friday .
dortmund 3-0 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : van bommel and his , erm , passion will be missing form this match saturday , october 16 bayern-hanover the opening weeks of the season for hanover were surprisingly good - the team busted loose to a 13-point haul in their first six games .
they 're still in third place , but last week 's limp home loss to st. pauli highlighted their weakness : without a full-strength strike partnership of mohamad abdelloue and didier ya konan , hanover are far from dangerous .
ya konan was out two weeks ago , this time it 's abdelloue .
bayern do have injury problems of their own -lrb- diego contento , franck ribery and arjen robben are still out , and miroslav klose , mark van bommel and ivica olic picked up injuries on international duty -rrb- , but they should have more than enough quality to take this one .
bayern 3-1 schalke-stuttgart the bundesliga 's two most hapless sides were all set to square off in a contest to decide who would see their name inserted into a flurry of “ -lsb- insert club name here -rsb- in crisis ” headlines , and whose coach would see a greater flurry of speculation surrounding his future .
then stuttgart went and spoiled the fun , firing christian gross before the match had even been played .
probably for the best , really .
though there is n't much to separate these two in terms of form -lrb- both have been very poor -rrb- , schalke are at home and have a slightly better squad .
thus they should win .
schalke 2-1 werder bremen-freiburg freiburg have been puzzlingly strong this season , defying the odds to win four of their first seven -lrb- including two away -rrb- and have risen all the way to fifth place .
bremen , meanwhile , have been in a funk .
it 's been down to a mixture of injuries to key players like naldo , per mertesacker and claudio pizarro and the kind of sloppy defending bremen have become famous for in recent years .
now mertesacker is back in the starting line-up , pizarro might be able to play as a substitute , and sporting director klaus allof 's -lrb- possibly illegal -rrb- stunt of docking the players ' pay after the 4-1 loss to hanover in week six seems to have done the trick .
bremen could easily have won on the last matchday in leverkusen , and should win easily at home on saturday .
bremen 2-0 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : settle down , adam - your hat-trick came against san marino mainz-hamburg the little club that could may lose some steam from its engine following the international break , what with their young squad having had ample time to let success go to their heads .
then again striker adam szalai , who 's just hit four goals in two games for hungary , might just come back to mainz on a justified high that will fire him up for more .
hamburg , for their part , showed signs of living up to their considerable promise in a gutsy win over kaiserslautern in match day seven , and will be boosted by paolo guerrero 's return from injury .
on the other hand , they are still hobbled by 10 -lrb- ! -rrb- other players from the first-team squad laid low at the moment .
i smell a draw .
draw 2-2 st. pauli-nuremberg a tough one to call , in that not much separates these two sides .
both have punched above the weight of their rather thin squads thus far , nuremberg through a very organized defense , pauli through fitness and a willingness to fight to the very end of a match .
it 's been seven home games since hamburg 's skull-and-crossbones appreciation society has seen their team get a win , and just as many matches since der club has won away .
may the streaks continue .
draw 1-1 wolfsburg-leverkusen both these sides have n't got out of the gate as strongly as they 'd have liked , but neither the pharmaceuticals -lrb- in 4th place on 12 points -rrb- or the wolves -lrb- 8th place , 10pts . -rrb- are so far off the pace for panic to have set in , and in fact are on good form .
that 's in part because both are starting to get good production from strikers who had looked out of it at the season 's opening - wolfsburg 's grafite and leverkusen 's eren derdiyok .
i might have been inclined to go with the home side , but they will be missing goalkeeper diego benaglio , so a draw looks a good bet .
draw 2-2 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eintracht 's ultras are a real sharing , caring group of guys sunday , october 17 kaiserslautern-frankfurt it 's an intriguing match-up between a team that started poorly and may be beginning to fade -lrb- k-town -rrb- , and another that stumbled at first but that now might be finding its sea legs -lrb- eintracht -rrb- .
but nobody 's talking about the game , they 're talking about the potential for fan trouble .
these two clubs are not natural derby rivals , but they are historically the two strongest in their region , and have a history .
eintracht 's ultras , considered by many to be the nastiest " fans " in the bundesliga , certainly are trumpeting this as a trip to see hated rivals , virtually promising violence in internet forums .
much as i 'd like to see them disappointed , i see frankfurt taking the points .
frankfurt 2-1 hoffenheim-moenchengladbach gladbach lead the league by a comfortable margin in goals allowed with 20 , but showed signs in their 1-1 match day seven draw against the often potent wolfsburg that they might have found their way .
hoffenheim , meanwhile , have had a rough few weeks , losing at mainz and bayern -lrb- which is acceptable -rrb- , and drawing away to cologne -lrb- which is n't -rrb- .
a bright spot , however , has been the ice-cold free-kicks of their young icelandic newcomer , gylfi sigurdsson .

in recent years , that has meant moving closer to the us college model . with its vast marble staircase and lofty ceiling , the foyer of the humboldt in central berlin is an imposing space .
it has an air of prestige and learnedness about it .
but that is not all it has . in one corner there is something quite different : the university store , which is filled with shelves and rails of brightly colored clothes bearing the humboldt insignia .
one t-shirt boldly states " my mother wanted me to go to harvard , my father wanted me to go to cambridge , but i wanted to go my way " - that way being the humboldt . and while the university , which ranks among the top 10 in the country , is undoubtedly popular , some 8,000 germans are currently studying at colleges in the united states .
that is fewer than are on programs in the netherlands and austria , but still a large number given the prohibitively expensive fees synonymous with an american university education . ursula hans , director of the international office at the humboldt , said one of the major benefits of the us system is that it not only teaches its students , but is also willing to learn from them . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german professors are often responsible for too many students " this is a university system that for 200 years or more has been taking tuition from its students , and that has translated into services , and institutes and departments that are well planned and set up , " hans told deutsche welle . unbeatable resources it 's a view shared by german students who have experienced the american system first-hand .
ines eben von racknitz went to stanford university on a scholarship to study chinese , religion and comparative literature .
she was so taken with the whole experience that she said she probably would have done it even if it had meant leaving college with a mountain of debts .
she was amazed at the resources and the attitudes of those on campus . " everyone wants to help you to get a job afterwards ; people are looking after you , " said von racknitz .
" and you have amazing archives and libraries which are open all the time , and professors have open doors , so are always available . " but what stood out to her perhaps more than anything was the enthusiasm with which the academic staff went about their own work and encouraged her in hers . " they are delighted in what they do , they have passion and they are glowing from it , " she continued .
" if you are in academia , you are abandoning riches and fame , so you need to be passionate and delighted ; that is what they are , and it 's very inspiring . " overworked multi-taskers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stanford university : not just a pretty face although von racknitz was at pains to stress that the time she spent at german universities also provided her with an excellent education , she said professors here seem to lack that american elan which can be an invaluable source of inspiration and motivation for students .
the reason for that , experts agree , is that teaching staff at colleges in germany face a much heavier workload than their counterparts across the atlantic . while professors in the us can generally leave the administrative aspect of their work to someone else and concentrate fully on their teaching and research , in germany that is a luxury reserved for professors at well-financed masters programs .
the rest are left to multi-task , which , according to ursula hans , is a problem both for the teaching and the student body . " how can you talk to your advisor if he is responsible for 20 other people ? "
hans asked .
" and how is the advisor going to make time to take care of your student or phd needs if he is involved in other commissions and doing research and serving on other committees ? " aiming high barbara von bechtolsheim , who got her phd at stanford and has taught at colleges in both the states and germany , agrees that german staff are overloaded , but believes that german students could be pushed harder .

in recent years , that has meant moving closer to the us college model . with its vast marble staircase and lofty ceiling , the foyer of the humboldt in central berlin is an imposing space .
it has an air of prestige and learnedness about it .
but that is not all it has . in one corner there is something quite different : the university store , which is filled with shelves and rails of brightly colored clothes bearing the humboldt insignia .
one t-shirt boldly states " my mother wanted me to go to harvard , my father wanted me to go to cambridge , but i wanted to go my way " - that way being the humboldt . and while the university , which ranks among the top 10 in the country , is undoubtedly popular , some 8,000 germans are currently studying at colleges in the united states .
that is fewer than are on programs in the netherlands and austria , but still a large number given the prohibitively expensive fees synonymous with an american university education . ursula hans , director of the international office at the humboldt , said one of the major benefits of the us system is that it not only teaches its students , but is also willing to learn from them . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german professors are often responsible for too many students " this is a university system that for 200 years or more has been taking tuition from its students , and that has translated into services , and institutes and departments that are well planned and set up , " hans told deutsche welle . unbeatable resources it 's a view shared by german students who have experienced the american system first-hand .
ines eben von racknitz went to stanford university on a scholarship to study chinese , religion and comparative literature .
she was so taken with the whole experience that she said she probably would have done it even if it had meant leaving college with a mountain of debts .
she was amazed at the resources and the attitudes of those on campus . " everyone wants to help you to get a job afterwards ; people are looking after you , " said von racknitz .
" and you have amazing archives and libraries which are open all the time , and professors have open doors , so are always available . " but what stood out to her perhaps more than anything was the enthusiasm with which the academic staff went about their own work and encouraged her in hers . " they are delighted in what they do , they have passion and they are glowing from it , " she continued .
" if you are in academia , you are abandoning riches and fame , so you need to be passionate and delighted ; that is what they are , and it 's very inspiring . " overworked multi-taskers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stanford university : not just a pretty face although von racknitz was at pains to stress that the time she spent at german universities also provided her with an excellent education , she said professors here seem to lack that american elan which can be an invaluable source of inspiration and motivation for students .
the reason for that , experts agree , is that teaching staff at colleges in germany face a much heavier workload than their counterparts across the atlantic . while professors in the us can generally leave the administrative aspect of their work to someone else and concentrate fully on their teaching and research , in germany that is a luxury reserved for professors at well-financed masters programs .
the rest are left to multi-task , which , according to ursula hans , is a problem both for the teaching and the student body . " how can you talk to your advisor if he is responsible for 20 other people ? "
hans asked .
" and how is the advisor going to make time to take care of your student or phd needs if he is involved in other commissions and doing research and serving on other committees ? " aiming high barbara von bechtolsheim , who got her phd at stanford and has taught at colleges in both the states and germany , agrees that german staff are overloaded , but believes that german students could be pushed harder . " i came to stanford with an ma in german studies from munich and i had studied with one of the best professors there , " she said .
" however when i came to stanford , i learned i did n't know much in terms of academic standards . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no matter where you study , there 's no way to avoid hitting the books her four years in california were hard work , but they broadened her horizons and her expectations of herself .
they also left her in no doubt that a us university education has more to offer than a german one .
apart from the resources and the support on offer to students there , she says the first two years in which all undergraduates are given a solid grounding in history , literature and culture , are absolutely invaluable . " it 's a very good idea even if you want to major in math or geology that you have such a broad mind and reference points , " she said .
" in germany , you can go to medical school and if you have n't learned it at home or school , medicine and physics and chemistry is all that is on your mind . " but ursula hans , herself a former us college student , is not convinced of the merit of that approach .
she believes one of the greatest strengths of the german system is that it does not bombard young people with facts , but teaches them to think for themselves . as far as she is concerned , a university education from germany is of an extremely high standard .
she says if there is one thing colleges in germany could perhaps still learn from their american counterparts , it would be the fine art of marketing an identity . if the items for sale in the humboldt store are anything to go by , that lesson has already been taken on board . author : tamsin walker editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

french government officials still hope to derail the planned deal . earlier this month , international rail services operator eurostar defied opposition from the french government to become the first affiliate of french state-owned train operator sncf to order high-speeds trains made outside of france .
on thursday , the country 's transportation minister stepped up government opposition to the planned 600 million euro -lrb- $ 845 million -rrb- order for german trains by claiming that only those built by france 's alstom could use the channel tunnel . french transportation minister dominique bussereau called eurostar 's selection of siemens " null and void " in an interview with lci television .
the minister repeated government claims that siemens ' trains represent a safety risk - claims that both the channel tunnel intergovernmental commission and eurostar have rejected . " purely safety concerns " bussereau added that the french government 's concerns are purely safety related and not a question of choosing alstom or any other manufacturer .
among the government 's chief concerns : only trains with power units at the front or rear of trains , known as " concentrated traction " systems , could manage fires in tunnels safely .

the trip was part of a series of tests that germany 's deutsche bahn is conducting before it launches its planned service between frankfurt and london . competition for equipment and operations eurostar has decided to overhaul its existing equipment and buy new trains for its routes , which run between london and the continental cities of paris and brussels . the 10 trains that siemens is to deliver will be capable of reaching speeds of 320 kilometers per hour and carry more than 900 passengers , compared to 750 passengers in existing trains .
the new trains will be interoperable , meaning that they can operate across europe 's high-speed rail network . competition is heating up not only on the equipment side but on the operator side , too .
the eurostar fleet overhaul comes amid increasing competition from rival operators to use the channel tunnel .
the european union supports allowing other operators to use cross-border track , provided they fulfill all specifications .

tolerance and openness have marked the arrival of migrants , but the second generation will be the litmus test of successful integration . arabic is often heard as you walk through the streets of lavapies in central madrid . here , traditional tapas bars and bakeries mix with shisha joints , bangaldeshi corner shops and african restaurants .
one of these , doing a swift trade in spicy fish , is run by ibrahima ndiaye .
he has two children with his spanish wife and has enjoyed financial success .
he started out as a night club bouncer and now runs a boutique and this popular restaurant .
he is part of spain 's diverse muslim population , which now numbers around 1.3 million people - just under 3 percent of the overall population of 45 million .
his restaurant is in the same neighborhood where islamic fundamentalists planned the train bombing that killed 191 people march 2004 .
but he says there was no backlash locally .
" i have lived here for many years .
my spanish neighbors know me , they know how i live . it 's true that terrorism has created problems .
when you travel or go to a public place people do look at you now .
but i have n't suffered consequences in my neighborhood . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ibrahima ndiaye runs a successful restaurant in lavapies , madrid minimal conflict an annual survey of the muslim community suggests he is not alone .
some 70 percent of muslims say they feel at home here , and 80 percent say they feel they have adapted well to the spanish way of life .
islam is now the second largest religious domination , with a range of liberal , progressive branches represented , from the moroccan maliki school of thought to the tarikat sufi order from west africa .
spain transformed into a multicultural society with spectacular speed . and yet conflict between communities has been minimal according to madrid 's leading expert on muslim communities , berbabe lopez .
" the person who comes adapts , although they keep the trappings of their culture especially the older generation .
people do n't live in ghettos ; they are spread out all over the country , throughout neighborhoods , " he told deutsche welle .
" and i think that the spanish population - from whom you might have expected more racism - has really absorbed immigrants well .
in almost 15 years - there has been 12 percent immigration .
that has n't happened at such great speed in any other country in europe . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muslim migration has benefitted sweet teeth in spain pix and mix lopez says there is no spanish government ' model of integration ' .
instead , the ruling socialist party has borrowed different policies from other european countries .
the result is neither the assimilation prototype of france nor the multicultural model of the uk .
social integration has been aided by national politicians refusing to talk down muslims .
their response to the terrorist attack was the ' alliance of civilizations ' , a diplomatic push for cooperation between mediterranean cultures that drew on spain 's shared history with morocco .
at home this was mirrored by social cohesion programs .
but in parallel – and perhaps more importantly – there were regular amnesties for the immigrant workers who had powered spain 's construction boom .
in the last ten years over a million people who could prove they were working were granted legal status .
meanwhile all residents – even those without papers – have access to health and education .
and immigrants have not been blamed for the current crisis – even if this may cost votes .
emigrant hosts one reason for this inclusive approach is that spaniards emigrated in living memory . " when i was young we did n't have immigrants .
people here were the migrants .
people came back from germany and switzerland and england at summertime to spend the holidays here , " said ana planet , an arab and islamic studies professor at the madrid autonoma university .
spain also has a legal commitment to religious freedom , which is enshrined in its constitution .
this law tends to foils isolated attempts by town halls to ban veils .
and although they live in a mainly secular society , spaniards still recognize the importance of faith .
" we still consider religion as an important part of life and we are familiar with the this idea that ' you have your religion ' , ' you do that because of your religion ' , " said planet .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : impromptu mosques are springing up across the capital a marginalized group but it is not all positive .
ana explained that full social acceptance is still some way off . catalonia is seeing conflict emerge over the construction of mosques .
and a far-right party plans to field candidates in mayoral elections .
moroccan migrants , who make up around 80 percent of muslims here , tend to bear the brunt of prejudice , and fall within the most marginalized sector of society .
the crisis has left 30 percent out of work , compared to the 20 percent spanish average .
" bear in mind that we immigrants have always had the lowest-qualified jobs .
we do the jobs that no one else wants .
we have very casual contracts , in very bad conditions - you can be fired at any time and all this complicates the process of integration , " said kamal rahmouni from moroccan immigrant association atime .
but rahmouni ended on at upbeat note .
he feels the " complex , long road to integration " is generally going in the right direction .
at the crossroads spain passed the arrivals test but now faces the challenge of meshing these new identities with its own as the children of immigrants come of age .
they will not measure their lives against relatives from their parents ' country of origin but with their peers .
restaurant owner ibrahima -lrb- like 90 percent of muslims surveyed -rrb- believes islam is no barrier to being spanish .
he is convinced his children will have the same chances as classmates .
" i think that opportunities depend on your studies and the abilities of a person .
these days it does n't depend on a person 's color , " he said .
the crisis has made immigrants vulnerable .
but it has also brought down new arrivals by 43 percent .
this may create space for the government to make sure that the second generation of immigrants does enjoy equality of opportunity in the future .

that explains why the company is investing 750 million dollars – or 540 million euros – to expand its one and only us plant .
less vulnerable to shifts in exchange rates " the united states is still the biggest market for premium cars , " said bmw chief executive norbert reithofer .
" there 's no doubt - we need to be active there .
and we need to have local production facilities to make ourselves less vulnerable to shifts in the euro-dollar exchange rate . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bmw ceo norbert reithofer says the us is " still the biggest market for premium cars " the addition of the x3 model will see spartanburg 's capacity climb from 160,000 to 240,000 cars per year .
and there 's still room for another production line for what the bavarian automaker describes as a “ high-volume ” model .
" before the crisis , the premium car market in the united states sold about two million vehicles annually , " reithofer said .
" we expect the market will probably reach that volume again in 2013 , so our target for us sales will be about 300,000 units . "
bmw 's plans have seen its south carolina workforce grow more than 25 percent as a result , from 6,000 to 7,600 employees .
regional leaders like senator lindsey graham are delighted .
" this is taking south carolina 's economy in a new direction – for every job created by bmw at this plant , three additional jobs are created to support this plant , " graham said .
" it 's hard to put a figure on it , but it 's meant the world to the state of south carolina . "
good reason to be there bmw is not the only german carmaker with a factory in the united states .
mercedes-benz builds its own suv range in tuscaloosa , alabama .
and volkswagen is constructing a massive production center in chattanooga , tennessee .
it 's no coincidence , analysts say , why these factories are located in the southern part of the us . because the southern states are not highly industrialized , their governments are offering high subsidies to attract new investment .
and the american autoworkers ' union – which is traditionally very strong in the north – does n't have a presence in the south , making it much easier for management to negotiate flexible shift times with the workers .
bildunterschrift : bmw will build its next-generation x3 in spartanburg , south carolina meanwhile , back in germany , unions are asking what the attractive conditions on the other side of the atlantic will mean for the future of bmw workers in germany .
could government subsidies see production of the x1 compact suv shift to south carolina as well ?
for now , bmw chief norbert reithofer says the answer is " no . "
" the main market for the x1 is europe , which is why we 're producing that model in leipzig , " reithofer said .
" and that is where it 's going to stay . "
analysts say that if bmw chooses to produce a fourth vehicle at spartanburg , it would likely be the carmaker 's best-seller 3-series compact .
the bavarian company has n't announced any concrete plans for further expansion , but a precedent already exists .
rival carmaker daimler announced last december that the new generation of mercedes c-class sedan would be built in alabama , ending the model 's assembly in the german town of sindelfingen after more than 25 years .

german workers in leipzig now worry that their baby , the pint-sized x1 , may be the next candidate for relocation . german luxury car giant bmw has unveiled plans to build a new production line at its plant in spartanburg , south carolina , for the next-generation of x3 sport-utility vehicles currently manufactured in graz , austria .
the german premium carmaker has been building spartanburg in city since 1994 , concentrating mainly on the larger x5 and x6 models .
bmw sells more cars in the us than in any other country except germany .
its sport-utility range , the x series , is in particularly high demand in america .
that explains why the company is investing 750 million dollars – or 540 million euros – to expand its one and only us plant .

some humanitarian organizations believe the president 's policy will end a growing trend toward the militarization of aid . for the first time in american history , a us administration has issued a global development policy .
president obama declared during his recent speech before the un millennium goals summit that development is not strictly an end in itself .
instead , it is a component of a wider national security strategy that defends us interests abroad . " my national security strategy recognizes development not only as a moral imperative , but a strategic and economic imperative , " obama said before the un general assembly .
in an era when the defense department is playing an increased role in development , some humanitarian organizations believe the president 's new policy will reverse the growing trend toward the militarization of aid .
new conflicts , new threats for decades , the us had trained its military to deter a conventional soviet military advance into western europe .
but in a wave of unexpected political upheaval , the eastern bloc imploded without a shot being fired .
as a consequence , political leaders in washington questioned the utility of bloated defense budgets in the belief that the " peace dividend " should free up resources for civilian ends .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : humanitarian interventions are designed to protect civilians although the cold war had ended , the peace dividend proved premature . the media broadcast images of social collapse from the battlefields of bosnia and somalia , documenting a growing trend toward war fought within nations instead of between them .
" the end of the cold war to some degree meant the lid came off that had suppressed internal conflicts in many countries , and as a result you then see the breakdown in weaker or failed states , " mark schneider , senior vice president of the international crisis group , told deutsche welle .
" you see the break down of institutions and internal conflicts grow and multiply , " schneider said . " it 's in that context that the united states and the european union view the consequences of failed states and instability as a potential for conflict that can affect their own citizens and interests . "
job of civilians or soldiers ?
as the us military intervened to contain these brutal civil wars , it began to adopt a new humanitarian mandate with the goal of protecting human life instead of destroying it .
the enemy was no longer a uniformed army , but instead the political and economic instability that had led to ethnic cleansing in bosnia and famine in somalia .
commanders on the ground recognized that a process of social collapse could not be reversed by airstrikes .
ultimately , long-term economic and political development would secure victory .
in an ad-hoc fashion , soldiers started taking on traditional civilian roles , acting as policemen , diplomats and social workers .
the front line had vanished , and the difference between military and development objectives had become muddled .
" meanwhile , more and more responsibilities have been delegated to the military , " david bosold , an expert on human security at the german council on foreign relations , told deutsche welle .
" since there is n't a stable security situation , sometimes it 's simply not possible to find development organizations that are willing to go there .
the main problem is that there 's nobody except for the military that can make an impact . "
military taking the lead after september 11 , the convergence of development and defense responsibilities took a new turn .
a transnational network of terrorists had launched an attack on the us from afghanistan , underscoring the dangers of failed states .
in response , policymakers in washington turned to development as a way to defeat terrorism by combating the poverty that leads to social instability and extremism .
the bush administration institutionalized this view by designating three pillars of american foreign policy : defense , diplomacy and development - the 3ds .
however , development agencies such as usaid remained poorly resourced while the defense department 's budget rapidly expanded .
as a result , the military started conducting its own development work .
the goal was not to altruistically satisfy human need , but to advance american interests and win the war on terror .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the military has become increasingly involved in humanitarian and development assistance " the politics of it are rather stark , " noam unger , the director of the foreign assistance reform program with the brookings institution , told deutsche welle .
" the defense industry and the department of defense have assets placed in every political district across the united states . "
" there are bases , manufacturers , suppliers and those are tied to political interests at the local level that feed up to capitol hill and effect funding , " unger continued . " the state department and usaid operate overseas and so the constituency is actually different and that affects the politics . "
development as a weapon of war as the us military struggled to contain growing insurgencies in afghanistan and iraq , military commanders looked for quick ways to win hearts and minds .
in response , the concept of the provincial reconstruction team -lrb- prt -rrb- was introduced .
prts would apply the 3ds by bringing military and civilian agencies together to conduct development work in regions at risk for extremism . the military , however , increasingly became the face of development to the local population .
" it creates a degree of confusion , " gregory adams , director of aid effectiveness at oxfam america , told deutsche welle .
" they -lrb- local population -rrb- do rightly question our intent when they see soldiers involved in this work .
it does n't necessarily increase their trust of troops to a large degree , but it does reduce their trust in civilians . "
the defense department was using development as a weapon of war .
as a consequence , aid agencies voiced concern that a militarization of development was taking place which would undermine their humanitarian objectives .
in search of balance by declaring development vital to us national security , obama 's new strategy - at least in word - makes development indispensible to achieving foreign policy goals .
development becomes important in its own right , not just as an instrument of defense department objectives .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us policy now views development as vital to the national interest " there 's a lot of people involved in development who argue for development for development 's sake , " beth ellen cole , an expert on post-conflict and peacekeeping activities with the united states peace institute , told deutsche welle .
" but in a resource-constrained environment where every dollar is under scrutiny , you have to make a case why development ... is important , " cole said . " if you 're going to elevate development , you have to make a strong case that it 's important to national security . "
the rebalancing of development and defense may signal a change in the way american foreign policy is conducted .
instead of planning how to win wars , policymakers in washington may start planning how to prevent them from ever breaking out .
and an institutional bias toward prevention could reduce the demand for military involvement in development work .
" if the president is going to be serious about the 3ds that define our national security strategy and how we pursue our foreign policy mission , then development needs to have a voice at the table for how those decisions are made , " adams said .
" if you do n't have a development voice at the table you 're basically deciding from the beginning that you 're not going to take a development approach . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : focus : midterm elections in the us eu and us ' must work together , ' says diplomat obama seeks to mobilize disappointed voters foreign donations spark row ahead of us midterm elections shift to the right in midterm elections could affect us foreign policy development policy -pipe- 15.10.2010 obama to give development a larger role in us foreign policy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama announced america 's first global development policy president obama has declared development assistance vital to us national security interests .
some humanitarian organizations believe the president 's policy will end a growing trend toward the militarization of aid . for the first time in american history , a us administration has issued a global development policy .
president obama declared during his recent speech before the un millennium goals summit that development is not strictly an end in itself .
instead , it is a component of a wider national security strategy that defends us interests abroad . " my national security strategy recognizes development not only as a moral imperative , but a strategic and economic imperative , " obama said before the un general assembly .
in an era when the defense department is playing an increased role in development , some humanitarian organizations believe the president 's new policy will reverse the growing trend toward the militarization of aid .
new conflicts , new threats for decades , the us had trained its military to deter a conventional soviet military advance into western europe .
but in a wave of unexpected political upheaval , the eastern bloc imploded without a shot being fired .
as a consequence , political leaders in washington questioned the utility of bloated defense budgets in the belief that the " peace dividend " should free up resources for civilian ends .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : humanitarian interventions are designed to protect civilians although the cold war had ended , the peace dividend proved premature . the media broadcast images of social collapse from the battlefields of bosnia and somalia , documenting a growing trend toward war fought within nations instead of between them .
" the end of the cold war to some degree meant the lid came off that had suppressed internal conflicts in many countries , and as a result you then see the breakdown in weaker or failed states , " mark schneider , senior vice president of the international crisis group , told deutsche welle .
" you see the break down of institutions and internal conflicts grow and multiply , " schneider said . " it 's in that context that the united states and the european union view the consequences of failed states and instability as a potential for conflict that can affect their own citizens and interests . "
job of civilians or soldiers ?
as the us military intervened to contain these brutal civil wars , it began to adopt a new humanitarian mandate with the goal of protecting human life instead of destroying it .
the enemy was no longer a uniformed army , but instead the political and economic instability that had led to ethnic cleansing in bosnia and famine in somalia .
commanders on the ground recognized that a process of social collapse could not be reversed by airstrikes .
ultimately , long-term economic and political development would secure victory .
in an ad-hoc fashion , soldiers started taking on traditional civilian roles , acting as policemen , diplomats and social workers .
the front line had vanished , and the difference between military and development objectives had become muddled .
" meanwhile , more and more responsibilities have been delegated to the military , " david bosold , an expert on human security at the german council on foreign relations , told deutsche welle .
" since there is n't a stable security situation , sometimes it 's simply not possible to find development organizations that are willing to go there .
the main problem is that there 's nobody except for the military that can make an impact . "
military taking the lead after september 11 , the convergence of development and defense responsibilities took a new turn .
a transnational network of terrorists had launched an attack on the us from afghanistan , underscoring the dangers of failed states .
in response , policymakers in washington turned to development as a way to defeat terrorism by combating the poverty that leads to social instability and extremism .
the bush administration institutionalized this view by designating three pillars of american foreign policy : defense , diplomacy and development - the 3ds .
however , development agencies such as usaid remained poorly resourced while the defense department 's budget rapidly expanded .
as a result , the military started conducting its own development work .
the goal was not to altruistically satisfy human need , but to advance american interests and win the war on terror .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the military has become increasingly involved in humanitarian and development assistance " the politics of it are rather stark , " noam unger , the director of the foreign assistance reform program with the brookings institution , told deutsche welle .
" the defense industry and the department of defense have assets placed in every political district across the united states . "
" there are bases , manufacturers , suppliers and those are tied to political interests at the local level that feed up to capitol hill and effect funding , " unger continued . " the state department and usaid operate overseas and so the constituency is actually different and that affects the politics . "
development as a weapon of war as the us military struggled to contain growing insurgencies in afghanistan and iraq , military commanders looked for quick ways to win hearts and minds .
in response , the concept of the provincial reconstruction team -lrb- prt -rrb- was introduced .
prts would apply the 3ds by bringing military and civilian agencies together to conduct development work in regions at risk for extremism . the military , however , increasingly became the face of development to the local population .
" it creates a degree of confusion , " gregory adams , director of aid effectiveness at oxfam america , told deutsche welle .
" they -lrb- local population -rrb- do rightly question our intent when they see soldiers involved in this work .
it does n't necessarily increase their trust of troops to a large degree , but it does reduce their trust in civilians . "
the defense department was using development as a weapon of war .
as a consequence , aid agencies voiced concern that a militarization of development was taking place which would undermine their humanitarian objectives .
in search of balance by declaring development vital to us national security , obama 's new strategy - at least in word - makes development indispensible to achieving foreign policy goals .
development becomes important in its own right , not just as an instrument of defense department objectives .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us policy now views development as vital to the national interest " there 's a lot of people involved in development who argue for development for development 's sake , " beth ellen cole , an expert on post-conflict and peacekeeping activities with the united states peace institute , told deutsche welle .
" but in a resource-constrained environment where every dollar is under scrutiny , you have to make a case why development ... is important , " cole said . " if you 're going to elevate development , you have to make a strong case that it 's important to national security . "
the rebalancing of development and defense may signal a change in the way american foreign policy is conducted .
instead of planning how to win wars , policymakers in washington may start planning how to prevent them from ever breaking out .
and an institutional bias toward prevention could reduce the demand for military involvement in development work .
" if the president is going to be serious about the 3ds that define our national security strategy and how we pursue our foreign policy mission , then development needs to have a voice at the table for how those decisions are made , " adams said .
" if you do n't have a development voice at the table you 're basically deciding from the beginning that you 're not going to take a development approach . "
