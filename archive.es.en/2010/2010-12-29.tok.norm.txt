these hackers say society should be worried about personal data collected by governments about us . on monday , two berlin mobile security researchers outlined what they 've dubbed the " sms of death " attack , which they claim could potentially could affect significant portions of mobile phones worldwide , the overwhelming majority of which are non-smartphones , like an iphone or android .
by flooding these mobiles with hundreds of thousands of malicious texts , they were able to discover bugs within the phones text-message reading software , that in some cases would force the phone to get stuck in a reboot loop .
and that was just day one of the 27th annual chaos communication congress , the annual gathering of the chaos computer club , currently going on this week in the german capital .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new attack could affect millions of mobile phones the two german researchers , collin mulliner and nico golde , from the technical university of berlin , claimed that their attack potentially could affect older-generation mobile phones made by sony ericsson , samsung , motorola , micromax and lg .
mulliner theorized that a large scale such attack might be overwhelming to a mobile network by inducing " ten thousand mobiles to try to reconnect simultaneously . "
amongst the 3,000 attendees , there 's a majority of very pale , sometimes chubby men , with laptops under their arms who look like they have n't seen a lot of sunlight , there are also students , a few hipsters and women in attendance .
during the conference , which concludes on thursday , participants take part in lectures and workshops on political and technical topics - from censorship , data surveillance and copyright , to voip security and hacking smart phones .
attendees can even buy sim cards to use a special , experimental mobile phone network set up solely for this conference .
wikileaks first debuted at the 2007 ccc congress the chaos computer club , or ccc , was founded in berlin in 1981 and is one of the world 's oldest self-desecribed hacker clubs .
since that time , the ccc has become known for consistently exposing security flaws and challenged the trend of heightened data surveillance since the september 11 , 2001 attacks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in 2008 , the ccc published the fingerprints of germany 's interior minister to protest the authorities ' increasing use of biometric data , in march 2008 , the ccc acquired the german interior minister 's fingerprints , which they took from a water glass the politician used at a public speaking event .
they took that imprint and published them as a way to protest the increased use of biometric data in germany and to highlight the insecure nature of such data .
three years ago , at the 2007 congress , wikileaks founder julian assange presented an early sketch of the now-contraversial website .
there , he met ccc member , daniel domscheit-berg , -lrb- then known by his alias , daniel schmitt -rrb- , who until a few months ago was considered assange 's number two at wikileaks .
while the two groups are not formally affiliated , frank rosengart , a chaos computer club spokesperson , said that his organization supports wikileaks because both groups have similar goals , especially around the issues of more transparency in government , or what rosengart calls " machine-readable government . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wikileaks founder julian assange presented his website to the ccc in 2007 " wikileaks , for us , it 's the right way to do it , to publish information , " said rosengart .
" keeping the privacy and keeping the sources anonymous - that 's a very important part of software and this can be considered a good hack to set up such a system that works in this way . "
rosengart said that first and foremost the congress is a meeting place for technical collaboration to take place - as was the case with wikileaks .
" there are a lot of projects like open-source programming projects and some people they meet here for the first time in real life , " he said .
" so they know them online , they work together , they do software together , but they meet here for the first time . "
data retention policies on the rise this week at the ccc congress are a number of talks at the congress about data retention , which has increased dramatically in the last nine years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in december 2007 , assange met daniel domscheit-berg , who until recently was wikileaks ' number two in an attempt to prevent further terrorist attacks , many governments , including the united states and germany , have increased the amount and type of data they keep on each citizen .
one of the groups participating this year is ak vorrat - the working group on data retention - that lead a campaign protesting against the introduction of a data retention law in germany in 2008 .
the group 's efforts were successful and in march 2010 the law was declarecd unconstitutional by the german constitutional court .
however , this year , ak vorrat has focused its attention on the 2011 census .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many club members are worried about what types of data should be collected by governments " there is some data that should not be collected , " said michael ebeling , an ak vorrat spokesperson , who said the group is particularly concerned about certain lines of questioning in the german census .
" if you are not coming from germany , they are asking you where are you coming from , where are your father , your mother coming from ? " he said . " what kind of religion do you believe in ? if you are islamic believer then they ask very precisely , are you sunni or shiite .
and we ask why do they ask these things ? "
he added that for christians , there are no follow up questions about a person 's particular denomination , and noted that people who do n't fill out the forms correctly could face further questioning and or a hefty fine .
ak vorrat is also concerned because the data people put on the census forms will not be made anonymous for four to six years , and given the sensitive nature of much of this personal data , they fear that it could be misused by politicians - in the name of fighting terrorism .
increasing surveillance across the european union bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chaos computer club members are also concerned about the use of such data around europe but this year 's attendees are not just concerned about surveillance measures within germany .
the forum of computer scientists for peace and social responsibility association -lrb- fiff -rrb- , is a german non-profit organization focusing mainly on privacy and security issues , as well as the use of technology in weapons , robots and cyber-warfare .
on wednesday , fiff members gave a presentation about a european research project called indect that develops surveillance techniques for the authorities .
indect was initiated by the polish platform for homeland security , and according to its website , aims to " develop new , advanced and innovative algorithms and methods aiming at combating terrorism and other criminal activities affecting citizens ' safety . "
kai nothdurft , a student at the university of bremen , and a fiff member , said that indect is all about meticulously aggregating data from different sources - from websites , social networks , government databases and filming demonstrations using unmanned aerial vehicles , or uavs .
" they combine -lsb- data -rsb- with pictures they get from surveillance cameras , cctv cameras from public places and by using face recognition , " he said , adding that social networking photos can also be used as a surveillance tool .
" that 's a very dangerous thing because there 's an empowerment of all these surveillance techniques by really combining all these things . ”
lockpicking : the original hack bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german lockpicking club also had a stand at the conference while there 's a big focus on political issues at the conference , there are also fun and practical workshops like how to recover your data if your hard drive crashes , how to hack your playstation 3 console , and there 's even a stand for germany 's lockpicking club .
" if you enter a door without a key and if you open a lock without a key , it 's a hacking technique too , " said one female member of the club , who goes by the nom de hacker , snow goose .
however , she was quick to explain that the club has strict ethical ground rules .
" -lsb- we do n't teach -rsb- anybody to break into other peoples ' houses , " she said .
" always pick your own locks only ! "
similarly , for many attendees , this strong confluence of curiosity , technical inquiry , civic-mindendness and ethics is what unites all hackers .
" for me its more a lifestyle , " said frank rosengart , the ccc spokesperson .
" hacking is asking more questions , trying to understand , using electronic devices in a different way than the manual proposes .
i think we need to go out to the world with this kind of lifestyle and trying to make a better world . "

transportation in germany and around europe has been severely disrupted this winter with heavy snowfall and icy conditions .
the chairman of the bundestag 's transportation committee , winfried hermann of the opposition green party , told the berlin-based newspaper tagesspiegel that deutsche bahn must utilize all its available trains traveling routes around europe in order to cope with domestic demand in such circumstances .
he said this might mean deutsche bahn would have to put the brakes on its expansion aims , including plans for an intercity express to london from 2013 .
transportation spokesman uwe beckmeyer from the opposition social democrats called on the government to not to weaken support for deutsche bahn , which has struggled to maintain effective and regular services during particularly icy or snowy periods this winter .
" the company needs every cent to invest in better equipment , " he told tagesspiegel .
according to the tagesspiegel , deutsche bahn came to the conclusion in october that it did not own enough trains to ensure regular services during " extraordinary circumstances . "
around nine percent of deutsche bahn 's intercity express trains are currently unavailable for use due to frequent and long-term maintenance .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de aviation -pipe- 29.12.2010 german airport boss sparks debate about passenger profiling großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : passenger profiling would be partly based on ethnicity the future president of the german airport association has called for checks based on age , sex and ethnicity for " high-risk passengers . "
but the german justice minister has flatly rejected the idea . the ceo of dusseldorf airport , christoph blume , said he wanted to introduce passenger profiling in german airports to fight terrorism .
the system would be similar to that used in israel , where passengers are categorized as high or low risk according to their age , sex , ethnic background and other criteria . " in this way , the security systems can be more effectively used to benefit all those involved , " blume , who will become president of the german airport association -lrb- adv -rrb- in january , told the german newspaper rheinische post on tuesday .
high-risk passengers - those deemed more likely to carry out terrorist or illegal activity , such as organized crime , drug trafficking or espionage - would undergo more stringent security checks .
this could mean anything from a bag search to a full body search .
blume is n't alone in calling for more targeted checks .
current procedures are n't working according to joerg handwerg , a pilot for lufthansa and spokesperson for the pilot 's association cockpit .
" the current controls are foolish , because we waste resources by doing things that feign security but do n't actually bring security , " handwerg told deutsche welle .
a matter of common sense ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the threat of terrorism has led to heightened security at airports handwerg suggested that a point system could be employed to determine which passengers might pose a higher security risk , also taking note of where passengers were coming from and travelling to .
he said profiling could involve analyzing passenger behavior .
" the israelis already very successfully do psychological profiling based on asking people where they are going and paying attention to psychological reactions , like if the people become nervous , " he said .
" in these conversations you can assess whether a passenger should be checked more closely , or if they are unsuspicious . "
handwerg said profiling was a matter of common sense , rejecting the notion that it could be discriminatory .
" is it justified to check an 80-year-old woman just as intensively as an 18-year-old male passenger ? " he asked .
" there are differences .
that 's got nothing to do with discrimination ; it 's just common sense . "
climate of suspicion but in germany , where data protection is highly prized , opposition to collecting personal information about passengers would be a sticking point to introducing profiling .
critics , such as martin kutscha , a professor of constitutional law at the berlin school of economics and law , say that the dangers of profiling are too high a price to pay for greater security .
" obviously safety is a valuable commodity , but our society will never be 100 percent safe , " kutscha told deutsche welle .
" you will never catch someone who blows himself up at a market place with this kind of profiling .
safety is important , but not to the extent that you hold everybody under extreme suspicion . "
kutscha said profiling would also be legally problematic , especially since germany 's constitution does not allow ethnic discrimination .
he also worried that a climate of suspicion could be damaging for german society , especially with regard to its immigrant population .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : justice minister leutheusser-schnarrenberger has rejected the proposal " -lsb- profiling -rsb- would feed the fears that exist in society .
it 's obviously very damaging for a country that depends on immigration , like germany , " kutscha said .
in comments made to the frankfurter rundschau newspaper on wednesday , german justice minister sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger flatly rejected blume 's proposal , warning of the danger of " stigmatizing passengers , if one differentiates between them according to their origin and religion . "
she added that she believed passenger profiling would contravene german and european anti-discrimination legislation . the federal commissioner for data protection , peter schaar , also dismissed the suggestion , calling it unreasonable and unsupported in any legal sense .

dw examines how online events altered the real world . while military experts have been dealing with the issue of cyber-warfare for years , its public profile grew in 2010 as the united states established a " cyber command " in may and the nato alliance approved a new strategy that includes developing means of warding off cyber-attacks . " we did realize that cyber is one of the major , new issues to be dealt with , " said former us secretary of state madeline albright , who played a leading role in developing nato 's new overall strategy . stuxnet , a sophisticated computer virus designed to infect industrial control systems used in power plants , refineries and chemical production facilities , was found in september .
though its creators remain unknown , experts believe the program was written by programmers aiming to cripple iran 's uranium enrichment capabilities . the program proved nations and other groups were actively working on covert projects that would derail other countries ' industrial complex , according to stefan ritter of the german federal office for information security . " now we had proof , " he told deutsche welle .
" it was n't a fictional threat thought up by a couple of experts in a backroom anymore .
it 's a real threat that 's extremely large and extremely sophisticated . " wikileaks published classified material the whistle-blower website wikileaks , however , showed that sophisticated technology can also be harnessed to take information out of the backroom and put it in a public forum . bildunterschrift : already operational , wikileaks became well-known after releasing the afghan files the site first published some 80,000 classified documents relating to the us war in afghanistan then 400,000 files concerning the war in iraq . " the battlefield consequences of the release of these documents are potentially severe and dangerous for our troops , our allies and our afghan partners and may well damage our relationships and reputation in that key part of the world , " us defense secretary robert gates said after the afghanistan files were published . in november , wikileaks began the gradual publication of 250,000 diplomatic cables sent to washington from us embassies .
the frank assessments us officials sent to the state department brought to light the discrepancy between what world leaders sometimes say and do when it comes to international politics . wikileaks led to another online confrontation as an informal group of its proponents staged denial of service attacks on companies that removed wikileaks.org material from their servers and stopped accepting donations and discontinued financial services for the organization . google street view launches in germany personal privacy was the largest tech topic in germany in 2010 .
much media attention focused on opposition to google street view , an expansion of the us company 's map service that shows a street-level view of cities around the world . bildunterschrift : not everyone in germany was happy to have pictures of their homes appear on the internet privacy advocates accused google of infringing on individuals ' privacy and demanded a way for germans to opt out of the service before it went online , which some 200,000 people did before images of 20 german cities were made available in november . the german government also was in the spotlight after the country 's highest court overturned a 2008 law that required telecommunications companies to save phone and internet connection data for six months in case authorities required it for a criminal investigation . " saving connection information without cause evokes a diffuse and threatening feeling of being observation that impairs the unprejudiced perception of basic rights in many areas , " said hans-juergen papier , the president of the constitutional court at the time of the march verdict . proving that a change in calendar wo n't mean a change in points of view , joerg ziercke , the head of germany 's federal criminal police agency , called on lawmakers to find a way of sidestepping the court 's decision and obliging companies to store connection data . " it is important for us to be able to access this information under certain circumstances , " he said .
" that 's why we need a new law that removes the barriers in the fight against terrorism and organized crime . " authors : matthias von hein , sean sinico editor : cyrus farivar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

transportation in germany and around europe has been severely disrupted this winter with heavy snowfall and icy conditions .
the chairman of the bundestag 's transportation committee , winfried hermann of the opposition green party , told the berlin-based newspaper tagesspiegel that deutsche bahn must utilize all its available trains traveling routes around europe in order to cope with domestic demand in such circumstances .
he said this might mean deutsche bahn would have to put the brakes on its expansion aims , including plans for an intercity express to london from 2013 .
transportation spokesman uwe beckmeyer from the opposition social democrats called on the government to not to weaken support for deutsche bahn , which has struggled to maintain effective and regular services during particularly icy or snowy periods this winter .
" the company needs every cent to invest in better equipment , " he told tagesspiegel .
according to the tagesspiegel , deutsche bahn came to the conclusion in october that it did not own enough trains to ensure regular services during " extraordinary circumstances . "
around nine percent of deutsche bahn 's intercity express trains are currently unavailable for use due to frequent and long-term maintenance .

national security trumps rights and conflicts displace tens of thousands .
but progress has been made improving international institutions . united nations high commissioner for human rights navi pillay capped off a turbulent year of human rights by marking the 60th anniversary of her office and honored the achievements of hundreds of thousands of rights workers who risk their lives to speak out for human rights . " while combating discrimination and other important human rights causes , they themselves are often subject to discrimination , " she said .
" in fact , every year , thousands of human rights defenders are harassed , abused , unjustly detained and even murdered . " mass rape continues to be an appalling reality , torture remains widespread , extra-judicial executions , arbitrary detention and disappearances are all too prevalent in repressive societies , and national security interests and xenophobia are eroding human rights in democratic ones . some progress meanwhile , progress is slowly being made in strengthening the international laws and institutions that hold human rights violators accountable for their crimes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's difficult to judge the state of human rights however , it is getting harder to gauge whether the human rights situation is improving , according to julie de rivero , the geneva director for international non-government organization human rights watch . " what we have seen is an increase on the attacks on human rights defenders not only in places like china and iran , but also in other places where we had been a little bit hopeful about reform , such as bahrain , " she told deutsche welle . de rivero pointed to sri lanka as a place where crimes against civilians continue to be committed with impunity . " we saw the war end in sri lanka , but at a very high cost for civilians that were caught in indiscriminate fire by both sides , " she said .
" and , yet , there has been no accountability for war crimes in that country . " violence against women another worrying trend , de rivero noted , is sexual violence against women , particularly in the democratic republic of congo . " the scale of the phenomenon , i think , always compels us to focus on this particular situation because rape has been so normalized as a weapon of war in that country that it is shocking and the devastation that it causes is incredible in the lives of individuals and the community , " she said . de rivero added that the war on terror and heightened concern for national security are leading to a further erosion of human rights , even in democratic societies . making perpetrators accountable for their crimes remains a major concern for the international community , according to un high commissioner for human rights spokesman rupert collville .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rape and violence against women persist in drc " you have certain human rights violations that just continue year after year , " he said .
" you get some progress and then you get backsliding on something like torture . almost all states have laws that prohibit torture and declare it a crime , yet many states are still practicing it and many states do not prosecute those who commit it . " justice 's slow march discrimination is another major - and ongoing - concern , he said , adding that it affects women , homosexuals , people with disabilities , the elderly , minorities and indigenous peoples . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : discrimination troubles both industrialized and developing nations " it is a constant theme on every continent , including in the developed countries , where i think the treatment of migrants or foreigners has clearly deteriorated in the past decade or so , " collville said . while too many people get away with the crimes they commit , not all do and patience is needed as the wheels of justice turn slowly , collville said . " twenty or 30 years down the line , people still are being brought to court and charged with serious crimes - that perhaps is the strength of the system , " he said .
" circumstances change and people who think they are actively immune to justice sometimes find that is not actually the case in the long term .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de security -pipe- 29.12.2010 international hackers convene in berlin großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the chaos communication congress opened monday the 27th annual chaos communication congress is currently underway in germany .
these hackers say society should be worried about personal data collected by governments about us . on monday , two berlin mobile security researchers outlined what they 've dubbed the " sms of death " attack , which they claim could potentially could affect significant portions of mobile phones worldwide , the overwhelming majority of which are non-smartphones , like an iphone or android .
by flooding these mobiles with hundreds of thousands of malicious texts , they were able to discover bugs within the phones text-message reading software , that in some cases would force the phone to get stuck in a reboot loop .
and that was just day one of the 27th annual chaos communication congress , the annual gathering of the chaos computer club , currently going on this week in the german capital .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new attack could affect millions of mobile phones the two german researchers , collin mulliner and nico golde , from the technical university of berlin , claimed that their attack potentially could affect older-generation mobile phones made by sony ericsson , samsung , motorola , micromax and lg .
mulliner theorized that a large scale such attack might be overwhelming to a mobile network by inducing " ten thousand mobiles to try to reconnect simultaneously . "
amongst the 3,000 attendees , there 's a majority of very pale , sometimes chubby men , with laptops under their arms who look like they have n't seen a lot of sunlight , there are also students , a few hipsters and women in attendance .
during the conference , which concludes on thursday , participants take part in lectures and workshops on political and technical topics - from censorship , data surveillance and copyright , to voip security and hacking smart phones .
attendees can even buy sim cards to use a special , experimental mobile phone network set up solely for this conference .
wikileaks first debuted at the 2007 ccc congress the chaos computer club , or ccc , was founded in berlin in 1981 and is one of the world 's oldest self-desecribed hacker clubs .
since that time , the ccc has become known for consistently exposing security flaws and challenged the trend of heightened data surveillance since the september 11 , 2001 attacks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in 2008 , the ccc published the fingerprints of germany 's interior minister to protest the authorities ' increasing use of biometric data , in march 2008 , the ccc acquired the german interior minister 's fingerprints , which they took from a water glass the politician used at a public speaking event .
they took that imprint and published them as a way to protest the increased use of biometric data in germany and to highlight the insecure nature of such data .
three years ago , at the 2007 congress , wikileaks founder julian assange presented an early sketch of the now-contraversial website .
there , he met ccc member , daniel domscheit-berg , -lrb- then known by his alias , daniel schmitt -rrb- , who until a few months ago was considered assange 's number two at wikileaks .
while the two groups are not formally affiliated , frank rosengart , a chaos computer club spokesperson , said that his organization supports wikileaks because both groups have similar goals , especially around the issues of more transparency in government , or what rosengart calls " machine-readable government . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wikileaks founder julian assange presented his website to the ccc in 2007 " wikileaks , for us , it 's the right way to do it , to publish information , " said rosengart .
" keeping the privacy and keeping the sources anonymous - that 's a very important part of software and this can be considered a good hack to set up such a system that works in this way . "
rosengart said that first and foremost the congress is a meeting place for technical collaboration to take place - as was the case with wikileaks .
" there are a lot of projects like open-source programming projects and some people they meet here for the first time in real life , " he said .
" so they know them online , they work together , they do software together , but they meet here for the first time . "
data retention policies on the rise this week at the ccc congress are a number of talks at the congress about data retention , which has increased dramatically in the last nine years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in december 2007 , assange met daniel domscheit-berg , who until recently was wikileaks ' number two in an attempt to prevent further terrorist attacks , many governments , including the united states and germany , have increased the amount and type of data they keep on each citizen .
one of the groups participating this year is ak vorrat - the working group on data retention - that lead a campaign protesting against the introduction of a data retention law in germany in 2008 .
the group 's efforts were successful and in march 2010 the law was declarecd unconstitutional by the german constitutional court .
however , this year , ak vorrat has focused its attention on the 2011 census .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many club members are worried about what types of data should be collected by governments " there is some data that should not be collected , " said michael ebeling , an ak vorrat spokesperson , who said the group is particularly concerned about certain lines of questioning in the german census .
" if you are not coming from germany , they are asking you where are you coming from , where are your father , your mother coming from ? " he said . " what kind of religion do you believe in ? if you are islamic believer then they ask very precisely , are you sunni or shiite .
and we ask why do they ask these things ? "
he added that for christians , there are no follow up questions about a person 's particular denomination , and noted that people who do n't fill out the forms correctly could face further questioning and or a hefty fine .
ak vorrat is also concerned because the data people put on the census forms will not be made anonymous for four to six years , and given the sensitive nature of much of this personal data , they fear that it could be misused by politicians - in the name of fighting terrorism .
increasing surveillance across the european union bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chaos computer club members are also concerned about the use of such data around europe but this year 's attendees are not just concerned about surveillance measures within germany .
the forum of computer scientists for peace and social responsibility association -lrb- fiff -rrb- , is a german non-profit organization focusing mainly on privacy and security issues , as well as the use of technology in weapons , robots and cyber-warfare .
on wednesday , fiff members gave a presentation about a european research project called indect that develops surveillance techniques for the authorities .
indect was initiated by the polish platform for homeland security , and according to its website , aims to " develop new , advanced and innovative algorithms and methods aiming at combating terrorism and other criminal activities affecting citizens ' safety . "
kai nothdurft , a student at the university of bremen , and a fiff member , said that indect is all about meticulously aggregating data from different sources - from websites , social networks , government databases and filming demonstrations using unmanned aerial vehicles , or uavs .
" they combine -lsb- data -rsb- with pictures they get from surveillance cameras , cctv cameras from public places and by using face recognition , " he said , adding that social networking photos can also be used as a surveillance tool .
" that 's a very dangerous thing because there 's an empowerment of all these surveillance techniques by really combining all these things . ”
lockpicking : the original hack bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german lockpicking club also had a stand at the conference while there 's a big focus on political issues at the conference , there are also fun and practical workshops like how to recover your data if your hard drive crashes , how to hack your playstation 3 console , and there 's even a stand for germany 's lockpicking club .
" if you enter a door without a key and if you open a lock without a key , it 's a hacking technique too , " said one female member of the club , who goes by the nom de hacker , snow goose .
however , she was quick to explain that the club has strict ethical ground rules .
" -lsb- we do n't teach -rsb- anybody to break into other peoples ' houses , " she said .
" always pick your own locks only ! "
similarly , for many attendees , this strong confluence of curiosity , technical inquiry , civic-mindendness and ethics is what unites all hackers .
" for me its more a lifestyle , " said frank rosengart , the ccc spokesperson .
" hacking is asking more questions , trying to understand , using electronic devices in a different way than the manual proposes .
i think we need to go out to the world with this kind of lifestyle and trying to make a better world . "

"
but the german justice minister has flatly rejected the idea . the ceo of dusseldorf airport , christoph blume , said he wanted to introduce passenger profiling in german airports to fight terrorism .
the system would be similar to that used in israel , where passengers are categorized as high or low risk according to their age , sex , ethnic background and other criteria . " in this way , the security systems can be more effectively used to benefit all those involved , " blume , who will become president of the german airport association -lrb- adv -rrb- in january , told the german newspaper rheinische post on tuesday .
high-risk passengers - those deemed more likely to carry out terrorist or illegal activity , such as organized crime , drug trafficking or espionage - would undergo more stringent security checks .
this could mean anything from a bag search to a full body search .
blume is n't alone in calling for more targeted checks .
current procedures are n't working according to joerg handwerg , a pilot for lufthansa and spokesperson for the pilot 's association cockpit .
" the current controls are foolish , because we waste resources by doing things that feign security but do n't actually bring security , " handwerg told deutsche welle .
a matter of common sense ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the threat of terrorism has led to heightened security at airports handwerg suggested that a point system could be employed to determine which passengers might pose a higher security risk , also taking note of where passengers were coming from and travelling to .
he said profiling could involve analyzing passenger behavior .
" the israelis already very successfully do psychological profiling based on asking people where they are going and paying attention to psychological reactions , like if the people become nervous , " he said .
" in these conversations you can assess whether a passenger should be checked more closely , or if they are unsuspicious . "
handwerg said profiling was a matter of common sense , rejecting the notion that it could be discriminatory .
" is it justified to check an 80-year-old woman just as intensively as an 18-year-old male passenger ? " he asked .
" there are differences .
that 's got nothing to do with discrimination ; it 's just common sense . "
climate of suspicion but in germany , where data protection is highly prized , opposition to collecting personal information about passengers would be a sticking point to introducing profiling .
critics , such as martin kutscha , a professor of constitutional law at the berlin school of economics and law , say that the dangers of profiling are too high a price to pay for greater security .
" obviously safety is a valuable commodity , but our society will never be 100 percent safe , " kutscha told deutsche welle .
" you will never catch someone who blows himself up at a market place with this kind of profiling .
safety is important , but not to the extent that you hold everybody under extreme suspicion . "
kutscha said profiling would also be legally problematic , especially since germany 's constitution does not allow ethnic discrimination .
he also worried that a climate of suspicion could be damaging for german society , especially with regard to its immigrant population .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : justice minister leutheusser-schnarrenberger has rejected the proposal " -lsb- profiling -rsb- would feed the fears that exist in society .
it 's obviously very damaging for a country that depends on immigration , like germany , " kutscha said .
in comments made to the frankfurter rundschau newspaper on wednesday , german justice minister sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger flatly rejected blume 's proposal , warning of the danger of " stigmatizing passengers , if one differentiates between them according to their origin and religion . "
she added that she believed passenger profiling would contravene german and european anti-discrimination legislation . the federal commissioner for data protection , peter schaar , also dismissed the suggestion , calling it unreasonable and unsupported in any legal sense .
" such a procedure would amount to a permanent dragnet , " he told the rheinische post newspaper .

turku will offer an unusually interdisciplinary program with finnish culture at the core . turku in southwestern finland will celebrate its year as one of two european capitals of culture in 2011 with a focus on the connection between wellness , science and culture . under the motto " culture does you good , " the finnish city founded in 1229 is set to host 155 cultural projects alongside events planned by fellow culture capital tallinn in estonia . " we want to emphasize that culture has a positive impact on mental and physical well-being , and we 're the first european capital of culture to focus on this aspect , " said the head spokesperson for turku 's 2011 programming , saara malila , in an interview with deutsche welle . the city has already drawn attention for an unusual program in which doctors will " prescribe " tickets to cultural happenings as part of their treatment of patients during 2011 . a revival of the musical " hair , " performed entirely by middle-aged actors with no previous stage experience , also puts the connection between health and culture in the spotlight .
the performers ' blood pressure and other health indicators will be systematically studied during rehearsal and the shows to help draw conclusions about the relationship between creative endeavors and physical well-being . " we have a lot of smaller-scale , intimate projects that involve going into nursing homes , daycares or institutions for the disabled and bringing people together , " malila said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : actresses in " hair " will have to get ready for both the stage and the stethescope combining research with culture the 155 projects selected for presentation during 2011 were culled from over 1,000 proposals submitted during an open call in 2008 .
over 15 of the selected projects focus on the intersection of science and cultural activity . " science and research are important in turku , given the long tradition of academic life with three major universities here , " malila noted . " those institutions were very active in submitting proposals . " an interactive exhibition titled " fire !
fire ! " combines the science of fire with the history of finland 's oldest city and current culture capital , which was nearly destroyed by a fire in 1827 .
another series of events titled " 876 shades of darkness " takes up themes undoubtedly on the minds of many of turku 's guests during the long winter months : what is darkness , how do we perceive it , and how do we deal with it ? the 14th incarnation of an event titled " black market for useful knowledge and non-useful knowledge " also will also take an academic approach to culture .
at 50 tables set up for the " knowledge market , " scientists , artists , craftsmen and philosophers impart their knowledge to guests one-on-one in ways that intersect with performance . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " photomontage iv " by melinda gibson is part of the alice in wonderland show ' alice in wonderland ' much of turku 's 50 million euro -lrb- $ 66 million -rrb- budget is also given over to more traditional cultural programming , including dance and theater performances and gallery exhibitions , like a major , year-long presentation of contemporary photography titled " alice in wonderland . " it will be the largest exhibition of contemporary photographic art ever held in finland , presenting works from finnish and international artists that explore the intersection of fantasy and reality . " our inspiration for the show came from noticing that many finnish photographers today are producing work that examines the fantastical aspects of life , " exhibition curator elina heikka told deutsche welle . " every one of us is living between these two worlds of fantasy and reality , and we wanted to present that issue , " she added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : located on the baltic sea , turku has a population of 175,000 stories around the campfire finnish tradition is also reflected in one of the other major themes of turku 's programming : storytelling , according to festival representative saara malila . " we want to raise the importance of storytelling for a new generation of people growing up around constant media and the internet , " malila explained .
" it goes back to those long , dark winter nights in finland where there was n't much to do except gather together and tell stories . " an event titled " nordic voices " will draw professional storytellers from across europe to finland 's capital of culture to share tales both ancient and modern , while a program titled " poetry portraits " offers participants the chance to spend anywhere from several minutes to hours with poets and hear a piece about what the writer observed . turku 's own story as a year-long culture capital will kick off with the opening ceremony on january 15 and last through december , 2011 . author : greg wiser editor : jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 29.12.2010 estonia 's recession-hit economy prepares for euro introduction großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the euro will become the currency of estonia in january estonia will adopt the euro on january 1 , but experts and citizens are wary of the fact .
once known for its ascendant economy , estonia 's financial prospects were changed drastically by the global economic crisis . starting in the late 1990s , estonia , lithuania and latvia enjoyed an unprecedented economic boom .
dubbed the " baltic tigers " , these three republics grew as much as 12 percent per year .
while tiny estonia is the smallest of the three states , it was regarded as the poster child of these emerging economic hotbeds .
with a flare for technology , the country was often jokingly called " e-stonia " .
one of the government 's key economic goals was to become a member of the eurozone .
following years of negotiations , estonia will introduce the common currency on january 1 , 2011 .
unfortunately for many residents , the global financial crisis has wiped out many of the telltale signs of economic prosperity in estonia .
euro already recognized for marina wolkowa , who sells a variety of goods from a market booth at tallinn 's central railway station , the euro is already part of daily reality .
sitting on a stool and waiting for customers , she explains that she has been required to list prices in both estonian kroons and the euro for a year now .
she sells estonian pickles for 25 kroons or 1.60 euros .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : estonia 's kroon became a symbol of independence from the soviet union " but the euro wo n't help us forward .
it 's only going to drive up prices , " she told deutsche welle .
at the end of the year , however , estonia 's 1.3 million inhabitants will have to part with the kroon , which has served as a symbol of the country 's independence after the collapse of the soviet union .
estonia 's economic boom was fueled in part by its enthusiasm for technology .
the country was an early adopter of computer-based financial systems .
then there were neoliberal market reforms : estonia 's flat income tax rate is an across-the-board 22 percent .
low deficit ultimately it was the global economic crisis that brought the " estonian tiger " to its knees .
in 2009 , the country 's economy shrank by 13 percent .
but the euro is coming to estonia anyway .
this is mainly because of the country 's low budget deficit , which for the past two years has been well below the 3 percent stipulated by the maastricht treaty .
additionally , the kroon has been pegged to the value of the euro since 2004 .
that 's why estonian president toomas hendrik ilves has said the change from kroons to euros will have a psychological effect more than anything .
it will help to differentiate estonia from the other baltic states , which are often perceived by outsiders of as a single unit .
" when latvia has a problem , then there is immediately a ' crisis in the baltic ' , " ilves said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : estonian president toomas hendrik ilves says the euro will be good for estonia in 2009 , latvia narrowly avoided insolvency multi-billion-euro lines of credit from the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- and the european union .
the country 's largest financial institute , parex-bank , was rescued from collapse by being nationalized .
easy credit and overspending estonia may have fared better than latvia , but it still has its own share of problems , and not just in the eyes of its own population .
many independent economists see the country 's situation as precarious .
rainer kattel from of the tallinn university of technology says the country would have run into problems even without the global economic crisis because many estonians were living beyond their means .
when times were at their best , banks doled out easy credit – often via cell phone text message and without seriously checking their customers ' creditworthiness .
" in principle , the situation in the baltic region is n't much different than in greece or spain , " kattel told deutsche welle .
" on the one hand we do n't have that high level of debt , but on the other hand estonia has an unemployment rate of 18 percent . "
kattel argues that an alternative to introducing the euro in 2011 would have been to devalue the kroon .
instead , estonia is now experiencing an internal devaluation through decreased salaries , he said .
there are plenty of reasons to be skeptical about the direction estonia is currently moving in , according to kattel .
the global economic crisis is far from over , and many of the country 's citizens will carry immense amounts of debt for years to come .
" i 'm afraid that large areas of estonia will become more and more depopulated , because the people there will move into the cities or move away completely , " he said .

once known for its ascendant economy , estonia 's financial prospects were changed drastically by the global economic crisis . starting in the late 1990s , estonia , lithuania and latvia enjoyed an unprecedented economic boom .
dubbed the " baltic tigers " , these three republics grew as much as 12 percent per year .
while tiny estonia is the smallest of the three states , it was regarded as the poster child of these emerging economic hotbeds .
with a flare for technology , the country was often jokingly called " e-stonia " .
one of the government 's key economic goals was to become a member of the eurozone .
following years of negotiations , estonia will introduce the common currency on january 1 , 2011 .
unfortunately for many residents , the global financial crisis has wiped out many of the telltale signs of economic prosperity in estonia .
euro already recognized for marina wolkowa , who sells a variety of goods from a market booth at tallinn 's central railway station , the euro is already part of daily reality .
sitting on a stool and waiting for customers , she explains that she has been required to list prices in both estonian kroons and the euro for a year now .
she sells estonian pickles for 25 kroons or 1.60 euros .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : estonia 's kroon became a symbol of independence from the soviet union " but the euro wo n't help us forward .
it 's only going to drive up prices , " she told deutsche welle .
at the end of the year , however , estonia 's 1.3 million inhabitants will have to part with the kroon , which has served as a symbol of the country 's independence after the collapse of the soviet union .
estonia 's economic boom was fueled in part by its enthusiasm for technology .
the country was an early adopter of computer-based financial systems .
then there were neoliberal market reforms : estonia 's flat income tax rate is an across-the-board 22 percent .
low deficit ultimately it was the global economic crisis that brought the " estonian tiger " to its knees .
in 2009 , the country 's economy shrank by 13 percent .
but the euro is coming to estonia anyway .
this is mainly because of the country 's low budget deficit , which for the past two years has been well below the 3 percent stipulated by the maastricht treaty .
additionally , the kroon has been pegged to the value of the euro since 2004 .
that 's why estonian president toomas hendrik ilves has said the change from kroons to euros will have a psychological effect more than anything .
it will help to differentiate estonia from the other baltic states , which are often perceived by outsiders of as a single unit .
" when latvia has a problem , then there is immediately a ' crisis in the baltic ' , " ilves said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : estonian president toomas hendrik ilves says the euro will be good for estonia in 2009 , latvia narrowly avoided insolvency multi-billion-euro lines of credit from the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- and the european union .
the country 's largest financial institute , parex-bank , was rescued from collapse by being nationalized .
easy credit and overspending estonia may have fared better than latvia , but it still has its own share of problems , and not just in the eyes of its own population .
many independent economists see the country 's situation as precarious .
rainer kattel from of the tallinn university of technology says the country would have run into problems even without the global economic crisis because many estonians were living beyond their means .
when times were at their best , banks doled out easy credit – often via cell phone text message and without seriously checking their customers ' creditworthiness .
" in principle , the situation in the baltic region is n't much different than in greece or spain , " kattel told deutsche welle .
" on the one hand we do n't have that high level of debt , but on the other hand estonia has an unemployment rate of 18 percent . "
kattel argues that an alternative to introducing the euro in 2011 would have been to devalue the kroon .
instead , estonia is now experiencing an internal devaluation through decreased salaries , he said .
there are plenty of reasons to be skeptical about the direction estonia is currently moving in , according to kattel .
the global economic crisis is far from over , and many of the country 's citizens will carry immense amounts of debt for years to come .
" i 'm afraid that large areas of estonia will become more and more depopulated , because the people there will move into the cities or move away completely , " he said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de aviation -pipe- 29.12.2010 german airport boss sparks debate about passenger profiling großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : passenger profiling would be partly based on ethnicity the future president of the german airport association has called for checks based on age , sex and ethnicity for " high-risk passengers . "
but the german justice minister has flatly rejected the idea . the ceo of dusseldorf airport , christoph blume , said he wanted to introduce passenger profiling in german airports to fight terrorism .
the system would be similar to that used in israel , where passengers are categorized as high or low risk according to their age , sex , ethnic background and other criteria . " in this way , the security systems can be more effectively used to benefit all those involved , " blume , who will become president of the german airport association -lrb- adv -rrb- in january , told the german newspaper rheinische post on tuesday .
high-risk passengers - those deemed more likely to carry out terrorist or illegal activity , such as organized crime , drug trafficking or espionage - would undergo more stringent security checks .
this could mean anything from a bag search to a full body search .
blume is n't alone in calling for more targeted checks .
current procedures are n't working according to joerg handwerg , a pilot for lufthansa and spokesperson for the pilot 's association cockpit .
" the current controls are foolish , because we waste resources by doing things that feign security but do n't actually bring security , " handwerg told deutsche welle .
a matter of common sense ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the threat of terrorism has led to heightened security at airports handwerg suggested that a point system could be employed to determine which passengers might pose a higher security risk , also taking note of where passengers were coming from and travelling to .
he said profiling could involve analyzing passenger behavior .
" the israelis already very successfully do psychological profiling based on asking people where they are going and paying attention to psychological reactions , like if the people become nervous , " he said .
" in these conversations you can assess whether a passenger should be checked more closely , or if they are unsuspicious . "
handwerg said profiling was a matter of common sense , rejecting the notion that it could be discriminatory .
" is it justified to check an 80-year-old woman just as intensively as an 18-year-old male passenger ? " he asked .
" there are differences .
that 's got nothing to do with discrimination ; it 's just common sense . "
climate of suspicion but in germany , where data protection is highly prized , opposition to collecting personal information about passengers would be a sticking point to introducing profiling .
critics , such as martin kutscha , a professor of constitutional law at the berlin school of economics and law , say that the dangers of profiling are too high a price to pay for greater security .
" obviously safety is a valuable commodity , but our society will never be 100 percent safe , " kutscha told deutsche welle .
" you will never catch someone who blows himself up at a market place with this kind of profiling .
safety is important , but not to the extent that you hold everybody under extreme suspicion . "
kutscha said profiling would also be legally problematic , especially since germany 's constitution does not allow ethnic discrimination .
he also worried that a climate of suspicion could be damaging for german society , especially with regard to its immigrant population .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : justice minister leutheusser-schnarrenberger has rejected the proposal " -lsb- profiling -rsb- would feed the fears that exist in society .
it 's obviously very damaging for a country that depends on immigration , like germany , " kutscha said .
in comments made to the frankfurter rundschau newspaper on wednesday , german justice minister sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger flatly rejected blume 's proposal , warning of the danger of " stigmatizing passengers , if one differentiates between them according to their origin and religion . "
she added that she believed passenger profiling would contravene german and european anti-discrimination legislation . the federal commissioner for data protection , peter schaar , also dismissed the suggestion , calling it unreasonable and unsupported in any legal sense .
" such a procedure would amount to a permanent dragnet , " he told the rheinische post newspaper .

transportation in germany and around europe has been severely disrupted this winter with heavy snowfall and icy conditions .
the chairman of the bundestag 's transportation committee , winfried hermann of the opposition green party , told the berlin-based newspaper tagesspiegel that deutsche bahn must utilize all its available trains traveling routes around europe in order to cope with domestic demand in such circumstances .
he said this might mean deutsche bahn would have to put the brakes on its expansion aims , including plans for an intercity express to london from 2013 .
transportation spokesman uwe beckmeyer from the opposition social democrats called on the government to not to weaken support for deutsche bahn , which has struggled to maintain effective and regular services during particularly icy or snowy periods this winter .
" the company needs every cent to invest in better equipment , " he told tagesspiegel .
according to the tagesspiegel , deutsche bahn came to the conclusion in october that it did not own enough trains to ensure regular services during " extraordinary circumstances . "
around nine percent of deutsche bahn 's intercity express trains are currently unavailable for use due to frequent and long-term maintenance .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de security -pipe- 29.12.2010 international hackers convene in berlin großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the chaos communication congress opened monday the 27th annual chaos communication congress is currently underway in germany .
these hackers say society should be worried about personal data collected by governments about us . on monday , two berlin mobile security researchers outlined what they 've dubbed the " sms of death " attack , which they claim could potentially could affect significant portions of mobile phones worldwide , the overwhelming majority of which are non-smartphones , like an iphone or android .
by flooding these mobiles with hundreds of thousands of malicious texts , they were able to discover bugs within the phones text-message reading software , that in some cases would force the phone to get stuck in a reboot loop .
and that was just day one of the 27th annual chaos communication congress , the annual gathering of the chaos computer club , currently going on this week in the german capital .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new attack could affect millions of mobile phones the two german researchers , collin mulliner and nico golde , from the technical university of berlin , claimed that their attack potentially could affect older-generation mobile phones made by sony ericsson , samsung , motorola , micromax and lg .
mulliner theorized that a large scale such attack might be overwhelming to a mobile network by inducing " ten thousand mobiles to try to reconnect simultaneously . "
amongst the 3,000 attendees , there 's a majority of very pale , sometimes chubby men , with laptops under their arms who look like they have n't seen a lot of sunlight , there are also students , a few hipsters and women in attendance .
during the conference , which concludes on thursday , participants take part in lectures and workshops on political and technical topics - from censorship , data surveillance and copyright , to voip security and hacking smart phones .
attendees can even buy sim cards to use a special , experimental mobile phone network set up solely for this conference .
wikileaks first debuted at the 2007 ccc congress the chaos computer club , or ccc , was founded in berlin in 1981 and is one of the world 's oldest self-desecribed hacker clubs .
since that time , the ccc has become known for consistently exposing security flaws and challenged the trend of heightened data surveillance since the september 11 , 2001 attacks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in 2008 , the ccc published the fingerprints of germany 's interior minister to protest the authorities ' increasing use of biometric data , in march 2008 , the ccc acquired the german interior minister 's fingerprints , which they took from a water glass the politician used at a public speaking event .
they took that imprint and published them as a way to protest the increased use of biometric data in germany and to highlight the insecure nature of such data .
three years ago , at the 2007 congress , wikileaks founder julian assange presented an early sketch of the now-contraversial website .
there , he met ccc member , daniel domscheit-berg , -lrb- then known by his alias , daniel schmitt -rrb- , who until a few months ago was considered assange 's number two at wikileaks .
while the two groups are not formally affiliated , frank rosengart , a chaos computer club spokesperson , said that his organization supports wikileaks because both groups have similar goals , especially around the issues of more transparency in government , or what rosengart calls " machine-readable government . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wikileaks founder julian assange presented his website to the ccc in 2007 " wikileaks , for us , it 's the right way to do it , to publish information , " said rosengart .
" keeping the privacy and keeping the sources anonymous - that 's a very important part of software and this can be considered a good hack to set up such a system that works in this way . "
rosengart said that first and foremost the congress is a meeting place for technical collaboration to take place - as was the case with wikileaks .
" there are a lot of projects like open-source programming projects and some people they meet here for the first time in real life , " he said .
" so they know them online , they work together , they do software together , but they meet here for the first time . "
data retention policies on the rise this week at the ccc congress are a number of talks at the congress about data retention , which has increased dramatically in the last nine years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in december 2007 , assange met daniel domscheit-berg , who until recently was wikileaks ' number two in an attempt to prevent further terrorist attacks , many governments , including the united states and germany , have increased the amount and type of data they keep on each citizen .
one of the groups participating this year is ak vorrat - the working group on data retention - that lead a campaign protesting against the introduction of a data retention law in germany in 2008 .
the group 's efforts were successful and in march 2010 the law was declarecd unconstitutional by the german constitutional court .
however , this year , ak vorrat has focused its attention on the 2011 census .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many club members are worried about what types of data should be collected by governments " there is some data that should not be collected , " said michael ebeling , an ak vorrat spokesperson , who said the group is particularly concerned about certain lines of questioning in the german census .
" if you are not coming from germany , they are asking you where are you coming from , where are your father , your mother coming from ? " he said . " what kind of religion do you believe in ? if you are islamic believer then they ask very precisely , are you sunni or shiite .
and we ask why do they ask these things ? "
he added that for christians , there are no follow up questions about a person 's particular denomination , and noted that people who do n't fill out the forms correctly could face further questioning and or a hefty fine .
ak vorrat is also concerned because the data people put on the census forms will not be made anonymous for four to six years , and given the sensitive nature of much of this personal data , they fear that it could be misused by politicians - in the name of fighting terrorism .
increasing surveillance across the european union bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chaos computer club members are also concerned about the use of such data around europe but this year 's attendees are not just concerned about surveillance measures within germany .
the forum of computer scientists for peace and social responsibility association -lrb- fiff -rrb- , is a german non-profit organization focusing mainly on privacy and security issues , as well as the use of technology in weapons , robots and cyber-warfare .
on wednesday , fiff members gave a presentation about a european research project called indect that develops surveillance techniques for the authorities .
indect was initiated by the polish platform for homeland security , and according to its website , aims to " develop new , advanced and innovative algorithms and methods aiming at combating terrorism and other criminal activities affecting citizens ' safety . "
kai nothdurft , a student at the university of bremen , and a fiff member , said that indect is all about meticulously aggregating data from different sources - from websites , social networks , government databases and filming demonstrations using unmanned aerial vehicles , or uavs .
" they combine -lsb- data -rsb- with pictures they get from surveillance cameras , cctv cameras from public places and by using face recognition , " he said , adding that social networking photos can also be used as a surveillance tool .
" that 's a very dangerous thing because there 's an empowerment of all these surveillance techniques by really combining all these things . ”
lockpicking : the original hack bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german lockpicking club also had a stand at the conference while there 's a big focus on political issues at the conference , there are also fun and practical workshops like how to recover your data if your hard drive crashes , how to hack your playstation 3 console , and there 's even a stand for germany 's lockpicking club .
" if you enter a door without a key and if you open a lock without a key , it 's a hacking technique too , " said one female member of the club , who goes by the nom de hacker , snow goose .
however , she was quick to explain that the club has strict ethical ground rules .
" -lsb- we do n't teach -rsb- anybody to break into other peoples ' houses , " she said .
" always pick your own locks only ! "
similarly , for many attendees , this strong confluence of curiosity , technical inquiry , civic-mindendness and ethics is what unites all hackers .
" for me its more a lifestyle , " said frank rosengart , the ccc spokesperson .
" hacking is asking more questions , trying to understand , using electronic devices in a different way than the manual proposes .
i think we need to go out to the world with this kind of lifestyle and trying to make a better world . "

"
but the german justice minister has flatly rejected the idea . the ceo of dusseldorf airport , christoph blume , said he wanted to introduce passenger profiling in german airports to fight terrorism .
the system would be similar to that used in israel , where passengers are categorized as high or low risk according to their age , sex , ethnic background and other criteria . " in this way , the security systems can be more effectively used to benefit all those involved , " blume , who will become president of the german airport association -lrb- adv -rrb- in january , told the german newspaper rheinische post on tuesday .
high-risk passengers - those deemed more likely to carry out terrorist or illegal activity , such as organized crime , drug trafficking or espionage - would undergo more stringent security checks .
this could mean anything from a bag search to a full body search .
blume is n't alone in calling for more targeted checks .
current procedures are n't working according to joerg handwerg , a pilot for lufthansa and spokesperson for the pilot 's association cockpit .
" the current controls are foolish , because we waste resources by doing things that feign security but do n't actually bring security , " handwerg told deutsche welle .
a matter of common sense ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the threat of terrorism has led to heightened security at airports handwerg suggested that a point system could be employed to determine which passengers might pose a higher security risk , also taking note of where passengers were coming from and travelling to .
he said profiling could involve analyzing passenger behavior .
" the israelis already very successfully do psychological profiling based on asking people where they are going and paying attention to psychological reactions , like if the people become nervous , " he said .
" in these conversations you can assess whether a passenger should be checked more closely , or if they are unsuspicious . "
handwerg said profiling was a matter of common sense , rejecting the notion that it could be discriminatory .
" is it justified to check an 80-year-old woman just as intensively as an 18-year-old male passenger ? " he asked .
" there are differences .
that 's got nothing to do with discrimination ; it 's just common sense . "
climate of suspicion but in germany , where data protection is highly prized , opposition to collecting personal information about passengers would be a sticking point to introducing profiling .
critics , such as martin kutscha , a professor of constitutional law at the berlin school of economics and law , say that the dangers of profiling are too high a price to pay for greater security .
" obviously safety is a valuable commodity , but our society will never be 100 percent safe , " kutscha told deutsche welle .
" you will never catch someone who blows himself up at a market place with this kind of profiling .
safety is important , but not to the extent that you hold everybody under extreme suspicion . "
kutscha said profiling would also be legally problematic , especially since germany 's constitution does not allow ethnic discrimination .
he also worried that a climate of suspicion could be damaging for german society , especially with regard to its immigrant population .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : justice minister leutheusser-schnarrenberger has rejected the proposal " -lsb- profiling -rsb- would feed the fears that exist in society .
it 's obviously very damaging for a country that depends on immigration , like germany , " kutscha said .
in comments made to the frankfurter rundschau newspaper on wednesday , german justice minister sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger flatly rejected blume 's proposal , warning of the danger of " stigmatizing passengers , if one differentiates between them according to their origin and religion . "
she added that she believed passenger profiling would contravene german and european anti-discrimination legislation . the federal commissioner for data protection , peter schaar , also dismissed the suggestion , calling it unreasonable and unsupported in any legal sense .
" such a procedure would amount to a permanent dragnet , " he told the rheinische post newspaper .

transportation in germany and around europe has been severely disrupted this winter with heavy snowfall and icy conditions .
the chairman of the bundestag 's transportation committee , winfried hermann of the opposition green party , told the berlin-based newspaper tagesspiegel that deutsche bahn must utilize all its available trains traveling routes around europe in order to cope with domestic demand in such circumstances .
he said this might mean deutsche bahn would have to put the brakes on its expansion aims , including plans for an intercity express to london from 2013 .
transportation spokesman uwe beckmeyer from the opposition social democrats called on the government to not to weaken support for deutsche bahn , which has struggled to maintain effective and regular services during particularly icy or snowy periods this winter .
" the company needs every cent to invest in better equipment , " he told tagesspiegel .
according to the tagesspiegel , deutsche bahn came to the conclusion in october that it did not own enough trains to ensure regular services during " extraordinary circumstances . "
around nine percent of deutsche bahn 's intercity express trains are currently unavailable for use due to frequent and long-term maintenance .

they are found in everything from handhelds to wind turbines .
cause for concern now that china is reducing exports . after the chinese government decided to reduce exports of its precious rare earth elements on international markets by 35 percent for the first half of 2011 , the shares of chinese producers have reacted with increases .
meanwhile world markets are expected to react next year as modern technologies such as flat screen televisions and monitors and green technologies such as fluorescent light bulbs and hybrid cars require the minerals . china produces over 95 percent of the world ’ s rare earths and thus has a stronghold on the market .
according to sources in japanese industry , beijing temporarily cut exports to japan after a territorial row earlier this year .
the united states has advised china not to use its control over the coveted raw materials as a " weapon " and might take action at the world trade organization .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the restriction of rare earths could harm high-tech industries looking for alternatives while producers are now looking for alternative sources outside of china , high-tech company sony has said it will look for ways to cut its use of rare earths . at present , china accounts for approximately 75 percent of the global demand for rare earths ; the rest is used in japan , north america and europe .

as the nato forces look for an exit , the future of afghanistan appears as unpredictable as ever . the 2010 us annual strategy review of afghanistan showed ' significant ' progress in the decade-long war against the taliban and al qaeda militants .
however , some afghanistan experts are of the opinion that things are quite the opposite in the war-torn country .
" these days we are getting different echoes out of afghanistan , " said conrad schetter , an expert on the afpak region , in an interview with deutsche welle .
" the official point of view , for example of the german administration , is that things are on track and they -lrb- nato -rrb- are quite successful in afghanistan .
however , if you talk to afghans , or to people who have just returned from afghanistan , they give you a very different picture .
they tell you that on the one side , the afghan government is so corrupt , and on the other side the pakistani government is so unwilling to cooperate that there has hardly been any success against the insurgents in the last year . "
many afghans also disagree with the us claims of progress .
" in my opinion , in 2010 , the government did not achieve anything .
people 's lives have got worse , " said a resident of kabul .
" long-term " us interests in afghanistan bildunterschrift : experts believe that president obama wanted a less hawkish strategy for afghanistan the war against islamist militants is far from over despite the us administration 's military surge in the earlier half of 2010 .
the us also tried to woo the ' moderate ' taliban for a power-sharing arrangement post nato withdrawal in 2014 .
both the us and afghan governments continued to express their dissatisfaction with pakistan 's counter-terrorism efforts in its recalcitrant northwest , which is considered to be a safe haven for many al-qaeda and taliban operatives .
some analysts are also of the view that the us ' strategy to increase troops in afghanistan did n't turn out to be effective , and that it was more a dictate of the us army generals than us president obama 's own plan .
" i think for obama it was a very difficult decision , and that is also why he took such a long time to send more troops into afghanistan .
he was favoring a more non-violent approach , but there were some generals in the pentagon who wanted to go on an offensive , " said schetter , " but one thing should be clear : the americans wo n't leave afghanistan for good .
it is clear that they have long-term interests in the country . "
increased civilian deaths bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a un report found a 25 percent rise in civilian casualties in 2010 according to a recent un report , the civilian casualties in afghanistan rose by 25 % in 2010 .
the un blamed the militants for most of the deaths .
according to the report , there were 6,200 civilian casualties in the first ten months of 2010 , including 2,400 deaths and 3,800 injuries .
an afghan citizen from the taliban 's birth city kandahar complained : " we are the victims of this war .
we have no security .
the government should take care of our security .
if we only had security , we could solve other problems ourselves . "
on the other hand , more than 700 us and nato troops have also been killed in 2010 , compared to 512 last year , which is a 25 percent increase .
second post-taliban elections bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an afghan woman casts her vote in the september elections then there were the controversial parliamentary elections of september 2010 .
independent election monitors recorded large-scale irregularities .
but the fact that nearly five million afghans came out to cast their votes was considered a success by many .
a less optimistic picture in july 2010 , the whistle blowing website wikileaks published more than 91,000 official us documents dealing with afghanistan .
the leaked us cables showed a less optimistic picture of afghanistan than what the us and afghan governments had been trying to project publically .
the us government 's afghanistan logs also shed light on the corruption of the afghan government , as well as the us cynicism with pakistan , which is believed was supporting some taliban militants , causing a great deal of damage to nato 's efforts in afghanistan .

the men and women who try their luck in the big cities are young and modern - they spend most of their time on the internet . the new generation of migrant laborers has changed .
the men and women who try their luck in the big cities work in factories or restaurants and are young and modern .
and they spend most of their free time on the internet .
as most can not afford their own computer , they go to internet cafes , where they play computer games , meet friends in chat rooms and in social networking communities . the internet café hao xinqing or " good mood " in beijing has around 200 computers and at peak time , around 10:30 pm , nearly all of them are taken .
they are set up in long rows .
lights are dim and cigarette smoke hangs in the air .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the peak time in many internet cafes is around 10 pm " social networking improves my life " du jun is a 19-year-old who frequently comes to the café .
he sits in the last row chatting with friends .
" when i get off work around 10 pm i usually come here to the internet cafe .
i usually stay until midnight and then i go home and go to bed .
when i get here , i go first thing to my qq chat room to see if friends or family are online .
if they are , we chat and if not , i listen to music or play a game . "
du jun waits tables in a restaurant .
he says his quality of life would be worse were it not for qq , china ’ s most popular instant messaging network with almost one billion registered users .
there people can meet friends , exchange photos or phone each other .
like du jun , most of qq ’ s users are young migrant workers aged around 20 , who have come to the capital city from poor provinces looking for work .
they have trendy clothes and hair styles and are constantly fumbling around with their mobiles .
for this new generation of migrant workers , the internet has become the foundation of their social lives ; the lives of their parents seem worlds apart .

that is how it has always been at home .
my village is very poor .
i am always sad to see my parents working so hard and i feel bad that i don ’ t earn much either . "
du jun earns around 150 euros per month .
that is not enough for him to buy his own computer but it is enough for him to pay the bill at the internet café – 30 cents per hour .
the only disadvantage is that he is not allowed to upload pictures there .
but he can at the shop next door , where mr. wang helps people connect .
" some people are looking for relationships over the internet .
they come to me and have their picture taken , which i send to them by email .
then they have a picture they can use to find a boyfriend or girlfriend online .
young soldiers also come here .

turku will offer an unusually interdisciplinary program with finnish culture at the core . turku in southwestern finland will celebrate its year as one of two european capitals of culture in 2011 with a focus on the connection between wellness , science and culture . under the motto " culture does you good , " the finnish city founded in 1229 is set to host 155 cultural projects alongside events planned by fellow culture capital tallinn in estonia . " we want to emphasize that culture has a positive impact on mental and physical well-being , and we 're the first european capital of culture to focus on this aspect , " said the head spokesperson for turku 's 2011 programming , saara malila , in an interview with deutsche welle . the city has already drawn attention for an unusual program in which doctors will " prescribe " tickets to cultural happenings as part of their treatment of patients during 2011 . a revival of the musical " hair , " performed entirely by middle-aged actors with no previous stage experience , also puts the connection between health and culture in the spotlight .
the performers ' blood pressure and other health indicators will be systematically studied during rehearsal and the shows to help draw conclusions about the relationship between creative endeavors and physical well-being . " we have a lot of smaller-scale , intimate projects that involve going into nursing homes , daycares or institutions for the disabled and bringing people together , " malila said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : actresses in " hair " will have to get ready for both the stage and the stethescope combining research with culture the 155 projects selected for presentation during 2011 were culled from over 1,000 proposals submitted during an open call in 2008 .
over 15 of the selected projects focus on the intersection of science and cultural activity . " science and research are important in turku , given the long tradition of academic life with three major universities here , " malila noted . " those institutions were very active in submitting proposals . " an interactive exhibition titled " fire !
fire ! " combines the science of fire with the history of finland 's oldest city and current culture capital , which was nearly destroyed by a fire in 1827 .
another series of events titled " 876 shades of darkness " takes up themes undoubtedly on the minds of many of turku 's guests during the long winter months : what is darkness , how do we perceive it , and how do we deal with it ? the 14th incarnation of an event titled " black market for useful knowledge and non-useful knowledge " also will also take an academic approach to culture .
at 50 tables set up for the " knowledge market , " scientists , artists , craftsmen and philosophers impart their knowledge to guests one-on-one in ways that intersect with performance . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " photomontage iv " by melinda gibson is part of the alice in wonderland show ' alice in wonderland ' much of turku 's 50 million euro -lrb- $ 66 million -rrb- budget is also given over to more traditional cultural programming , including dance and theater performances and gallery exhibitions , like a major , year-long presentation of contemporary photography titled " alice in wonderland . " it will be the largest exhibition of contemporary photographic art ever held in finland , presenting works from finnish and international artists that explore the intersection of fantasy and reality . " our inspiration for the show came from noticing that many finnish photographers today are producing work that examines the fantastical aspects of life , " exhibition curator elina heikka told deutsche welle . " every one of us is living between these two worlds of fantasy and reality , and we wanted to present that issue , " she added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : located on the baltic sea , turku has a population of 175,000 stories around the campfire finnish tradition is also reflected in one of the other major themes of turku 's programming : storytelling , according to festival representative saara malila . " we want to raise the importance of storytelling for a new generation of people growing up around constant media and the internet , " malila explained .
" it goes back to those long , dark winter nights in finland where there was n't much to do except gather together and tell stories . " an event titled " nordic voices " will draw professional storytellers from across europe to finland 's capital of culture to share tales both ancient and modern , while a program titled " poetry portraits " offers participants the chance to spend anywhere from several minutes to hours with poets and hear a piece about what the writer observed . turku 's own story as a year-long culture capital will kick off with the opening ceremony on january 15 and last through december , 2011 . author : greg wiser editor : jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

they are found in everything from handhelds to wind turbines .
cause for concern now that china is reducing exports . after the chinese government decided to reduce exports of its precious rare earth elements on international markets by 35 percent for the first half of 2011 , the shares of chinese producers have reacted with increases .
meanwhile world markets are expected to react next year as modern technologies such as flat screen televisions and monitors and green technologies such as fluorescent light bulbs and hybrid cars require the minerals . china produces over 95 percent of the world ’ s rare earths and thus has a stronghold on the market .
according to sources in japanese industry , beijing temporarily cut exports to japan after a territorial row earlier this year .
the united states has advised china not to use its control over the coveted raw materials as a " weapon " and might take action at the world trade organization .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the restriction of rare earths could harm high-tech industries looking for alternatives while producers are now looking for alternative sources outside of china , high-tech company sony has said it will look for ways to cut its use of rare earths . at present , china accounts for approximately 75 percent of the global demand for rare earths ; the rest is used in japan , north america and europe .
by 2015 the demand for the elements is expected to increase by more than 50 percent from 110,000 tons to 250,000 tons per year . author : sarah berning -lrb- afp , reuters -rrb- editor : thomas baerthlein send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de afghanistan -pipe- 29.12.2010 2010 - a look back at another troubled year for afghanistan großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato will start reducing its troops in afghanistan from july 2011 afghanistan saw some stability and progress in 2010 , however things can easily go wrong in the coming year .
as the nato forces look for an exit , the future of afghanistan appears as unpredictable as ever . the 2010 us annual strategy review of afghanistan showed ' significant ' progress in the decade-long war against the taliban and al qaeda militants .
however , some afghanistan experts are of the opinion that things are quite the opposite in the war-torn country .
" these days we are getting different echoes out of afghanistan , " said conrad schetter , an expert on the afpak region , in an interview with deutsche welle .
" the official point of view , for example of the german administration , is that things are on track and they -lrb- nato -rrb- are quite successful in afghanistan .
however , if you talk to afghans , or to people who have just returned from afghanistan , they give you a very different picture .
they tell you that on the one side , the afghan government is so corrupt , and on the other side the pakistani government is so unwilling to cooperate that there has hardly been any success against the insurgents in the last year . "
many afghans also disagree with the us claims of progress .
" in my opinion , in 2010 , the government did not achieve anything .
people 's lives have got worse , " said a resident of kabul .
" long-term " us interests in afghanistan bildunterschrift : experts believe that president obama wanted a less hawkish strategy for afghanistan the war against islamist militants is far from over despite the us administration 's military surge in the earlier half of 2010 .
the us also tried to woo the ' moderate ' taliban for a power-sharing arrangement post nato withdrawal in 2014 .
both the us and afghan governments continued to express their dissatisfaction with pakistan 's counter-terrorism efforts in its recalcitrant northwest , which is considered to be a safe haven for many al-qaeda and taliban operatives .
some analysts are also of the view that the us ' strategy to increase troops in afghanistan did n't turn out to be effective , and that it was more a dictate of the us army generals than us president obama 's own plan .
" i think for obama it was a very difficult decision , and that is also why he took such a long time to send more troops into afghanistan .
he was favoring a more non-violent approach , but there were some generals in the pentagon who wanted to go on an offensive , " said schetter , " but one thing should be clear : the americans wo n't leave afghanistan for good .
it is clear that they have long-term interests in the country . "
increased civilian deaths bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a un report found a 25 percent rise in civilian casualties in 2010 according to a recent un report , the civilian casualties in afghanistan rose by 25 % in 2010 .
the un blamed the militants for most of the deaths .
according to the report , there were 6,200 civilian casualties in the first ten months of 2010 , including 2,400 deaths and 3,800 injuries .
an afghan citizen from the taliban 's birth city kandahar complained : " we are the victims of this war .
we have no security .
the government should take care of our security .
if we only had security , we could solve other problems ourselves . "
on the other hand , more than 700 us and nato troops have also been killed in 2010 , compared to 512 last year , which is a 25 percent increase .
second post-taliban elections bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an afghan woman casts her vote in the september elections then there were the controversial parliamentary elections of september 2010 .
independent election monitors recorded large-scale irregularities .
but the fact that nearly five million afghans came out to cast their votes was considered a success by many .
a less optimistic picture in july 2010 , the whistle blowing website wikileaks published more than 91,000 official us documents dealing with afghanistan .
the leaked us cables showed a less optimistic picture of afghanistan than what the us and afghan governments had been trying to project publically .
the us government 's afghanistan logs also shed light on the corruption of the afghan government , as well as the us cynicism with pakistan , which is believed was supporting some taliban militants , causing a great deal of damage to nato 's efforts in afghanistan .

the men and women who try their luck in the big cities are young and modern - they spend most of their time on the internet . the new generation of migrant laborers has changed .
the men and women who try their luck in the big cities work in factories or restaurants and are young and modern .
and they spend most of their free time on the internet .
as most can not afford their own computer , they go to internet cafes , where they play computer games , meet friends in chat rooms and in social networking communities . the internet café hao xinqing or " good mood " in beijing has around 200 computers and at peak time , around 10:30 pm , nearly all of them are taken .
they are set up in long rows .
lights are dim and cigarette smoke hangs in the air .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the peak time in many internet cafes is around 10 pm " social networking improves my life " du jun is a 19-year-old who frequently comes to the café .
he sits in the last row chatting with friends .
" when i get off work around 10 pm i usually come here to the internet cafe .
i usually stay until midnight and then i go home and go to bed .
when i get here , i go first thing to my qq chat room to see if friends or family are online .
if they are , we chat and if not , i listen to music or play a game . "
du jun waits tables in a restaurant .
he says his quality of life would be worse were it not for qq , china ’ s most popular instant messaging network with almost one billion registered users .
there people can meet friends , exchange photos or phone each other .
like du jun , most of qq ’ s users are young migrant workers aged around 20 , who have come to the capital city from poor provinces looking for work .
they have trendy clothes and hair styles and are constantly fumbling around with their mobiles .
for this new generation of migrant workers , the internet has become the foundation of their social lives ; the lives of their parents seem worlds apart .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a farmer reaping a rice harvest in loudi in southern china 's hunan province two worlds connected du jun is from gansu , a poor province in the northwest of china .
he says his life in the city is nothing like it was back home . " my parents are farmers .
my mother works the fields and my father is constantly on the go , looking for work .
that is how it has always been at home .
my village is very poor .
i am always sad to see my parents working so hard and i feel bad that i don ’ t earn much either . "
du jun earns around 150 euros per month .
that is not enough for him to buy his own computer but it is enough for him to pay the bill at the internet café – 30 cents per hour .
the only disadvantage is that he is not allowed to upload pictures there .
but he can at the shop next door , where mr. wang helps people connect .
" some people are looking for relationships over the internet .
they come to me and have their picture taken , which i send to them by email .
then they have a picture they can use to find a boyfriend or girlfriend online .
young soldiers also come here .
this one wanted his picture with tiananmen square in the background . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a woman uses the internet at a computer store in beijing real life vs. cyber space migrant workers and soldiers send these photographs back home via internet , so that their parents can see their children in the big city .

but with all its advantages , the internet also has disadvantages .
du jun says he would like to find a girlfriend , preferably in the real world rather than in cyber space .

as the nato forces look for an exit , the future of afghanistan appears as unpredictable as ever . the 2010 us annual strategy review of afghanistan showed ' significant ' progress in the decade-long war against the taliban and al qaeda militants .
however , some afghanistan experts are of the opinion that things are quite the opposite in the war-torn country .
" these days we are getting different echoes out of afghanistan , " said conrad schetter , an expert on the afpak region , in an interview with deutsche welle .
" the official point of view , for example of the german administration , is that things are on track and they -lrb- nato -rrb- are quite successful in afghanistan .
however , if you talk to afghans , or to people who have just returned from afghanistan , they give you a very different picture .
they tell you that on the one side , the afghan government is so corrupt , and on the other side the pakistani government is so unwilling to cooperate that there has hardly been any success against the insurgents in the last year . "
many afghans also disagree with the us claims of progress .
" in my opinion , in 2010 , the government did not achieve anything .
people 's lives have got worse , " said a resident of kabul .
" long-term " us interests in afghanistan bildunterschrift : experts believe that president obama wanted a less hawkish strategy for afghanistan the war against islamist militants is far from over despite the us administration 's military surge in the earlier half of 2010 .
the us also tried to woo the ' moderate ' taliban for a power-sharing arrangement post nato withdrawal in 2014 .
both the us and afghan governments continued to express their dissatisfaction with pakistan 's counter-terrorism efforts in its recalcitrant northwest , which is considered to be a safe haven for many al-qaeda and taliban operatives .
some analysts are also of the view that the us ' strategy to increase troops in afghanistan did n't turn out to be effective , and that it was more a dictate of the us army generals than us president obama 's own plan .
" i think for obama it was a very difficult decision , and that is also why he took such a long time to send more troops into afghanistan .
he was favoring a more non-violent approach , but there were some generals in the pentagon who wanted to go on an offensive , " said schetter , " but one thing should be clear : the americans wo n't leave afghanistan for good .
it is clear that they have long-term interests in the country . "
increased civilian deaths bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a un report found a 25 percent rise in civilian casualties in 2010 according to a recent un report , the civilian casualties in afghanistan rose by 25 % in 2010 .
the un blamed the militants for most of the deaths .
according to the report , there were 6,200 civilian casualties in the first ten months of 2010 , including 2,400 deaths and 3,800 injuries .
an afghan citizen from the taliban 's birth city kandahar complained : " we are the victims of this war .
we have no security .
the government should take care of our security .
if we only had security , we could solve other problems ourselves . "
on the other hand , more than 700 us and nato troops have also been killed in 2010 , compared to 512 last year , which is a 25 percent increase .
second post-taliban elections bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an afghan woman casts her vote in the september elections then there were the controversial parliamentary elections of september 2010 .
independent election monitors recorded large-scale irregularities .
but the fact that nearly five million afghans came out to cast their votes was considered a success by many .
a less optimistic picture in july 2010 , the whistle blowing website wikileaks published more than 91,000 official us documents dealing with afghanistan .
the leaked us cables showed a less optimistic picture of afghanistan than what the us and afghan governments had been trying to project publically .
the us government 's afghanistan logs also shed light on the corruption of the afghan government , as well as the us cynicism with pakistan , which is believed was supporting some taliban militants , causing a great deal of damage to nato 's efforts in afghanistan .

the men and women who try their luck in the big cities work in factories or restaurants and are young and modern .
and they spend most of their free time on the internet .
as most can not afford their own computer , they go to internet cafes , where they play computer games , meet friends in chat rooms and in social networking communities . the internet café hao xinqing or " good mood " in beijing has around 200 computers and at peak time , around 10:30 pm , nearly all of them are taken .
they are set up in long rows .
lights are dim and cigarette smoke hangs in the air .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the peak time in many internet cafes is around 10 pm " social networking improves my life " du jun is a 19-year-old who frequently comes to the café .

i usually stay until midnight and then i go home and go to bed .
when i get here , i go first thing to my qq chat room to see if friends or family are online .

du jun waits tables in a restaurant .
he says his quality of life would be worse were it not for qq , china ’ s most popular instant messaging network with almost one billion registered users .
there people can meet friends , exchange photos or phone each other .
like du jun , most of qq ’ s users are young migrant workers aged around 20 , who have come to the capital city from poor provinces looking for work .
they have trendy clothes and hair styles and are constantly fumbling around with their mobiles .

du jun earns around 150 euros per month .
that is not enough for him to buy his own computer but it is enough for him to pay the bill at the internet café – 30 cents per hour .
the only disadvantage is that he is not allowed to upload pictures there .

turku will offer an unusually interdisciplinary program with finnish culture at the core . turku in southwestern finland will celebrate its year as one of two european capitals of culture in 2011 with a focus on the connection between wellness , science and culture . under the motto " culture does you good , " the finnish city founded in 1229 is set to host 155 cultural projects alongside events planned by fellow culture capital tallinn in estonia . " we want to emphasize that culture has a positive impact on mental and physical well-being , and we 're the first european capital of culture to focus on this aspect , " said the head spokesperson for turku 's 2011 programming , saara malila , in an interview with deutsche welle . the city has already drawn attention for an unusual program in which doctors will " prescribe " tickets to cultural happenings as part of their treatment of patients during 2011 . a revival of the musical " hair , " performed entirely by middle-aged actors with no previous stage experience , also puts the connection between health and culture in the spotlight .
the performers ' blood pressure and other health indicators will be systematically studied during rehearsal and the shows to help draw conclusions about the relationship between creative endeavors and physical well-being . " we have a lot of smaller-scale , intimate projects that involve going into nursing homes , daycares or institutions for the disabled and bringing people together , " malila said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : actresses in " hair " will have to get ready for both the stage and the stethescope combining research with culture the 155 projects selected for presentation during 2011 were culled from over 1,000 proposals submitted during an open call in 2008 .
over 15 of the selected projects focus on the intersection of science and cultural activity . " science and research are important in turku , given the long tradition of academic life with three major universities here , " malila noted . " those institutions were very active in submitting proposals . " an interactive exhibition titled " fire !
fire ! " combines the science of fire with the history of finland 's oldest city and current culture capital , which was nearly destroyed by a fire in 1827 .
another series of events titled " 876 shades of darkness " takes up themes undoubtedly on the minds of many of turku 's guests during the long winter months : what is darkness , how do we perceive it , and how do we deal with it ? the 14th incarnation of an event titled " black market for useful knowledge and non-useful knowledge " also will also take an academic approach to culture .
at 50 tables set up for the " knowledge market , " scientists , artists , craftsmen and philosophers impart their knowledge to guests one-on-one in ways that intersect with performance . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " photomontage iv " by melinda gibson is part of the alice in wonderland show ' alice in wonderland ' much of turku 's 50 million euro -lrb- $ 66 million -rrb- budget is also given over to more traditional cultural programming , including dance and theater performances and gallery exhibitions , like a major , year-long presentation of contemporary photography titled " alice in wonderland . " it will be the largest exhibition of contemporary photographic art ever held in finland , presenting works from finnish and international artists that explore the intersection of fantasy and reality . " our inspiration for the show came from noticing that many finnish photographers today are producing work that examines the fantastical aspects of life , " exhibition curator elina heikka told deutsche welle . " every one of us is living between these two worlds of fantasy and reality , and we wanted to present that issue , " she added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : located on the baltic sea , turku has a population of 175,000 stories around the campfire finnish tradition is also reflected in one of the other major themes of turku 's programming : storytelling , according to festival representative saara malila . " we want to raise the importance of storytelling for a new generation of people growing up around constant media and the internet , " malila explained .
" it goes back to those long , dark winter nights in finland where there was n't much to do except gather together and tell stories . " an event titled " nordic voices " will draw professional storytellers from across europe to finland 's capital of culture to share tales both ancient and modern , while a program titled " poetry portraits " offers participants the chance to spend anywhere from several minutes to hours with poets and hear a piece about what the writer observed . turku 's own story as a year-long culture capital will kick off with the opening ceremony on january 15 and last through december , 2011 . author : greg wiser editor : jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

as the nato forces look for an exit , the future of afghanistan appears as unpredictable as ever . the 2010 us annual strategy review of afghanistan showed ' significant ' progress in the decade-long war against the taliban and al qaeda militants .
however , some afghanistan experts are of the opinion that things are quite the opposite in the war-torn country .
" these days we are getting different echoes out of afghanistan , " said conrad schetter , an expert on the afpak region , in an interview with deutsche welle .
" the official point of view , for example of the german administration , is that things are on track and they -lrb- nato -rrb- are quite successful in afghanistan .
however , if you talk to afghans , or to people who have just returned from afghanistan , they give you a very different picture .
they tell you that on the one side , the afghan government is so corrupt , and on the other side the pakistani government is so unwilling to cooperate that there has hardly been any success against the insurgents in the last year . "
many afghans also disagree with the us claims of progress .
" in my opinion , in 2010 , the government did not achieve anything .
people 's lives have got worse , " said a resident of kabul .
" long-term " us interests in afghanistan bildunterschrift : experts believe that president obama wanted a less hawkish strategy for afghanistan the war against islamist militants is far from over despite the us administration 's military surge in the earlier half of 2010 .
the us also tried to woo the ' moderate ' taliban for a power-sharing arrangement post nato withdrawal in 2014 .
both the us and afghan governments continued to express their dissatisfaction with pakistan 's counter-terrorism efforts in its recalcitrant northwest , which is considered to be a safe haven for many al-qaeda and taliban operatives .
some analysts are also of the view that the us ' strategy to increase troops in afghanistan did n't turn out to be effective , and that it was more a dictate of the us army generals than us president obama 's own plan .
" i think for obama it was a very difficult decision , and that is also why he took such a long time to send more troops into afghanistan .
he was favoring a more non-violent approach , but there were some generals in the pentagon who wanted to go on an offensive , " said schetter , " but one thing should be clear : the americans wo n't leave afghanistan for good .
it is clear that they have long-term interests in the country . "
increased civilian deaths bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a un report found a 25 percent rise in civilian casualties in 2010 according to a recent un report , the civilian casualties in afghanistan rose by 25 % in 2010 .
the un blamed the militants for most of the deaths .
according to the report , there were 6,200 civilian casualties in the first ten months of 2010 , including 2,400 deaths and 3,800 injuries .
an afghan citizen from the taliban 's birth city kandahar complained : " we are the victims of this war .
we have no security .
the government should take care of our security .
if we only had security , we could solve other problems ourselves . "
on the other hand , more than 700 us and nato troops have also been killed in 2010 , compared to 512 last year , which is a 25 percent increase .
second post-taliban elections bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an afghan woman casts her vote in the september elections then there were the controversial parliamentary elections of september 2010 .
independent election monitors recorded large-scale irregularities .
but the fact that nearly five million afghans came out to cast their votes was considered a success by many .
a less optimistic picture in july 2010 , the whistle blowing website wikileaks published more than 91,000 official us documents dealing with afghanistan .
the leaked us cables showed a less optimistic picture of afghanistan than what the us and afghan governments had been trying to project publically .
the us government 's afghanistan logs also shed light on the corruption of the afghan government , as well as the us cynicism with pakistan , which is believed was supporting some taliban militants , causing a great deal of damage to nato 's efforts in afghanistan .

they are found in everything from handhelds to wind turbines .
cause for concern now that china is reducing exports . after the chinese government decided to reduce exports of its precious rare earth elements on international markets by 35 percent for the first half of 2011 , the shares of chinese producers have reacted with increases .
meanwhile world markets are expected to react next year as modern technologies such as flat screen televisions and monitors and green technologies such as fluorescent light bulbs and hybrid cars require the minerals . china produces over 95 percent of the world ’ s rare earths and thus has a stronghold on the market .
according to sources in japanese industry , beijing temporarily cut exports to japan after a territorial row earlier this year .
the united states has advised china not to use its control over the coveted raw materials as a " weapon " and might take action at the world trade organization .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the restriction of rare earths could harm high-tech industries looking for alternatives while producers are now looking for alternative sources outside of china , high-tech company sony has said it will look for ways to cut its use of rare earths . at present , china accounts for approximately 75 percent of the global demand for rare earths ; the rest is used in japan , north america and europe .
by 2015 the demand for the elements is expected to increase by more than 50 percent from 110,000 tons to 250,000 tons per year . author : sarah berning -lrb- afp , reuters -rrb- editor : thomas baerthlein send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

they are found in everything from handhelds to wind turbines .
cause for concern now that china is reducing exports . after the chinese government decided to reduce exports of its precious rare earth elements on international markets by 35 percent for the first half of 2011 , the shares of chinese producers have reacted with increases .
meanwhile world markets are expected to react next year as modern technologies such as flat screen televisions and monitors and green technologies such as fluorescent light bulbs and hybrid cars require the minerals . china produces over 95 percent of the world ’ s rare earths and thus has a stronghold on the market .
according to sources in japanese industry , beijing temporarily cut exports to japan after a territorial row earlier this year .
the united states has advised china not to use its control over the coveted raw materials as a " weapon " and might take action at the world trade organization .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the restriction of rare earths could harm high-tech industries looking for alternatives while producers are now looking for alternative sources outside of china , high-tech company sony has said it will look for ways to cut its use of rare earths . at present , china accounts for approximately 75 percent of the global demand for rare earths ; the rest is used in japan , north america and europe .
by 2015 the demand for the elements is expected to increase by more than 50 percent from 110,000 tons to 250,000 tons per year . author : sarah berning -lrb- afp , reuters -rrb- editor : thomas baerthlein send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de aviation -pipe- 29.12.2010 german airport boss sparks debate about passenger profiling großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : passenger profiling would be partly based on ethnicity the future president of the german airport association has called for checks based on age , sex and ethnicity for " high-risk passengers . "
but the german justice minister has flatly rejected the idea . the ceo of dusseldorf airport , christoph blume , said he wanted to introduce passenger profiling in german airports to fight terrorism .
the system would be similar to that used in israel , where passengers are categorized as high or low risk according to their age , sex , ethnic background and other criteria . " in this way , the security systems can be more effectively used to benefit all those involved , " blume , who will become president of the german airport association -lrb- adv -rrb- in january , told the german newspaper rheinische post on tuesday .
high-risk passengers - those deemed more likely to carry out terrorist or illegal activity , such as organized crime , drug trafficking or espionage - would undergo more stringent security checks .
this could mean anything from a bag search to a full body search .
blume is n't alone in calling for more targeted checks .
current procedures are n't working according to joerg handwerg , a pilot for lufthansa and spokesperson for the pilot 's association cockpit .
" the current controls are foolish , because we waste resources by doing things that feign security but do n't actually bring security , " handwerg told deutsche welle .
a matter of common sense ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the threat of terrorism has led to heightened security at airports handwerg suggested that a point system could be employed to determine which passengers might pose a higher security risk , also taking note of where passengers were coming from and travelling to .
he said profiling could involve analyzing passenger behavior .
" the israelis already very successfully do psychological profiling based on asking people where they are going and paying attention to psychological reactions , like if the people become nervous , " he said .
" in these conversations you can assess whether a passenger should be checked more closely , or if they are unsuspicious . "
handwerg said profiling was a matter of common sense , rejecting the notion that it could be discriminatory .
" is it justified to check an 80-year-old woman just as intensively as an 18-year-old male passenger ? " he asked .
" there are differences .
that 's got nothing to do with discrimination ; it 's just common sense . "
climate of suspicion but in germany , where data protection is highly prized , opposition to collecting personal information about passengers would be a sticking point to introducing profiling .
critics , such as martin kutscha , a professor of constitutional law at the berlin school of economics and law , say that the dangers of profiling are too high a price to pay for greater security .
" obviously safety is a valuable commodity , but our society will never be 100 percent safe , " kutscha told deutsche welle .
" you will never catch someone who blows himself up at a market place with this kind of profiling .
safety is important , but not to the extent that you hold everybody under extreme suspicion . "
kutscha said profiling would also be legally problematic , especially since germany 's constitution does not allow ethnic discrimination .
he also worried that a climate of suspicion could be damaging for german society , especially with regard to its immigrant population .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : justice minister leutheusser-schnarrenberger has rejected the proposal " -lsb- profiling -rsb- would feed the fears that exist in society .
it 's obviously very damaging for a country that depends on immigration , like germany , " kutscha said .
in comments made to the frankfurter rundschau newspaper on wednesday , german justice minister sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger flatly rejected blume 's proposal , warning of the danger of " stigmatizing passengers , if one differentiates between them according to their origin and religion . "
she added that she believed passenger profiling would contravene german and european anti-discrimination legislation . the federal commissioner for data protection , peter schaar , also dismissed the suggestion , calling it unreasonable and unsupported in any legal sense .
" such a procedure would amount to a permanent dragnet , " he told the rheinische post newspaper .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de security -pipe- 29.12.2010 international hackers convene in berlin großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the chaos communication congress opened monday the 27th annual chaos communication congress is currently underway in germany .
these hackers say society should be worried about personal data collected by governments about us . on monday , two berlin mobile security researchers outlined what they 've dubbed the " sms of death " attack , which they claim could potentially could affect significant portions of mobile phones worldwide , the overwhelming majority of which are non-smartphones , like an iphone or android .
by flooding these mobiles with hundreds of thousands of malicious texts , they were able to discover bugs within the phones text-message reading software , that in some cases would force the phone to get stuck in a reboot loop .
and that was just day one of the 27th annual chaos communication congress , the annual gathering of the chaos computer club , currently going on this week in the german capital .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new attack could affect millions of mobile phones the two german researchers , collin mulliner and nico golde , from the technical university of berlin , claimed that their attack potentially could affect older-generation mobile phones made by sony ericsson , samsung , motorola , micromax and lg .
mulliner theorized that a large scale such attack might be overwhelming to a mobile network by inducing " ten thousand mobiles to try to reconnect simultaneously . "
amongst the 3,000 attendees , there 's a majority of very pale , sometimes chubby men , with laptops under their arms who look like they have n't seen a lot of sunlight , there are also students , a few hipsters and women in attendance .
during the conference , which concludes on thursday , participants take part in lectures and workshops on political and technical topics - from censorship , data surveillance and copyright , to voip security and hacking smart phones .
attendees can even buy sim cards to use a special , experimental mobile phone network set up solely for this conference .
wikileaks first debuted at the 2007 ccc congress the chaos computer club , or ccc , was founded in berlin in 1981 and is one of the world 's oldest self-desecribed hacker clubs .
since that time , the ccc has become known for consistently exposing security flaws and challenged the trend of heightened data surveillance since the september 11 , 2001 attacks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in 2008 , the ccc published the fingerprints of germany 's interior minister to protest the authorities ' increasing use of biometric data , in march 2008 , the ccc acquired the german interior minister 's fingerprints , which they took from a water glass the politician used at a public speaking event .
they took that imprint and published them as a way to protest the increased use of biometric data in germany and to highlight the insecure nature of such data .
three years ago , at the 2007 congress , wikileaks founder julian assange presented an early sketch of the now-contraversial website .
there , he met ccc member , daniel domscheit-berg , -lrb- then known by his alias , daniel schmitt -rrb- , who until a few months ago was considered assange 's number two at wikileaks .
while the two groups are not formally affiliated , frank rosengart , a chaos computer club spokesperson , said that his organization supports wikileaks because both groups have similar goals , especially around the issues of more transparency in government , or what rosengart calls " machine-readable government . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wikileaks founder julian assange presented his website to the ccc in 2007 " wikileaks , for us , it 's the right way to do it , to publish information , " said rosengart .
" keeping the privacy and keeping the sources anonymous - that 's a very important part of software and this can be considered a good hack to set up such a system that works in this way . "
rosengart said that first and foremost the congress is a meeting place for technical collaboration to take place - as was the case with wikileaks .
" there are a lot of projects like open-source programming projects and some people they meet here for the first time in real life , " he said .
" so they know them online , they work together , they do software together , but they meet here for the first time . "
data retention policies on the rise this week at the ccc congress are a number of talks at the congress about data retention , which has increased dramatically in the last nine years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in december 2007 , assange met daniel domscheit-berg , who until recently was wikileaks ' number two in an attempt to prevent further terrorist attacks , many governments , including the united states and germany , have increased the amount and type of data they keep on each citizen .
one of the groups participating this year is ak vorrat - the working group on data retention - that lead a campaign protesting against the introduction of a data retention law in germany in 2008 .
the group 's efforts were successful and in march 2010 the law was declarecd unconstitutional by the german constitutional court .
however , this year , ak vorrat has focused its attention on the 2011 census .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many club members are worried about what types of data should be collected by governments " there is some data that should not be collected , " said michael ebeling , an ak vorrat spokesperson , who said the group is particularly concerned about certain lines of questioning in the german census .
" if you are not coming from germany , they are asking you where are you coming from , where are your father , your mother coming from ? " he said . " what kind of religion do you believe in ? if you are islamic believer then they ask very precisely , are you sunni or shiite .
and we ask why do they ask these things ? "
he added that for christians , there are no follow up questions about a person 's particular denomination , and noted that people who do n't fill out the forms correctly could face further questioning and or a hefty fine .
ak vorrat is also concerned because the data people put on the census forms will not be made anonymous for four to six years , and given the sensitive nature of much of this personal data , they fear that it could be misused by politicians - in the name of fighting terrorism .
increasing surveillance across the european union bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chaos computer club members are also concerned about the use of such data around europe but this year 's attendees are not just concerned about surveillance measures within germany .
the forum of computer scientists for peace and social responsibility association -lrb- fiff -rrb- , is a german non-profit organization focusing mainly on privacy and security issues , as well as the use of technology in weapons , robots and cyber-warfare .
on wednesday , fiff members gave a presentation about a european research project called indect that develops surveillance techniques for the authorities .
indect was initiated by the polish platform for homeland security , and according to its website , aims to " develop new , advanced and innovative algorithms and methods aiming at combating terrorism and other criminal activities affecting citizens ' safety . "
kai nothdurft , a student at the university of bremen , and a fiff member , said that indect is all about meticulously aggregating data from different sources - from websites , social networks , government databases and filming demonstrations using unmanned aerial vehicles , or uavs .
" they combine -lsb- data -rsb- with pictures they get from surveillance cameras , cctv cameras from public places and by using face recognition , " he said , adding that social networking photos can also be used as a surveillance tool .
" that 's a very dangerous thing because there 's an empowerment of all these surveillance techniques by really combining all these things . ”
lockpicking : the original hack bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german lockpicking club also had a stand at the conference while there 's a big focus on political issues at the conference , there are also fun and practical workshops like how to recover your data if your hard drive crashes , how to hack your playstation 3 console , and there 's even a stand for germany 's lockpicking club .
" if you enter a door without a key and if you open a lock without a key , it 's a hacking technique too , " said one female member of the club , who goes by the nom de hacker , snow goose .
however , she was quick to explain that the club has strict ethical ground rules .
" -lsb- we do n't teach -rsb- anybody to break into other peoples ' houses , " she said .
" always pick your own locks only ! "
similarly , for many attendees , this strong confluence of curiosity , technical inquiry , civic-mindendness and ethics is what unites all hackers .
" for me its more a lifestyle , " said frank rosengart , the ccc spokesperson .
" hacking is asking more questions , trying to understand , using electronic devices in a different way than the manual proposes .
i think we need to go out to the world with this kind of lifestyle and trying to make a better world . "

" we did realize that cyber is one of the major , new issues to be dealt with , " said former us secretary of state madeline albright , who played a leading role in developing nato 's new overall strategy . stuxnet , a sophisticated computer virus designed to infect industrial control systems used in power plants , refineries and chemical production facilities , was found in september .
though its creators remain unknown , experts believe the program was written by programmers aiming to cripple iran 's uranium enrichment capabilities . the program proved nations and other groups were actively working on covert projects that would derail other countries ' industrial complex , according to stefan ritter of the german federal office for information security . " now we had proof , " he told deutsche welle .
" it was n't a fictional threat thought up by a couple of experts in a backroom anymore .
it 's a real threat that 's extremely large and extremely sophisticated . " wikileaks published classified material the whistle-blower website wikileaks , however , showed that sophisticated technology can also be harnessed to take information out of the backroom and put it in a public forum . bildunterschrift : already operational , wikileaks became well-known after releasing the afghan files the site first published some 80,000 classified documents relating to the us war in afghanistan then 400,000 files concerning the war in iraq . " the battlefield consequences of the release of these documents are potentially severe and dangerous for our troops , our allies and our afghan partners and may well damage our relationships and reputation in that key part of the world , " us defense secretary robert gates said after the afghanistan files were published . in november , wikileaks began the gradual publication of 250,000 diplomatic cables sent to washington from us embassies .
the frank assessments us officials sent to the state department brought to light the discrepancy between what world leaders sometimes say and do when it comes to international politics . wikileaks led to another online confrontation as an informal group of its proponents staged denial of service attacks on companies that removed wikileaks.org material from their servers and stopped accepting donations and discontinued financial services for the organization . google street view launches in germany personal privacy was the largest tech topic in germany in 2010 .
much media attention focused on opposition to google street view , an expansion of the us company 's map service that shows a street-level view of cities around the world . bildunterschrift : not everyone in germany was happy to have pictures of their homes appear on the internet privacy advocates accused google of infringing on individuals ' privacy and demanded a way for germans to opt out of the service before it went online , which some 200,000 people did before images of 20 german cities were made available in november . the german government also was in the spotlight after the country 's highest court overturned a 2008 law that required telecommunications companies to save phone and internet connection data for six months in case authorities required it for a criminal investigation . " saving connection information without cause evokes a diffuse and threatening feeling of being observation that impairs the unprejudiced perception of basic rights in many areas , " said hans-juergen papier , the president of the constitutional court at the time of the march verdict . proving that a change in calendar wo n't mean a change in points of view , joerg ziercke , the head of germany 's federal criminal police agency , called on lawmakers to find a way of sidestepping the court 's decision and obliging companies to store connection data . " it is important for us to be able to access this information under certain circumstances , " he said .

though its creators remain unknown , experts believe the program was written by programmers aiming to cripple iran 's uranium enrichment capabilities . the program proved nations and other groups were actively working on covert projects that would derail other countries ' industrial complex , according to stefan ritter of the german federal office for information security . " now we had proof , " he told deutsche welle .
" it was n't a fictional threat thought up by a couple of experts in a backroom anymore .
it 's a real threat that 's extremely large and extremely sophisticated . " wikileaks published classified material the whistle-blower website wikileaks , however , showed that sophisticated technology can also be harnessed to take information out of the backroom and put it in a public forum . bildunterschrift : already operational , wikileaks became well-known after releasing the afghan files the site first published some 80,000 classified documents relating to the us war in afghanistan then 400,000 files concerning the war in iraq . " the battlefield consequences of the release of these documents are potentially severe and dangerous for our troops , our allies and our afghan partners and may well damage our relationships and reputation in that key part of the world , " us defense secretary robert gates said after the afghanistan files were published . in november , wikileaks began the gradual publication of 250,000 diplomatic cables sent to washington from us embassies .
the frank assessments us officials sent to the state department brought to light the discrepancy between what world leaders sometimes say and do when it comes to international politics . wikileaks led to another online confrontation as an informal group of its proponents staged denial of service attacks on companies that removed wikileaks.org material from their servers and stopped accepting donations and discontinued financial services for the organization . google street view launches in germany personal privacy was the largest tech topic in germany in 2010 .
much media attention focused on opposition to google street view , an expansion of the us company 's map service that shows a street-level view of cities around the world . bildunterschrift : not everyone in germany was happy to have pictures of their homes appear on the internet privacy advocates accused google of infringing on individuals ' privacy and demanded a way for germans to opt out of the service before it went online , which some 200,000 people did before images of 20 german cities were made available in november . the german government also was in the spotlight after the country 's highest court overturned a 2008 law that required telecommunications companies to save phone and internet connection data for six months in case authorities required it for a criminal investigation . " saving connection information without cause evokes a diffuse and threatening feeling of being observation that impairs the unprejudiced perception of basic rights in many areas , " said hans-juergen papier , the president of the constitutional court at the time of the march verdict . proving that a change in calendar wo n't mean a change in points of view , joerg ziercke , the head of germany 's federal criminal police agency , called on lawmakers to find a way of sidestepping the court 's decision and obliging companies to store connection data . " it is important for us to be able to access this information under certain circumstances , " he said .
" that 's why we need a new law that removes the barriers in the fight against terrorism and organized crime . " authors : matthias von hein , sean sinico editor : cyrus farivar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de security -pipe- 29.12.2010 international hackers convene in berlin großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the chaos communication congress opened monday the 27th annual chaos communication congress is currently underway in germany .
these hackers say society should be worried about personal data collected by governments about us . on monday , two berlin mobile security researchers outlined what they 've dubbed the " sms of death " attack , which they claim could potentially could affect significant portions of mobile phones worldwide , the overwhelming majority of which are non-smartphones , like an iphone or android .
by flooding these mobiles with hundreds of thousands of malicious texts , they were able to discover bugs within the phones text-message reading software , that in some cases would force the phone to get stuck in a reboot loop .
and that was just day one of the 27th annual chaos communication congress , the annual gathering of the chaos computer club , currently going on this week in the german capital .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new attack could affect millions of mobile phones the two german researchers , collin mulliner and nico golde , from the technical university of berlin , claimed that their attack potentially could affect older-generation mobile phones made by sony ericsson , samsung , motorola , micromax and lg .
mulliner theorized that a large scale such attack might be overwhelming to a mobile network by inducing " ten thousand mobiles to try to reconnect simultaneously . "
amongst the 3,000 attendees , there 's a majority of very pale , sometimes chubby men , with laptops under their arms who look like they have n't seen a lot of sunlight , there are also students , a few hipsters and women in attendance .
during the conference , which concludes on thursday , participants take part in lectures and workshops on political and technical topics - from censorship , data surveillance and copyright , to voip security and hacking smart phones .
attendees can even buy sim cards to use a special , experimental mobile phone network set up solely for this conference .
wikileaks first debuted at the 2007 ccc congress the chaos computer club , or ccc , was founded in berlin in 1981 and is one of the world 's oldest self-desecribed hacker clubs .
since that time , the ccc has become known for consistently exposing security flaws and challenged the trend of heightened data surveillance since the september 11 , 2001 attacks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in 2008 , the ccc published the fingerprints of germany 's interior minister to protest the authorities ' increasing use of biometric data , in march 2008 , the ccc acquired the german interior minister 's fingerprints , which they took from a water glass the politician used at a public speaking event .
they took that imprint and published them as a way to protest the increased use of biometric data in germany and to highlight the insecure nature of such data .
three years ago , at the 2007 congress , wikileaks founder julian assange presented an early sketch of the now-contraversial website .
there , he met ccc member , daniel domscheit-berg , -lrb- then known by his alias , daniel schmitt -rrb- , who until a few months ago was considered assange 's number two at wikileaks .
while the two groups are not formally affiliated , frank rosengart , a chaos computer club spokesperson , said that his organization supports wikileaks because both groups have similar goals , especially around the issues of more transparency in government , or what rosengart calls " machine-readable government . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wikileaks founder julian assange presented his website to the ccc in 2007 " wikileaks , for us , it 's the right way to do it , to publish information , " said rosengart .
" keeping the privacy and keeping the sources anonymous - that 's a very important part of software and this can be considered a good hack to set up such a system that works in this way . "
rosengart said that first and foremost the congress is a meeting place for technical collaboration to take place - as was the case with wikileaks .
" there are a lot of projects like open-source programming projects and some people they meet here for the first time in real life , " he said .
" so they know them online , they work together , they do software together , but they meet here for the first time . "
data retention policies on the rise this week at the ccc congress are a number of talks at the congress about data retention , which has increased dramatically in the last nine years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in december 2007 , assange met daniel domscheit-berg , who until recently was wikileaks ' number two in an attempt to prevent further terrorist attacks , many governments , including the united states and germany , have increased the amount and type of data they keep on each citizen .
one of the groups participating this year is ak vorrat - the working group on data retention - that lead a campaign protesting against the introduction of a data retention law in germany in 2008 .
the group 's efforts were successful and in march 2010 the law was declarecd unconstitutional by the german constitutional court .
however , this year , ak vorrat has focused its attention on the 2011 census .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many club members are worried about what types of data should be collected by governments " there is some data that should not be collected , " said michael ebeling , an ak vorrat spokesperson , who said the group is particularly concerned about certain lines of questioning in the german census .
" if you are not coming from germany , they are asking you where are you coming from , where are your father , your mother coming from ? " he said . " what kind of religion do you believe in ? if you are islamic believer then they ask very precisely , are you sunni or shiite .
and we ask why do they ask these things ? "
he added that for christians , there are no follow up questions about a person 's particular denomination , and noted that people who do n't fill out the forms correctly could face further questioning and or a hefty fine .
ak vorrat is also concerned because the data people put on the census forms will not be made anonymous for four to six years , and given the sensitive nature of much of this personal data , they fear that it could be misused by politicians - in the name of fighting terrorism .
increasing surveillance across the european union bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chaos computer club members are also concerned about the use of such data around europe but this year 's attendees are not just concerned about surveillance measures within germany .
the forum of computer scientists for peace and social responsibility association -lrb- fiff -rrb- , is a german non-profit organization focusing mainly on privacy and security issues , as well as the use of technology in weapons , robots and cyber-warfare .
on wednesday , fiff members gave a presentation about a european research project called indect that develops surveillance techniques for the authorities .
indect was initiated by the polish platform for homeland security , and according to its website , aims to " develop new , advanced and innovative algorithms and methods aiming at combating terrorism and other criminal activities affecting citizens ' safety . "
kai nothdurft , a student at the university of bremen , and a fiff member , said that indect is all about meticulously aggregating data from different sources - from websites , social networks , government databases and filming demonstrations using unmanned aerial vehicles , or uavs .
" they combine -lsb- data -rsb- with pictures they get from surveillance cameras , cctv cameras from public places and by using face recognition , " he said , adding that social networking photos can also be used as a surveillance tool .
" that 's a very dangerous thing because there 's an empowerment of all these surveillance techniques by really combining all these things . ”
lockpicking : the original hack bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german lockpicking club also had a stand at the conference while there 's a big focus on political issues at the conference , there are also fun and practical workshops like how to recover your data if your hard drive crashes , how to hack your playstation 3 console , and there 's even a stand for germany 's lockpicking club .
" if you enter a door without a key and if you open a lock without a key , it 's a hacking technique too , " said one female member of the club , who goes by the nom de hacker , snow goose .
however , she was quick to explain that the club has strict ethical ground rules .
" -lsb- we do n't teach -rsb- anybody to break into other peoples ' houses , " she said .
" always pick your own locks only ! "
similarly , for many attendees , this strong confluence of curiosity , technical inquiry , civic-mindendness and ethics is what unites all hackers .
" for me its more a lifestyle , " said frank rosengart , the ccc spokesperson .
" hacking is asking more questions , trying to understand , using electronic devices in a different way than the manual proposes .
i think we need to go out to the world with this kind of lifestyle and trying to make a better world . "

national security trumps rights and conflicts displace tens of thousands .
but progress has been made improving international institutions . united nations high commissioner for human rights navi pillay capped off a turbulent year of human rights by marking the 60th anniversary of her office and honored the achievements of hundreds of thousands of rights workers who risk their lives to speak out for human rights . " while combating discrimination and other important human rights causes , they themselves are often subject to discrimination , " she said .
" in fact , every year , thousands of human rights defenders are harassed , abused , unjustly detained and even murdered . " mass rape continues to be an appalling reality , torture remains widespread , extra-judicial executions , arbitrary detention and disappearances are all too prevalent in repressive societies , and national security interests and xenophobia are eroding human rights in democratic ones . some progress meanwhile , progress is slowly being made in strengthening the international laws and institutions that hold human rights violators accountable for their crimes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's difficult to judge the state of human rights however , it is getting harder to gauge whether the human rights situation is improving , according to julie de rivero , the geneva director for international non-government organization human rights watch . " what we have seen is an increase on the attacks on human rights defenders not only in places like china and iran , but also in other places where we had been a little bit hopeful about reform , such as bahrain , " she told deutsche welle . de rivero pointed to sri lanka as a place where crimes against civilians continue to be committed with impunity . " we saw the war end in sri lanka , but at a very high cost for civilians that were caught in indiscriminate fire by both sides , " she said .
" and , yet , there has been no accountability for war crimes in that country . " violence against women another worrying trend , de rivero noted , is sexual violence against women , particularly in the democratic republic of congo . " the scale of the phenomenon , i think , always compels us to focus on this particular situation because rape has been so normalized as a weapon of war in that country that it is shocking and the devastation that it causes is incredible in the lives of individuals and the community , " she said . de rivero added that the war on terror and heightened concern for national security are leading to a further erosion of human rights , even in democratic societies . making perpetrators accountable for their crimes remains a major concern for the international community , according to un high commissioner for human rights spokesman rupert collville .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rape and violence against women persist in drc " you have certain human rights violations that just continue year after year , " he said .
" you get some progress and then you get backsliding on something like torture . almost all states have laws that prohibit torture and declare it a crime , yet many states are still practicing it and many states do not prosecute those who commit it . " justice 's slow march discrimination is another major - and ongoing - concern , he said , adding that it affects women , homosexuals , people with disabilities , the elderly , minorities and indigenous peoples . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : discrimination troubles both industrialized and developing nations " it is a constant theme on every continent , including in the developed countries , where i think the treatment of migrants or foreigners has clearly deteriorated in the past decade or so , " collville said . while too many people get away with the crimes they commit , not all do and patience is needed as the wheels of justice turn slowly , collville said . " twenty or 30 years down the line , people still are being brought to court and charged with serious crimes - that perhaps is the strength of the system , " he said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de security -pipe- 29.12.2010 germany prepares for un security council membership großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as of january , germany will help man the security council as of january , germany will take one of the ten seats on the un security council reserved for non-permanent members .
it will focus on the afghanistan conflict and hopes to push climate change onto the council 's agenda . given the magnitude of conflicts that end up on the table of the united nations security council , germany hopes it can help defuse or even settle at least some of those conflicts when it joins the body for a two-year term in january 2011 .
" we want the council to not only deal with the fallout of a given crisis , but put more effort into conflict prevention , " said germany 's ambassador to the united nations , peter wittig .
" in other words , we want the security council to become active long before any reports about the first casualties come in . "
germany will above all be responsible for coordinating the international community 's military and development efforts in afghanistan .
it 's also likely to be in charge of the council 's al qaeda sanctions committee which oversees travel restrictions that have been imposed and the freezing of assets held by taliban supporters .
squaring the circle ?
yet the sanctions in place have proven to be an obstacle to bringing taliban leaders to the negotiating table in a bid to incorporate them in the peace process in afghanistan - and compromises will be required to get out of the dilemma .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter wittig has represented germany at the un since december 2009 but former german un ambassador guenter pleuger is confident that germany can make a difference .
" individual members of the council can be quite influential , " he told deutsche welle .
" you just need to present good arguments and a good course of action . "
new strategic alliances germany is also poised to use its tenure to convince others of treating climate change as a potential security issue .
what it has in mind is the expected impact of global warming on available resources and the fate of many small island states threatened by rising sea levels .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sao tome and principe is one of the island states threatened with disappearance " if germany wants to make headway , it has to focus more on talks with individual countries , including rapidly industrializing nations , " susanne droege from the german institute for international and security affairs told deutsche welle .
" it can not count on the backing of the united states in this field .
it 'll be like walking the tightrope – seeking support from countries in africa and asia without alienating itself from its traditional allies in the west . "
germany was once before a non-permanent member of the security council between 2003 and 2004 when it was among those refusing to give their backing for the us-led invasion of iraq .
that earned it a good deal of harsh criticism from the us administration – and admiration from others .
the iraq war was unleashed nonetheless , mercilessly highlighting the limited powers of the united nations ' most important body .
the security council also failed to prevent the genocide in rwanda , the civil war in somalia and the political chaos in the democratic republic of congo .
higher ambitions germany 's renewed membership is seen as an important milestone in berlin .
but plans to become a permanent member of the council will also be pursued , along with a general overhaul of the body to reflect modern-day realities . brazil , india , south africa and japan have also been struggling to join the body on a permanent basis to give their regions a greater say in world affairs . it is widely felt that the current composition of the security council made up of the united states , russia , britain , france and china reflects an outdated post-world war ii scenario . author : hardy graupner editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" in fact , every year , thousands of human rights defenders are harassed , abused , unjustly detained and even murdered . " mass rape continues to be an appalling reality , torture remains widespread , extra-judicial executions , arbitrary detention and disappearances are all too prevalent in repressive societies , and national security interests and xenophobia are eroding human rights in democratic ones . some progress meanwhile , progress is slowly being made in strengthening the international laws and institutions that hold human rights violators accountable for their crimes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's difficult to judge the state of human rights however , it is getting harder to gauge whether the human rights situation is improving , according to julie de rivero , the geneva director for international non-government organization human rights watch . " what we have seen is an increase on the attacks on human rights defenders not only in places like china and iran , but also in other places where we had been a little bit hopeful about reform , such as bahrain , " she told deutsche welle . de rivero pointed to sri lanka as a place where crimes against civilians continue to be committed with impunity . " we saw the war end in sri lanka , but at a very high cost for civilians that were caught in indiscriminate fire by both sides , " she said .
" and , yet , there has been no accountability for war crimes in that country . " violence against women another worrying trend , de rivero noted , is sexual violence against women , particularly in the democratic republic of congo . " the scale of the phenomenon , i think , always compels us to focus on this particular situation because rape has been so normalized as a weapon of war in that country that it is shocking and the devastation that it causes is incredible in the lives of individuals and the community , " she said . de rivero added that the war on terror and heightened concern for national security are leading to a further erosion of human rights , even in democratic societies . making perpetrators accountable for their crimes remains a major concern for the international community , according to un high commissioner for human rights spokesman rupert collville .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rape and violence against women persist in drc " you have certain human rights violations that just continue year after year , " he said .
" you get some progress and then you get backsliding on something like torture . almost all states have laws that prohibit torture and declare it a crime , yet many states are still practicing it and many states do not prosecute those who commit it . " justice 's slow march discrimination is another major - and ongoing - concern , he said , adding that it affects women , homosexuals , people with disabilities , the elderly , minorities and indigenous peoples . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : discrimination troubles both industrialized and developing nations " it is a constant theme on every continent , including in the developed countries , where i think the treatment of migrants or foreigners has clearly deteriorated in the past decade or so , " collville said . while too many people get away with the crimes they commit , not all do and patience is needed as the wheels of justice turn slowly , collville said . " twenty or 30 years down the line , people still are being brought to court and charged with serious crimes - that perhaps is the strength of the system , " he said .
" circumstances change and people who think they are actively immune to justice sometimes find that is not actually the case in the long term .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de security -pipe- 29.12.2010 international hackers convene in berlin großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the chaos communication congress opened monday the 27th annual chaos communication congress is currently underway in germany .
these hackers say society should be worried about personal data collected by governments about us . on monday , two berlin mobile security researchers outlined what they 've dubbed the " sms of death " attack , which they claim could potentially could affect significant portions of mobile phones worldwide , the overwhelming majority of which are non-smartphones , like an iphone or android .
by flooding these mobiles with hundreds of thousands of malicious texts , they were able to discover bugs within the phones text-message reading software , that in some cases would force the phone to get stuck in a reboot loop .
and that was just day one of the 27th annual chaos communication congress , the annual gathering of the chaos computer club , currently going on this week in the german capital .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new attack could affect millions of mobile phones the two german researchers , collin mulliner and nico golde , from the technical university of berlin , claimed that their attack potentially could affect older-generation mobile phones made by sony ericsson , samsung , motorola , micromax and lg .
mulliner theorized that a large scale such attack might be overwhelming to a mobile network by inducing " ten thousand mobiles to try to reconnect simultaneously . "
amongst the 3,000 attendees , there 's a majority of very pale , sometimes chubby men , with laptops under their arms who look like they have n't seen a lot of sunlight , there are also students , a few hipsters and women in attendance .
during the conference , which concludes on thursday , participants take part in lectures and workshops on political and technical topics - from censorship , data surveillance and copyright , to voip security and hacking smart phones .
attendees can even buy sim cards to use a special , experimental mobile phone network set up solely for this conference .
wikileaks first debuted at the 2007 ccc congress the chaos computer club , or ccc , was founded in berlin in 1981 and is one of the world 's oldest self-desecribed hacker clubs .
since that time , the ccc has become known for consistently exposing security flaws and challenged the trend of heightened data surveillance since the september 11 , 2001 attacks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in 2008 , the ccc published the fingerprints of germany 's interior minister to protest the authorities ' increasing use of biometric data , in march 2008 , the ccc acquired the german interior minister 's fingerprints , which they took from a water glass the politician used at a public speaking event .
they took that imprint and published them as a way to protest the increased use of biometric data in germany and to highlight the insecure nature of such data .
three years ago , at the 2007 congress , wikileaks founder julian assange presented an early sketch of the now-contraversial website .
there , he met ccc member , daniel domscheit-berg , -lrb- then known by his alias , daniel schmitt -rrb- , who until a few months ago was considered assange 's number two at wikileaks .
while the two groups are not formally affiliated , frank rosengart , a chaos computer club spokesperson , said that his organization supports wikileaks because both groups have similar goals , especially around the issues of more transparency in government , or what rosengart calls " machine-readable government . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wikileaks founder julian assange presented his website to the ccc in 2007 " wikileaks , for us , it 's the right way to do it , to publish information , " said rosengart .
" keeping the privacy and keeping the sources anonymous - that 's a very important part of software and this can be considered a good hack to set up such a system that works in this way . "
rosengart said that first and foremost the congress is a meeting place for technical collaboration to take place - as was the case with wikileaks .
" there are a lot of projects like open-source programming projects and some people they meet here for the first time in real life , " he said .
" so they know them online , they work together , they do software together , but they meet here for the first time . "
data retention policies on the rise this week at the ccc congress are a number of talks at the congress about data retention , which has increased dramatically in the last nine years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in december 2007 , assange met daniel domscheit-berg , who until recently was wikileaks ' number two in an attempt to prevent further terrorist attacks , many governments , including the united states and germany , have increased the amount and type of data they keep on each citizen .
one of the groups participating this year is ak vorrat - the working group on data retention - that lead a campaign protesting against the introduction of a data retention law in germany in 2008 .
the group 's efforts were successful and in march 2010 the law was declarecd unconstitutional by the german constitutional court .
however , this year , ak vorrat has focused its attention on the 2011 census .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many club members are worried about what types of data should be collected by governments " there is some data that should not be collected , " said michael ebeling , an ak vorrat spokesperson , who said the group is particularly concerned about certain lines of questioning in the german census .
" if you are not coming from germany , they are asking you where are you coming from , where are your father , your mother coming from ? " he said . " what kind of religion do you believe in ? if you are islamic believer then they ask very precisely , are you sunni or shiite .
and we ask why do they ask these things ? "
he added that for christians , there are no follow up questions about a person 's particular denomination , and noted that people who do n't fill out the forms correctly could face further questioning and or a hefty fine .
ak vorrat is also concerned because the data people put on the census forms will not be made anonymous for four to six years , and given the sensitive nature of much of this personal data , they fear that it could be misused by politicians - in the name of fighting terrorism .
increasing surveillance across the european union bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chaos computer club members are also concerned about the use of such data around europe but this year 's attendees are not just concerned about surveillance measures within germany .
the forum of computer scientists for peace and social responsibility association -lrb- fiff -rrb- , is a german non-profit organization focusing mainly on privacy and security issues , as well as the use of technology in weapons , robots and cyber-warfare .
on wednesday , fiff members gave a presentation about a european research project called indect that develops surveillance techniques for the authorities .
indect was initiated by the polish platform for homeland security , and according to its website , aims to " develop new , advanced and innovative algorithms and methods aiming at combating terrorism and other criminal activities affecting citizens ' safety . "
kai nothdurft , a student at the university of bremen , and a fiff member , said that indect is all about meticulously aggregating data from different sources - from websites , social networks , government databases and filming demonstrations using unmanned aerial vehicles , or uavs .
" they combine -lsb- data -rsb- with pictures they get from surveillance cameras , cctv cameras from public places and by using face recognition , " he said , adding that social networking photos can also be used as a surveillance tool .
" that 's a very dangerous thing because there 's an empowerment of all these surveillance techniques by really combining all these things . ”
lockpicking : the original hack bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german lockpicking club also had a stand at the conference while there 's a big focus on political issues at the conference , there are also fun and practical workshops like how to recover your data if your hard drive crashes , how to hack your playstation 3 console , and there 's even a stand for germany 's lockpicking club .
" if you enter a door without a key and if you open a lock without a key , it 's a hacking technique too , " said one female member of the club , who goes by the nom de hacker , snow goose .
however , she was quick to explain that the club has strict ethical ground rules .
" -lsb- we do n't teach -rsb- anybody to break into other peoples ' houses , " she said .
" always pick your own locks only ! "
similarly , for many attendees , this strong confluence of curiosity , technical inquiry , civic-mindendness and ethics is what unites all hackers .
" for me its more a lifestyle , " said frank rosengart , the ccc spokesperson .
" hacking is asking more questions , trying to understand , using electronic devices in a different way than the manual proposes .
i think we need to go out to the world with this kind of lifestyle and trying to make a better world . "

transportation in germany and around europe has been severely disrupted this winter with heavy snowfall and icy conditions .

he said this might mean deutsche bahn would have to put the brakes on its expansion aims , including plans for an intercity express to london from 2013 .
transportation spokesman uwe beckmeyer from the opposition social democrats called on the government to not to weaken support for deutsche bahn , which has struggled to maintain effective and regular services during particularly icy or snowy periods this winter .
" the company needs every cent to invest in better equipment , " he told tagesspiegel .
according to the tagesspiegel , deutsche bahn came to the conclusion in october that it did not own enough trains to ensure regular services during " extraordinary circumstances . "

former prime minister tymoshenko and several members of her cabinet are already under investigation . opposition leaders in ukraine have accused the authorities of running a campaign of repression against the main opposition leader , former prime minister yulia tymoshenko , and her allies .
president viktor yanukovych has dismissed the claims as groundless .
yet a total of 12 members of the country 's opposition are under criminal investigation , six of them are set to ring in the new year in prison .
the latest prominent opposition figure be arrested was yuri lutsenko , a former interior minister in tymoshenko 's cabinet .
lutsenko was walking his dog when the security service arrested him on sunday .
" these are not the last arrests we are going to see this christmas and new year 's season , " mykola tomenko , deputy speaker of parliament , said on tuesday . " people could be going to jail all the way through epiphany . "
vasyl onopenko , head of the country 's supreme court on tuesday called on officials to respect the rights of detainees .
" the presumption of innocence must be respected , " he told a news conference .
" this is a constitutional principle .
but in our country , there are n't even formal charges , and still a person is immediately declared a criminal . "

she is accused of having spent money destined for environmental issues on paying pensions .
for the time being , she has not been detained , although she is not allowed to leave the capital kyiv and must be available for questioning .
before being questioned in the public prosecutor 's office last week , yulia tymoshenko accused the government of president viktor yanukovych of running the country " like a real mafia , " and that repressions against the opposition were aimed at ensuring that the opposition was in prison when the next elections are due .
" i would like to say to viktor yanukovych that , if he must carry out repressions , to do it in such a way that the people will not start laughing , when he puts the former prime minister behind bars for paying pensions , " she said .
yanukovich , however , denies all allegations .
during a recent television interview , he stressed that the president does not have the power to exert influence on the courts and that , besides , tymoshenko had all means at her disposal to defend herself .
opinion polls show that many people appear to have grown weary of politics .
the indicate that a growing number of ukrainians have little faith in their president - but they have even less faith in other politicians .

the latest prominent opposition figure be arrested was yuri lutsenko , a former interior minister in tymoshenko 's cabinet .

" i would like to say to viktor yanukovych that , if he must carry out repressions , to do it in such a way that the people will not start laughing , when he puts the former prime minister behind bars for paying pensions , " she said .
yanukovich , however , denies all allegations .
during a recent television interview , he stressed that the president does not have the power to exert influence on the courts and that , besides , tymoshenko had all means at her disposal to defend herself .

"
but the german justice minister has flatly rejected the idea . the ceo of dusseldorf airport , christoph blume , said he wanted to introduce passenger profiling in german airports to fight terrorism .
the system would be similar to that used in israel , where passengers are categorized as high or low risk according to their age , sex , ethnic background and other criteria . " in this way , the security systems can be more effectively used to benefit all those involved , " blume , who will become president of the german airport association -lrb- adv -rrb- in january , told the german newspaper rheinische post on tuesday .
high-risk passengers - those deemed more likely to carry out terrorist or illegal activity , such as organized crime , drug trafficking or espionage - would undergo more stringent security checks .
this could mean anything from a bag search to a full body search .
blume is n't alone in calling for more targeted checks .
current procedures are n't working according to joerg handwerg , a pilot for lufthansa and spokesperson for the pilot 's association cockpit .
" the current controls are foolish , because we waste resources by doing things that feign security but do n't actually bring security , " handwerg told deutsche welle .
a matter of common sense ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the threat of terrorism has led to heightened security at airports handwerg suggested that a point system could be employed to determine which passengers might pose a higher security risk , also taking note of where passengers were coming from and travelling to .
he said profiling could involve analyzing passenger behavior .
" the israelis already very successfully do psychological profiling based on asking people where they are going and paying attention to psychological reactions , like if the people become nervous , " he said .
" in these conversations you can assess whether a passenger should be checked more closely , or if they are unsuspicious . "
handwerg said profiling was a matter of common sense , rejecting the notion that it could be discriminatory .
" is it justified to check an 80-year-old woman just as intensively as an 18-year-old male passenger ? " he asked .
" there are differences .
that 's got nothing to do with discrimination ; it 's just common sense . "
climate of suspicion but in germany , where data protection is highly prized , opposition to collecting personal information about passengers would be a sticking point to introducing profiling .
critics , such as martin kutscha , a professor of constitutional law at the berlin school of economics and law , say that the dangers of profiling are too high a price to pay for greater security .
" obviously safety is a valuable commodity , but our society will never be 100 percent safe , " kutscha told deutsche welle .
" you will never catch someone who blows himself up at a market place with this kind of profiling .
safety is important , but not to the extent that you hold everybody under extreme suspicion . "
kutscha said profiling would also be legally problematic , especially since germany 's constitution does not allow ethnic discrimination .
he also worried that a climate of suspicion could be damaging for german society , especially with regard to its immigrant population .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : justice minister leutheusser-schnarrenberger has rejected the proposal " -lsb- profiling -rsb- would feed the fears that exist in society .
it 's obviously very damaging for a country that depends on immigration , like germany , " kutscha said .
in comments made to the frankfurter rundschau newspaper on wednesday , german justice minister sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger flatly rejected blume 's proposal , warning of the danger of " stigmatizing passengers , if one differentiates between them according to their origin and religion . "
she added that she believed passenger profiling would contravene german and european anti-discrimination legislation . the federal commissioner for data protection , peter schaar , also dismissed the suggestion , calling it unreasonable and unsupported in any legal sense .
" such a procedure would amount to a permanent dragnet , " he told the rheinische post newspaper .

once known for its ascendant economy , estonia 's financial prospects were changed drastically by the global economic crisis . starting in the late 1990s , estonia , lithuania and latvia enjoyed an unprecedented economic boom .
dubbed the " baltic tigers " , these three republics grew as much as 12 percent per year .
while tiny estonia is the smallest of the three states , it was regarded as the poster child of these emerging economic hotbeds .
with a flare for technology , the country was often jokingly called " e-stonia " .
one of the government 's key economic goals was to become a member of the eurozone .
following years of negotiations , estonia will introduce the common currency on january 1 , 2011 .
unfortunately for many residents , the global financial crisis has wiped out many of the telltale signs of economic prosperity in estonia .
euro already recognized for marina wolkowa , who sells a variety of goods from a market booth at tallinn 's central railway station , the euro is already part of daily reality .
sitting on a stool and waiting for customers , she explains that she has been required to list prices in both estonian kroons and the euro for a year now .
she sells estonian pickles for 25 kroons or 1.60 euros .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : estonia 's kroon became a symbol of independence from the soviet union " but the euro wo n't help us forward .
it 's only going to drive up prices , " she told deutsche welle .
at the end of the year , however , estonia 's 1.3 million inhabitants will have to part with the kroon , which has served as a symbol of the country 's independence after the collapse of the soviet union .
estonia 's economic boom was fueled in part by its enthusiasm for technology .
the country was an early adopter of computer-based financial systems .
then there were neoliberal market reforms : estonia 's flat income tax rate is an across-the-board 22 percent .
low deficit ultimately it was the global economic crisis that brought the " estonian tiger " to its knees .
in 2009 , the country 's economy shrank by 13 percent .
but the euro is coming to estonia anyway .
this is mainly because of the country 's low budget deficit , which for the past two years has been well below the 3 percent stipulated by the maastricht treaty .
additionally , the kroon has been pegged to the value of the euro since 2004 .
that 's why estonian president toomas hendrik ilves has said the change from kroons to euros will have a psychological effect more than anything .
it will help to differentiate estonia from the other baltic states , which are often perceived by outsiders of as a single unit .
" when latvia has a problem , then there is immediately a ' crisis in the baltic ' , " ilves said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : estonian president toomas hendrik ilves says the euro will be good for estonia in 2009 , latvia narrowly avoided insolvency multi-billion-euro lines of credit from the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- and the european union .
the country 's largest financial institute , parex-bank , was rescued from collapse by being nationalized .
easy credit and overspending estonia may have fared better than latvia , but it still has its own share of problems , and not just in the eyes of its own population .
many independent economists see the country 's situation as precarious .
rainer kattel from of the tallinn university of technology says the country would have run into problems even without the global economic crisis because many estonians were living beyond their means .
when times were at their best , banks doled out easy credit – often via cell phone text message and without seriously checking their customers ' creditworthiness .
" in principle , the situation in the baltic region is n't much different than in greece or spain , " kattel told deutsche welle .
" on the one hand we do n't have that high level of debt , but on the other hand estonia has an unemployment rate of 18 percent . "
kattel argues that an alternative to introducing the euro in 2011 would have been to devalue the kroon .
instead , estonia is now experiencing an internal devaluation through decreased salaries , he said .
there are plenty of reasons to be skeptical about the direction estonia is currently moving in , according to kattel .
the global economic crisis is far from over , and many of the country 's citizens will carry immense amounts of debt for years to come .
" i 'm afraid that large areas of estonia will become more and more depopulated , because the people there will move into the cities or move away completely , " he said .

estonia 's economic boom was fueled in part by its enthusiasm for technology .
the country was an early adopter of computer-based financial systems .
then there were neoliberal market reforms : estonia 's flat income tax rate is an across-the-board 22 percent .
low deficit ultimately it was the global economic crisis that brought the " estonian tiger " to its knees .
in 2009 , the country 's economy shrank by 13 percent .
but the euro is coming to estonia anyway .
this is mainly because of the country 's low budget deficit , which for the past two years has been well below the 3 percent stipulated by the maastricht treaty .
additionally , the kroon has been pegged to the value of the euro since 2004 .
that 's why estonian president toomas hendrik ilves has said the change from kroons to euros will have a psychological effect more than anything .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de security -pipe- 29.12.2010 international hackers convene in berlin großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the chaos communication congress opened monday the 27th annual chaos communication congress is currently underway in germany .
these hackers say society should be worried about personal data collected by governments about us . on monday , two berlin mobile security researchers outlined what they 've dubbed the " sms of death " attack , which they claim could potentially could affect significant portions of mobile phones worldwide , the overwhelming majority of which are non-smartphones , like an iphone or android .
by flooding these mobiles with hundreds of thousands of malicious texts , they were able to discover bugs within the phones text-message reading software , that in some cases would force the phone to get stuck in a reboot loop .
and that was just day one of the 27th annual chaos communication congress , the annual gathering of the chaos computer club , currently going on this week in the german capital .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new attack could affect millions of mobile phones the two german researchers , collin mulliner and nico golde , from the technical university of berlin , claimed that their attack potentially could affect older-generation mobile phones made by sony ericsson , samsung , motorola , micromax and lg .
mulliner theorized that a large scale such attack might be overwhelming to a mobile network by inducing " ten thousand mobiles to try to reconnect simultaneously . "
amongst the 3,000 attendees , there 's a majority of very pale , sometimes chubby men , with laptops under their arms who look like they have n't seen a lot of sunlight , there are also students , a few hipsters and women in attendance .
during the conference , which concludes on thursday , participants take part in lectures and workshops on political and technical topics - from censorship , data surveillance and copyright , to voip security and hacking smart phones .
attendees can even buy sim cards to use a special , experimental mobile phone network set up solely for this conference .
wikileaks first debuted at the 2007 ccc congress the chaos computer club , or ccc , was founded in berlin in 1981 and is one of the world 's oldest self-desecribed hacker clubs .
since that time , the ccc has become known for consistently exposing security flaws and challenged the trend of heightened data surveillance since the september 11 , 2001 attacks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in 2008 , the ccc published the fingerprints of germany 's interior minister to protest the authorities ' increasing use of biometric data , in march 2008 , the ccc acquired the german interior minister 's fingerprints , which they took from a water glass the politician used at a public speaking event .
they took that imprint and published them as a way to protest the increased use of biometric data in germany and to highlight the insecure nature of such data .
three years ago , at the 2007 congress , wikileaks founder julian assange presented an early sketch of the now-contraversial website .
there , he met ccc member , daniel domscheit-berg , -lrb- then known by his alias , daniel schmitt -rrb- , who until a few months ago was considered assange 's number two at wikileaks .
while the two groups are not formally affiliated , frank rosengart , a chaos computer club spokesperson , said that his organization supports wikileaks because both groups have similar goals , especially around the issues of more transparency in government , or what rosengart calls " machine-readable government . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wikileaks founder julian assange presented his website to the ccc in 2007 " wikileaks , for us , it 's the right way to do it , to publish information , " said rosengart .
" keeping the privacy and keeping the sources anonymous - that 's a very important part of software and this can be considered a good hack to set up such a system that works in this way . "
rosengart said that first and foremost the congress is a meeting place for technical collaboration to take place - as was the case with wikileaks .
" there are a lot of projects like open-source programming projects and some people they meet here for the first time in real life , " he said .
" so they know them online , they work together , they do software together , but they meet here for the first time . "
data retention policies on the rise this week at the ccc congress are a number of talks at the congress about data retention , which has increased dramatically in the last nine years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in december 2007 , assange met daniel domscheit-berg , who until recently was wikileaks ' number two in an attempt to prevent further terrorist attacks , many governments , including the united states and germany , have increased the amount and type of data they keep on each citizen .
one of the groups participating this year is ak vorrat - the working group on data retention - that lead a campaign protesting against the introduction of a data retention law in germany in 2008 .
the group 's efforts were successful and in march 2010 the law was declarecd unconstitutional by the german constitutional court .
however , this year , ak vorrat has focused its attention on the 2011 census .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many club members are worried about what types of data should be collected by governments " there is some data that should not be collected , " said michael ebeling , an ak vorrat spokesperson , who said the group is particularly concerned about certain lines of questioning in the german census .
" if you are not coming from germany , they are asking you where are you coming from , where are your father , your mother coming from ? " he said . " what kind of religion do you believe in ? if you are islamic believer then they ask very precisely , are you sunni or shiite .
and we ask why do they ask these things ? "
he added that for christians , there are no follow up questions about a person 's particular denomination , and noted that people who do n't fill out the forms correctly could face further questioning and or a hefty fine .
ak vorrat is also concerned because the data people put on the census forms will not be made anonymous for four to six years , and given the sensitive nature of much of this personal data , they fear that it could be misused by politicians - in the name of fighting terrorism .
increasing surveillance across the european union bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chaos computer club members are also concerned about the use of such data around europe but this year 's attendees are not just concerned about surveillance measures within germany .
the forum of computer scientists for peace and social responsibility association -lrb- fiff -rrb- , is a german non-profit organization focusing mainly on privacy and security issues , as well as the use of technology in weapons , robots and cyber-warfare .
on wednesday , fiff members gave a presentation about a european research project called indect that develops surveillance techniques for the authorities .
indect was initiated by the polish platform for homeland security , and according to its website , aims to " develop new , advanced and innovative algorithms and methods aiming at combating terrorism and other criminal activities affecting citizens ' safety . "
kai nothdurft , a student at the university of bremen , and a fiff member , said that indect is all about meticulously aggregating data from different sources - from websites , social networks , government databases and filming demonstrations using unmanned aerial vehicles , or uavs .
" they combine -lsb- data -rsb- with pictures they get from surveillance cameras , cctv cameras from public places and by using face recognition , " he said , adding that social networking photos can also be used as a surveillance tool .
" that 's a very dangerous thing because there 's an empowerment of all these surveillance techniques by really combining all these things . ”
lockpicking : the original hack bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german lockpicking club also had a stand at the conference while there 's a big focus on political issues at the conference , there are also fun and practical workshops like how to recover your data if your hard drive crashes , how to hack your playstation 3 console , and there 's even a stand for germany 's lockpicking club .
" if you enter a door without a key and if you open a lock without a key , it 's a hacking technique too , " said one female member of the club , who goes by the nom de hacker , snow goose .
however , she was quick to explain that the club has strict ethical ground rules .
" -lsb- we do n't teach -rsb- anybody to break into other peoples ' houses , " she said .
" always pick your own locks only ! "
similarly , for many attendees , this strong confluence of curiosity , technical inquiry , civic-mindendness and ethics is what unites all hackers .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 29.12.2010 divisions between online and physical worlds blur in 2010 großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : connections between the online and real worlds are increasing the virtual world continued to revolutionize reality in 2010 as the internet solidified its position as a platform for warfare , personal privacy and transparency .
dw examines how online events altered the real world . while military experts have been dealing with the issue of cyber-warfare for years , its public profile grew in 2010 as the united states established a " cyber command " in may and the nato alliance approved a new strategy that includes developing means of warding off cyber-attacks . " we did realize that cyber is one of the major , new issues to be dealt with , " said former us secretary of state madeline albright , who played a leading role in developing nato 's new overall strategy . stuxnet , a sophisticated computer virus designed to infect industrial control systems used in power plants , refineries and chemical production facilities , was found in september .
though its creators remain unknown , experts believe the program was written by programmers aiming to cripple iran 's uranium enrichment capabilities . the program proved nations and other groups were actively working on covert projects that would derail other countries ' industrial complex , according to stefan ritter of the german federal office for information security . " now we had proof , " he told deutsche welle .
" it was n't a fictional threat thought up by a couple of experts in a backroom anymore .
it 's a real threat that 's extremely large and extremely sophisticated . " wikileaks published classified material the whistle-blower website wikileaks , however , showed that sophisticated technology can also be harnessed to take information out of the backroom and put it in a public forum . bildunterschrift : already operational , wikileaks became well-known after releasing the afghan files the site first published some 80,000 classified documents relating to the us war in afghanistan then 400,000 files concerning the war in iraq . " the battlefield consequences of the release of these documents are potentially severe and dangerous for our troops , our allies and our afghan partners and may well damage our relationships and reputation in that key part of the world , " us defense secretary robert gates said after the afghanistan files were published . in november , wikileaks began the gradual publication of 250,000 diplomatic cables sent to washington from us embassies .
the frank assessments us officials sent to the state department brought to light the discrepancy between what world leaders sometimes say and do when it comes to international politics . wikileaks led to another online confrontation as an informal group of its proponents staged denial of service attacks on companies that removed wikileaks.org material from their servers and stopped accepting donations and discontinued financial services for the organization . google street view launches in germany personal privacy was the largest tech topic in germany in 2010 .
much media attention focused on opposition to google street view , an expansion of the us company 's map service that shows a street-level view of cities around the world . bildunterschrift : not everyone in germany was happy to have pictures of their homes appear on the internet privacy advocates accused google of infringing on individuals ' privacy and demanded a way for germans to opt out of the service before it went online , which some 200,000 people did before images of 20 german cities were made available in november . the german government also was in the spotlight after the country 's highest court overturned a 2008 law that required telecommunications companies to save phone and internet connection data for six months in case authorities required it for a criminal investigation . " saving connection information without cause evokes a diffuse and threatening feeling of being observation that impairs the unprejudiced perception of basic rights in many areas , " said hans-juergen papier , the president of the constitutional court at the time of the march verdict . proving that a change in calendar wo n't mean a change in points of view , joerg ziercke , the head of germany 's federal criminal police agency , called on lawmakers to find a way of sidestepping the court 's decision and obliging companies to store connection data . " it is important for us to be able to access this information under certain circumstances , " he said .
" that 's why we need a new law that removes the barriers in the fight against terrorism and organized crime . " authors : matthias von hein , sean sinico editor : cyrus farivar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" in fact , every year , thousands of human rights defenders are harassed , abused , unjustly detained and even murdered . " mass rape continues to be an appalling reality , torture remains widespread , extra-judicial executions , arbitrary detention and disappearances are all too prevalent in repressive societies , and national security interests and xenophobia are eroding human rights in democratic ones . some progress meanwhile , progress is slowly being made in strengthening the international laws and institutions that hold human rights violators accountable for their crimes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's difficult to judge the state of human rights however , it is getting harder to gauge whether the human rights situation is improving , according to julie de rivero , the geneva director for international non-government organization human rights watch . " what we have seen is an increase on the attacks on human rights defenders not only in places like china and iran , but also in other places where we had been a little bit hopeful about reform , such as bahrain , " she told deutsche welle . de rivero pointed to sri lanka as a place where crimes against civilians continue to be committed with impunity . " we saw the war end in sri lanka , but at a very high cost for civilians that were caught in indiscriminate fire by both sides , " she said .
" and , yet , there has been no accountability for war crimes in that country . " violence against women another worrying trend , de rivero noted , is sexual violence against women , particularly in the democratic republic of congo . " the scale of the phenomenon , i think , always compels us to focus on this particular situation because rape has been so normalized as a weapon of war in that country that it is shocking and the devastation that it causes is incredible in the lives of individuals and the community , " she said . de rivero added that the war on terror and heightened concern for national security are leading to a further erosion of human rights , even in democratic societies . making perpetrators accountable for their crimes remains a major concern for the international community , according to un high commissioner for human rights spokesman rupert collville .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rape and violence against women persist in drc " you have certain human rights violations that just continue year after year , " he said .
" you get some progress and then you get backsliding on something like torture . almost all states have laws that prohibit torture and declare it a crime , yet many states are still practicing it and many states do not prosecute those who commit it . " justice 's slow march discrimination is another major - and ongoing - concern , he said , adding that it affects women , homosexuals , people with disabilities , the elderly , minorities and indigenous peoples . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : discrimination troubles both industrialized and developing nations " it is a constant theme on every continent , including in the developed countries , where i think the treatment of migrants or foreigners has clearly deteriorated in the past decade or so , " collville said . while too many people get away with the crimes they commit , not all do and patience is needed as the wheels of justice turn slowly , collville said . " twenty or 30 years down the line , people still are being brought to court and charged with serious crimes - that perhaps is the strength of the system , " he said .
" circumstances change and people who think they are actively immune to justice sometimes find that is not actually the case in the long term .

dw examines how online events altered the real world . while military experts have been dealing with the issue of cyber-warfare for years , its public profile grew in 2010 as the united states established a " cyber command " in may and the nato alliance approved a new strategy that includes developing means of warding off cyber-attacks . " we did realize that cyber is one of the major , new issues to be dealt with , " said former us secretary of state madeline albright , who played a leading role in developing nato 's new overall strategy . stuxnet , a sophisticated computer virus designed to infect industrial control systems used in power plants , refineries and chemical production facilities , was found in september .
though its creators remain unknown , experts believe the program was written by programmers aiming to cripple iran 's uranium enrichment capabilities . the program proved nations and other groups were actively working on covert projects that would derail other countries ' industrial complex , according to stefan ritter of the german federal office for information security . " now we had proof , " he told deutsche welle .
" it was n't a fictional threat thought up by a couple of experts in a backroom anymore .
it 's a real threat that 's extremely large and extremely sophisticated . " wikileaks published classified material the whistle-blower website wikileaks , however , showed that sophisticated technology can also be harnessed to take information out of the backroom and put it in a public forum . bildunterschrift : already operational , wikileaks became well-known after releasing the afghan files the site first published some 80,000 classified documents relating to the us war in afghanistan then 400,000 files concerning the war in iraq . " the battlefield consequences of the release of these documents are potentially severe and dangerous for our troops , our allies and our afghan partners and may well damage our relationships and reputation in that key part of the world , " us defense secretary robert gates said after the afghanistan files were published . in november , wikileaks began the gradual publication of 250,000 diplomatic cables sent to washington from us embassies .
the frank assessments us officials sent to the state department brought to light the discrepancy between what world leaders sometimes say and do when it comes to international politics . wikileaks led to another online confrontation as an informal group of its proponents staged denial of service attacks on companies that removed wikileaks.org material from their servers and stopped accepting donations and discontinued financial services for the organization . google street view launches in germany personal privacy was the largest tech topic in germany in 2010 .
much media attention focused on opposition to google street view , an expansion of the us company 's map service that shows a street-level view of cities around the world . bildunterschrift : not everyone in germany was happy to have pictures of their homes appear on the internet privacy advocates accused google of infringing on individuals ' privacy and demanded a way for germans to opt out of the service before it went online , which some 200,000 people did before images of 20 german cities were made available in november . the german government also was in the spotlight after the country 's highest court overturned a 2008 law that required telecommunications companies to save phone and internet connection data for six months in case authorities required it for a criminal investigation . " saving connection information without cause evokes a diffuse and threatening feeling of being observation that impairs the unprejudiced perception of basic rights in many areas , " said hans-juergen papier , the president of the constitutional court at the time of the march verdict . proving that a change in calendar wo n't mean a change in points of view , joerg ziercke , the head of germany 's federal criminal police agency , called on lawmakers to find a way of sidestepping the court 's decision and obliging companies to store connection data . " it is important for us to be able to access this information under certain circumstances , " he said .
" that 's why we need a new law that removes the barriers in the fight against terrorism and organized crime . " authors : matthias von hein , sean sinico editor : cyrus farivar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de security -pipe- 29.12.2010 germany prepares for un security council membership großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as of january , germany will help man the security council as of january , germany will take one of the ten seats on the un security council reserved for non-permanent members .
it will focus on the afghanistan conflict and hopes to push climate change onto the council 's agenda . given the magnitude of conflicts that end up on the table of the united nations security council , germany hopes it can help defuse or even settle at least some of those conflicts when it joins the body for a two-year term in january 2011 .
" we want the council to not only deal with the fallout of a given crisis , but put more effort into conflict prevention , " said germany 's ambassador to the united nations , peter wittig .
" in other words , we want the security council to become active long before any reports about the first casualties come in . "
germany will above all be responsible for coordinating the international community 's military and development efforts in afghanistan .
it 's also likely to be in charge of the council 's al qaeda sanctions committee which oversees travel restrictions that have been imposed and the freezing of assets held by taliban supporters .
squaring the circle ?
yet the sanctions in place have proven to be an obstacle to bringing taliban leaders to the negotiating table in a bid to incorporate them in the peace process in afghanistan - and compromises will be required to get out of the dilemma .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter wittig has represented germany at the un since december 2009 but former german un ambassador guenter pleuger is confident that germany can make a difference .
" individual members of the council can be quite influential , " he told deutsche welle .
" you just need to present good arguments and a good course of action . "
new strategic alliances germany is also poised to use its tenure to convince others of treating climate change as a potential security issue .
what it has in mind is the expected impact of global warming on available resources and the fate of many small island states threatened by rising sea levels .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sao tome and principe is one of the island states threatened with disappearance " if germany wants to make headway , it has to focus more on talks with individual countries , including rapidly industrializing nations , " susanne droege from the german institute for international and security affairs told deutsche welle .
" it can not count on the backing of the united states in this field .
it 'll be like walking the tightrope – seeking support from countries in africa and asia without alienating itself from its traditional allies in the west . "
germany was once before a non-permanent member of the security council between 2003 and 2004 when it was among those refusing to give their backing for the us-led invasion of iraq .
that earned it a good deal of harsh criticism from the us administration – and admiration from others .
the iraq war was unleashed nonetheless , mercilessly highlighting the limited powers of the united nations ' most important body .
the security council also failed to prevent the genocide in rwanda , the civil war in somalia and the political chaos in the democratic republic of congo .
higher ambitions germany 's renewed membership is seen as an important milestone in berlin .
but plans to become a permanent member of the council will also be pursued , along with a general overhaul of the body to reflect modern-day realities . brazil , india , south africa and japan have also been struggling to join the body on a permanent basis to give their regions a greater say in world affairs . it is widely felt that the current composition of the security council made up of the united states , russia , britain , france and china reflects an outdated post-world war ii scenario . author : hardy graupner editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

dw examines how online events altered the real world . while military experts have been dealing with the issue of cyber-warfare for years , its public profile grew in 2010 as the united states established a " cyber command " in may and the nato alliance approved a new strategy that includes developing means of warding off cyber-attacks . " we did realize that cyber is one of the major , new issues to be dealt with , " said former us secretary of state madeline albright , who played a leading role in developing nato 's new overall strategy . stuxnet , a sophisticated computer virus designed to infect industrial control systems used in power plants , refineries and chemical production facilities , was found in september .
though its creators remain unknown , experts believe the program was written by programmers aiming to cripple iran 's uranium enrichment capabilities . the program proved nations and other groups were actively working on covert projects that would derail other countries ' industrial complex , according to stefan ritter of the german federal office for information security . " now we had proof , " he told deutsche welle .
" it was n't a fictional threat thought up by a couple of experts in a backroom anymore .
it 's a real threat that 's extremely large and extremely sophisticated . " wikileaks published classified material the whistle-blower website wikileaks , however , showed that sophisticated technology can also be harnessed to take information out of the backroom and put it in a public forum . bildunterschrift : already operational , wikileaks became well-known after releasing the afghan files the site first published some 80,000 classified documents relating to the us war in afghanistan then 400,000 files concerning the war in iraq . " the battlefield consequences of the release of these documents are potentially severe and dangerous for our troops , our allies and our afghan partners and may well damage our relationships and reputation in that key part of the world , " us defense secretary robert gates said after the afghanistan files were published . in november , wikileaks began the gradual publication of 250,000 diplomatic cables sent to washington from us embassies .
the frank assessments us officials sent to the state department brought to light the discrepancy between what world leaders sometimes say and do when it comes to international politics . wikileaks led to another online confrontation as an informal group of its proponents staged denial of service attacks on companies that removed wikileaks.org material from their servers and stopped accepting donations and discontinued financial services for the organization . google street view launches in germany personal privacy was the largest tech topic in germany in 2010 .
much media attention focused on opposition to google street view , an expansion of the us company 's map service that shows a street-level view of cities around the world . bildunterschrift : not everyone in germany was happy to have pictures of their homes appear on the internet privacy advocates accused google of infringing on individuals ' privacy and demanded a way for germans to opt out of the service before it went online , which some 200,000 people did before images of 20 german cities were made available in november . the german government also was in the spotlight after the country 's highest court overturned a 2008 law that required telecommunications companies to save phone and internet connection data for six months in case authorities required it for a criminal investigation . " saving connection information without cause evokes a diffuse and threatening feeling of being observation that impairs the unprejudiced perception of basic rights in many areas , " said hans-juergen papier , the president of the constitutional court at the time of the march verdict . proving that a change in calendar wo n't mean a change in points of view , joerg ziercke , the head of germany 's federal criminal police agency , called on lawmakers to find a way of sidestepping the court 's decision and obliging companies to store connection data . " it is important for us to be able to access this information under certain circumstances , " he said .
" that 's why we need a new law that removes the barriers in the fight against terrorism and organized crime . " authors : matthias von hein , sean sinico editor : cyrus farivar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de security -pipe- 29.12.2010 international hackers convene in berlin großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the chaos communication congress opened monday the 27th annual chaos communication congress is currently underway in germany .
these hackers say society should be worried about personal data collected by governments about us . on monday , two berlin mobile security researchers outlined what they 've dubbed the " sms of death " attack , which they claim could potentially could affect significant portions of mobile phones worldwide , the overwhelming majority of which are non-smartphones , like an iphone or android .
by flooding these mobiles with hundreds of thousands of malicious texts , they were able to discover bugs within the phones text-message reading software , that in some cases would force the phone to get stuck in a reboot loop .
and that was just day one of the 27th annual chaos communication congress , the annual gathering of the chaos computer club , currently going on this week in the german capital .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new attack could affect millions of mobile phones the two german researchers , collin mulliner and nico golde , from the technical university of berlin , claimed that their attack potentially could affect older-generation mobile phones made by sony ericsson , samsung , motorola , micromax and lg .
mulliner theorized that a large scale such attack might be overwhelming to a mobile network by inducing " ten thousand mobiles to try to reconnect simultaneously . "
amongst the 3,000 attendees , there 's a majority of very pale , sometimes chubby men , with laptops under their arms who look like they have n't seen a lot of sunlight , there are also students , a few hipsters and women in attendance .
during the conference , which concludes on thursday , participants take part in lectures and workshops on political and technical topics - from censorship , data surveillance and copyright , to voip security and hacking smart phones .
attendees can even buy sim cards to use a special , experimental mobile phone network set up solely for this conference .
wikileaks first debuted at the 2007 ccc congress the chaos computer club , or ccc , was founded in berlin in 1981 and is one of the world 's oldest self-desecribed hacker clubs .
since that time , the ccc has become known for consistently exposing security flaws and challenged the trend of heightened data surveillance since the september 11 , 2001 attacks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in 2008 , the ccc published the fingerprints of germany 's interior minister to protest the authorities ' increasing use of biometric data , in march 2008 , the ccc acquired the german interior minister 's fingerprints , which they took from a water glass the politician used at a public speaking event .
they took that imprint and published them as a way to protest the increased use of biometric data in germany and to highlight the insecure nature of such data .
three years ago , at the 2007 congress , wikileaks founder julian assange presented an early sketch of the now-contraversial website .
there , he met ccc member , daniel domscheit-berg , -lrb- then known by his alias , daniel schmitt -rrb- , who until a few months ago was considered assange 's number two at wikileaks .
while the two groups are not formally affiliated , frank rosengart , a chaos computer club spokesperson , said that his organization supports wikileaks because both groups have similar goals , especially around the issues of more transparency in government , or what rosengart calls " machine-readable government . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wikileaks founder julian assange presented his website to the ccc in 2007 " wikileaks , for us , it 's the right way to do it , to publish information , " said rosengart .
" keeping the privacy and keeping the sources anonymous - that 's a very important part of software and this can be considered a good hack to set up such a system that works in this way . "
rosengart said that first and foremost the congress is a meeting place for technical collaboration to take place - as was the case with wikileaks .
" there are a lot of projects like open-source programming projects and some people they meet here for the first time in real life , " he said .
" so they know them online , they work together , they do software together , but they meet here for the first time . "
data retention policies on the rise this week at the ccc congress are a number of talks at the congress about data retention , which has increased dramatically in the last nine years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in december 2007 , assange met daniel domscheit-berg , who until recently was wikileaks ' number two in an attempt to prevent further terrorist attacks , many governments , including the united states and germany , have increased the amount and type of data they keep on each citizen .
one of the groups participating this year is ak vorrat - the working group on data retention - that lead a campaign protesting against the introduction of a data retention law in germany in 2008 .
the group 's efforts were successful and in march 2010 the law was declarecd unconstitutional by the german constitutional court .
however , this year , ak vorrat has focused its attention on the 2011 census .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many club members are worried about what types of data should be collected by governments " there is some data that should not be collected , " said michael ebeling , an ak vorrat spokesperson , who said the group is particularly concerned about certain lines of questioning in the german census .
" if you are not coming from germany , they are asking you where are you coming from , where are your father , your mother coming from ? " he said . " what kind of religion do you believe in ? if you are islamic believer then they ask very precisely , are you sunni or shiite .
and we ask why do they ask these things ? "
he added that for christians , there are no follow up questions about a person 's particular denomination , and noted that people who do n't fill out the forms correctly could face further questioning and or a hefty fine .
ak vorrat is also concerned because the data people put on the census forms will not be made anonymous for four to six years , and given the sensitive nature of much of this personal data , they fear that it could be misused by politicians - in the name of fighting terrorism .
increasing surveillance across the european union bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chaos computer club members are also concerned about the use of such data around europe but this year 's attendees are not just concerned about surveillance measures within germany .
the forum of computer scientists for peace and social responsibility association -lrb- fiff -rrb- , is a german non-profit organization focusing mainly on privacy and security issues , as well as the use of technology in weapons , robots and cyber-warfare .
on wednesday , fiff members gave a presentation about a european research project called indect that develops surveillance techniques for the authorities .
indect was initiated by the polish platform for homeland security , and according to its website , aims to " develop new , advanced and innovative algorithms and methods aiming at combating terrorism and other criminal activities affecting citizens ' safety . "
kai nothdurft , a student at the university of bremen , and a fiff member , said that indect is all about meticulously aggregating data from different sources - from websites , social networks , government databases and filming demonstrations using unmanned aerial vehicles , or uavs .
" they combine -lsb- data -rsb- with pictures they get from surveillance cameras , cctv cameras from public places and by using face recognition , " he said , adding that social networking photos can also be used as a surveillance tool .
" that 's a very dangerous thing because there 's an empowerment of all these surveillance techniques by really combining all these things . ”
lockpicking : the original hack bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german lockpicking club also had a stand at the conference while there 's a big focus on political issues at the conference , there are also fun and practical workshops like how to recover your data if your hard drive crashes , how to hack your playstation 3 console , and there 's even a stand for germany 's lockpicking club .
" if you enter a door without a key and if you open a lock without a key , it 's a hacking technique too , " said one female member of the club , who goes by the nom de hacker , snow goose .
however , she was quick to explain that the club has strict ethical ground rules .
" -lsb- we do n't teach -rsb- anybody to break into other peoples ' houses , " she said .
" always pick your own locks only ! "
similarly , for many attendees , this strong confluence of curiosity , technical inquiry , civic-mindendness and ethics is what unites all hackers .
" for me its more a lifestyle , " said frank rosengart , the ccc spokesperson .
" hacking is asking more questions , trying to understand , using electronic devices in a different way than the manual proposes .
i think we need to go out to the world with this kind of lifestyle and trying to make a better world . "

amongst the 3,000 attendees , there 's a majority of very pale , sometimes chubby men , with laptops under their arms who look like they have n't seen a lot of sunlight , there are also students , a few hipsters and women in attendance .

attendees can even buy sim cards to use a special , experimental mobile phone network set up solely for this conference .
wikileaks first debuted at the 2007 ccc congress the chaos computer club , or ccc , was founded in berlin in 1981 and is one of the world 's oldest self-desecribed hacker clubs .
since that time , the ccc has become known for consistently exposing security flaws and challenged the trend of heightened data surveillance since the september 11 , 2001 attacks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in 2008 , the ccc published the fingerprints of germany 's interior minister to protest the authorities ' increasing use of biometric data , in march 2008 , the ccc acquired the german interior minister 's fingerprints , which they took from a water glass the politician used at a public speaking event .
they took that imprint and published them as a way to protest the increased use of biometric data in germany and to highlight the insecure nature of such data .
three years ago , at the 2007 congress , wikileaks founder julian assange presented an early sketch of the now-contraversial website .
there , he met ccc member , daniel domscheit-berg , -lrb- then known by his alias , daniel schmitt -rrb- , who until a few months ago was considered assange 's number two at wikileaks .
while the two groups are not formally affiliated , frank rosengart , a chaos computer club spokesperson , said that his organization supports wikileaks because both groups have similar goals , especially around the issues of more transparency in government , or what rosengart calls " machine-readable government . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wikileaks founder julian assange presented his website to the ccc in 2007 " wikileaks , for us , it 's the right way to do it , to publish information , " said rosengart .
" keeping the privacy and keeping the sources anonymous - that 's a very important part of software and this can be considered a good hack to set up such a system that works in this way . "
rosengart said that first and foremost the congress is a meeting place for technical collaboration to take place - as was the case with wikileaks .
" there are a lot of projects like open-source programming projects and some people they meet here for the first time in real life , " he said .
" so they know them online , they work together , they do software together , but they meet here for the first time . "
data retention policies on the rise this week at the ccc congress are a number of talks at the congress about data retention , which has increased dramatically in the last nine years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in december 2007 , assange met daniel domscheit-berg , who until recently was wikileaks ' number two in an attempt to prevent further terrorist attacks , many governments , including the united states and germany , have increased the amount and type of data they keep on each citizen .
one of the groups participating this year is ak vorrat - the working group on data retention - that lead a campaign protesting against the introduction of a data retention law in germany in 2008 .
the group 's efforts were successful and in march 2010 the law was declarecd unconstitutional by the german constitutional court .
however , this year , ak vorrat has focused its attention on the 2011 census .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many club members are worried about what types of data should be collected by governments " there is some data that should not be collected , " said michael ebeling , an ak vorrat spokesperson , who said the group is particularly concerned about certain lines of questioning in the german census .
" if you are not coming from germany , they are asking you where are you coming from , where are your father , your mother coming from ? " he said . " what kind of religion do you believe in ? if you are islamic believer then they ask very precisely , are you sunni or shiite .
and we ask why do they ask these things ? "
he added that for christians , there are no follow up questions about a person 's particular denomination , and noted that people who do n't fill out the forms correctly could face further questioning and or a hefty fine .
ak vorrat is also concerned because the data people put on the census forms will not be made anonymous for four to six years , and given the sensitive nature of much of this personal data , they fear that it could be misused by politicians - in the name of fighting terrorism .
increasing surveillance across the european union bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chaos computer club members are also concerned about the use of such data around europe but this year 's attendees are not just concerned about surveillance measures within germany .
the forum of computer scientists for peace and social responsibility association -lrb- fiff -rrb- , is a german non-profit organization focusing mainly on privacy and security issues , as well as the use of technology in weapons , robots and cyber-warfare .
on wednesday , fiff members gave a presentation about a european research project called indect that develops surveillance techniques for the authorities .
indect was initiated by the polish platform for homeland security , and according to its website , aims to " develop new , advanced and innovative algorithms and methods aiming at combating terrorism and other criminal activities affecting citizens ' safety . "
kai nothdurft , a student at the university of bremen , and a fiff member , said that indect is all about meticulously aggregating data from different sources - from websites , social networks , government databases and filming demonstrations using unmanned aerial vehicles , or uavs .
" they combine -lsb- data -rsb- with pictures they get from surveillance cameras , cctv cameras from public places and by using face recognition , " he said , adding that social networking photos can also be used as a surveillance tool .
" that 's a very dangerous thing because there 's an empowerment of all these surveillance techniques by really combining all these things . ”
lockpicking : the original hack bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german lockpicking club also had a stand at the conference while there 's a big focus on political issues at the conference , there are also fun and practical workshops like how to recover your data if your hard drive crashes , how to hack your playstation 3 console , and there 's even a stand for germany 's lockpicking club .
" if you enter a door without a key and if you open a lock without a key , it 's a hacking technique too , " said one female member of the club , who goes by the nom de hacker , snow goose .
however , she was quick to explain that the club has strict ethical ground rules .
" -lsb- we do n't teach -rsb- anybody to break into other peoples ' houses , " she said .
" always pick your own locks only ! "
similarly , for many attendees , this strong confluence of curiosity , technical inquiry , civic-mindendness and ethics is what unites all hackers .
" for me its more a lifestyle , " said frank rosengart , the ccc spokesperson .
" hacking is asking more questions , trying to understand , using electronic devices in a different way than the manual proposes .
i think we need to go out to the world with this kind of lifestyle and trying to make a better world . "

these hackers say society should be worried about personal data collected by governments about us . on monday , two berlin mobile security researchers outlined what they 've dubbed the " sms of death " attack , which they claim could potentially could affect significant portions of mobile phones worldwide , the overwhelming majority of which are non-smartphones , like an iphone or android .
by flooding these mobiles with hundreds of thousands of malicious texts , they were able to discover bugs within the phones text-message reading software , that in some cases would force the phone to get stuck in a reboot loop .
and that was just day one of the 27th annual chaos communication congress , the annual gathering of the chaos computer club , currently going on this week in the german capital .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de aviation -pipe- 29.12.2010 german airport boss sparks debate about passenger profiling großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : passenger profiling would be partly based on ethnicity the future president of the german airport association has called for checks based on age , sex and ethnicity for " high-risk passengers . "
but the german justice minister has flatly rejected the idea . the ceo of dusseldorf airport , christoph blume , said he wanted to introduce passenger profiling in german airports to fight terrorism .
the system would be similar to that used in israel , where passengers are categorized as high or low risk according to their age , sex , ethnic background and other criteria . " in this way , the security systems can be more effectively used to benefit all those involved , " blume , who will become president of the german airport association -lrb- adv -rrb- in january , told the german newspaper rheinische post on tuesday .
high-risk passengers - those deemed more likely to carry out terrorist or illegal activity , such as organized crime , drug trafficking or espionage - would undergo more stringent security checks .
this could mean anything from a bag search to a full body search .
blume is n't alone in calling for more targeted checks .
current procedures are n't working according to joerg handwerg , a pilot for lufthansa and spokesperson for the pilot 's association cockpit .
" the current controls are foolish , because we waste resources by doing things that feign security but do n't actually bring security , " handwerg told deutsche welle .
a matter of common sense ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the threat of terrorism has led to heightened security at airports handwerg suggested that a point system could be employed to determine which passengers might pose a higher security risk , also taking note of where passengers were coming from and travelling to .
he said profiling could involve analyzing passenger behavior .
" the israelis already very successfully do psychological profiling based on asking people where they are going and paying attention to psychological reactions , like if the people become nervous , " he said .
" in these conversations you can assess whether a passenger should be checked more closely , or if they are unsuspicious . "
handwerg said profiling was a matter of common sense , rejecting the notion that it could be discriminatory .
" is it justified to check an 80-year-old woman just as intensively as an 18-year-old male passenger ? " he asked .
" there are differences .
that 's got nothing to do with discrimination ; it 's just common sense . "
climate of suspicion but in germany , where data protection is highly prized , opposition to collecting personal information about passengers would be a sticking point to introducing profiling .
critics , such as martin kutscha , a professor of constitutional law at the berlin school of economics and law , say that the dangers of profiling are too high a price to pay for greater security .
" obviously safety is a valuable commodity , but our society will never be 100 percent safe , " kutscha told deutsche welle .
" you will never catch someone who blows himself up at a market place with this kind of profiling .
safety is important , but not to the extent that you hold everybody under extreme suspicion . "
kutscha said profiling would also be legally problematic , especially since germany 's constitution does not allow ethnic discrimination .
he also worried that a climate of suspicion could be damaging for german society , especially with regard to its immigrant population .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : justice minister leutheusser-schnarrenberger has rejected the proposal " -lsb- profiling -rsb- would feed the fears that exist in society .
it 's obviously very damaging for a country that depends on immigration , like germany , " kutscha said .
in comments made to the frankfurter rundschau newspaper on wednesday , german justice minister sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger flatly rejected blume 's proposal , warning of the danger of " stigmatizing passengers , if one differentiates between them according to their origin and religion . "
she added that she believed passenger profiling would contravene german and european anti-discrimination legislation . the federal commissioner for data protection , peter schaar , also dismissed the suggestion , calling it unreasonable and unsupported in any legal sense .
" such a procedure would amount to a permanent dragnet , " he told the rheinische post newspaper .

in comments made to the frankfurter rundschau newspaper on wednesday , german justice minister sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger flatly rejected blume 's proposal , warning of the danger of " stigmatizing passengers , if one differentiates between them according to their origin and religion . "
she added that she believed passenger profiling would contravene german and european anti-discrimination legislation . the federal commissioner for data protection , peter schaar , also dismissed the suggestion , calling it unreasonable and unsupported in any legal sense .
" such a procedure would amount to a permanent dragnet , " he told the rheinische post newspaper .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de aviation -pipe- 29.12.2010 german airport boss sparks debate about passenger profiling großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : passenger profiling would be partly based on ethnicity the future president of the german airport association has called for checks based on age , sex and ethnicity for " high-risk passengers . "
but the german justice minister has flatly rejected the idea . the ceo of dusseldorf airport , christoph blume , said he wanted to introduce passenger profiling in german airports to fight terrorism .
the system would be similar to that used in israel , where passengers are categorized as high or low risk according to their age , sex , ethnic background and other criteria . " in this way , the security systems can be more effectively used to benefit all those involved , " blume , who will become president of the german airport association -lrb- adv -rrb- in january , told the german newspaper rheinische post on tuesday .
high-risk passengers - those deemed more likely to carry out terrorist or illegal activity , such as organized crime , drug trafficking or espionage - would undergo more stringent security checks .
this could mean anything from a bag search to a full body search .
blume is n't alone in calling for more targeted checks .
current procedures are n't working according to joerg handwerg , a pilot for lufthansa and spokesperson for the pilot 's association cockpit .
" the current controls are foolish , because we waste resources by doing things that feign security but do n't actually bring security , " handwerg told deutsche welle .
a matter of common sense ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the threat of terrorism has led to heightened security at airports handwerg suggested that a point system could be employed to determine which passengers might pose a higher security risk , also taking note of where passengers were coming from and travelling to .
he said profiling could involve analyzing passenger behavior .
" the israelis already very successfully do psychological profiling based on asking people where they are going and paying attention to psychological reactions , like if the people become nervous , " he said .
" in these conversations you can assess whether a passenger should be checked more closely , or if they are unsuspicious . "
handwerg said profiling was a matter of common sense , rejecting the notion that it could be discriminatory .
" is it justified to check an 80-year-old woman just as intensively as an 18-year-old male passenger ? " he asked .
" there are differences .
that 's got nothing to do with discrimination ; it 's just common sense . "
climate of suspicion but in germany , where data protection is highly prized , opposition to collecting personal information about passengers would be a sticking point to introducing profiling .
critics , such as martin kutscha , a professor of constitutional law at the berlin school of economics and law , say that the dangers of profiling are too high a price to pay for greater security .
" obviously safety is a valuable commodity , but our society will never be 100 percent safe , " kutscha told deutsche welle .
" you will never catch someone who blows himself up at a market place with this kind of profiling .
safety is important , but not to the extent that you hold everybody under extreme suspicion . "
kutscha said profiling would also be legally problematic , especially since germany 's constitution does not allow ethnic discrimination .
he also worried that a climate of suspicion could be damaging for german society , especially with regard to its immigrant population .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : justice minister leutheusser-schnarrenberger has rejected the proposal " -lsb- profiling -rsb- would feed the fears that exist in society .
it 's obviously very damaging for a country that depends on immigration , like germany , " kutscha said .

former prime minister tymoshenko and several members of her cabinet are already under investigation . opposition leaders in ukraine have accused the authorities of running a campaign of repression against the main opposition leader , former prime minister yulia tymoshenko , and her allies .
president viktor yanukovych has dismissed the claims as groundless .
yet a total of 12 members of the country 's opposition are under criminal investigation , six of them are set to ring in the new year in prison .
the latest prominent opposition figure be arrested was yuri lutsenko , a former interior minister in tymoshenko 's cabinet .
lutsenko was walking his dog when the security service arrested him on sunday .
" these are not the last arrests we are going to see this christmas and new year 's season , " mykola tomenko , deputy speaker of parliament , said on tuesday . " people could be going to jail all the way through epiphany . "
vasyl onopenko , head of the country 's supreme court on tuesday called on officials to respect the rights of detainees .
" the presumption of innocence must be respected , " he told a news conference .
" this is a constitutional principle .
but in our country , there are n't even formal charges , and still a person is immediately declared a criminal . "
running the country " like mafia " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tymoshenko was swept to power during the 2004 orange revolution apart from lutsenko , the former environment and economy ministers and a former deputy justice minister have also been arrested .
yulia tymoshenko herself has been charged with abuse of office .
she is accused of having spent money destined for environmental issues on paying pensions .
for the time being , she has not been detained , although she is not allowed to leave the capital kyiv and must be available for questioning .
before being questioned in the public prosecutor 's office last week , yulia tymoshenko accused the government of president viktor yanukovych of running the country " like a real mafia , " and that repressions against the opposition were aimed at ensuring that the opposition was in prison when the next elections are due .
" i would like to say to viktor yanukovych that , if he must carry out repressions , to do it in such a way that the people will not start laughing , when he puts the former prime minister behind bars for paying pensions , " she said .
yanukovich , however , denies all allegations .
during a recent television interview , he stressed that the president does not have the power to exert influence on the courts and that , besides , tymoshenko had all means at her disposal to defend herself .
opinion polls show that many people appear to have grown weary of politics .

he said this might mean deutsche bahn would have to put the brakes on its expansion aims , including plans for an intercity express to london from 2013 .
transportation spokesman uwe beckmeyer from the opposition social democrats called on the government to not to weaken support for deutsche bahn , which has struggled to maintain effective and regular services during particularly icy or snowy periods this winter .
" the company needs every cent to invest in better equipment , " he told tagesspiegel .
according to the tagesspiegel , deutsche bahn came to the conclusion in october that it did not own enough trains to ensure regular services during " extraordinary circumstances . "

"
but the german justice minister has flatly rejected the idea . the ceo of dusseldorf airport , christoph blume , said he wanted to introduce passenger profiling in german airports to fight terrorism .
the system would be similar to that used in israel , where passengers are categorized as high or low risk according to their age , sex , ethnic background and other criteria . " in this way , the security systems can be more effectively used to benefit all those involved , " blume , who will become president of the german airport association -lrb- adv -rrb- in january , told the german newspaper rheinische post on tuesday .
high-risk passengers - those deemed more likely to carry out terrorist or illegal activity , such as organized crime , drug trafficking or espionage - would undergo more stringent security checks .
this could mean anything from a bag search to a full body search .
blume is n't alone in calling for more targeted checks .
current procedures are n't working according to joerg handwerg , a pilot for lufthansa and spokesperson for the pilot 's association cockpit .
" the current controls are foolish , because we waste resources by doing things that feign security but do n't actually bring security , " handwerg told deutsche welle .
a matter of common sense ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the threat of terrorism has led to heightened security at airports handwerg suggested that a point system could be employed to determine which passengers might pose a higher security risk , also taking note of where passengers were coming from and travelling to .
he said profiling could involve analyzing passenger behavior .
" the israelis already very successfully do psychological profiling based on asking people where they are going and paying attention to psychological reactions , like if the people become nervous , " he said .
" in these conversations you can assess whether a passenger should be checked more closely , or if they are unsuspicious . "
handwerg said profiling was a matter of common sense , rejecting the notion that it could be discriminatory .
" is it justified to check an 80-year-old woman just as intensively as an 18-year-old male passenger ? " he asked .
" there are differences .
that 's got nothing to do with discrimination ; it 's just common sense . "
climate of suspicion but in germany , where data protection is highly prized , opposition to collecting personal information about passengers would be a sticking point to introducing profiling .
critics , such as martin kutscha , a professor of constitutional law at the berlin school of economics and law , say that the dangers of profiling are too high a price to pay for greater security .
" obviously safety is a valuable commodity , but our society will never be 100 percent safe , " kutscha told deutsche welle .
" you will never catch someone who blows himself up at a market place with this kind of profiling .
safety is important , but not to the extent that you hold everybody under extreme suspicion . "
kutscha said profiling would also be legally problematic , especially since germany 's constitution does not allow ethnic discrimination .
he also worried that a climate of suspicion could be damaging for german society , especially with regard to its immigrant population .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : justice minister leutheusser-schnarrenberger has rejected the proposal " -lsb- profiling -rsb- would feed the fears that exist in society .
it 's obviously very damaging for a country that depends on immigration , like germany , " kutscha said .
in comments made to the frankfurter rundschau newspaper on wednesday , german justice minister sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger flatly rejected blume 's proposal , warning of the danger of " stigmatizing passengers , if one differentiates between them according to their origin and religion . "
she added that she believed passenger profiling would contravene german and european anti-discrimination legislation . the federal commissioner for data protection , peter schaar , also dismissed the suggestion , calling it unreasonable and unsupported in any legal sense .
" such a procedure would amount to a permanent dragnet , " he told the rheinische post newspaper .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 29.12.2010 divisions between online and physical worlds blur in 2010 großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : connections between the online and real worlds are increasing the virtual world continued to revolutionize reality in 2010 as the internet solidified its position as a platform for warfare , personal privacy and transparency .
dw examines how online events altered the real world . while military experts have been dealing with the issue of cyber-warfare for years , its public profile grew in 2010 as the united states established a " cyber command " in may and the nato alliance approved a new strategy that includes developing means of warding off cyber-attacks . " we did realize that cyber is one of the major , new issues to be dealt with , " said former us secretary of state madeline albright , who played a leading role in developing nato 's new overall strategy . stuxnet , a sophisticated computer virus designed to infect industrial control systems used in power plants , refineries and chemical production facilities , was found in september .
though its creators remain unknown , experts believe the program was written by programmers aiming to cripple iran 's uranium enrichment capabilities . the program proved nations and other groups were actively working on covert projects that would derail other countries ' industrial complex , according to stefan ritter of the german federal office for information security . " now we had proof , " he told deutsche welle .
" it was n't a fictional threat thought up by a couple of experts in a backroom anymore .
it 's a real threat that 's extremely large and extremely sophisticated . " wikileaks published classified material the whistle-blower website wikileaks , however , showed that sophisticated technology can also be harnessed to take information out of the backroom and put it in a public forum . bildunterschrift : already operational , wikileaks became well-known after releasing the afghan files the site first published some 80,000 classified documents relating to the us war in afghanistan then 400,000 files concerning the war in iraq . " the battlefield consequences of the release of these documents are potentially severe and dangerous for our troops , our allies and our afghan partners and may well damage our relationships and reputation in that key part of the world , " us defense secretary robert gates said after the afghanistan files were published . in november , wikileaks began the gradual publication of 250,000 diplomatic cables sent to washington from us embassies .
the frank assessments us officials sent to the state department brought to light the discrepancy between what world leaders sometimes say and do when it comes to international politics . wikileaks led to another online confrontation as an informal group of its proponents staged denial of service attacks on companies that removed wikileaks.org material from their servers and stopped accepting donations and discontinued financial services for the organization . google street view launches in germany personal privacy was the largest tech topic in germany in 2010 .
much media attention focused on opposition to google street view , an expansion of the us company 's map service that shows a street-level view of cities around the world . bildunterschrift : not everyone in germany was happy to have pictures of their homes appear on the internet privacy advocates accused google of infringing on individuals ' privacy and demanded a way for germans to opt out of the service before it went online , which some 200,000 people did before images of 20 german cities were made available in november . the german government also was in the spotlight after the country 's highest court overturned a 2008 law that required telecommunications companies to save phone and internet connection data for six months in case authorities required it for a criminal investigation . " saving connection information without cause evokes a diffuse and threatening feeling of being observation that impairs the unprejudiced perception of basic rights in many areas , " said hans-juergen papier , the president of the constitutional court at the time of the march verdict . proving that a change in calendar wo n't mean a change in points of view , joerg ziercke , the head of germany 's federal criminal police agency , called on lawmakers to find a way of sidestepping the court 's decision and obliging companies to store connection data . " it is important for us to be able to access this information under certain circumstances , " he said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de security -pipe- 29.12.2010 international hackers convene in berlin großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the chaos communication congress opened monday the 27th annual chaos communication congress is currently underway in germany .
these hackers say society should be worried about personal data collected by governments about us . on monday , two berlin mobile security researchers outlined what they 've dubbed the " sms of death " attack , which they claim could potentially could affect significant portions of mobile phones worldwide , the overwhelming majority of which are non-smartphones , like an iphone or android .
by flooding these mobiles with hundreds of thousands of malicious texts , they were able to discover bugs within the phones text-message reading software , that in some cases would force the phone to get stuck in a reboot loop .
and that was just day one of the 27th annual chaos communication congress , the annual gathering of the chaos computer club , currently going on this week in the german capital .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new attack could affect millions of mobile phones the two german researchers , collin mulliner and nico golde , from the technical university of berlin , claimed that their attack potentially could affect older-generation mobile phones made by sony ericsson , samsung , motorola , micromax and lg .
mulliner theorized that a large scale such attack might be overwhelming to a mobile network by inducing " ten thousand mobiles to try to reconnect simultaneously . "
amongst the 3,000 attendees , there 's a majority of very pale , sometimes chubby men , with laptops under their arms who look like they have n't seen a lot of sunlight , there are also students , a few hipsters and women in attendance .
during the conference , which concludes on thursday , participants take part in lectures and workshops on political and technical topics - from censorship , data surveillance and copyright , to voip security and hacking smart phones .
attendees can even buy sim cards to use a special , experimental mobile phone network set up solely for this conference .
wikileaks first debuted at the 2007 ccc congress the chaos computer club , or ccc , was founded in berlin in 1981 and is one of the world 's oldest self-desecribed hacker clubs .
since that time , the ccc has become known for consistently exposing security flaws and challenged the trend of heightened data surveillance since the september 11 , 2001 attacks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in 2008 , the ccc published the fingerprints of germany 's interior minister to protest the authorities ' increasing use of biometric data , in march 2008 , the ccc acquired the german interior minister 's fingerprints , which they took from a water glass the politician used at a public speaking event .
they took that imprint and published them as a way to protest the increased use of biometric data in germany and to highlight the insecure nature of such data .
three years ago , at the 2007 congress , wikileaks founder julian assange presented an early sketch of the now-contraversial website .
there , he met ccc member , daniel domscheit-berg , -lrb- then known by his alias , daniel schmitt -rrb- , who until a few months ago was considered assange 's number two at wikileaks .
while the two groups are not formally affiliated , frank rosengart , a chaos computer club spokesperson , said that his organization supports wikileaks because both groups have similar goals , especially around the issues of more transparency in government , or what rosengart calls " machine-readable government . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wikileaks founder julian assange presented his website to the ccc in 2007 " wikileaks , for us , it 's the right way to do it , to publish information , " said rosengart .
" keeping the privacy and keeping the sources anonymous - that 's a very important part of software and this can be considered a good hack to set up such a system that works in this way . "
rosengart said that first and foremost the congress is a meeting place for technical collaboration to take place - as was the case with wikileaks .
" there are a lot of projects like open-source programming projects and some people they meet here for the first time in real life , " he said .
" so they know them online , they work together , they do software together , but they meet here for the first time . "
data retention policies on the rise this week at the ccc congress are a number of talks at the congress about data retention , which has increased dramatically in the last nine years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in december 2007 , assange met daniel domscheit-berg , who until recently was wikileaks ' number two in an attempt to prevent further terrorist attacks , many governments , including the united states and germany , have increased the amount and type of data they keep on each citizen .
one of the groups participating this year is ak vorrat - the working group on data retention - that lead a campaign protesting against the introduction of a data retention law in germany in 2008 .
the group 's efforts were successful and in march 2010 the law was declarecd unconstitutional by the german constitutional court .
however , this year , ak vorrat has focused its attention on the 2011 census .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many club members are worried about what types of data should be collected by governments " there is some data that should not be collected , " said michael ebeling , an ak vorrat spokesperson , who said the group is particularly concerned about certain lines of questioning in the german census .
" if you are not coming from germany , they are asking you where are you coming from , where are your father , your mother coming from ? " he said . " what kind of religion do you believe in ? if you are islamic believer then they ask very precisely , are you sunni or shiite .
and we ask why do they ask these things ? "
he added that for christians , there are no follow up questions about a person 's particular denomination , and noted that people who do n't fill out the forms correctly could face further questioning and or a hefty fine .
ak vorrat is also concerned because the data people put on the census forms will not be made anonymous for four to six years , and given the sensitive nature of much of this personal data , they fear that it could be misused by politicians - in the name of fighting terrorism .
increasing surveillance across the european union bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chaos computer club members are also concerned about the use of such data around europe but this year 's attendees are not just concerned about surveillance measures within germany .
the forum of computer scientists for peace and social responsibility association -lrb- fiff -rrb- , is a german non-profit organization focusing mainly on privacy and security issues , as well as the use of technology in weapons , robots and cyber-warfare .
on wednesday , fiff members gave a presentation about a european research project called indect that develops surveillance techniques for the authorities .
indect was initiated by the polish platform for homeland security , and according to its website , aims to " develop new , advanced and innovative algorithms and methods aiming at combating terrorism and other criminal activities affecting citizens ' safety . "
kai nothdurft , a student at the university of bremen , and a fiff member , said that indect is all about meticulously aggregating data from different sources - from websites , social networks , government databases and filming demonstrations using unmanned aerial vehicles , or uavs .
" they combine -lsb- data -rsb- with pictures they get from surveillance cameras , cctv cameras from public places and by using face recognition , " he said , adding that social networking photos can also be used as a surveillance tool .
" that 's a very dangerous thing because there 's an empowerment of all these surveillance techniques by really combining all these things . ”
lockpicking : the original hack bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german lockpicking club also had a stand at the conference while there 's a big focus on political issues at the conference , there are also fun and practical workshops like how to recover your data if your hard drive crashes , how to hack your playstation 3 console , and there 's even a stand for germany 's lockpicking club .
" if you enter a door without a key and if you open a lock without a key , it 's a hacking technique too , " said one female member of the club , who goes by the nom de hacker , snow goose .
however , she was quick to explain that the club has strict ethical ground rules .
" -lsb- we do n't teach -rsb- anybody to break into other peoples ' houses , " she said .
" always pick your own locks only ! "
similarly , for many attendees , this strong confluence of curiosity , technical inquiry , civic-mindendness and ethics is what unites all hackers .
" for me its more a lifestyle , " said frank rosengart , the ccc spokesperson .
" hacking is asking more questions , trying to understand , using electronic devices in a different way than the manual proposes .
i think we need to go out to the world with this kind of lifestyle and trying to make a better world . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de aviation -pipe- 29.12.2010 german airport boss sparks debate about passenger profiling großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : passenger profiling would be partly based on ethnicity the future president of the german airport association has called for checks based on age , sex and ethnicity for " high-risk passengers . "
but the german justice minister has flatly rejected the idea . the ceo of dusseldorf airport , christoph blume , said he wanted to introduce passenger profiling in german airports to fight terrorism .
the system would be similar to that used in israel , where passengers are categorized as high or low risk according to their age , sex , ethnic background and other criteria . " in this way , the security systems can be more effectively used to benefit all those involved , " blume , who will become president of the german airport association -lrb- adv -rrb- in january , told the german newspaper rheinische post on tuesday .
high-risk passengers - those deemed more likely to carry out terrorist or illegal activity , such as organized crime , drug trafficking or espionage - would undergo more stringent security checks .
this could mean anything from a bag search to a full body search .
blume is n't alone in calling for more targeted checks .
current procedures are n't working according to joerg handwerg , a pilot for lufthansa and spokesperson for the pilot 's association cockpit .
" the current controls are foolish , because we waste resources by doing things that feign security but do n't actually bring security , " handwerg told deutsche welle .
a matter of common sense ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the threat of terrorism has led to heightened security at airports handwerg suggested that a point system could be employed to determine which passengers might pose a higher security risk , also taking note of where passengers were coming from and travelling to .
he said profiling could involve analyzing passenger behavior .
" the israelis already very successfully do psychological profiling based on asking people where they are going and paying attention to psychological reactions , like if the people become nervous , " he said .
" in these conversations you can assess whether a passenger should be checked more closely , or if they are unsuspicious . "
handwerg said profiling was a matter of common sense , rejecting the notion that it could be discriminatory .
" is it justified to check an 80-year-old woman just as intensively as an 18-year-old male passenger ? " he asked .
" there are differences .
that 's got nothing to do with discrimination ; it 's just common sense . "
climate of suspicion but in germany , where data protection is highly prized , opposition to collecting personal information about passengers would be a sticking point to introducing profiling .
critics , such as martin kutscha , a professor of constitutional law at the berlin school of economics and law , say that the dangers of profiling are too high a price to pay for greater security .
" obviously safety is a valuable commodity , but our society will never be 100 percent safe , " kutscha told deutsche welle .
" you will never catch someone who blows himself up at a market place with this kind of profiling .
safety is important , but not to the extent that you hold everybody under extreme suspicion . "
kutscha said profiling would also be legally problematic , especially since germany 's constitution does not allow ethnic discrimination .
he also worried that a climate of suspicion could be damaging for german society , especially with regard to its immigrant population .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : justice minister leutheusser-schnarrenberger has rejected the proposal " -lsb- profiling -rsb- would feed the fears that exist in society .
it 's obviously very damaging for a country that depends on immigration , like germany , " kutscha said .
in comments made to the frankfurter rundschau newspaper on wednesday , german justice minister sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger flatly rejected blume 's proposal , warning of the danger of " stigmatizing passengers , if one differentiates between them according to their origin and religion . "
she added that she believed passenger profiling would contravene german and european anti-discrimination legislation . the federal commissioner for data protection , peter schaar , also dismissed the suggestion , calling it unreasonable and unsupported in any legal sense .
" such a procedure would amount to a permanent dragnet , " he told the rheinische post newspaper .

dw examines how online events altered the real world . while military experts have been dealing with the issue of cyber-warfare for years , its public profile grew in 2010 as the united states established a " cyber command " in may and the nato alliance approved a new strategy that includes developing means of warding off cyber-attacks . " we did realize that cyber is one of the major , new issues to be dealt with , " said former us secretary of state madeline albright , who played a leading role in developing nato 's new overall strategy . stuxnet , a sophisticated computer virus designed to infect industrial control systems used in power plants , refineries and chemical production facilities , was found in september .
though its creators remain unknown , experts believe the program was written by programmers aiming to cripple iran 's uranium enrichment capabilities . the program proved nations and other groups were actively working on covert projects that would derail other countries ' industrial complex , according to stefan ritter of the german federal office for information security . " now we had proof , " he told deutsche welle .
" it was n't a fictional threat thought up by a couple of experts in a backroom anymore .
it 's a real threat that 's extremely large and extremely sophisticated . " wikileaks published classified material the whistle-blower website wikileaks , however , showed that sophisticated technology can also be harnessed to take information out of the backroom and put it in a public forum . bildunterschrift : already operational , wikileaks became well-known after releasing the afghan files the site first published some 80,000 classified documents relating to the us war in afghanistan then 400,000 files concerning the war in iraq . " the battlefield consequences of the release of these documents are potentially severe and dangerous for our troops , our allies and our afghan partners and may well damage our relationships and reputation in that key part of the world , " us defense secretary robert gates said after the afghanistan files were published . in november , wikileaks began the gradual publication of 250,000 diplomatic cables sent to washington from us embassies .
the frank assessments us officials sent to the state department brought to light the discrepancy between what world leaders sometimes say and do when it comes to international politics . wikileaks led to another online confrontation as an informal group of its proponents staged denial of service attacks on companies that removed wikileaks.org material from their servers and stopped accepting donations and discontinued financial services for the organization . google street view launches in germany personal privacy was the largest tech topic in germany in 2010 .
much media attention focused on opposition to google street view , an expansion of the us company 's map service that shows a street-level view of cities around the world . bildunterschrift : not everyone in germany was happy to have pictures of their homes appear on the internet privacy advocates accused google of infringing on individuals ' privacy and demanded a way for germans to opt out of the service before it went online , which some 200,000 people did before images of 20 german cities were made available in november . the german government also was in the spotlight after the country 's highest court overturned a 2008 law that required telecommunications companies to save phone and internet connection data for six months in case authorities required it for a criminal investigation . " saving connection information without cause evokes a diffuse and threatening feeling of being observation that impairs the unprejudiced perception of basic rights in many areas , " said hans-juergen papier , the president of the constitutional court at the time of the march verdict . proving that a change in calendar wo n't mean a change in points of view , joerg ziercke , the head of germany 's federal criminal police agency , called on lawmakers to find a way of sidestepping the court 's decision and obliging companies to store connection data . " it is important for us to be able to access this information under certain circumstances , " he said .

national security trumps rights and conflicts displace tens of thousands .
but progress has been made improving international institutions . united nations high commissioner for human rights navi pillay capped off a turbulent year of human rights by marking the 60th anniversary of her office and honored the achievements of hundreds of thousands of rights workers who risk their lives to speak out for human rights . " while combating discrimination and other important human rights causes , they themselves are often subject to discrimination , " she said .
" in fact , every year , thousands of human rights defenders are harassed , abused , unjustly detained and even murdered . " mass rape continues to be an appalling reality , torture remains widespread , extra-judicial executions , arbitrary detention and disappearances are all too prevalent in repressive societies , and national security interests and xenophobia are eroding human rights in democratic ones . some progress meanwhile , progress is slowly being made in strengthening the international laws and institutions that hold human rights violators accountable for their crimes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's difficult to judge the state of human rights however , it is getting harder to gauge whether the human rights situation is improving , according to julie de rivero , the geneva director for international non-government organization human rights watch . " what we have seen is an increase on the attacks on human rights defenders not only in places like china and iran , but also in other places where we had been a little bit hopeful about reform , such as bahrain , " she told deutsche welle . de rivero pointed to sri lanka as a place where crimes against civilians continue to be committed with impunity . " we saw the war end in sri lanka , but at a very high cost for civilians that were caught in indiscriminate fire by both sides , " she said .
" and , yet , there has been no accountability for war crimes in that country . " violence against women another worrying trend , de rivero noted , is sexual violence against women , particularly in the democratic republic of congo . " the scale of the phenomenon , i think , always compels us to focus on this particular situation because rape has been so normalized as a weapon of war in that country that it is shocking and the devastation that it causes is incredible in the lives of individuals and the community , " she said . de rivero added that the war on terror and heightened concern for national security are leading to a further erosion of human rights , even in democratic societies . making perpetrators accountable for their crimes remains a major concern for the international community , according to un high commissioner for human rights spokesman rupert collville .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rape and violence against women persist in drc " you have certain human rights violations that just continue year after year , " he said .
" you get some progress and then you get backsliding on something like torture . almost all states have laws that prohibit torture and declare it a crime , yet many states are still practicing it and many states do not prosecute those who commit it . " justice 's slow march discrimination is another major - and ongoing - concern , he said , adding that it affects women , homosexuals , people with disabilities , the elderly , minorities and indigenous peoples . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : discrimination troubles both industrialized and developing nations " it is a constant theme on every continent , including in the developed countries , where i think the treatment of migrants or foreigners has clearly deteriorated in the past decade or so , " collville said . while too many people get away with the crimes they commit , not all do and patience is needed as the wheels of justice turn slowly , collville said . " twenty or 30 years down the line , people still are being brought to court and charged with serious crimes - that perhaps is the strength of the system , " he said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de aviation -pipe- 29.12.2010 german airport boss sparks debate about passenger profiling großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : passenger profiling would be partly based on ethnicity the future president of the german airport association has called for checks based on age , sex and ethnicity for " high-risk passengers . "
but the german justice minister has flatly rejected the idea . the ceo of dusseldorf airport , christoph blume , said he wanted to introduce passenger profiling in german airports to fight terrorism .
the system would be similar to that used in israel , where passengers are categorized as high or low risk according to their age , sex , ethnic background and other criteria . " in this way , the security systems can be more effectively used to benefit all those involved , " blume , who will become president of the german airport association -lrb- adv -rrb- in january , told the german newspaper rheinische post on tuesday .
high-risk passengers - those deemed more likely to carry out terrorist or illegal activity , such as organized crime , drug trafficking or espionage - would undergo more stringent security checks .
this could mean anything from a bag search to a full body search .
blume is n't alone in calling for more targeted checks .
current procedures are n't working according to joerg handwerg , a pilot for lufthansa and spokesperson for the pilot 's association cockpit .
" the current controls are foolish , because we waste resources by doing things that feign security but do n't actually bring security , " handwerg told deutsche welle .
a matter of common sense ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the threat of terrorism has led to heightened security at airports handwerg suggested that a point system could be employed to determine which passengers might pose a higher security risk , also taking note of where passengers were coming from and travelling to .
he said profiling could involve analyzing passenger behavior .
" the israelis already very successfully do psychological profiling based on asking people where they are going and paying attention to psychological reactions , like if the people become nervous , " he said .
" in these conversations you can assess whether a passenger should be checked more closely , or if they are unsuspicious . "
handwerg said profiling was a matter of common sense , rejecting the notion that it could be discriminatory .
" is it justified to check an 80-year-old woman just as intensively as an 18-year-old male passenger ? " he asked .
" there are differences .
that 's got nothing to do with discrimination ; it 's just common sense . "
climate of suspicion but in germany , where data protection is highly prized , opposition to collecting personal information about passengers would be a sticking point to introducing profiling .
critics , such as martin kutscha , a professor of constitutional law at the berlin school of economics and law , say that the dangers of profiling are too high a price to pay for greater security .
" obviously safety is a valuable commodity , but our society will never be 100 percent safe , " kutscha told deutsche welle .
" you will never catch someone who blows himself up at a market place with this kind of profiling .
safety is important , but not to the extent that you hold everybody under extreme suspicion . "
kutscha said profiling would also be legally problematic , especially since germany 's constitution does not allow ethnic discrimination .
he also worried that a climate of suspicion could be damaging for german society , especially with regard to its immigrant population .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : justice minister leutheusser-schnarrenberger has rejected the proposal " -lsb- profiling -rsb- would feed the fears that exist in society .
it 's obviously very damaging for a country that depends on immigration , like germany , " kutscha said .
in comments made to the frankfurter rundschau newspaper on wednesday , german justice minister sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger flatly rejected blume 's proposal , warning of the danger of " stigmatizing passengers , if one differentiates between them according to their origin and religion . "
she added that she believed passenger profiling would contravene german and european anti-discrimination legislation . the federal commissioner for data protection , peter schaar , also dismissed the suggestion , calling it unreasonable and unsupported in any legal sense .
" such a procedure would amount to a permanent dragnet , " he told the rheinische post newspaper .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de security -pipe- 29.12.2010 international hackers convene in berlin großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the chaos communication congress opened monday the 27th annual chaos communication congress is currently underway in germany .
these hackers say society should be worried about personal data collected by governments about us . on monday , two berlin mobile security researchers outlined what they 've dubbed the " sms of death " attack , which they claim could potentially could affect significant portions of mobile phones worldwide , the overwhelming majority of which are non-smartphones , like an iphone or android .
by flooding these mobiles with hundreds of thousands of malicious texts , they were able to discover bugs within the phones text-message reading software , that in some cases would force the phone to get stuck in a reboot loop .
and that was just day one of the 27th annual chaos communication congress , the annual gathering of the chaos computer club , currently going on this week in the german capital .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new attack could affect millions of mobile phones the two german researchers , collin mulliner and nico golde , from the technical university of berlin , claimed that their attack potentially could affect older-generation mobile phones made by sony ericsson , samsung , motorola , micromax and lg .
mulliner theorized that a large scale such attack might be overwhelming to a mobile network by inducing " ten thousand mobiles to try to reconnect simultaneously . "
amongst the 3,000 attendees , there 's a majority of very pale , sometimes chubby men , with laptops under their arms who look like they have n't seen a lot of sunlight , there are also students , a few hipsters and women in attendance .
during the conference , which concludes on thursday , participants take part in lectures and workshops on political and technical topics - from censorship , data surveillance and copyright , to voip security and hacking smart phones .
attendees can even buy sim cards to use a special , experimental mobile phone network set up solely for this conference .
wikileaks first debuted at the 2007 ccc congress the chaos computer club , or ccc , was founded in berlin in 1981 and is one of the world 's oldest self-desecribed hacker clubs .
since that time , the ccc has become known for consistently exposing security flaws and challenged the trend of heightened data surveillance since the september 11 , 2001 attacks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in 2008 , the ccc published the fingerprints of germany 's interior minister to protest the authorities ' increasing use of biometric data , in march 2008 , the ccc acquired the german interior minister 's fingerprints , which they took from a water glass the politician used at a public speaking event .
they took that imprint and published them as a way to protest the increased use of biometric data in germany and to highlight the insecure nature of such data .
three years ago , at the 2007 congress , wikileaks founder julian assange presented an early sketch of the now-contraversial website .
there , he met ccc member , daniel domscheit-berg , -lrb- then known by his alias , daniel schmitt -rrb- , who until a few months ago was considered assange 's number two at wikileaks .
while the two groups are not formally affiliated , frank rosengart , a chaos computer club spokesperson , said that his organization supports wikileaks because both groups have similar goals , especially around the issues of more transparency in government , or what rosengart calls " machine-readable government . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wikileaks founder julian assange presented his website to the ccc in 2007 " wikileaks , for us , it 's the right way to do it , to publish information , " said rosengart .
" keeping the privacy and keeping the sources anonymous - that 's a very important part of software and this can be considered a good hack to set up such a system that works in this way . "
rosengart said that first and foremost the congress is a meeting place for technical collaboration to take place - as was the case with wikileaks .
" there are a lot of projects like open-source programming projects and some people they meet here for the first time in real life , " he said .
" so they know them online , they work together , they do software together , but they meet here for the first time . "
data retention policies on the rise this week at the ccc congress are a number of talks at the congress about data retention , which has increased dramatically in the last nine years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in december 2007 , assange met daniel domscheit-berg , who until recently was wikileaks ' number two in an attempt to prevent further terrorist attacks , many governments , including the united states and germany , have increased the amount and type of data they keep on each citizen .
one of the groups participating this year is ak vorrat - the working group on data retention - that lead a campaign protesting against the introduction of a data retention law in germany in 2008 .
the group 's efforts were successful and in march 2010 the law was declarecd unconstitutional by the german constitutional court .
however , this year , ak vorrat has focused its attention on the 2011 census .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many club members are worried about what types of data should be collected by governments " there is some data that should not be collected , " said michael ebeling , an ak vorrat spokesperson , who said the group is particularly concerned about certain lines of questioning in the german census .
" if you are not coming from germany , they are asking you where are you coming from , where are your father , your mother coming from ? " he said . " what kind of religion do you believe in ? if you are islamic believer then they ask very precisely , are you sunni or shiite .
and we ask why do they ask these things ? "
he added that for christians , there are no follow up questions about a person 's particular denomination , and noted that people who do n't fill out the forms correctly could face further questioning and or a hefty fine .
ak vorrat is also concerned because the data people put on the census forms will not be made anonymous for four to six years , and given the sensitive nature of much of this personal data , they fear that it could be misused by politicians - in the name of fighting terrorism .
increasing surveillance across the european union bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chaos computer club members are also concerned about the use of such data around europe but this year 's attendees are not just concerned about surveillance measures within germany .
the forum of computer scientists for peace and social responsibility association -lrb- fiff -rrb- , is a german non-profit organization focusing mainly on privacy and security issues , as well as the use of technology in weapons , robots and cyber-warfare .
on wednesday , fiff members gave a presentation about a european research project called indect that develops surveillance techniques for the authorities .
indect was initiated by the polish platform for homeland security , and according to its website , aims to " develop new , advanced and innovative algorithms and methods aiming at combating terrorism and other criminal activities affecting citizens ' safety . "
kai nothdurft , a student at the university of bremen , and a fiff member , said that indect is all about meticulously aggregating data from different sources - from websites , social networks , government databases and filming demonstrations using unmanned aerial vehicles , or uavs .
" they combine -lsb- data -rsb- with pictures they get from surveillance cameras , cctv cameras from public places and by using face recognition , " he said , adding that social networking photos can also be used as a surveillance tool .
" that 's a very dangerous thing because there 's an empowerment of all these surveillance techniques by really combining all these things . ”
lockpicking : the original hack bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german lockpicking club also had a stand at the conference while there 's a big focus on political issues at the conference , there are also fun and practical workshops like how to recover your data if your hard drive crashes , how to hack your playstation 3 console , and there 's even a stand for germany 's lockpicking club .
" if you enter a door without a key and if you open a lock without a key , it 's a hacking technique too , " said one female member of the club , who goes by the nom de hacker , snow goose .
however , she was quick to explain that the club has strict ethical ground rules .
" -lsb- we do n't teach -rsb- anybody to break into other peoples ' houses , " she said .
" always pick your own locks only ! "
similarly , for many attendees , this strong confluence of curiosity , technical inquiry , civic-mindendness and ethics is what unites all hackers .
" for me its more a lifestyle , " said frank rosengart , the ccc spokesperson .
" hacking is asking more questions , trying to understand , using electronic devices in a different way than the manual proposes .
i think we need to go out to the world with this kind of lifestyle and trying to make a better world . "

national security trumps rights and conflicts displace tens of thousands .
but progress has been made improving international institutions . united nations high commissioner for human rights navi pillay capped off a turbulent year of human rights by marking the 60th anniversary of her office and honored the achievements of hundreds of thousands of rights workers who risk their lives to speak out for human rights . " while combating discrimination and other important human rights causes , they themselves are often subject to discrimination , " she said .
" in fact , every year , thousands of human rights defenders are harassed , abused , unjustly detained and even murdered . " mass rape continues to be an appalling reality , torture remains widespread , extra-judicial executions , arbitrary detention and disappearances are all too prevalent in repressive societies , and national security interests and xenophobia are eroding human rights in democratic ones . some progress meanwhile , progress is slowly being made in strengthening the international laws and institutions that hold human rights violators accountable for their crimes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's difficult to judge the state of human rights however , it is getting harder to gauge whether the human rights situation is improving , according to julie de rivero , the geneva director for international non-government organization human rights watch . " what we have seen is an increase on the attacks on human rights defenders not only in places like china and iran , but also in other places where we had been a little bit hopeful about reform , such as bahrain , " she told deutsche welle . de rivero pointed to sri lanka as a place where crimes against civilians continue to be committed with impunity . " we saw the war end in sri lanka , but at a very high cost for civilians that were caught in indiscriminate fire by both sides , " she said .
" and , yet , there has been no accountability for war crimes in that country . " violence against women another worrying trend , de rivero noted , is sexual violence against women , particularly in the democratic republic of congo . " the scale of the phenomenon , i think , always compels us to focus on this particular situation because rape has been so normalized as a weapon of war in that country that it is shocking and the devastation that it causes is incredible in the lives of individuals and the community , " she said . de rivero added that the war on terror and heightened concern for national security are leading to a further erosion of human rights , even in democratic societies . making perpetrators accountable for their crimes remains a major concern for the international community , according to un high commissioner for human rights spokesman rupert collville .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rape and violence against women persist in drc " you have certain human rights violations that just continue year after year , " he said .
" you get some progress and then you get backsliding on something like torture . almost all states have laws that prohibit torture and declare it a crime , yet many states are still practicing it and many states do not prosecute those who commit it . " justice 's slow march discrimination is another major - and ongoing - concern , he said , adding that it affects women , homosexuals , people with disabilities , the elderly , minorities and indigenous peoples . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : discrimination troubles both industrialized and developing nations " it is a constant theme on every continent , including in the developed countries , where i think the treatment of migrants or foreigners has clearly deteriorated in the past decade or so , " collville said . while too many people get away with the crimes they commit , not all do and patience is needed as the wheels of justice turn slowly , collville said . " twenty or 30 years down the line , people still are being brought to court and charged with serious crimes - that perhaps is the strength of the system , " he said .
" circumstances change and people who think they are actively immune to justice sometimes find that is not actually the case in the long term .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de security -pipe- 29.12.2010 international hackers convene in berlin großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the chaos communication congress opened monday the 27th annual chaos communication congress is currently underway in germany .
these hackers say society should be worried about personal data collected by governments about us . on monday , two berlin mobile security researchers outlined what they 've dubbed the " sms of death " attack , which they claim could potentially could affect significant portions of mobile phones worldwide , the overwhelming majority of which are non-smartphones , like an iphone or android .
by flooding these mobiles with hundreds of thousands of malicious texts , they were able to discover bugs within the phones text-message reading software , that in some cases would force the phone to get stuck in a reboot loop .
and that was just day one of the 27th annual chaos communication congress , the annual gathering of the chaos computer club , currently going on this week in the german capital .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new attack could affect millions of mobile phones the two german researchers , collin mulliner and nico golde , from the technical university of berlin , claimed that their attack potentially could affect older-generation mobile phones made by sony ericsson , samsung , motorola , micromax and lg .
mulliner theorized that a large scale such attack might be overwhelming to a mobile network by inducing " ten thousand mobiles to try to reconnect simultaneously . "
amongst the 3,000 attendees , there 's a majority of very pale , sometimes chubby men , with laptops under their arms who look like they have n't seen a lot of sunlight , there are also students , a few hipsters and women in attendance .
during the conference , which concludes on thursday , participants take part in lectures and workshops on political and technical topics - from censorship , data surveillance and copyright , to voip security and hacking smart phones .
attendees can even buy sim cards to use a special , experimental mobile phone network set up solely for this conference .
wikileaks first debuted at the 2007 ccc congress the chaos computer club , or ccc , was founded in berlin in 1981 and is one of the world 's oldest self-desecribed hacker clubs .
since that time , the ccc has become known for consistently exposing security flaws and challenged the trend of heightened data surveillance since the september 11 , 2001 attacks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in 2008 , the ccc published the fingerprints of germany 's interior minister to protest the authorities ' increasing use of biometric data , in march 2008 , the ccc acquired the german interior minister 's fingerprints , which they took from a water glass the politician used at a public speaking event .
they took that imprint and published them as a way to protest the increased use of biometric data in germany and to highlight the insecure nature of such data .
three years ago , at the 2007 congress , wikileaks founder julian assange presented an early sketch of the now-contraversial website .
there , he met ccc member , daniel domscheit-berg , -lrb- then known by his alias , daniel schmitt -rrb- , who until a few months ago was considered assange 's number two at wikileaks .
while the two groups are not formally affiliated , frank rosengart , a chaos computer club spokesperson , said that his organization supports wikileaks because both groups have similar goals , especially around the issues of more transparency in government , or what rosengart calls " machine-readable government . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wikileaks founder julian assange presented his website to the ccc in 2007 " wikileaks , for us , it 's the right way to do it , to publish information , " said rosengart .
" keeping the privacy and keeping the sources anonymous - that 's a very important part of software and this can be considered a good hack to set up such a system that works in this way . "
rosengart said that first and foremost the congress is a meeting place for technical collaboration to take place - as was the case with wikileaks .
" there are a lot of projects like open-source programming projects and some people they meet here for the first time in real life , " he said .
" so they know them online , they work together , they do software together , but they meet here for the first time . "
data retention policies on the rise this week at the ccc congress are a number of talks at the congress about data retention , which has increased dramatically in the last nine years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in december 2007 , assange met daniel domscheit-berg , who until recently was wikileaks ' number two in an attempt to prevent further terrorist attacks , many governments , including the united states and germany , have increased the amount and type of data they keep on each citizen .
one of the groups participating this year is ak vorrat - the working group on data retention - that lead a campaign protesting against the introduction of a data retention law in germany in 2008 .
the group 's efforts were successful and in march 2010 the law was declarecd unconstitutional by the german constitutional court .
however , this year , ak vorrat has focused its attention on the 2011 census .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many club members are worried about what types of data should be collected by governments " there is some data that should not be collected , " said michael ebeling , an ak vorrat spokesperson , who said the group is particularly concerned about certain lines of questioning in the german census .
" if you are not coming from germany , they are asking you where are you coming from , where are your father , your mother coming from ? " he said . " what kind of religion do you believe in ? if you are islamic believer then they ask very precisely , are you sunni or shiite .
and we ask why do they ask these things ? "
he added that for christians , there are no follow up questions about a person 's particular denomination , and noted that people who do n't fill out the forms correctly could face further questioning and or a hefty fine .
ak vorrat is also concerned because the data people put on the census forms will not be made anonymous for four to six years , and given the sensitive nature of much of this personal data , they fear that it could be misused by politicians - in the name of fighting terrorism .
increasing surveillance across the european union bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chaos computer club members are also concerned about the use of such data around europe but this year 's attendees are not just concerned about surveillance measures within germany .
the forum of computer scientists for peace and social responsibility association -lrb- fiff -rrb- , is a german non-profit organization focusing mainly on privacy and security issues , as well as the use of technology in weapons , robots and cyber-warfare .
on wednesday , fiff members gave a presentation about a european research project called indect that develops surveillance techniques for the authorities .
indect was initiated by the polish platform for homeland security , and according to its website , aims to " develop new , advanced and innovative algorithms and methods aiming at combating terrorism and other criminal activities affecting citizens ' safety . "
kai nothdurft , a student at the university of bremen , and a fiff member , said that indect is all about meticulously aggregating data from different sources - from websites , social networks , government databases and filming demonstrations using unmanned aerial vehicles , or uavs .
" they combine -lsb- data -rsb- with pictures they get from surveillance cameras , cctv cameras from public places and by using face recognition , " he said , adding that social networking photos can also be used as a surveillance tool .
" that 's a very dangerous thing because there 's an empowerment of all these surveillance techniques by really combining all these things . ”
lockpicking : the original hack bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german lockpicking club also had a stand at the conference while there 's a big focus on political issues at the conference , there are also fun and practical workshops like how to recover your data if your hard drive crashes , how to hack your playstation 3 console , and there 's even a stand for germany 's lockpicking club .
" if you enter a door without a key and if you open a lock without a key , it 's a hacking technique too , " said one female member of the club , who goes by the nom de hacker , snow goose .
however , she was quick to explain that the club has strict ethical ground rules .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de security -pipe- 29.12.2010 international hackers convene in berlin großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the chaos communication congress opened monday the 27th annual chaos communication congress is currently underway in germany .
these hackers say society should be worried about personal data collected by governments about us . on monday , two berlin mobile security researchers outlined what they 've dubbed the " sms of death " attack , which they claim could potentially could affect significant portions of mobile phones worldwide , the overwhelming majority of which are non-smartphones , like an iphone or android .
by flooding these mobiles with hundreds of thousands of malicious texts , they were able to discover bugs within the phones text-message reading software , that in some cases would force the phone to get stuck in a reboot loop .
and that was just day one of the 27th annual chaos communication congress , the annual gathering of the chaos computer club , currently going on this week in the german capital .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new attack could affect millions of mobile phones the two german researchers , collin mulliner and nico golde , from the technical university of berlin , claimed that their attack potentially could affect older-generation mobile phones made by sony ericsson , samsung , motorola , micromax and lg .
mulliner theorized that a large scale such attack might be overwhelming to a mobile network by inducing " ten thousand mobiles to try to reconnect simultaneously . "
amongst the 3,000 attendees , there 's a majority of very pale , sometimes chubby men , with laptops under their arms who look like they have n't seen a lot of sunlight , there are also students , a few hipsters and women in attendance .
during the conference , which concludes on thursday , participants take part in lectures and workshops on political and technical topics - from censorship , data surveillance and copyright , to voip security and hacking smart phones .
attendees can even buy sim cards to use a special , experimental mobile phone network set up solely for this conference .
wikileaks first debuted at the 2007 ccc congress the chaos computer club , or ccc , was founded in berlin in 1981 and is one of the world 's oldest self-desecribed hacker clubs .
since that time , the ccc has become known for consistently exposing security flaws and challenged the trend of heightened data surveillance since the september 11 , 2001 attacks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in 2008 , the ccc published the fingerprints of germany 's interior minister to protest the authorities ' increasing use of biometric data , in march 2008 , the ccc acquired the german interior minister 's fingerprints , which they took from a water glass the politician used at a public speaking event .
they took that imprint and published them as a way to protest the increased use of biometric data in germany and to highlight the insecure nature of such data .
three years ago , at the 2007 congress , wikileaks founder julian assange presented an early sketch of the now-contraversial website .
there , he met ccc member , daniel domscheit-berg , -lrb- then known by his alias , daniel schmitt -rrb- , who until a few months ago was considered assange 's number two at wikileaks .
while the two groups are not formally affiliated , frank rosengart , a chaos computer club spokesperson , said that his organization supports wikileaks because both groups have similar goals , especially around the issues of more transparency in government , or what rosengart calls " machine-readable government . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wikileaks founder julian assange presented his website to the ccc in 2007 " wikileaks , for us , it 's the right way to do it , to publish information , " said rosengart .
" keeping the privacy and keeping the sources anonymous - that 's a very important part of software and this can be considered a good hack to set up such a system that works in this way . "
rosengart said that first and foremost the congress is a meeting place for technical collaboration to take place - as was the case with wikileaks .
" there are a lot of projects like open-source programming projects and some people they meet here for the first time in real life , " he said .
" so they know them online , they work together , they do software together , but they meet here for the first time . "
data retention policies on the rise this week at the ccc congress are a number of talks at the congress about data retention , which has increased dramatically in the last nine years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in december 2007 , assange met daniel domscheit-berg , who until recently was wikileaks ' number two in an attempt to prevent further terrorist attacks , many governments , including the united states and germany , have increased the amount and type of data they keep on each citizen .
one of the groups participating this year is ak vorrat - the working group on data retention - that lead a campaign protesting against the introduction of a data retention law in germany in 2008 .
the group 's efforts were successful and in march 2010 the law was declarecd unconstitutional by the german constitutional court .
however , this year , ak vorrat has focused its attention on the 2011 census .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many club members are worried about what types of data should be collected by governments " there is some data that should not be collected , " said michael ebeling , an ak vorrat spokesperson , who said the group is particularly concerned about certain lines of questioning in the german census .
" if you are not coming from germany , they are asking you where are you coming from , where are your father , your mother coming from ? " he said . " what kind of religion do you believe in ? if you are islamic believer then they ask very precisely , are you sunni or shiite .
and we ask why do they ask these things ? "
he added that for christians , there are no follow up questions about a person 's particular denomination , and noted that people who do n't fill out the forms correctly could face further questioning and or a hefty fine .
ak vorrat is also concerned because the data people put on the census forms will not be made anonymous for four to six years , and given the sensitive nature of much of this personal data , they fear that it could be misused by politicians - in the name of fighting terrorism .
increasing surveillance across the european union bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chaos computer club members are also concerned about the use of such data around europe but this year 's attendees are not just concerned about surveillance measures within germany .
the forum of computer scientists for peace and social responsibility association -lrb- fiff -rrb- , is a german non-profit organization focusing mainly on privacy and security issues , as well as the use of technology in weapons , robots and cyber-warfare .
on wednesday , fiff members gave a presentation about a european research project called indect that develops surveillance techniques for the authorities .
indect was initiated by the polish platform for homeland security , and according to its website , aims to " develop new , advanced and innovative algorithms and methods aiming at combating terrorism and other criminal activities affecting citizens ' safety . "
kai nothdurft , a student at the university of bremen , and a fiff member , said that indect is all about meticulously aggregating data from different sources - from websites , social networks , government databases and filming demonstrations using unmanned aerial vehicles , or uavs .
" they combine -lsb- data -rsb- with pictures they get from surveillance cameras , cctv cameras from public places and by using face recognition , " he said , adding that social networking photos can also be used as a surveillance tool .
" that 's a very dangerous thing because there 's an empowerment of all these surveillance techniques by really combining all these things . ”
lockpicking : the original hack bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german lockpicking club also had a stand at the conference while there 's a big focus on political issues at the conference , there are also fun and practical workshops like how to recover your data if your hard drive crashes , how to hack your playstation 3 console , and there 's even a stand for germany 's lockpicking club .
" if you enter a door without a key and if you open a lock without a key , it 's a hacking technique too , " said one female member of the club , who goes by the nom de hacker , snow goose .
however , she was quick to explain that the club has strict ethical ground rules .
" -lsb- we do n't teach -rsb- anybody to break into other peoples ' houses , " she said .
" always pick your own locks only ! "
similarly , for many attendees , this strong confluence of curiosity , technical inquiry , civic-mindendness and ethics is what unites all hackers .
" for me its more a lifestyle , " said frank rosengart , the ccc spokesperson .
" hacking is asking more questions , trying to understand , using electronic devices in a different way than the manual proposes .
i think we need to go out to the world with this kind of lifestyle and trying to make a better world . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de aviation -pipe- 29.12.2010 german airport boss sparks debate about passenger profiling großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : passenger profiling would be partly based on ethnicity the future president of the german airport association has called for checks based on age , sex and ethnicity for " high-risk passengers . "
but the german justice minister has flatly rejected the idea . the ceo of dusseldorf airport , christoph blume , said he wanted to introduce passenger profiling in german airports to fight terrorism .
the system would be similar to that used in israel , where passengers are categorized as high or low risk according to their age , sex , ethnic background and other criteria . " in this way , the security systems can be more effectively used to benefit all those involved , " blume , who will become president of the german airport association -lrb- adv -rrb- in january , told the german newspaper rheinische post on tuesday .
high-risk passengers - those deemed more likely to carry out terrorist or illegal activity , such as organized crime , drug trafficking or espionage - would undergo more stringent security checks .
this could mean anything from a bag search to a full body search .
blume is n't alone in calling for more targeted checks .
current procedures are n't working according to joerg handwerg , a pilot for lufthansa and spokesperson for the pilot 's association cockpit .
" the current controls are foolish , because we waste resources by doing things that feign security but do n't actually bring security , " handwerg told deutsche welle .
a matter of common sense ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the threat of terrorism has led to heightened security at airports handwerg suggested that a point system could be employed to determine which passengers might pose a higher security risk , also taking note of where passengers were coming from and travelling to .
he said profiling could involve analyzing passenger behavior .
" the israelis already very successfully do psychological profiling based on asking people where they are going and paying attention to psychological reactions , like if the people become nervous , " he said .
" in these conversations you can assess whether a passenger should be checked more closely , or if they are unsuspicious . "
handwerg said profiling was a matter of common sense , rejecting the notion that it could be discriminatory .
" is it justified to check an 80-year-old woman just as intensively as an 18-year-old male passenger ? " he asked .
" there are differences .
that 's got nothing to do with discrimination ; it 's just common sense . "
climate of suspicion but in germany , where data protection is highly prized , opposition to collecting personal information about passengers would be a sticking point to introducing profiling .
critics , such as martin kutscha , a professor of constitutional law at the berlin school of economics and law , say that the dangers of profiling are too high a price to pay for greater security .
" obviously safety is a valuable commodity , but our society will never be 100 percent safe , " kutscha told deutsche welle .
" you will never catch someone who blows himself up at a market place with this kind of profiling .
safety is important , but not to the extent that you hold everybody under extreme suspicion . "
kutscha said profiling would also be legally problematic , especially since germany 's constitution does not allow ethnic discrimination .
he also worried that a climate of suspicion could be damaging for german society , especially with regard to its immigrant population .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : justice minister leutheusser-schnarrenberger has rejected the proposal " -lsb- profiling -rsb- would feed the fears that exist in society .
it 's obviously very damaging for a country that depends on immigration , like germany , " kutscha said .
in comments made to the frankfurter rundschau newspaper on wednesday , german justice minister sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger flatly rejected blume 's proposal , warning of the danger of " stigmatizing passengers , if one differentiates between them according to their origin and religion . "
she added that she believed passenger profiling would contravene german and european anti-discrimination legislation . the federal commissioner for data protection , peter schaar , also dismissed the suggestion , calling it unreasonable and unsupported in any legal sense .
" such a procedure would amount to a permanent dragnet , " he told the rheinische post newspaper .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de aviation -pipe- 29.12.2010 german airport boss sparks debate about passenger profiling großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : passenger profiling would be partly based on ethnicity the future president of the german airport association has called for checks based on age , sex and ethnicity for " high-risk passengers . "
but the german justice minister has flatly rejected the idea . the ceo of dusseldorf airport , christoph blume , said he wanted to introduce passenger profiling in german airports to fight terrorism .
the system would be similar to that used in israel , where passengers are categorized as high or low risk according to their age , sex , ethnic background and other criteria . " in this way , the security systems can be more effectively used to benefit all those involved , " blume , who will become president of the german airport association -lrb- adv -rrb- in january , told the german newspaper rheinische post on tuesday .
high-risk passengers - those deemed more likely to carry out terrorist or illegal activity , such as organized crime , drug trafficking or espionage - would undergo more stringent security checks .
this could mean anything from a bag search to a full body search .
blume is n't alone in calling for more targeted checks .
current procedures are n't working according to joerg handwerg , a pilot for lufthansa and spokesperson for the pilot 's association cockpit .
" the current controls are foolish , because we waste resources by doing things that feign security but do n't actually bring security , " handwerg told deutsche welle .
a matter of common sense ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the threat of terrorism has led to heightened security at airports handwerg suggested that a point system could be employed to determine which passengers might pose a higher security risk , also taking note of where passengers were coming from and travelling to .
he said profiling could involve analyzing passenger behavior .
" the israelis already very successfully do psychological profiling based on asking people where they are going and paying attention to psychological reactions , like if the people become nervous , " he said .
" in these conversations you can assess whether a passenger should be checked more closely , or if they are unsuspicious . "
handwerg said profiling was a matter of common sense , rejecting the notion that it could be discriminatory .
" is it justified to check an 80-year-old woman just as intensively as an 18-year-old male passenger ? " he asked .
" there are differences .
that 's got nothing to do with discrimination ; it 's just common sense . "
climate of suspicion but in germany , where data protection is highly prized , opposition to collecting personal information about passengers would be a sticking point to introducing profiling .
critics , such as martin kutscha , a professor of constitutional law at the berlin school of economics and law , say that the dangers of profiling are too high a price to pay for greater security .
" obviously safety is a valuable commodity , but our society will never be 100 percent safe , " kutscha told deutsche welle .
" you will never catch someone who blows himself up at a market place with this kind of profiling .
safety is important , but not to the extent that you hold everybody under extreme suspicion . "
kutscha said profiling would also be legally problematic , especially since germany 's constitution does not allow ethnic discrimination .
he also worried that a climate of suspicion could be damaging for german society , especially with regard to its immigrant population .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : justice minister leutheusser-schnarrenberger has rejected the proposal " -lsb- profiling -rsb- would feed the fears that exist in society .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de security -pipe- 29.12.2010 international hackers convene in berlin großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the chaos communication congress opened monday the 27th annual chaos communication congress is currently underway in germany .
these hackers say society should be worried about personal data collected by governments about us . on monday , two berlin mobile security researchers outlined what they 've dubbed the " sms of death " attack , which they claim could potentially could affect significant portions of mobile phones worldwide , the overwhelming majority of which are non-smartphones , like an iphone or android .
by flooding these mobiles with hundreds of thousands of malicious texts , they were able to discover bugs within the phones text-message reading software , that in some cases would force the phone to get stuck in a reboot loop .
and that was just day one of the 27th annual chaos communication congress , the annual gathering of the chaos computer club , currently going on this week in the german capital .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new attack could affect millions of mobile phones the two german researchers , collin mulliner and nico golde , from the technical university of berlin , claimed that their attack potentially could affect older-generation mobile phones made by sony ericsson , samsung , motorola , micromax and lg .
mulliner theorized that a large scale such attack might be overwhelming to a mobile network by inducing " ten thousand mobiles to try to reconnect simultaneously . "
amongst the 3,000 attendees , there 's a majority of very pale , sometimes chubby men , with laptops under their arms who look like they have n't seen a lot of sunlight , there are also students , a few hipsters and women in attendance .
during the conference , which concludes on thursday , participants take part in lectures and workshops on political and technical topics - from censorship , data surveillance and copyright , to voip security and hacking smart phones .
attendees can even buy sim cards to use a special , experimental mobile phone network set up solely for this conference .
wikileaks first debuted at the 2007 ccc congress the chaos computer club , or ccc , was founded in berlin in 1981 and is one of the world 's oldest self-desecribed hacker clubs .
since that time , the ccc has become known for consistently exposing security flaws and challenged the trend of heightened data surveillance since the september 11 , 2001 attacks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in 2008 , the ccc published the fingerprints of germany 's interior minister to protest the authorities ' increasing use of biometric data , in march 2008 , the ccc acquired the german interior minister 's fingerprints , which they took from a water glass the politician used at a public speaking event .
they took that imprint and published them as a way to protest the increased use of biometric data in germany and to highlight the insecure nature of such data .
three years ago , at the 2007 congress , wikileaks founder julian assange presented an early sketch of the now-contraversial website .
there , he met ccc member , daniel domscheit-berg , -lrb- then known by his alias , daniel schmitt -rrb- , who until a few months ago was considered assange 's number two at wikileaks .
while the two groups are not formally affiliated , frank rosengart , a chaos computer club spokesperson , said that his organization supports wikileaks because both groups have similar goals , especially around the issues of more transparency in government , or what rosengart calls " machine-readable government . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wikileaks founder julian assange presented his website to the ccc in 2007 " wikileaks , for us , it 's the right way to do it , to publish information , " said rosengart .
" keeping the privacy and keeping the sources anonymous - that 's a very important part of software and this can be considered a good hack to set up such a system that works in this way . "
rosengart said that first and foremost the congress is a meeting place for technical collaboration to take place - as was the case with wikileaks .
" there are a lot of projects like open-source programming projects and some people they meet here for the first time in real life , " he said .
" so they know them online , they work together , they do software together , but they meet here for the first time . "
data retention policies on the rise this week at the ccc congress are a number of talks at the congress about data retention , which has increased dramatically in the last nine years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in december 2007 , assange met daniel domscheit-berg , who until recently was wikileaks ' number two in an attempt to prevent further terrorist attacks , many governments , including the united states and germany , have increased the amount and type of data they keep on each citizen .
one of the groups participating this year is ak vorrat - the working group on data retention - that lead a campaign protesting against the introduction of a data retention law in germany in 2008 .
the group 's efforts were successful and in march 2010 the law was declarecd unconstitutional by the german constitutional court .
however , this year , ak vorrat has focused its attention on the 2011 census .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many club members are worried about what types of data should be collected by governments " there is some data that should not be collected , " said michael ebeling , an ak vorrat spokesperson , who said the group is particularly concerned about certain lines of questioning in the german census .
" if you are not coming from germany , they are asking you where are you coming from , where are your father , your mother coming from ? " he said . " what kind of religion do you believe in ? if you are islamic believer then they ask very precisely , are you sunni or shiite .
and we ask why do they ask these things ? "
he added that for christians , there are no follow up questions about a person 's particular denomination , and noted that people who do n't fill out the forms correctly could face further questioning and or a hefty fine .
ak vorrat is also concerned because the data people put on the census forms will not be made anonymous for four to six years , and given the sensitive nature of much of this personal data , they fear that it could be misused by politicians - in the name of fighting terrorism .
increasing surveillance across the european union bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chaos computer club members are also concerned about the use of such data around europe but this year 's attendees are not just concerned about surveillance measures within germany .
the forum of computer scientists for peace and social responsibility association -lrb- fiff -rrb- , is a german non-profit organization focusing mainly on privacy and security issues , as well as the use of technology in weapons , robots and cyber-warfare .
on wednesday , fiff members gave a presentation about a european research project called indect that develops surveillance techniques for the authorities .
indect was initiated by the polish platform for homeland security , and according to its website , aims to " develop new , advanced and innovative algorithms and methods aiming at combating terrorism and other criminal activities affecting citizens ' safety . "
kai nothdurft , a student at the university of bremen , and a fiff member , said that indect is all about meticulously aggregating data from different sources - from websites , social networks , government databases and filming demonstrations using unmanned aerial vehicles , or uavs .
" they combine -lsb- data -rsb- with pictures they get from surveillance cameras , cctv cameras from public places and by using face recognition , " he said , adding that social networking photos can also be used as a surveillance tool .
" that 's a very dangerous thing because there 's an empowerment of all these surveillance techniques by really combining all these things . ”
lockpicking : the original hack bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german lockpicking club also had a stand at the conference while there 's a big focus on political issues at the conference , there are also fun and practical workshops like how to recover your data if your hard drive crashes , how to hack your playstation 3 console , and there 's even a stand for germany 's lockpicking club .
" if you enter a door without a key and if you open a lock without a key , it 's a hacking technique too , " said one female member of the club , who goes by the nom de hacker , snow goose .
however , she was quick to explain that the club has strict ethical ground rules .
" -lsb- we do n't teach -rsb- anybody to break into other peoples ' houses , " she said .
" always pick your own locks only ! "
similarly , for many attendees , this strong confluence of curiosity , technical inquiry , civic-mindendness and ethics is what unites all hackers .
" for me its more a lifestyle , " said frank rosengart , the ccc spokesperson .
" hacking is asking more questions , trying to understand , using electronic devices in a different way than the manual proposes .
i think we need to go out to the world with this kind of lifestyle and trying to make a better world . "

dw examines how online events altered the real world . while military experts have been dealing with the issue of cyber-warfare for years , its public profile grew in 2010 as the united states established a " cyber command " in may and the nato alliance approved a new strategy that includes developing means of warding off cyber-attacks . " we did realize that cyber is one of the major , new issues to be dealt with , " said former us secretary of state madeline albright , who played a leading role in developing nato 's new overall strategy . stuxnet , a sophisticated computer virus designed to infect industrial control systems used in power plants , refineries and chemical production facilities , was found in september .
though its creators remain unknown , experts believe the program was written by programmers aiming to cripple iran 's uranium enrichment capabilities . the program proved nations and other groups were actively working on covert projects that would derail other countries ' industrial complex , according to stefan ritter of the german federal office for information security . " now we had proof , " he told deutsche welle .
" it was n't a fictional threat thought up by a couple of experts in a backroom anymore .
it 's a real threat that 's extremely large and extremely sophisticated . " wikileaks published classified material the whistle-blower website wikileaks , however , showed that sophisticated technology can also be harnessed to take information out of the backroom and put it in a public forum . bildunterschrift : already operational , wikileaks became well-known after releasing the afghan files the site first published some 80,000 classified documents relating to the us war in afghanistan then 400,000 files concerning the war in iraq . " the battlefield consequences of the release of these documents are potentially severe and dangerous for our troops , our allies and our afghan partners and may well damage our relationships and reputation in that key part of the world , " us defense secretary robert gates said after the afghanistan files were published . in november , wikileaks began the gradual publication of 250,000 diplomatic cables sent to washington from us embassies .
the frank assessments us officials sent to the state department brought to light the discrepancy between what world leaders sometimes say and do when it comes to international politics . wikileaks led to another online confrontation as an informal group of its proponents staged denial of service attacks on companies that removed wikileaks.org material from their servers and stopped accepting donations and discontinued financial services for the organization . google street view launches in germany personal privacy was the largest tech topic in germany in 2010 .
much media attention focused on opposition to google street view , an expansion of the us company 's map service that shows a street-level view of cities around the world . bildunterschrift : not everyone in germany was happy to have pictures of their homes appear on the internet privacy advocates accused google of infringing on individuals ' privacy and demanded a way for germans to opt out of the service before it went online , which some 200,000 people did before images of 20 german cities were made available in november . the german government also was in the spotlight after the country 's highest court overturned a 2008 law that required telecommunications companies to save phone and internet connection data for six months in case authorities required it for a criminal investigation . " saving connection information without cause evokes a diffuse and threatening feeling of being observation that impairs the unprejudiced perception of basic rights in many areas , " said hans-juergen papier , the president of the constitutional court at the time of the march verdict . proving that a change in calendar wo n't mean a change in points of view , joerg ziercke , the head of germany 's federal criminal police agency , called on lawmakers to find a way of sidestepping the court 's decision and obliging companies to store connection data . " it is important for us to be able to access this information under certain circumstances , " he said .
" that 's why we need a new law that removes the barriers in the fight against terrorism and organized crime . " authors : matthias von hein , sean sinico editor : cyrus farivar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

there , he met ccc member , daniel domscheit-berg , -lrb- then known by his alias , daniel schmitt -rrb- , who until a few months ago was considered assange 's number two at wikileaks .
while the two groups are not formally affiliated , frank rosengart , a chaos computer club spokesperson , said that his organization supports wikileaks because both groups have similar goals , especially around the issues of more transparency in government , or what rosengart calls " machine-readable government . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wikileaks founder julian assange presented his website to the ccc in 2007 " wikileaks , for us , it 's the right way to do it , to publish information , " said rosengart .
" keeping the privacy and keeping the sources anonymous - that 's a very important part of software and this can be considered a good hack to set up such a system that works in this way . "
rosengart said that first and foremost the congress is a meeting place for technical collaboration to take place - as was the case with wikileaks .
" there are a lot of projects like open-source programming projects and some people they meet here for the first time in real life , " he said .
" so they know them online , they work together , they do software together , but they meet here for the first time . "
data retention policies on the rise this week at the ccc congress are a number of talks at the congress about data retention , which has increased dramatically in the last nine years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in december 2007 , assange met daniel domscheit-berg , who until recently was wikileaks ' number two in an attempt to prevent further terrorist attacks , many governments , including the united states and germany , have increased the amount and type of data they keep on each citizen .
one of the groups participating this year is ak vorrat - the working group on data retention - that lead a campaign protesting against the introduction of a data retention law in germany in 2008 .
the group 's efforts were successful and in march 2010 the law was declarecd unconstitutional by the german constitutional court .
however , this year , ak vorrat has focused its attention on the 2011 census .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many club members are worried about what types of data should be collected by governments " there is some data that should not be collected , " said michael ebeling , an ak vorrat spokesperson , who said the group is particularly concerned about certain lines of questioning in the german census .
" if you are not coming from germany , they are asking you where are you coming from , where are your father , your mother coming from ? " he said . " what kind of religion do you believe in ? if you are islamic believer then they ask very precisely , are you sunni or shiite .
and we ask why do they ask these things ? "
he added that for christians , there are no follow up questions about a person 's particular denomination , and noted that people who do n't fill out the forms correctly could face further questioning and or a hefty fine .
ak vorrat is also concerned because the data people put on the census forms will not be made anonymous for four to six years , and given the sensitive nature of much of this personal data , they fear that it could be misused by politicians - in the name of fighting terrorism .
increasing surveillance across the european union bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chaos computer club members are also concerned about the use of such data around europe but this year 's attendees are not just concerned about surveillance measures within germany .
the forum of computer scientists for peace and social responsibility association -lrb- fiff -rrb- , is a german non-profit organization focusing mainly on privacy and security issues , as well as the use of technology in weapons , robots and cyber-warfare .
on wednesday , fiff members gave a presentation about a european research project called indect that develops surveillance techniques for the authorities .
indect was initiated by the polish platform for homeland security , and according to its website , aims to " develop new , advanced and innovative algorithms and methods aiming at combating terrorism and other criminal activities affecting citizens ' safety . "
kai nothdurft , a student at the university of bremen , and a fiff member , said that indect is all about meticulously aggregating data from different sources - from websites , social networks , government databases and filming demonstrations using unmanned aerial vehicles , or uavs .
" they combine -lsb- data -rsb- with pictures they get from surveillance cameras , cctv cameras from public places and by using face recognition , " he said , adding that social networking photos can also be used as a surveillance tool .
" that 's a very dangerous thing because there 's an empowerment of all these surveillance techniques by really combining all these things . ”
lockpicking : the original hack bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german lockpicking club also had a stand at the conference while there 's a big focus on political issues at the conference , there are also fun and practical workshops like how to recover your data if your hard drive crashes , how to hack your playstation 3 console , and there 's even a stand for germany 's lockpicking club .
" if you enter a door without a key and if you open a lock without a key , it 's a hacking technique too , " said one female member of the club , who goes by the nom de hacker , snow goose .
however , she was quick to explain that the club has strict ethical ground rules .
" -lsb- we do n't teach -rsb- anybody to break into other peoples ' houses , " she said .
" always pick your own locks only ! "
similarly , for many attendees , this strong confluence of curiosity , technical inquiry , civic-mindendness and ethics is what unites all hackers .
" for me its more a lifestyle , " said frank rosengart , the ccc spokesperson .
" hacking is asking more questions , trying to understand , using electronic devices in a different way than the manual proposes .
i think we need to go out to the world with this kind of lifestyle and trying to make a better world . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 29.12.2010 divisions between online and physical worlds blur in 2010 großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : connections between the online and real worlds are increasing the virtual world continued to revolutionize reality in 2010 as the internet solidified its position as a platform for warfare , personal privacy and transparency .
dw examines how online events altered the real world . while military experts have been dealing with the issue of cyber-warfare for years , its public profile grew in 2010 as the united states established a " cyber command " in may and the nato alliance approved a new strategy that includes developing means of warding off cyber-attacks . " we did realize that cyber is one of the major , new issues to be dealt with , " said former us secretary of state madeline albright , who played a leading role in developing nato 's new overall strategy . stuxnet , a sophisticated computer virus designed to infect industrial control systems used in power plants , refineries and chemical production facilities , was found in september .
though its creators remain unknown , experts believe the program was written by programmers aiming to cripple iran 's uranium enrichment capabilities . the program proved nations and other groups were actively working on covert projects that would derail other countries ' industrial complex , according to stefan ritter of the german federal office for information security . " now we had proof , " he told deutsche welle .
" it was n't a fictional threat thought up by a couple of experts in a backroom anymore .
it 's a real threat that 's extremely large and extremely sophisticated . " wikileaks published classified material the whistle-blower website wikileaks , however , showed that sophisticated technology can also be harnessed to take information out of the backroom and put it in a public forum . bildunterschrift : already operational , wikileaks became well-known after releasing the afghan files the site first published some 80,000 classified documents relating to the us war in afghanistan then 400,000 files concerning the war in iraq . " the battlefield consequences of the release of these documents are potentially severe and dangerous for our troops , our allies and our afghan partners and may well damage our relationships and reputation in that key part of the world , " us defense secretary robert gates said after the afghanistan files were published . in november , wikileaks began the gradual publication of 250,000 diplomatic cables sent to washington from us embassies .
the frank assessments us officials sent to the state department brought to light the discrepancy between what world leaders sometimes say and do when it comes to international politics . wikileaks led to another online confrontation as an informal group of its proponents staged denial of service attacks on companies that removed wikileaks.org material from their servers and stopped accepting donations and discontinued financial services for the organization . google street view launches in germany personal privacy was the largest tech topic in germany in 2010 .
much media attention focused on opposition to google street view , an expansion of the us company 's map service that shows a street-level view of cities around the world . bildunterschrift : not everyone in germany was happy to have pictures of their homes appear on the internet privacy advocates accused google of infringing on individuals ' privacy and demanded a way for germans to opt out of the service before it went online , which some 200,000 people did before images of 20 german cities were made available in november . the german government also was in the spotlight after the country 's highest court overturned a 2008 law that required telecommunications companies to save phone and internet connection data for six months in case authorities required it for a criminal investigation . " saving connection information without cause evokes a diffuse and threatening feeling of being observation that impairs the unprejudiced perception of basic rights in many areas , " said hans-juergen papier , the president of the constitutional court at the time of the march verdict . proving that a change in calendar wo n't mean a change in points of view , joerg ziercke , the head of germany 's federal criminal police agency , called on lawmakers to find a way of sidestepping the court 's decision and obliging companies to store connection data . " it is important for us to be able to access this information under certain circumstances , " he said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de aviation -pipe- 29.12.2010 german airport boss sparks debate about passenger profiling großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : passenger profiling would be partly based on ethnicity the future president of the german airport association has called for checks based on age , sex and ethnicity for " high-risk passengers . "
but the german justice minister has flatly rejected the idea . the ceo of dusseldorf airport , christoph blume , said he wanted to introduce passenger profiling in german airports to fight terrorism .
the system would be similar to that used in israel , where passengers are categorized as high or low risk according to their age , sex , ethnic background and other criteria . " in this way , the security systems can be more effectively used to benefit all those involved , " blume , who will become president of the german airport association -lrb- adv -rrb- in january , told the german newspaper rheinische post on tuesday .
high-risk passengers - those deemed more likely to carry out terrorist or illegal activity , such as organized crime , drug trafficking or espionage - would undergo more stringent security checks .
this could mean anything from a bag search to a full body search .
blume is n't alone in calling for more targeted checks .
current procedures are n't working according to joerg handwerg , a pilot for lufthansa and spokesperson for the pilot 's association cockpit .
" the current controls are foolish , because we waste resources by doing things that feign security but do n't actually bring security , " handwerg told deutsche welle .
a matter of common sense ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the threat of terrorism has led to heightened security at airports handwerg suggested that a point system could be employed to determine which passengers might pose a higher security risk , also taking note of where passengers were coming from and travelling to .
he said profiling could involve analyzing passenger behavior .
" the israelis already very successfully do psychological profiling based on asking people where they are going and paying attention to psychological reactions , like if the people become nervous , " he said .
" in these conversations you can assess whether a passenger should be checked more closely , or if they are unsuspicious . "
handwerg said profiling was a matter of common sense , rejecting the notion that it could be discriminatory .
" is it justified to check an 80-year-old woman just as intensively as an 18-year-old male passenger ? " he asked .
" there are differences .
that 's got nothing to do with discrimination ; it 's just common sense . "
climate of suspicion but in germany , where data protection is highly prized , opposition to collecting personal information about passengers would be a sticking point to introducing profiling .
critics , such as martin kutscha , a professor of constitutional law at the berlin school of economics and law , say that the dangers of profiling are too high a price to pay for greater security .
" obviously safety is a valuable commodity , but our society will never be 100 percent safe , " kutscha told deutsche welle .
" you will never catch someone who blows himself up at a market place with this kind of profiling .
safety is important , but not to the extent that you hold everybody under extreme suspicion . "
kutscha said profiling would also be legally problematic , especially since germany 's constitution does not allow ethnic discrimination .
he also worried that a climate of suspicion could be damaging for german society , especially with regard to its immigrant population .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : justice minister leutheusser-schnarrenberger has rejected the proposal " -lsb- profiling -rsb- would feed the fears that exist in society .
it 's obviously very damaging for a country that depends on immigration , like germany , " kutscha said .
in comments made to the frankfurter rundschau newspaper on wednesday , german justice minister sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger flatly rejected blume 's proposal , warning of the danger of " stigmatizing passengers , if one differentiates between them according to their origin and religion . "
she added that she believed passenger profiling would contravene german and european anti-discrimination legislation . the federal commissioner for data protection , peter schaar , also dismissed the suggestion , calling it unreasonable and unsupported in any legal sense .
" such a procedure would amount to a permanent dragnet , " he told the rheinische post newspaper .

once known for its ascendant economy , estonia 's financial prospects were changed drastically by the global economic crisis . starting in the late 1990s , estonia , lithuania and latvia enjoyed an unprecedented economic boom .
dubbed the " baltic tigers " , these three republics grew as much as 12 percent per year .
while tiny estonia is the smallest of the three states , it was regarded as the poster child of these emerging economic hotbeds .
with a flare for technology , the country was often jokingly called " e-stonia " .
one of the government 's key economic goals was to become a member of the eurozone .
following years of negotiations , estonia will introduce the common currency on january 1 , 2011 .
unfortunately for many residents , the global financial crisis has wiped out many of the telltale signs of economic prosperity in estonia .
euro already recognized for marina wolkowa , who sells a variety of goods from a market booth at tallinn 's central railway station , the euro is already part of daily reality .
sitting on a stool and waiting for customers , she explains that she has been required to list prices in both estonian kroons and the euro for a year now .
she sells estonian pickles for 25 kroons or 1.60 euros .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : estonia 's kroon became a symbol of independence from the soviet union " but the euro wo n't help us forward .
it 's only going to drive up prices , " she told deutsche welle .
at the end of the year , however , estonia 's 1.3 million inhabitants will have to part with the kroon , which has served as a symbol of the country 's independence after the collapse of the soviet union .
estonia 's economic boom was fueled in part by its enthusiasm for technology .
the country was an early adopter of computer-based financial systems .
then there were neoliberal market reforms : estonia 's flat income tax rate is an across-the-board 22 percent .
low deficit ultimately it was the global economic crisis that brought the " estonian tiger " to its knees .
in 2009 , the country 's economy shrank by 13 percent .
but the euro is coming to estonia anyway .
this is mainly because of the country 's low budget deficit , which for the past two years has been well below the 3 percent stipulated by the maastricht treaty .
additionally , the kroon has been pegged to the value of the euro since 2004 .
that 's why estonian president toomas hendrik ilves has said the change from kroons to euros will have a psychological effect more than anything .
it will help to differentiate estonia from the other baltic states , which are often perceived by outsiders of as a single unit .
" when latvia has a problem , then there is immediately a ' crisis in the baltic ' , " ilves said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : estonian president toomas hendrik ilves says the euro will be good for estonia in 2009 , latvia narrowly avoided insolvency multi-billion-euro lines of credit from the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- and the european union .
the country 's largest financial institute , parex-bank , was rescued from collapse by being nationalized .
easy credit and overspending estonia may have fared better than latvia , but it still has its own share of problems , and not just in the eyes of its own population .
many independent economists see the country 's situation as precarious .
rainer kattel from of the tallinn university of technology says the country would have run into problems even without the global economic crisis because many estonians were living beyond their means .
when times were at their best , banks doled out easy credit – often via cell phone text message and without seriously checking their customers ' creditworthiness .
" in principle , the situation in the baltic region is n't much different than in greece or spain , " kattel told deutsche welle .
" on the one hand we do n't have that high level of debt , but on the other hand estonia has an unemployment rate of 18 percent . "
kattel argues that an alternative to introducing the euro in 2011 would have been to devalue the kroon .
instead , estonia is now experiencing an internal devaluation through decreased salaries , he said .
there are plenty of reasons to be skeptical about the direction estonia is currently moving in , according to kattel .
the global economic crisis is far from over , and many of the country 's citizens will carry immense amounts of debt for years to come .
" i 'm afraid that large areas of estonia will become more and more depopulated , because the people there will move into the cities or move away completely , " he said .
