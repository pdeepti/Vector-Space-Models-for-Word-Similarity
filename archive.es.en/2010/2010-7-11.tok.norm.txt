we 're proud of you !
that 's what we want to say to our national team .
third place in the world cup is a well-deserved reward for their fantastic performance this time round .
they 've created unforgettable moments .
in years to come we 'll still be saying : do you remember the round of sixteen match against england in south africa 2010 ? that disallowed goal for the english , and the subsequent 4-1 thrashing by our team .
do you remember the quarterfinal against argentina ?
when thomas mueller , bastian schweinsteiger and mesut oezil pulverized the " gauchos " ' defense and sent the pre-match favourites packing with a resounding 4-0 victory ?
from nobodies to stars let 's be honest , who really thought that this young team would create such memorable highlights ?
the german team is now being celebrated across the world for their inspirational offensive football .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche welle 's stefan nestler is dazzled by the german side talented players , who not so long ago were playing for the german football association 's junior team , whom no-one had even heard of abroad , hammered the world 's best into disarray .
international sports reporters became familiar with how to pronounce the names of the german players – and were full of respect for germany 's new football flair .
it was n't only fans at home who were upset when the team met their match in the semi finals against spain .
football fans from across the world reported that they were sorry that this amazing german side had n't made it into the final .
time to perfect their game we do n't need to grieve for what could have been .
this team belongs to the future .
thomas mueller , the biggest discovery of this world cup , is 20 years old , mesut oezil is 21 , sami khedira , 23 .
and even leading players like bastian schweinsteiger or the captain , philipp lahm , are only in their mid twenties .
they can play together for a few more years yet , and have time to perfect their game further .
and other talents are following on behind .
the seeds sown by the german football association in training young players are bearing fruit . above all , the pool of young players , trained to first-class standards , technically and tactically , promises a golden future for german football .
national team coach , joachim loew , should be praised for his part in this success story , in which he has personally played a major hand .
he must be eager to carry on as well .
in this instance , the german football association would be well-advised to hold onto him .
they should follow the motto : never change a winning team !
even if it never quite hit the jackpot .

but questions still surround the tragedy . some 40,000 people gathered sunday in the bosnian town of srebrenica , where the massacre widely described as europe 's worst atrocity since world war ii occurred 15 years ago .
srebrenica was a un-protected enclave besieged by bosnian serb forces throughout the 1992-95 war .
but un troops there were quickly overrun when the serbs entered the town , rounded up its bosnian muslim population and killed more than 8,000 men and boys .
as part of sunday 's ceremony , 775 recently identified massacre victims in coffins draped in green were interred at the potocari war cemetery , where more than 4,500 are already buried .
several world leaders attended the commemoration ceremony , including us president barack obama , british prime minister david cameron and turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan .
recognizing the international community 's failure to respond to the bloody bosnian war , obama called the massacre " a stain on our collective conscience . "
also at the ceremony was serbian president boris tadic , whose presence many bosnians resented .
serbia has been criticized for its perceived reluctance to capture ratko mladic , the general who led the attack on srebrenica .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un soldiers reinforce defensive positions in sarajevo during the 1992-1995 bosnian war slow search for victims on friday , thousands of people lined the main street of sarajevo as trucks bearing more coffins passed through on the way to srebrenica , some 100 miles to the south-east in eastern bosnia .
in the drina valley , the remains of 8,372 victims of the massacre have been exhumed from 275 mass graves in recent years .
so far 6,557 victims have been identified , and many more murdered muslim civilians are still missing .
the search is slow and tedious , as corpses were tossed into mass graves , often to be dug up again later with bulldozers only to be hastily buried again elsewhere . manfred eisele , an army major general in the german armed forces responsible for planning the un 's peacekeeping operations from 1994 to 1998 , said that 15 years after the srebrenica massacre , it was still difficult to shed light on events . he said he had doubts that those responsible in the un security council had the power or the intention to guarantee the protection of the 40,000 muslim civilians in the srebrenica " safe area . "
' they did n't prevent the drama ' many analysts now place much of the blame for the genocide on the dutch government . fearing for the safety of its 450 soldiers stationed in the area , the dutch government failed to order a un-proposed air attack on serb troops .
the dutch were easily overpowered and the massacre unfolded .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ex-bosnian-serb general ratko mladic is wanted for crimes against humanity german lawyer axel hagedorn , who represents about 8,000 relatives of the victims , is trying to invalidate the un 's immunity before the highest court in the netherlands , as well as the european court of justice .
" the un has a clear responsibility , it should have decided against the dutch , " hagedorn said .
" if the un had to go to court , then it would no longer be possible for the dutch state to blame the un , or the un to blame the dutch state , which is what 's happening now . "
lessons of history the massacre of srebrenica , but also the genocide in rwanda and cambodia , are seen as signs of the un 's failure . the united nations still has not learned its lesson , general eisele said .
" the readiness of states to take responsibility for hard-pressed minorities and also to recognize this protective responsibility is still dramatically underdeveloped , " he said .
" a direct consequence can be seen in the nato deployment … for the kosovo-albanians , who were subjected to massive human rights violations by their own government . "
today , only about three to five percent of the population in srebrenica is muslim , most of them women still searching for relatives .
many families went into exile to canada , new zealand and the united states .

he had an impressive cv but did he have the vision to lead the most potent attacking team on earth ?
on sunday , he leads them into the world cup final . in the hysteria that surrounded spain after they won their first ever trophy at the european championships in 2008 , it was easy to forget one of the more unsavoury chapters of their recent history , given their imperious march to the title in austria and switzerland .
it took place in 2004 when most of the spain team who would go on to become european champions were just starting to come through and show promise .
their coach at the time , luis aragones , allegedly used a racist slur to motivate striker jose antonio reyes to stand up to thierry henry of france .
while the comment itself was deplorable enough , the spanish fa 's reluctance to take action was even more so .
aragones was , of course , allowed to stay in his job and four years after the scandal , he led spain to the euro 2008 title .
the glory of that achievement , and the belief of his supporters that he was just a ' man of his time , ' glossed over the fact that aragones was seen by many as a difficult , volatile man and an opinionated , abusive coach .
but he got results , and as such , he was tolerated and indulged .
two years on and spain have the chance to claim the ultimate title when they face the netherlands in the final of the 2010 fifa world cup on sunday .
they have lost only two games in the last 55 they 've played and have shown the same confidence and class in south africa as they did in austria and switzerland .
if they win the world cup , it will be an achievement which will put even winning euro 2008 in the shade .
has all this been achieved with a raging , anachronistic coach at the helm ?
has a ' man of his time ' used bullying tactics to take this team to within one game of being crowned champions of the world ?
the answer is of course no .
vicente del bosque , a man and coach infinitely less brash or controversial than his predecessor , has brought spain to the cusp of winning the greatest prize with his mixture of calm advice and fatherly protection .
coach sticks with successful tactics but changes atmosphere del bosque is the polar opposite of the combustible aragones and yet the team has n't suffered from such a radical change at the top .
from the day he took over as coach , he insisted that nothing would change on the pitch .
spain had just enjoyed its finest hour and del bosque knew not to rock the boat by shaking up the system .
he kept the nucleus of the euro 2008 team intact along with aragones ' tactical plan .
it was n't broken , so why fix it ?
bildunterschrift : del bosque recognised that spain did not need rebuilding on the pitch but needed calm off it instead , he changed the approach off the pitch , replacing the haranguing of players with the quiet coaxing which had got the best out of the real madrid teams he had coached in the past .
the result is a happy , comfortable squad in which the potentially damaging barcelona-real madrid split has no place .
if no complaints about del bosque or rumours of feuds among players have leaked from the dressing room it is because there have n't been any .
the players have been made to feel they are partners in the team 's success by del bosque 's inclusive approach .
after weathering the storm of criticism which followed the switzerland defeat in spain 's first game in south africa , the quiet man of spanish soccer consulted those who knew best what went wrong – his players .
together they worked out how to put things right .
some saw this as weakness , as deferring to the players .
del bosque knew it was a way to win trust and cement a bond .
it was intelligent , not weak .
a thoughtful man , unafraid to make difficult decisions while he has been accused of being too gentle in the past , del bosque is no push over and is certainly not afraid of making big decisions .
he left out in-form players such as marcus senna , daniel aranzubia and alvarao dominguez from his final squad list and has shown during the tournament that there 's no place for sentiment by benching the misfiring fernando torres for the semi-final defeat of germany .
having had his fair share of dealing with difficult choices in club management , del bosque has handled the national set-up with aplomb .
bildunterschrift : the spain coach has brought in the players he needed to make the existing system operate better del bosque arrived as coach with an envious reputation for success .
as real madrid coach , the former los blancos defender won the champions league twice , la liga twice and the europa league during his four seasons in charge .
his dismissal – for being too docile and not marketable enough to coach the galacticos project – is one of the biggest stains on real madrid 's increasingly tainted record .
despite his long-standing allegiance to real , del bosque is astute enough not to buy into the club rivalries .
he picks the players who fit the system , regardless of their team colours .
find the player for the system , not the other way round del bosque has been forced by necessity to change certain things in the team line-up but he has been keen to point out that his additions are more about evolution than revolution .
fresh legs in the form of the barcelona trio pedro , sergi busquets and gerard pique have been installed to give the system new bite but the coach has n't tampered with anything for the sake of adding a certain player .
the ideal player is found to play a certain position in the system – not the other way round .
now del bosque has the chance to add the world cup to the european title won by his predecessor with a team that knows exactly what it is doing after years of honing a devastating pressing game built around some of the best ball players and passers in the world .
and it did n't take a lot of shouting and swearing .

aragones was , of course , allowed to stay in his job and four years after the scandal , he led spain to the euro 2008 title .
the glory of that achievement , and the belief of his supporters that he was just a ' man of his time , ' glossed over the fact that aragones was seen by many as a difficult , volatile man and an opinionated , abusive coach .
but he got results , and as such , he was tolerated and indulged .
two years on and spain have the chance to claim the ultimate title when they face the netherlands in the final of the 2010 fifa world cup on sunday .
they have lost only two games in the last 55 they 've played and have shown the same confidence and class in south africa as they did in austria and switzerland .
if they win the world cup , it will be an achievement which will put even winning euro 2008 in the shade .
has all this been achieved with a raging , anachronistic coach at the helm ?
has a ' man of his time ' used bullying tactics to take this team to within one game of being crowned champions of the world ?
the answer is of course no .
vicente del bosque , a man and coach infinitely less brash or controversial than his predecessor , has brought spain to the cusp of winning the greatest prize with his mixture of calm advice and fatherly protection .
coach sticks with successful tactics but changes atmosphere del bosque is the polar opposite of the combustible aragones and yet the team has n't suffered from such a radical change at the top .
from the day he took over as coach , he insisted that nothing would change on the pitch .
spain had just enjoyed its finest hour and del bosque knew not to rock the boat by shaking up the system .
he kept the nucleus of the euro 2008 team intact along with aragones ' tactical plan .
it was n't broken , so why fix it ?
bildunterschrift : del bosque recognised that spain did not need rebuilding on the pitch but needed calm off it instead , he changed the approach off the pitch , replacing the haranguing of players with the quiet coaxing which had got the best out of the real madrid teams he had coached in the past .
the result is a happy , comfortable squad in which the potentially damaging barcelona-real madrid split has no place .
if no complaints about del bosque or rumours of feuds among players have leaked from the dressing room it is because there have n't been any .
the players have been made to feel they are partners in the team 's success by del bosque 's inclusive approach .
after weathering the storm of criticism which followed the switzerland defeat in spain 's first game in south africa , the quiet man of spanish soccer consulted those who knew best what went wrong – his players .
together they worked out how to put things right .
some saw this as weakness , as deferring to the players .
del bosque knew it was a way to win trust and cement a bond .
it was intelligent , not weak .
a thoughtful man , unafraid to make difficult decisions while he has been accused of being too gentle in the past , del bosque is no push over and is certainly not afraid of making big decisions .
he left out in-form players such as marcus senna , daniel aranzubia and alvarao dominguez from his final squad list and has shown during the tournament that there 's no place for sentiment by benching the misfiring fernando torres for the semi-final defeat of germany .
having had his fair share of dealing with difficult choices in club management , del bosque has handled the national set-up with aplomb .
bildunterschrift : the spain coach has brought in the players he needed to make the existing system operate better del bosque arrived as coach with an envious reputation for success .
as real madrid coach , the former los blancos defender won the champions league twice , la liga twice and the europa league during his four seasons in charge .
his dismissal – for being too docile and not marketable enough to coach the galacticos project – is one of the biggest stains on real madrid 's increasingly tainted record .
despite his long-standing allegiance to real , del bosque is astute enough not to buy into the club rivalries .
he picks the players who fit the system , regardless of their team colours .
find the player for the system , not the other way round del bosque has been forced by necessity to change certain things in the team line-up but he has been keen to point out that his additions are more about evolution than revolution .
fresh legs in the form of the barcelona trio pedro , sergi busquets and gerard pique have been installed to give the system new bite but the coach has n't tampered with anything for the sake of adding a certain player .
the ideal player is found to play a certain position in the system – not the other way round .
now del bosque has the chance to add the world cup to the european title won by his predecessor with a team that knows exactly what it is doing after years of honing a devastating pressing game built around some of the best ball players and passers in the world .
and it did n't take a lot of shouting and swearing .

vicente del bosque 's team , favorites before the tournament began , confirmed their place at the top of the soccer world , two years after claiming the 2008 european championship .
andres iniesta scored the extra-time goal which secured the prize .
the barcelona midfielder collected a pass from cesc fabregas and fired a right-foot shot that beat maarten stekelenburg in the dutch goal .
the breakthrough came in the 116th minute of the game .
" it 's incredible , " said iniesta after the match .

however , today , many victims of the war crimes have still not been identified . since 2006 , the international committee on missing persons -lrb- icmp -rrb- has used dna analysis to link bone fragments and other organic material buried in bosnia 's mass graves with the dna of potential relatives who have donated their genetic material to be matched up with the victims . qiagen , a german company based in hilden outside dusseldorf in western germany , has developed the technology used for much of the biological and genetic testing . " there are quite a number of difficulties , especially in the extraction of older bones , which have been buried in the ground for years under very adverse conditions , " said scientist mario scherer , who works on samples from bosnia . " the quality of the genetic material in these bones is impaired by chemical and physical agents and processes through decomposition by bacteria very strongly , " he added .
" the aim is to extract the genetic material as cleanly as possible . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : identification brings closure for the victims ' relatives scherer works mostly with his centrifuge , a blue , futuristic-looking cube just larger than a microwave oven .
it sits on scherer 's laboratory bench and he puts his samples inside , where the biological material can be separated after being spun around at high speed . the genetic material is cleaned with so-called pillars , or plastic tubes filled with a material that binds to the genetic molecules and separates them from interfering substances . special precautions initially , qiagen 's scientists thought that their centrifuge would mainly be used to analyze simple dna sources , such as blood samples . but it soon became clear that the blue cube could also read more problematic samples of genetic molecules , even from bones that have been buried for many years . other scientists working in this field agree that special precautions must be taken even from the moment of extraction from the field . " we also must make sure that no additional external contamination is acquired during the process , " said thomas parsons , the director of forensic science at the international commission on missing persons , in a 2006 interview on qiagen 's website . " the small amounts of dna that we are working with can reach the levels of pcr -lrb- detection of polymerase chain reaction -rrb- technology , so it is easy to pick up any exogenous contamination that may be present , " he added . dna identification is crucial bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dna analysis is the only possibility for identifying the victims , say experts parsons ' colleagues from icmp use qiagen 's techniques to extract genetic molecules from bones that have been buried for 15 years . " dna is really the only mode for identification , " said rene huel , the head of the ipmc laboratory in sarajevo .
" other , more traditional ways of identification could not be applied here in this region . " after the war in bosnia , many thousands of people are still unaccounted for .
many bones discovered in mass graves could not initially be identified .
there are hundreds of bags of bones in cold storage , which are still waiting to be examined . huel added that their job is that much harder because the perpetrators have done everything to conceal the extent of war crimes . " you do not have one individual in one grave site , " he said . " you may have one individual in four or five grave sites .
we try to bring back as much of the body as possible .
to bring back the missing person to the family is one of the big challenges we face . " scientists are able to find dna fragments from the pieces of bone buried around bosnia .
then , they can compare that with the results of dna from possible relatives in the region who have agreed to provide blood samples . since work began , the icmp has been able to describe the fate of more than 15,000 missing people .
during the past 12 months alone , 775 more victims have been identified . the scientists have informed their living relatives so that they can be buried on the anniversary of the srebrenica massacre . " hopefully we will have an impact on a greater world , " huel said . " people will realize that these crimes or what they are committing hidden will not be hidden .
this type of dna technology can tell the truth about what has happened . " author : michael lange / cyrus farivar editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but questions still surround the tragedy . some 40,000 people gathered sunday in the bosnian town of srebrenica , where the massacre widely described as europe 's worst atrocity since world war ii occurred 15 years ago .
srebrenica was a un-protected enclave besieged by bosnian serb forces throughout the 1992-95 war .
but un troops there were quickly overrun when the serbs entered the town , rounded up its bosnian muslim population and killed more than 8,000 men and boys .
as part of sunday 's ceremony , 775 recently identified massacre victims in coffins draped in green were interred at the potocari war cemetery , where more than 4,500 are already buried .
several world leaders attended the commemoration ceremony , including us president barack obama , british prime minister david cameron and turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan .
recognizing the international community 's failure to respond to the bloody bosnian war , obama called the massacre " a stain on our collective conscience . "
also at the ceremony was serbian president boris tadic , whose presence many bosnians resented .
serbia has been criticized for its perceived reluctance to capture ratko mladic , the general who led the attack on srebrenica .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un soldiers reinforce defensive positions in sarajevo during the 1992-1995 bosnian war slow search for victims on friday , thousands of people lined the main street of sarajevo as trucks bearing more coffins passed through on the way to srebrenica , some 100 miles to the south-east in eastern bosnia .
in the drina valley , the remains of 8,372 victims of the massacre have been exhumed from 275 mass graves in recent years .
so far 6,557 victims have been identified , and many more murdered muslim civilians are still missing .
the search is slow and tedious , as corpses were tossed into mass graves , often to be dug up again later with bulldozers only to be hastily buried again elsewhere . manfred eisele , an army major general in the german armed forces responsible for planning the un 's peacekeeping operations from 1994 to 1998 , said that 15 years after the srebrenica massacre , it was still difficult to shed light on events . he said he had doubts that those responsible in the un security council had the power or the intention to guarantee the protection of the 40,000 muslim civilians in the srebrenica " safe area . "
' they did n't prevent the drama ' many analysts now place much of the blame for the genocide on the dutch government . fearing for the safety of its 450 soldiers stationed in the area , the dutch government failed to order a un-proposed air attack on serb troops .
the dutch were easily overpowered and the massacre unfolded .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ex-bosnian-serb general ratko mladic is wanted for crimes against humanity german lawyer axel hagedorn , who represents about 8,000 relatives of the victims , is trying to invalidate the un 's immunity before the highest court in the netherlands , as well as the european court of justice .
" the un has a clear responsibility , it should have decided against the dutch , " hagedorn said .
" if the un had to go to court , then it would no longer be possible for the dutch state to blame the un , or the un to blame the dutch state , which is what 's happening now . "
lessons of history the massacre of srebrenica , but also the genocide in rwanda and cambodia , are seen as signs of the un 's failure . the united nations still has not learned its lesson , general eisele said .
" the readiness of states to take responsibility for hard-pressed minorities and also to recognize this protective responsibility is still dramatically underdeveloped , " he said .
" a direct consequence can be seen in the nato deployment … for the kosovo-albanians , who were subjected to massive human rights violations by their own government . "
today , only about three to five percent of the population in srebrenica is muslim , most of them women still searching for relatives .
many families went into exile to canada , new zealand and the united states .

in the drina valley , the remains of 8,372 victims of the massacre have been exhumed from 275 mass graves in recent years .
so far 6,557 victims have been identified , and many more murdered muslim civilians are still missing .
the search is slow and tedious , as corpses were tossed into mass graves , often to be dug up again later with bulldozers only to be hastily buried again elsewhere . manfred eisele , an army major general in the german armed forces responsible for planning the un 's peacekeeping operations from 1994 to 1998 , said that 15 years after the srebrenica massacre , it was still difficult to shed light on events . he said he had doubts that those responsible in the un security council had the power or the intention to guarantee the protection of the 40,000 muslim civilians in the srebrenica " safe area . "
' they did n't prevent the drama ' many analysts now place much of the blame for the genocide on the dutch government . fearing for the safety of its 450 soldiers stationed in the area , the dutch government failed to order a un-proposed air attack on serb troops .
the dutch were easily overpowered and the massacre unfolded .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ex-bosnian-serb general ratko mladic is wanted for crimes against humanity german lawyer axel hagedorn , who represents about 8,000 relatives of the victims , is trying to invalidate the un 's immunity before the highest court in the netherlands , as well as the european court of justice .
" the un has a clear responsibility , it should have decided against the dutch , " hagedorn said .
" if the un had to go to court , then it would no longer be possible for the dutch state to blame the un , or the un to blame the dutch state , which is what 's happening now . "
lessons of history the massacre of srebrenica , but also the genocide in rwanda and cambodia , are seen as signs of the un 's failure . the united nations still has not learned its lesson , general eisele said .
" the readiness of states to take responsibility for hard-pressed minorities and also to recognize this protective responsibility is still dramatically underdeveloped , " he said .
" a direct consequence can be seen in the nato deployment … for the kosovo-albanians , who were subjected to massive human rights violations by their own government . "
today , only about three to five percent of the population in srebrenica is muslim , most of them women still searching for relatives .
many families went into exile to canada , new zealand and the united states .

here , dw ’ s nick amies looks at the key battles which could determine who wins the 2010 world cup . wesley sneijder versus sergio busquets few would dispute that wesley sneijder has been one of the players of the tournament .
the inter milan playmaker has been at the heart of much of holland 's ingenuity and has weighed in with a hugely impressive five goals from his roaming creative role in the midfield .
with mark van bommel and nigel de jong charged with more defensive duties , sneijder will again have the job of driving the dutch on , probing for openings for arjen robben and robin van persie and hitting his own shots from distance .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wesley sneijder will try to bypass spain 's sergio busquets the man whose job it will be to deny sneijder space is sergio busquets .
now barcelona 's first choice defensive midfielder , busquets has already faced off against sneijder in the champions league semi-finals last season and came off second best .
still only 21 , busquets unseated marcos senna from the same role in the spain team and is now the man to patrol ahead of the spanish back four .
he will need to close sneijder down fast , denying him time and space to play in others or shoot , much as he did against mesut oezil and lukas podolski in the semi-final win over germany .
it will not be an easy task but its imperative for spain that he succeeds .
david villa versus joris mathijsen david villa has shown at this world cup why the best teams in europe were all clambering for his signature before the tournament began .
the new barcelona forward has hit five goals on the way to the final and has taken spain 's scoring burden on his shoulders with aplomb .
not the tallest man on the field , villa can still cause problems in the air just by making the effort but his danger lies at his feet .
villa has impeccable timing which , given the quality of the ball-playing midfielders in his team , makes him a deadly striker .
spain like to play across the box and probe for openings and villa is the fox in the box .
it only takes a subtle flick or fast through ball for villa to spring his trap .
precise acceleration means he 's rarely caught offside and with little or no back lift in his shot , he needs very little space to take advantage of an opportunity .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : david villa will have to get past dutch defender joris mathijsen joris mathijsen 's solid performances in south africa have cemented his position as one of holland 's best defenders .
a player who goes about his business with quiet efficiency , mathijsen is a well drilled back who will know all about the threat david villa poses .
much like villa , mathijsen has a low centre of gravity and can turn quickly and accelerate at speed so will be ready to stay with the spain forward should he break .
mathijsen 's performance against uruguay 's diego forlan in the semi-final reduced the striker to long shots .
the dutch will be hoping that mathijsen will frustrate the spanish forward to the same extent – but with a different outcome : forlan scored from distance .
arjen robben versus joan capdevila after laboring a little at the start of the tournament due to an injury picked up in a pre-world cup warm-up game , arjen robben has since shown his most devastating form .
most dangerous when cutting in from the right to aim his lethal left footed shots at goal , robben has turned a number of left-backs inside out over the course of this tournament and shown most of them a clean pair of heels while racing past them .
robben will be allowed to roam at will but will be given the right channel as his own to penetrate , hitting the by-line to deliver crosses or swerving into the area to shoot at goal .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : arjen robben will be looking to torment joan capdevila experienced villareal left-back capdevila will have seen it all before , however , coming up as he did against robben when the dutchman was a real madrid player , but questions remain over whether his aging legs will be able to cope this time around .
capdevila 's head is a wise one though and will use his guile as much as his skill to keep an eye on robben with the more athletic sergio ramos likely to be lurking in support just in case .
robben will not have things all his own way though .
capdevila still possesses enough speed to threaten as an overlapping attacking option and the dutchman may be forced to track back to prevent the spaniard from getting into dangerous positions behind him .
andres iniesta versus nigel de jong it 's no surprise that spain 's return to confidence and competence has coincided with the recovery of andres iniesta from injury .
while xavi hernandez probes , iniesta flits and darts like a dragonfly around his midfield partner , collecting and poking short tactical passes to him before nipping past perplexed defenders .
given a similar brief to wesley sneijder , iniesta ghosts around in front of the back four , ready to play the killer ball to david villa or feint his way into his own goal-scoring position .
germany 's bastian schweinsteiger - who looked imperious until the semi-final - was made to look ordinary by iniesta on wednesday night while sami khedira was constantly pulled out of position by his movement .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tricky andres iniesta faces tough tackling nigel de jong nigel de jong will probably interchange with mark van bommel when it comes to dealing with xavi and iniesta as they approach the dutch back four , but de jong is more likely to get the first bite at iniesta due to his better mobility .
de jong has matured into a more intelligent yet still very combative defensive midfielder after coming under criticism for his often overly-physical game .
he 'll need his wits about him to deal with iniesta but armed as he is now with a fully engaged brain to go with his quick feet , de jong 's defenders will be well protected .
xavi hernandez versus mark van bommel mark van bommel has drawn both praise and jeers for his all-action approach to games at this world cup , drawing widespread criticism for a number of fully committed tackles which have left opponents wincing .
a volatile player who has a reputation for niggly fouls and a fast mouth , van bommel 's temperament has been a source of debate for most of his career .
however , his performances as a whole have been outstanding in south africa and his team 's defensive record has as much to do with his policing of the region in front of the penalty area as it does the actual defensive work of the back four .
facing spain , a team who will spend a lot of time in his neighborhood , means that van bommel will have a busy evening on sunday and he will have to keep his cool under what will be a concerted amount of pressure .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : xavi hernandez goes head-to-head with mark van bommel xavi will be a constant threat to van bommel 's peace .
both he and iniesta will be right in the dutchman 's face , leaving the languid build up behind them to the likes of xabi alonso and busquets .
xavi will bring the ball into van bommel 's zone and look to draw him into either making a rash tackle within striking distance of the goal , or pull him out of position enough to bypass him with threaded passes .
with iniesta buzzing round him and xavi forcing him to chase clipped exchanges , van bommel needs to be disciplined .
xavi 's goal threat has been reduced in recent years but his damage comes from playing people in .
he will hope that the dutch get frustrated by chasing the game before choosing the moment to strike .

xavi 's goal threat has been reduced in recent years but his damage comes from playing people in .
he will hope that the dutch get frustrated by chasing the game before choosing the moment to strike .

the decision came after a legal challenge to the catalan region 's statute of autonomy by the opposition conservative people 's party which favors a unified spain .
the statute of autonomy was approved by catalan voters in a referendum in 2006 .
the statute gave the catalan regional government greater powers in taxation and judicial matters as well as more control over airports , ports and immigration .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police said 1.1 million people attended the rally the court ruled that the term " nation " defining catalonia in the statute had no legal value because " the constitution only knows one nation , spain . "
widespread support saturday 's march in support of the statute of autonomy was led by the socialist leader of the regional government josé montilla .
a huge catalan flag with the slogan " we are a nation , we decide ourselves " was unfurled while the crowd held up thousands of red and yellow catalan banners .
the statute has the support of the vast majority of political parties , trades union and social organizations in catalonia , where a sizeable minority would like to see the wealthy region break away from spain .

but the opposition conservative claim the statute undermined the idea of spain as a unified state .
it was approved by the parliament in madrid in 2006 afer it was endorsed by catalan voters in a referendum .
catalonia is home to around seven million of spain 's population of some 47 million , and accounts for 25 percent of its gross domestic product .

he had an impressive cv but did he have the vision to lead the most potent attacking team on earth ?
on sunday , he leads them into the world cup final . in the hysteria that surrounded spain after they won their first ever trophy at the european championships in 2008 , it was easy to forget one of the more unsavoury chapters of their recent history , given their imperious march to the title in austria and switzerland .
it took place in 2004 when most of the spain team who would go on to become european champions were just starting to come through and show promise .
their coach at the time , luis aragones , allegedly used a racist slur to motivate striker jose antonio reyes to stand up to thierry henry of france .
while the comment itself was deplorable enough , the spanish fa 's reluctance to take action was even more so .
aragones was , of course , allowed to stay in his job and four years after the scandal , he led spain to the euro 2008 title .
the glory of that achievement , and the belief of his supporters that he was just a ' man of his time , ' glossed over the fact that aragones was seen by many as a difficult , volatile man and an opinionated , abusive coach .
but he got results , and as such , he was tolerated and indulged .
two years on and spain have the chance to claim the ultimate title when they face the netherlands in the final of the 2010 fifa world cup on sunday .
they have lost only two games in the last 55 they 've played and have shown the same confidence and class in south africa as they did in austria and switzerland .
if they win the world cup , it will be an achievement which will put even winning euro 2008 in the shade .
has all this been achieved with a raging , anachronistic coach at the helm ?
has a ' man of his time ' used bullying tactics to take this team to within one game of being crowned champions of the world ?
the answer is of course no .
vicente del bosque , a man and coach infinitely less brash or controversial than his predecessor , has brought spain to the cusp of winning the greatest prize with his mixture of calm advice and fatherly protection .
coach sticks with successful tactics but changes atmosphere del bosque is the polar opposite of the combustible aragones and yet the team has n't suffered from such a radical change at the top .
from the day he took over as coach , he insisted that nothing would change on the pitch .
spain had just enjoyed its finest hour and del bosque knew not to rock the boat by shaking up the system .
he kept the nucleus of the euro 2008 team intact along with aragones ' tactical plan .
it was n't broken , so why fix it ?
bildunterschrift : del bosque recognised that spain did not need rebuilding on the pitch but needed calm off it instead , he changed the approach off the pitch , replacing the haranguing of players with the quiet coaxing which had got the best out of the real madrid teams he had coached in the past .
the result is a happy , comfortable squad in which the potentially damaging barcelona-real madrid split has no place .
if no complaints about del bosque or rumours of feuds among players have leaked from the dressing room it is because there have n't been any .
the players have been made to feel they are partners in the team 's success by del bosque 's inclusive approach .
after weathering the storm of criticism which followed the switzerland defeat in spain 's first game in south africa , the quiet man of spanish soccer consulted those who knew best what went wrong – his players .
together they worked out how to put things right .
some saw this as weakness , as deferring to the players .
del bosque knew it was a way to win trust and cement a bond .
it was intelligent , not weak .
a thoughtful man , unafraid to make difficult decisions while he has been accused of being too gentle in the past , del bosque is no push over and is certainly not afraid of making big decisions .
he left out in-form players such as marcus senna , daniel aranzubia and alvarao dominguez from his final squad list and has shown during the tournament that there 's no place for sentiment by benching the misfiring fernando torres for the semi-final defeat of germany .
having had his fair share of dealing with difficult choices in club management , del bosque has handled the national set-up with aplomb .
bildunterschrift : the spain coach has brought in the players he needed to make the existing system operate better del bosque arrived as coach with an envious reputation for success .
as real madrid coach , the former los blancos defender won the champions league twice , la liga twice and the europa league during his four seasons in charge .
his dismissal – for being too docile and not marketable enough to coach the galacticos project – is one of the biggest stains on real madrid 's increasingly tainted record .
despite his long-standing allegiance to real , del bosque is astute enough not to buy into the club rivalries .
he picks the players who fit the system , regardless of their team colours .
find the player for the system , not the other way round del bosque has been forced by necessity to change certain things in the team line-up but he has been keen to point out that his additions are more about evolution than revolution .
fresh legs in the form of the barcelona trio pedro , sergi busquets and gerard pique have been installed to give the system new bite but the coach has n't tampered with anything for the sake of adding a certain player .
the ideal player is found to play a certain position in the system – not the other way round .
now del bosque has the chance to add the world cup to the european title won by his predecessor with a team that knows exactly what it is doing after years of honing a devastating pressing game built around some of the best ball players and passers in the world .
and it did n't take a lot of shouting and swearing .

spain beat the netherlands 1-0 , with the barcelona man netting late in extra-time , after 90 minutes failed to produce a goal . spain has won its first world cup , overcoming the netherlands at soccer city stadium , johannesburg .
vicente del bosque 's team , favorites before the tournament began , confirmed their place at the top of the soccer world , two years after claiming the 2008 european championship .
andres iniesta scored the extra-time goal which secured the prize .
the barcelona midfielder collected a pass from cesc fabregas and fired a right-foot shot that beat maarten stekelenburg in the dutch goal .
the breakthrough came in the 116th minute of the game .
" it 's incredible , " said iniesta after the match .
" there are n't the words to describe what i am feeling . "
bildunterschrift : iniesta scored after receiving a pass from fabregas deep into extra time the game only really came alive in extra time , after an uninspiring first 90 minutes in which the referee was often at the center of attention . twelve players were shown yellow , while dutch defender johnny heitinga saw red with ten minutes of extra time remaining .
heitinga pulled iniesta back on the edge of the box , and howard webb gave him his marching orders .
both sides had chances to win it in the added 30 minutes .
spanish substitute cesc fabregas could n't provide the finish when one-on-one , while joris mathijsen headed a corner over the bar from inside the six yard box at the other end .
spain were marginally the better team in normal time , although the netherlands had the best opening . arjen robben was played through by wesley sneijder and , one-on-one with iker casillas , could only hit his shot against the goalkeeper 's foot .
the bayern winger 's pace continued to cause the spanish defense problems , as the netherlands played on the counter attack .
spain tried to play their brand of intricate football , but were not at their fluid best .
dangerman david villa thought he had grabbed the lead mid-way through the second half .
his close-range shot was somehow deflected over the bar by heitinga .
spanish right-back sergio ramos also got himself in promising positions , only to fluff his lines .
he did well to get his head on a fifth-minute corner and draw a full-length save from stekelenburg .
but ramos should have done better with a second-half effort , heading over when unmarked six yards out .
the netherlands arguably should have been down to ten men in the first half .
dutch midfielder nigel de jong led with his studs when trying to win a bouncing ball and karate-kicked xabi alonso high in the chest .
the referee only showed yellow . bildunterschrift : de jong 's challenge was verging on assault spanish coach vincente del bosque admitted that his side had been in difficulty at times .
" it was a hard game .
we started well and then they had chances in the second half .
but after that i believed we were slightly superior . " dutch coach bert van marwijk took the defeat with grace , but could not hide his disappointment .
" the best team won .
i am disappointed .
it is a world championship and we have just lost a final . " del bosque again left striker fernando torres out of his starting 11 , preferring barcelona winger pedro , in the same team that started the semifinal win over germany .
torres came on late in extra time , but quickly pulled up injured . the netherlands made two changes to its line-up .
midfielder nigel de jong and right back gregory van der wiel returned to the team after missing the semifinal triumph against uruguay due to suspension . spain were co-favourites before the tournament , but lost their opening game to switzerland .
they got things together to qualify from group h , and have won each of their knockout games just 1-0 . third defeat in finals while spain was playing in its first final , the netherlands have now lost the three world cup finals they have competed in .
the oranje were runners-up in 1974 and 1978 .
bert van marwijk 's team knocked out knocked out brazil in the quarterfinal , and scored double the number of goals spain had before this evening . spain became the first european team to win a world cup held outside europe . an estimated 700 million people were watching the game on television around the globe .
however , the stadium itself was about 10,000 people short of being full .
fans were lucky enough to catch a glimpse of former president nelson mandela , who had to miss the opening ceremonies on june 11 after his great-granddaughter died in a car accident .
the icon of south african democracy was driven onto the field in a golf cart .

we 're proud of you !
that 's what we want to say to our national team .
third place in the world cup is a well-deserved reward for their fantastic performance this time round .
they 've created unforgettable moments .
in years to come we 'll still be saying : do you remember the round of sixteen match against england in south africa 2010 ? that disallowed goal for the english , and the subsequent 4-1 thrashing by our team .
do you remember the quarterfinal against argentina ?
when thomas mueller , bastian schweinsteiger and mesut oezil pulverized the " gauchos " ' defense and sent the pre-match favourites packing with a resounding 4-0 victory ?
from nobodies to stars let 's be honest , who really thought that this young team would create such memorable highlights ?
the german team is now being celebrated across the world for their inspirational offensive football .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche welle 's stefan nestler is dazzled by the german side talented players , who not so long ago were playing for the german football association 's junior team , whom no-one had even heard of abroad , hammered the world 's best into disarray .
international sports reporters became familiar with how to pronounce the names of the german players – and were full of respect for germany 's new football flair .
it was n't only fans at home who were upset when the team met their match in the semi finals against spain .
football fans from across the world reported that they were sorry that this amazing german side had n't made it into the final .
time to perfect their game we do n't need to grieve for what could have been .
this team belongs to the future .
thomas mueller , the biggest discovery of this world cup , is 20 years old , mesut oezil is 21 , sami khedira , 23 .
and even leading players like bastian schweinsteiger or the captain , philipp lahm , are only in their mid twenties .
they can play together for a few more years yet , and have time to perfect their game further .
and other talents are following on behind .
the seeds sown by the german football association in training young players are bearing fruit . above all , the pool of young players , trained to first-class standards , technically and tactically , promises a golden future for german football .
national team coach , joachim loew , should be praised for his part in this success story , in which he has personally played a major hand .
he must be eager to carry on as well .
in this instance , the german football association would be well-advised to hold onto him .
they should follow the motto : never change a winning team !
even if it never quite hit the jackpot .

here , dw ’ s nick amies looks at the key battles which could determine who wins the 2010 world cup . wesley sneijder versus sergio busquets few would dispute that wesley sneijder has been one of the players of the tournament .
the inter milan playmaker has been at the heart of much of holland 's ingenuity and has weighed in with a hugely impressive five goals from his roaming creative role in the midfield .
with mark van bommel and nigel de jong charged with more defensive duties , sneijder will again have the job of driving the dutch on , probing for openings for arjen robben and robin van persie and hitting his own shots from distance .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wesley sneijder will try to bypass spain 's sergio busquets the man whose job it will be to deny sneijder space is sergio busquets .
now barcelona 's first choice defensive midfielder , busquets has already faced off against sneijder in the champions league semi-finals last season and came off second best .
still only 21 , busquets unseated marcos senna from the same role in the spain team and is now the man to patrol ahead of the spanish back four .
he will need to close sneijder down fast , denying him time and space to play in others or shoot , much as he did against mesut oezil and lukas podolski in the semi-final win over germany .
it will not be an easy task but its imperative for spain that he succeeds .
david villa versus joris mathijsen david villa has shown at this world cup why the best teams in europe were all clambering for his signature before the tournament began .
the new barcelona forward has hit five goals on the way to the final and has taken spain 's scoring burden on his shoulders with aplomb .
not the tallest man on the field , villa can still cause problems in the air just by making the effort but his danger lies at his feet .
villa has impeccable timing which , given the quality of the ball-playing midfielders in his team , makes him a deadly striker .
spain like to play across the box and probe for openings and villa is the fox in the box .
it only takes a subtle flick or fast through ball for villa to spring his trap .
precise acceleration means he 's rarely caught offside and with little or no back lift in his shot , he needs very little space to take advantage of an opportunity .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : david villa will have to get past dutch defender joris mathijsen joris mathijsen 's solid performances in south africa have cemented his position as one of holland 's best defenders .
a player who goes about his business with quiet efficiency , mathijsen is a well drilled back who will know all about the threat david villa poses .
much like villa , mathijsen has a low centre of gravity and can turn quickly and accelerate at speed so will be ready to stay with the spain forward should he break .
mathijsen 's performance against uruguay 's diego forlan in the semi-final reduced the striker to long shots .
the dutch will be hoping that mathijsen will frustrate the spanish forward to the same extent – but with a different outcome : forlan scored from distance .
arjen robben versus joan capdevila after laboring a little at the start of the tournament due to an injury picked up in a pre-world cup warm-up game , arjen robben has since shown his most devastating form .
most dangerous when cutting in from the right to aim his lethal left footed shots at goal , robben has turned a number of left-backs inside out over the course of this tournament and shown most of them a clean pair of heels while racing past them .
robben will be allowed to roam at will but will be given the right channel as his own to penetrate , hitting the by-line to deliver crosses or swerving into the area to shoot at goal .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : arjen robben will be looking to torment joan capdevila experienced villareal left-back capdevila will have seen it all before , however , coming up as he did against robben when the dutchman was a real madrid player , but questions remain over whether his aging legs will be able to cope this time around .
capdevila 's head is a wise one though and will use his guile as much as his skill to keep an eye on robben with the more athletic sergio ramos likely to be lurking in support just in case .
robben will not have things all his own way though .
capdevila still possesses enough speed to threaten as an overlapping attacking option and the dutchman may be forced to track back to prevent the spaniard from getting into dangerous positions behind him .
andres iniesta versus nigel de jong it 's no surprise that spain 's return to confidence and competence has coincided with the recovery of andres iniesta from injury .
while xavi hernandez probes , iniesta flits and darts like a dragonfly around his midfield partner , collecting and poking short tactical passes to him before nipping past perplexed defenders .
given a similar brief to wesley sneijder , iniesta ghosts around in front of the back four , ready to play the killer ball to david villa or feint his way into his own goal-scoring position .
germany 's bastian schweinsteiger - who looked imperious until the semi-final - was made to look ordinary by iniesta on wednesday night while sami khedira was constantly pulled out of position by his movement .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tricky andres iniesta faces tough tackling nigel de jong nigel de jong will probably interchange with mark van bommel when it comes to dealing with xavi and iniesta as they approach the dutch back four , but de jong is more likely to get the first bite at iniesta due to his better mobility .
de jong has matured into a more intelligent yet still very combative defensive midfielder after coming under criticism for his often overly-physical game .
he 'll need his wits about him to deal with iniesta but armed as he is now with a fully engaged brain to go with his quick feet , de jong 's defenders will be well protected .
xavi hernandez versus mark van bommel mark van bommel has drawn both praise and jeers for his all-action approach to games at this world cup , drawing widespread criticism for a number of fully committed tackles which have left opponents wincing .
a volatile player who has a reputation for niggly fouls and a fast mouth , van bommel 's temperament has been a source of debate for most of his career .
however , his performances as a whole have been outstanding in south africa and his team 's defensive record has as much to do with his policing of the region in front of the penalty area as it does the actual defensive work of the back four .
facing spain , a team who will spend a lot of time in his neighborhood , means that van bommel will have a busy evening on sunday and he will have to keep his cool under what will be a concerted amount of pressure .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : xavi hernandez goes head-to-head with mark van bommel xavi will be a constant threat to van bommel 's peace .
both he and iniesta will be right in the dutchman 's face , leaving the languid build up behind them to the likes of xabi alonso and busquets .
xavi will bring the ball into van bommel 's zone and look to draw him into either making a rash tackle within striking distance of the goal , or pull him out of position enough to bypass him with threaded passes .
with iniesta buzzing round him and xavi forcing him to chase clipped exchanges , van bommel needs to be disciplined .
xavi 's goal threat has been reduced in recent years but his damage comes from playing people in .
he will hope that the dutch get frustrated by chasing the game before choosing the moment to strike .

here , dw ’ s nick amies looks at the key battles which could determine who wins the 2010 world cup . wesley sneijder versus sergio busquets few would dispute that wesley sneijder has been one of the players of the tournament .
the inter milan playmaker has been at the heart of much of holland 's ingenuity and has weighed in with a hugely impressive five goals from his roaming creative role in the midfield .
with mark van bommel and nigel de jong charged with more defensive duties , sneijder will again have the job of driving the dutch on , probing for openings for arjen robben and robin van persie and hitting his own shots from distance .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wesley sneijder will try to bypass spain 's sergio busquets the man whose job it will be to deny sneijder space is sergio busquets .
now barcelona 's first choice defensive midfielder , busquets has already faced off against sneijder in the champions league semi-finals last season and came off second best .
still only 21 , busquets unseated marcos senna from the same role in the spain team and is now the man to patrol ahead of the spanish back four .
he will need to close sneijder down fast , denying him time and space to play in others or shoot , much as he did against mesut oezil and lukas podolski in the semi-final win over germany .
it will not be an easy task but its imperative for spain that he succeeds .
david villa versus joris mathijsen david villa has shown at this world cup why the best teams in europe were all clambering for his signature before the tournament began .
the new barcelona forward has hit five goals on the way to the final and has taken spain 's scoring burden on his shoulders with aplomb .
not the tallest man on the field , villa can still cause problems in the air just by making the effort but his danger lies at his feet .
villa has impeccable timing which , given the quality of the ball-playing midfielders in his team , makes him a deadly striker .
spain like to play across the box and probe for openings and villa is the fox in the box .
it only takes a subtle flick or fast through ball for villa to spring his trap .
precise acceleration means he 's rarely caught offside and with little or no back lift in his shot , he needs very little space to take advantage of an opportunity .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : david villa will have to get past dutch defender joris mathijsen joris mathijsen 's solid performances in south africa have cemented his position as one of holland 's best defenders .
a player who goes about his business with quiet efficiency , mathijsen is a well drilled back who will know all about the threat david villa poses .
much like villa , mathijsen has a low centre of gravity and can turn quickly and accelerate at speed so will be ready to stay with the spain forward should he break .
mathijsen 's performance against uruguay 's diego forlan in the semi-final reduced the striker to long shots .
the dutch will be hoping that mathijsen will frustrate the spanish forward to the same extent – but with a different outcome : forlan scored from distance .
arjen robben versus joan capdevila after laboring a little at the start of the tournament due to an injury picked up in a pre-world cup warm-up game , arjen robben has since shown his most devastating form .
most dangerous when cutting in from the right to aim his lethal left footed shots at goal , robben has turned a number of left-backs inside out over the course of this tournament and shown most of them a clean pair of heels while racing past them .
robben will be allowed to roam at will but will be given the right channel as his own to penetrate , hitting the by-line to deliver crosses or swerving into the area to shoot at goal .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : arjen robben will be looking to torment joan capdevila experienced villareal left-back capdevila will have seen it all before , however , coming up as he did against robben when the dutchman was a real madrid player , but questions remain over whether his aging legs will be able to cope this time around .
capdevila 's head is a wise one though and will use his guile as much as his skill to keep an eye on robben with the more athletic sergio ramos likely to be lurking in support just in case .
robben will not have things all his own way though .
capdevila still possesses enough speed to threaten as an overlapping attacking option and the dutchman may be forced to track back to prevent the spaniard from getting into dangerous positions behind him .
andres iniesta versus nigel de jong it 's no surprise that spain 's return to confidence and competence has coincided with the recovery of andres iniesta from injury .
while xavi hernandez probes , iniesta flits and darts like a dragonfly around his midfield partner , collecting and poking short tactical passes to him before nipping past perplexed defenders .
given a similar brief to wesley sneijder , iniesta ghosts around in front of the back four , ready to play the killer ball to david villa or feint his way into his own goal-scoring position .
germany 's bastian schweinsteiger - who looked imperious until the semi-final - was made to look ordinary by iniesta on wednesday night while sami khedira was constantly pulled out of position by his movement .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tricky andres iniesta faces tough tackling nigel de jong nigel de jong will probably interchange with mark van bommel when it comes to dealing with xavi and iniesta as they approach the dutch back four , but de jong is more likely to get the first bite at iniesta due to his better mobility .
de jong has matured into a more intelligent yet still very combative defensive midfielder after coming under criticism for his often overly-physical game .
he 'll need his wits about him to deal with iniesta but armed as he is now with a fully engaged brain to go with his quick feet , de jong 's defenders will be well protected .
xavi hernandez versus mark van bommel mark van bommel has drawn both praise and jeers for his all-action approach to games at this world cup , drawing widespread criticism for a number of fully committed tackles which have left opponents wincing .
a volatile player who has a reputation for niggly fouls and a fast mouth , van bommel 's temperament has been a source of debate for most of his career .
however , his performances as a whole have been outstanding in south africa and his team 's defensive record has as much to do with his policing of the region in front of the penalty area as it does the actual defensive work of the back four .
facing spain , a team who will spend a lot of time in his neighborhood , means that van bommel will have a busy evening on sunday and he will have to keep his cool under what will be a concerted amount of pressure .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : xavi hernandez goes head-to-head with mark van bommel xavi will be a constant threat to van bommel 's peace .
both he and iniesta will be right in the dutchman 's face , leaving the languid build up behind them to the likes of xabi alonso and busquets .
xavi will bring the ball into van bommel 's zone and look to draw him into either making a rash tackle within striking distance of the goal , or pull him out of position enough to bypass him with threaded passes .
with iniesta buzzing round him and xavi forcing him to chase clipped exchanges , van bommel needs to be disciplined .
xavi 's goal threat has been reduced in recent years but his damage comes from playing people in .
he will hope that the dutch get frustrated by chasing the game before choosing the moment to strike .

here , dw ’ s nick amies looks at the key battles which could determine who wins the 2010 world cup . wesley sneijder versus sergio busquets few would dispute that wesley sneijder has been one of the players of the tournament .
the inter milan playmaker has been at the heart of much of holland 's ingenuity and has weighed in with a hugely impressive five goals from his roaming creative role in the midfield .
with mark van bommel and nigel de jong charged with more defensive duties , sneijder will again have the job of driving the dutch on , probing for openings for arjen robben and robin van persie and hitting his own shots from distance .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wesley sneijder will try to bypass spain 's sergio busquets the man whose job it will be to deny sneijder space is sergio busquets .
now barcelona 's first choice defensive midfielder , busquets has already faced off against sneijder in the champions league semi-finals last season and came off second best .
still only 21 , busquets unseated marcos senna from the same role in the spain team and is now the man to patrol ahead of the spanish back four .
he will need to close sneijder down fast , denying him time and space to play in others or shoot , much as he did against mesut oezil and lukas podolski in the semi-final win over germany .
it will not be an easy task but its imperative for spain that he succeeds .
david villa versus joris mathijsen david villa has shown at this world cup why the best teams in europe were all clambering for his signature before the tournament began .
the new barcelona forward has hit five goals on the way to the final and has taken spain 's scoring burden on his shoulders with aplomb .
not the tallest man on the field , villa can still cause problems in the air just by making the effort but his danger lies at his feet .
villa has impeccable timing which , given the quality of the ball-playing midfielders in his team , makes him a deadly striker .
spain like to play across the box and probe for openings and villa is the fox in the box .
it only takes a subtle flick or fast through ball for villa to spring his trap .
precise acceleration means he 's rarely caught offside and with little or no back lift in his shot , he needs very little space to take advantage of an opportunity .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : david villa will have to get past dutch defender joris mathijsen joris mathijsen 's solid performances in south africa have cemented his position as one of holland 's best defenders .
a player who goes about his business with quiet efficiency , mathijsen is a well drilled back who will know all about the threat david villa poses .
much like villa , mathijsen has a low centre of gravity and can turn quickly and accelerate at speed so will be ready to stay with the spain forward should he break .
mathijsen 's performance against uruguay 's diego forlan in the semi-final reduced the striker to long shots .
the dutch will be hoping that mathijsen will frustrate the spanish forward to the same extent – but with a different outcome : forlan scored from distance .
arjen robben versus joan capdevila after laboring a little at the start of the tournament due to an injury picked up in a pre-world cup warm-up game , arjen robben has since shown his most devastating form .
most dangerous when cutting in from the right to aim his lethal left footed shots at goal , robben has turned a number of left-backs inside out over the course of this tournament and shown most of them a clean pair of heels while racing past them .
robben will be allowed to roam at will but will be given the right channel as his own to penetrate , hitting the by-line to deliver crosses or swerving into the area to shoot at goal .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : arjen robben will be looking to torment joan capdevila experienced villareal left-back capdevila will have seen it all before , however , coming up as he did against robben when the dutchman was a real madrid player , but questions remain over whether his aging legs will be able to cope this time around .
capdevila 's head is a wise one though and will use his guile as much as his skill to keep an eye on robben with the more athletic sergio ramos likely to be lurking in support just in case .
robben will not have things all his own way though .
capdevila still possesses enough speed to threaten as an overlapping attacking option and the dutchman may be forced to track back to prevent the spaniard from getting into dangerous positions behind him .
andres iniesta versus nigel de jong it 's no surprise that spain 's return to confidence and competence has coincided with the recovery of andres iniesta from injury .
while xavi hernandez probes , iniesta flits and darts like a dragonfly around his midfield partner , collecting and poking short tactical passes to him before nipping past perplexed defenders .
given a similar brief to wesley sneijder , iniesta ghosts around in front of the back four , ready to play the killer ball to david villa or feint his way into his own goal-scoring position .
germany 's bastian schweinsteiger - who looked imperious until the semi-final - was made to look ordinary by iniesta on wednesday night while sami khedira was constantly pulled out of position by his movement .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tricky andres iniesta faces tough tackling nigel de jong nigel de jong will probably interchange with mark van bommel when it comes to dealing with xavi and iniesta as they approach the dutch back four , but de jong is more likely to get the first bite at iniesta due to his better mobility .
de jong has matured into a more intelligent yet still very combative defensive midfielder after coming under criticism for his often overly-physical game .
he 'll need his wits about him to deal with iniesta but armed as he is now with a fully engaged brain to go with his quick feet , de jong 's defenders will be well protected .
xavi hernandez versus mark van bommel mark van bommel has drawn both praise and jeers for his all-action approach to games at this world cup , drawing widespread criticism for a number of fully committed tackles which have left opponents wincing .
a volatile player who has a reputation for niggly fouls and a fast mouth , van bommel 's temperament has been a source of debate for most of his career .
however , his performances as a whole have been outstanding in south africa and his team 's defensive record has as much to do with his policing of the region in front of the penalty area as it does the actual defensive work of the back four .
facing spain , a team who will spend a lot of time in his neighborhood , means that van bommel will have a busy evening on sunday and he will have to keep his cool under what will be a concerted amount of pressure .

the " amalthea , " commissioned by a libyan charity , will not attempt to break the israeli blockade . a ship , loaded with humanitarian aid destined for palestinians in the gaza strip , has set sail from greece for the egyptian port of el-arish .
following intense diplomatic pressure from israel , the ship , which has been chartered by a libyan charity , will not attempt to break through the israeli blockade .
israeli defense minister ehud barak called the libyan aid vessel 's planned journey an " unnecessary provocation . "
the aid shipment will be transported overland from el-arish to the palestinian enclave in the hamas-controlled gaza strip .
greek radio said there were 27 people on board the " amalthea , " including 13 libyan activists , a nigerian and a syrian national .
the moldavian-flagged , greek-owned cargo ship left from lavrio on saturday afternoon carrying 2,000 tons of food and medical aid supplied by the gaddafi international charity and development association .
the charity is headed by saif al-islam gaddafi , a son of the libyan leader .
the vessel was originally scheduled to sail directly to the gaza strip , but greek diplomatic sources in athens confirmed it would travel instead to el-arish following diplomatic talks between greek deputy foreign minister dimitris droutsas and israeli foreign minister avigdor lieberman .
at the end of may , an international gaza flotilla tried to break through the israeli blockade .
nine people were killed , mainly turkish nationals , when the israeli military intercepted and used force to seize control of the ship .
following widespread international condemnation israel finally agreed to relax the blockade .

the " amalthea , " commissioned by a libyan charity , will not attempt to break the israeli blockade . a ship , loaded with humanitarian aid destined for palestinians in the gaza strip , has set sail from greece for the egyptian port of el-arish .
following intense diplomatic pressure from israel , the ship , which has been chartered by a libyan charity , will not attempt to break through the israeli blockade .
israeli defense minister ehud barak called the libyan aid vessel 's planned journey an " unnecessary provocation . "
the aid shipment will be transported overland from el-arish to the palestinian enclave in the hamas-controlled gaza strip .
greek radio said there were 27 people on board the " amalthea , " including 13 libyan activists , a nigerian and a syrian national .
the moldavian-flagged , greek-owned cargo ship left from lavrio on saturday afternoon carrying 2,000 tons of food and medical aid supplied by the gaddafi international charity and development association .
the charity is headed by saif al-islam gaddafi , a son of the libyan leader .
the vessel was originally scheduled to sail directly to the gaza strip , but greek diplomatic sources in athens confirmed it would travel instead to el-arish following diplomatic talks between greek deputy foreign minister dimitris droutsas and israeli foreign minister avigdor lieberman .
at the end of may , an international gaza flotilla tried to break through the israeli blockade .
nine people were killed , mainly turkish nationals , when the israeli military intercepted and used force to seize control of the ship .
following widespread international condemnation israel finally agreed to relax the blockade .

the decision came after a legal challenge to the catalan region 's statute of autonomy by the opposition conservative people 's party which favors a unified spain .

a huge catalan flag with the slogan " we are a nation , we decide ourselves " was unfurled while the crowd held up thousands of red and yellow catalan banners .
the statute has the support of the vast majority of political parties , trades union and social organizations in catalonia , where a sizeable minority would like to see the wealthy region break away from spain .

it was approved by the parliament in madrid in 2006 afer it was endorsed by catalan voters in a referendum .
catalonia is home to around seven million of spain 's population of some 47 million , and accounts for 25 percent of its gross domestic product .

the " amalthea , " commissioned by a libyan charity , will not attempt to break the israeli blockade . a ship , loaded with humanitarian aid destined for palestinians in the gaza strip , has set sail from greece for the egyptian port of el-arish .
following intense diplomatic pressure from israel , the ship , which has been chartered by a libyan charity , will not attempt to break through the israeli blockade .
israeli defense minister ehud barak called the libyan aid vessel 's planned journey an " unnecessary provocation . "
the aid shipment will be transported overland from el-arish to the palestinian enclave in the hamas-controlled gaza strip .
greek radio said there were 27 people on board the " amalthea , " including 13 libyan activists , a nigerian and a syrian national .
the moldavian-flagged , greek-owned cargo ship left from lavrio on saturday afternoon carrying 2,000 tons of food and medical aid supplied by the gaddafi international charity and development association .
the charity is headed by saif al-islam gaddafi , a son of the libyan leader .
the vessel was originally scheduled to sail directly to the gaza strip , but greek diplomatic sources in athens confirmed it would travel instead to el-arish following diplomatic talks between greek deputy foreign minister dimitris droutsas and israeli foreign minister avigdor lieberman .
at the end of may , an international gaza flotilla tried to break through the israeli blockade .
nine people were killed , mainly turkish nationals , when the israeli military intercepted and used force to seize control of the ship .
following widespread international condemnation israel finally agreed to relax the blockade .

he had an impressive cv but did he have the vision to lead the most potent attacking team on earth ?
on sunday , he leads them into the world cup final . in the hysteria that surrounded spain after they won their first ever trophy at the european championships in 2008 , it was easy to forget one of the more unsavoury chapters of their recent history , given their imperious march to the title in austria and switzerland .
it took place in 2004 when most of the spain team who would go on to become european champions were just starting to come through and show promise .
their coach at the time , luis aragones , allegedly used a racist slur to motivate striker jose antonio reyes to stand up to thierry henry of france .
while the comment itself was deplorable enough , the spanish fa 's reluctance to take action was even more so .
aragones was , of course , allowed to stay in his job and four years after the scandal , he led spain to the euro 2008 title .
the glory of that achievement , and the belief of his supporters that he was just a ' man of his time , ' glossed over the fact that aragones was seen by many as a difficult , volatile man and an opinionated , abusive coach .
but he got results , and as such , he was tolerated and indulged .
two years on and spain have the chance to claim the ultimate title when they face the netherlands in the final of the 2010 fifa world cup on sunday .
they have lost only two games in the last 55 they 've played and have shown the same confidence and class in south africa as they did in austria and switzerland .
if they win the world cup , it will be an achievement which will put even winning euro 2008 in the shade .
has all this been achieved with a raging , anachronistic coach at the helm ?
has a ' man of his time ' used bullying tactics to take this team to within one game of being crowned champions of the world ?
the answer is of course no .
vicente del bosque , a man and coach infinitely less brash or controversial than his predecessor , has brought spain to the cusp of winning the greatest prize with his mixture of calm advice and fatherly protection .
coach sticks with successful tactics but changes atmosphere del bosque is the polar opposite of the combustible aragones and yet the team has n't suffered from such a radical change at the top .
from the day he took over as coach , he insisted that nothing would change on the pitch .
spain had just enjoyed its finest hour and del bosque knew not to rock the boat by shaking up the system .
he kept the nucleus of the euro 2008 team intact along with aragones ' tactical plan .
it was n't broken , so why fix it ?
bildunterschrift : del bosque recognised that spain did not need rebuilding on the pitch but needed calm off it instead , he changed the approach off the pitch , replacing the haranguing of players with the quiet coaxing which had got the best out of the real madrid teams he had coached in the past .
the result is a happy , comfortable squad in which the potentially damaging barcelona-real madrid split has no place .
if no complaints about del bosque or rumours of feuds among players have leaked from the dressing room it is because there have n't been any .
the players have been made to feel they are partners in the team 's success by del bosque 's inclusive approach .
after weathering the storm of criticism which followed the switzerland defeat in spain 's first game in south africa , the quiet man of spanish soccer consulted those who knew best what went wrong – his players .
together they worked out how to put things right .
some saw this as weakness , as deferring to the players .
del bosque knew it was a way to win trust and cement a bond .
it was intelligent , not weak .
a thoughtful man , unafraid to make difficult decisions while he has been accused of being too gentle in the past , del bosque is no push over and is certainly not afraid of making big decisions .
he left out in-form players such as marcus senna , daniel aranzubia and alvarao dominguez from his final squad list and has shown during the tournament that there 's no place for sentiment by benching the misfiring fernando torres for the semi-final defeat of germany .
having had his fair share of dealing with difficult choices in club management , del bosque has handled the national set-up with aplomb .
bildunterschrift : the spain coach has brought in the players he needed to make the existing system operate better del bosque arrived as coach with an envious reputation for success .
as real madrid coach , the former los blancos defender won the champions league twice , la liga twice and the europa league during his four seasons in charge .
his dismissal – for being too docile and not marketable enough to coach the galacticos project – is one of the biggest stains on real madrid 's increasingly tainted record .
despite his long-standing allegiance to real , del bosque is astute enough not to buy into the club rivalries .
he picks the players who fit the system , regardless of their team colours .
find the player for the system , not the other way round del bosque has been forced by necessity to change certain things in the team line-up but he has been keen to point out that his additions are more about evolution than revolution .
fresh legs in the form of the barcelona trio pedro , sergi busquets and gerard pique have been installed to give the system new bite but the coach has n't tampered with anything for the sake of adding a certain player .
the ideal player is found to play a certain position in the system – not the other way round .
now del bosque has the chance to add the world cup to the european title won by his predecessor with a team that knows exactly what it is doing after years of honing a devastating pressing game built around some of the best ball players and passers in the world .
and it did n't take a lot of shouting and swearing .

we 're proud of you !
that 's what we want to say to our national team .
third place in the world cup is a well-deserved reward for their fantastic performance this time round .
they 've created unforgettable moments .
in years to come we 'll still be saying : do you remember the round of sixteen match against england in south africa 2010 ? that disallowed goal for the english , and the subsequent 4-1 thrashing by our team .
do you remember the quarterfinal against argentina ?
when thomas mueller , bastian schweinsteiger and mesut oezil pulverized the " gauchos " ' defense and sent the pre-match favourites packing with a resounding 4-0 victory ?
from nobodies to stars let 's be honest , who really thought that this young team would create such memorable highlights ?
the german team is now being celebrated across the world for their inspirational offensive football .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche welle 's stefan nestler is dazzled by the german side talented players , who not so long ago were playing for the german football association 's junior team , whom no-one had even heard of abroad , hammered the world 's best into disarray .
international sports reporters became familiar with how to pronounce the names of the german players – and were full of respect for germany 's new football flair .
it was n't only fans at home who were upset when the team met their match in the semi finals against spain .
football fans from across the world reported that they were sorry that this amazing german side had n't made it into the final .
time to perfect their game we do n't need to grieve for what could have been .
this team belongs to the future .
thomas mueller , the biggest discovery of this world cup , is 20 years old , mesut oezil is 21 , sami khedira , 23 .
and even leading players like bastian schweinsteiger or the captain , philipp lahm , are only in their mid twenties .
they can play together for a few more years yet , and have time to perfect their game further .
and other talents are following on behind .
the seeds sown by the german football association in training young players are bearing fruit . above all , the pool of young players , trained to first-class standards , technically and tactically , promises a golden future for german football .
national team coach , joachim loew , should be praised for his part in this success story , in which he has personally played a major hand .
he must be eager to carry on as well .
in this instance , the german football association would be well-advised to hold onto him .
they should follow the motto : never change a winning team !
even if it never quite hit the jackpot .

that 's what we want to say to our national team .
third place in the world cup is a well-deserved reward for their fantastic performance this time round .
they 've created unforgettable moments .

do you remember the quarterfinal against argentina ?
when thomas mueller , bastian schweinsteiger and mesut oezil pulverized the " gauchos " ' defense and sent the pre-match favourites packing with a resounding 4-0 victory ?

we 're proud of you !
that 's what we want to say to our national team .
third place in the world cup is a well-deserved reward for their fantastic performance this time round .
they 've created unforgettable moments .
in years to come we 'll still be saying : do you remember the round of sixteen match against england in south africa 2010 ? that disallowed goal for the english , and the subsequent 4-1 thrashing by our team .
do you remember the quarterfinal against argentina ?
when thomas mueller , bastian schweinsteiger and mesut oezil pulverized the " gauchos " ' defense and sent the pre-match favourites packing with a resounding 4-0 victory ?
from nobodies to stars let 's be honest , who really thought that this young team would create such memorable highlights ?
the german team is now being celebrated across the world for their inspirational offensive football .

international sports reporters became familiar with how to pronounce the names of the german players – and were full of respect for germany 's new football flair .
it was n't only fans at home who were upset when the team met their match in the semi finals against spain .
football fans from across the world reported that they were sorry that this amazing german side had n't made it into the final .
time to perfect their game we do n't need to grieve for what could have been .
this team belongs to the future .
thomas mueller , the biggest discovery of this world cup , is 20 years old , mesut oezil is 21 , sami khedira , 23 .
and even leading players like bastian schweinsteiger or the captain , philipp lahm , are only in their mid twenties .
they can play together for a few more years yet , and have time to perfect their game further .
and other talents are following on behind .
the seeds sown by the german football association in training young players are bearing fruit . above all , the pool of young players , trained to first-class standards , technically and tactically , promises a golden future for german football .
national team coach , joachim loew , should be praised for his part in this success story , in which he has personally played a major hand .
he must be eager to carry on as well .
in this instance , the german football association would be well-advised to hold onto him .
they should follow the motto : never change a winning team !
even if it never quite hit the jackpot .

on sunday , he leads them into the world cup final . in the hysteria that surrounded spain after they won their first ever trophy at the european championships in 2008 , it was easy to forget one of the more unsavoury chapters of their recent history , given their imperious march to the title in austria and switzerland .
it took place in 2004 when most of the spain team who would go on to become european champions were just starting to come through and show promise .
their coach at the time , luis aragones , allegedly used a racist slur to motivate striker jose antonio reyes to stand up to thierry henry of france .
while the comment itself was deplorable enough , the spanish fa 's reluctance to take action was even more so .
aragones was , of course , allowed to stay in his job and four years after the scandal , he led spain to the euro 2008 title .
the glory of that achievement , and the belief of his supporters that he was just a ' man of his time , ' glossed over the fact that aragones was seen by many as a difficult , volatile man and an opinionated , abusive coach .
but he got results , and as such , he was tolerated and indulged .
two years on and spain have the chance to claim the ultimate title when they face the netherlands in the final of the 2010 fifa world cup on sunday .
they have lost only two games in the last 55 they 've played and have shown the same confidence and class in south africa as they did in austria and switzerland .
if they win the world cup , it will be an achievement which will put even winning euro 2008 in the shade .
has all this been achieved with a raging , anachronistic coach at the helm ?
has a ' man of his time ' used bullying tactics to take this team to within one game of being crowned champions of the world ?
the answer is of course no .
vicente del bosque , a man and coach infinitely less brash or controversial than his predecessor , has brought spain to the cusp of winning the greatest prize with his mixture of calm advice and fatherly protection .
coach sticks with successful tactics but changes atmosphere del bosque is the polar opposite of the combustible aragones and yet the team has n't suffered from such a radical change at the top .
from the day he took over as coach , he insisted that nothing would change on the pitch .
spain had just enjoyed its finest hour and del bosque knew not to rock the boat by shaking up the system .
he kept the nucleus of the euro 2008 team intact along with aragones ' tactical plan .
it was n't broken , so why fix it ?
bildunterschrift : del bosque recognised that spain did not need rebuilding on the pitch but needed calm off it instead , he changed the approach off the pitch , replacing the haranguing of players with the quiet coaxing which had got the best out of the real madrid teams he had coached in the past .
the result is a happy , comfortable squad in which the potentially damaging barcelona-real madrid split has no place .
if no complaints about del bosque or rumours of feuds among players have leaked from the dressing room it is because there have n't been any .
the players have been made to feel they are partners in the team 's success by del bosque 's inclusive approach .
after weathering the storm of criticism which followed the switzerland defeat in spain 's first game in south africa , the quiet man of spanish soccer consulted those who knew best what went wrong – his players .
together they worked out how to put things right .
some saw this as weakness , as deferring to the players .
del bosque knew it was a way to win trust and cement a bond .
it was intelligent , not weak .
a thoughtful man , unafraid to make difficult decisions while he has been accused of being too gentle in the past , del bosque is no push over and is certainly not afraid of making big decisions .
he left out in-form players such as marcus senna , daniel aranzubia and alvarao dominguez from his final squad list and has shown during the tournament that there 's no place for sentiment by benching the misfiring fernando torres for the semi-final defeat of germany .
having had his fair share of dealing with difficult choices in club management , del bosque has handled the national set-up with aplomb .
bildunterschrift : the spain coach has brought in the players he needed to make the existing system operate better del bosque arrived as coach with an envious reputation for success .
as real madrid coach , the former los blancos defender won the champions league twice , la liga twice and the europa league during his four seasons in charge .
his dismissal – for being too docile and not marketable enough to coach the galacticos project – is one of the biggest stains on real madrid 's increasingly tainted record .
despite his long-standing allegiance to real , del bosque is astute enough not to buy into the club rivalries .
he picks the players who fit the system , regardless of their team colours .
find the player for the system , not the other way round del bosque has been forced by necessity to change certain things in the team line-up but he has been keen to point out that his additions are more about evolution than revolution .
fresh legs in the form of the barcelona trio pedro , sergi busquets and gerard pique have been installed to give the system new bite but the coach has n't tampered with anything for the sake of adding a certain player .
the ideal player is found to play a certain position in the system – not the other way round .
now del bosque has the chance to add the world cup to the european title won by his predecessor with a team that knows exactly what it is doing after years of honing a devastating pressing game built around some of the best ball players and passers in the world .
and it did n't take a lot of shouting and swearing .

however , today , many victims of the war crimes have still not been identified . since 2006 , the international committee on missing persons -lrb- icmp -rrb- has used dna analysis to link bone fragments and other organic material buried in bosnia 's mass graves with the dna of potential relatives who have donated their genetic material to be matched up with the victims . qiagen , a german company based in hilden outside dusseldorf in western germany , has developed the technology used for much of the biological and genetic testing . " there are quite a number of difficulties , especially in the extraction of older bones , which have been buried in the ground for years under very adverse conditions , " said scientist mario scherer , who works on samples from bosnia . " the quality of the genetic material in these bones is impaired by chemical and physical agents and processes through decomposition by bacteria very strongly , " he added .
" the aim is to extract the genetic material as cleanly as possible . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : identification brings closure for the victims ' relatives scherer works mostly with his centrifuge , a blue , futuristic-looking cube just larger than a microwave oven .

" we also must make sure that no additional external contamination is acquired during the process , " said thomas parsons , the director of forensic science at the international commission on missing persons , in a 2006 interview on qiagen 's website . " the small amounts of dna that we are working with can reach the levels of pcr -lrb- detection of polymerase chain reaction -rrb- technology , so it is easy to pick up any exogenous contamination that may be present , " he added . dna identification is crucial bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dna analysis is the only possibility for identifying the victims , say experts parsons ' colleagues from icmp use qiagen 's techniques to extract genetic molecules from bones that have been buried for 15 years .

" other , more traditional ways of identification could not be applied here in this region . " after the war in bosnia , many thousands of people are still unaccounted for .

however , today , many victims of the war crimes have still not been identified . since 2006 , the international committee on missing persons -lrb- icmp -rrb- has used dna analysis to link bone fragments and other organic material buried in bosnia 's mass graves with the dna of potential relatives who have donated their genetic material to be matched up with the victims . qiagen , a german company based in hilden outside dusseldorf in western germany , has developed the technology used for much of the biological and genetic testing . " there are quite a number of difficulties , especially in the extraction of older bones , which have been buried in the ground for years under very adverse conditions , " said scientist mario scherer , who works on samples from bosnia .

" we also must make sure that no additional external contamination is acquired during the process , " said thomas parsons , the director of forensic science at the international commission on missing persons , in a 2006 interview on qiagen 's website .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : dossier : 2010 fifa world cup spain , netherlands , germany dominate dw top xi spain 's world cup win down to possession , not goals youthful germany hold heads high and look to future spanish enjoy football fiesta after victory over devastated dutch world cup -pipe- 11.07.2010 spain , netherlands gear up for clash to be world 's best großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : both finalists have a number of potential match winners in what is an intriguing match-up , spain and the netherlands meet in the world cup final in johannesburg on sunday night .
here , dw ’ s nick amies looks at the key battles which could determine who wins the 2010 world cup . wesley sneijder versus sergio busquets few would dispute that wesley sneijder has been one of the players of the tournament .
the inter milan playmaker has been at the heart of much of holland 's ingenuity and has weighed in with a hugely impressive five goals from his roaming creative role in the midfield .
with mark van bommel and nigel de jong charged with more defensive duties , sneijder will again have the job of driving the dutch on , probing for openings for arjen robben and robin van persie and hitting his own shots from distance .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wesley sneijder will try to bypass spain 's sergio busquets the man whose job it will be to deny sneijder space is sergio busquets .
now barcelona 's first choice defensive midfielder , busquets has already faced off against sneijder in the champions league semi-finals last season and came off second best .
still only 21 , busquets unseated marcos senna from the same role in the spain team and is now the man to patrol ahead of the spanish back four .
he will need to close sneijder down fast , denying him time and space to play in others or shoot , much as he did against mesut oezil and lukas podolski in the semi-final win over germany .
it will not be an easy task but its imperative for spain that he succeeds .
david villa versus joris mathijsen david villa has shown at this world cup why the best teams in europe were all clambering for his signature before the tournament began .
the new barcelona forward has hit five goals on the way to the final and has taken spain 's scoring burden on his shoulders with aplomb .
not the tallest man on the field , villa can still cause problems in the air just by making the effort but his danger lies at his feet .
villa has impeccable timing which , given the quality of the ball-playing midfielders in his team , makes him a deadly striker .
spain like to play across the box and probe for openings and villa is the fox in the box .
it only takes a subtle flick or fast through ball for villa to spring his trap .
precise acceleration means he 's rarely caught offside and with little or no back lift in his shot , he needs very little space to take advantage of an opportunity .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : david villa will have to get past dutch defender joris mathijsen joris mathijsen 's solid performances in south africa have cemented his position as one of holland 's best defenders .
a player who goes about his business with quiet efficiency , mathijsen is a well drilled back who will know all about the threat david villa poses .
much like villa , mathijsen has a low centre of gravity and can turn quickly and accelerate at speed so will be ready to stay with the spain forward should he break .
mathijsen 's performance against uruguay 's diego forlan in the semi-final reduced the striker to long shots .
the dutch will be hoping that mathijsen will frustrate the spanish forward to the same extent – but with a different outcome : forlan scored from distance .
arjen robben versus joan capdevila after laboring a little at the start of the tournament due to an injury picked up in a pre-world cup warm-up game , arjen robben has since shown his most devastating form .
most dangerous when cutting in from the right to aim his lethal left footed shots at goal , robben has turned a number of left-backs inside out over the course of this tournament and shown most of them a clean pair of heels while racing past them .
robben will be allowed to roam at will but will be given the right channel as his own to penetrate , hitting the by-line to deliver crosses or swerving into the area to shoot at goal .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : arjen robben will be looking to torment joan capdevila experienced villareal left-back capdevila will have seen it all before , however , coming up as he did against robben when the dutchman was a real madrid player , but questions remain over whether his aging legs will be able to cope this time around .
capdevila 's head is a wise one though and will use his guile as much as his skill to keep an eye on robben with the more athletic sergio ramos likely to be lurking in support just in case .
robben will not have things all his own way though .
capdevila still possesses enough speed to threaten as an overlapping attacking option and the dutchman may be forced to track back to prevent the spaniard from getting into dangerous positions behind him .
andres iniesta versus nigel de jong it 's no surprise that spain 's return to confidence and competence has coincided with the recovery of andres iniesta from injury .
while xavi hernandez probes , iniesta flits and darts like a dragonfly around his midfield partner , collecting and poking short tactical passes to him before nipping past perplexed defenders .
given a similar brief to wesley sneijder , iniesta ghosts around in front of the back four , ready to play the killer ball to david villa or feint his way into his own goal-scoring position .
germany 's bastian schweinsteiger - who looked imperious until the semi-final - was made to look ordinary by iniesta on wednesday night while sami khedira was constantly pulled out of position by his movement .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tricky andres iniesta faces tough tackling nigel de jong nigel de jong will probably interchange with mark van bommel when it comes to dealing with xavi and iniesta as they approach the dutch back four , but de jong is more likely to get the first bite at iniesta due to his better mobility .
de jong has matured into a more intelligent yet still very combative defensive midfielder after coming under criticism for his often overly-physical game .
he 'll need his wits about him to deal with iniesta but armed as he is now with a fully engaged brain to go with his quick feet , de jong 's defenders will be well protected .
xavi hernandez versus mark van bommel mark van bommel has drawn both praise and jeers for his all-action approach to games at this world cup , drawing widespread criticism for a number of fully committed tackles which have left opponents wincing .
a volatile player who has a reputation for niggly fouls and a fast mouth , van bommel 's temperament has been a source of debate for most of his career .
however , his performances as a whole have been outstanding in south africa and his team 's defensive record has as much to do with his policing of the region in front of the penalty area as it does the actual defensive work of the back four .
facing spain , a team who will spend a lot of time in his neighborhood , means that van bommel will have a busy evening on sunday and he will have to keep his cool under what will be a concerted amount of pressure .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : xavi hernandez goes head-to-head with mark van bommel xavi will be a constant threat to van bommel 's peace .
both he and iniesta will be right in the dutchman 's face , leaving the languid build up behind them to the likes of xabi alonso and busquets .
xavi will bring the ball into van bommel 's zone and look to draw him into either making a rash tackle within striking distance of the goal , or pull him out of position enough to bypass him with threaded passes .
with iniesta buzzing round him and xavi forcing him to chase clipped exchanges , van bommel needs to be disciplined .
xavi 's goal threat has been reduced in recent years but his damage comes from playing people in .
he will hope that the dutch get frustrated by chasing the game before choosing the moment to strike .

here , dw ’ s nick amies looks at the key battles which could determine who wins the 2010 world cup . wesley sneijder versus sergio busquets few would dispute that wesley sneijder has been one of the players of the tournament .
the inter milan playmaker has been at the heart of much of holland 's ingenuity and has weighed in with a hugely impressive five goals from his roaming creative role in the midfield .
with mark van bommel and nigel de jong charged with more defensive duties , sneijder will again have the job of driving the dutch on , probing for openings for arjen robben and robin van persie and hitting his own shots from distance .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wesley sneijder will try to bypass spain 's sergio busquets the man whose job it will be to deny sneijder space is sergio busquets .
now barcelona 's first choice defensive midfielder , busquets has already faced off against sneijder in the champions league semi-finals last season and came off second best .
still only 21 , busquets unseated marcos senna from the same role in the spain team and is now the man to patrol ahead of the spanish back four .
he will need to close sneijder down fast , denying him time and space to play in others or shoot , much as he did against mesut oezil and lukas podolski in the semi-final win over germany .
it will not be an easy task but its imperative for spain that he succeeds .
david villa versus joris mathijsen david villa has shown at this world cup why the best teams in europe were all clambering for his signature before the tournament began .
the new barcelona forward has hit five goals on the way to the final and has taken spain 's scoring burden on his shoulders with aplomb .
not the tallest man on the field , villa can still cause problems in the air just by making the effort but his danger lies at his feet .
villa has impeccable timing which , given the quality of the ball-playing midfielders in his team , makes him a deadly striker .
spain like to play across the box and probe for openings and villa is the fox in the box .
it only takes a subtle flick or fast through ball for villa to spring his trap .
precise acceleration means he 's rarely caught offside and with little or no back lift in his shot , he needs very little space to take advantage of an opportunity .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : david villa will have to get past dutch defender joris mathijsen joris mathijsen 's solid performances in south africa have cemented his position as one of holland 's best defenders .
a player who goes about his business with quiet efficiency , mathijsen is a well drilled back who will know all about the threat david villa poses .
much like villa , mathijsen has a low centre of gravity and can turn quickly and accelerate at speed so will be ready to stay with the spain forward should he break .
mathijsen 's performance against uruguay 's diego forlan in the semi-final reduced the striker to long shots .
the dutch will be hoping that mathijsen will frustrate the spanish forward to the same extent – but with a different outcome : forlan scored from distance .
arjen robben versus joan capdevila after laboring a little at the start of the tournament due to an injury picked up in a pre-world cup warm-up game , arjen robben has since shown his most devastating form .
most dangerous when cutting in from the right to aim his lethal left footed shots at goal , robben has turned a number of left-backs inside out over the course of this tournament and shown most of them a clean pair of heels while racing past them .
robben will be allowed to roam at will but will be given the right channel as his own to penetrate , hitting the by-line to deliver crosses or swerving into the area to shoot at goal .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : arjen robben will be looking to torment joan capdevila experienced villareal left-back capdevila will have seen it all before , however , coming up as he did against robben when the dutchman was a real madrid player , but questions remain over whether his aging legs will be able to cope this time around .
capdevila 's head is a wise one though and will use his guile as much as his skill to keep an eye on robben with the more athletic sergio ramos likely to be lurking in support just in case .
robben will not have things all his own way though .
capdevila still possesses enough speed to threaten as an overlapping attacking option and the dutchman may be forced to track back to prevent the spaniard from getting into dangerous positions behind him .
andres iniesta versus nigel de jong it 's no surprise that spain 's return to confidence and competence has coincided with the recovery of andres iniesta from injury .
while xavi hernandez probes , iniesta flits and darts like a dragonfly around his midfield partner , collecting and poking short tactical passes to him before nipping past perplexed defenders .
given a similar brief to wesley sneijder , iniesta ghosts around in front of the back four , ready to play the killer ball to david villa or feint his way into his own goal-scoring position .
germany 's bastian schweinsteiger - who looked imperious until the semi-final - was made to look ordinary by iniesta on wednesday night while sami khedira was constantly pulled out of position by his movement .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tricky andres iniesta faces tough tackling nigel de jong nigel de jong will probably interchange with mark van bommel when it comes to dealing with xavi and iniesta as they approach the dutch back four , but de jong is more likely to get the first bite at iniesta due to his better mobility .
de jong has matured into a more intelligent yet still very combative defensive midfielder after coming under criticism for his often overly-physical game .
he 'll need his wits about him to deal with iniesta but armed as he is now with a fully engaged brain to go with his quick feet , de jong 's defenders will be well protected .
xavi hernandez versus mark van bommel mark van bommel has drawn both praise and jeers for his all-action approach to games at this world cup , drawing widespread criticism for a number of fully committed tackles which have left opponents wincing .
a volatile player who has a reputation for niggly fouls and a fast mouth , van bommel 's temperament has been a source of debate for most of his career .
however , his performances as a whole have been outstanding in south africa and his team 's defensive record has as much to do with his policing of the region in front of the penalty area as it does the actual defensive work of the back four .
facing spain , a team who will spend a lot of time in his neighborhood , means that van bommel will have a busy evening on sunday and he will have to keep his cool under what will be a concerted amount of pressure .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : xavi hernandez goes head-to-head with mark van bommel xavi will be a constant threat to van bommel 's peace .
both he and iniesta will be right in the dutchman 's face , leaving the languid build up behind them to the likes of xabi alonso and busquets .
xavi will bring the ball into van bommel 's zone and look to draw him into either making a rash tackle within striking distance of the goal , or pull him out of position enough to bypass him with threaded passes .
with iniesta buzzing round him and xavi forcing him to chase clipped exchanges , van bommel needs to be disciplined .
xavi 's goal threat has been reduced in recent years but his damage comes from playing people in .
he will hope that the dutch get frustrated by chasing the game before choosing the moment to strike .

while xavi hernandez probes , iniesta flits and darts like a dragonfly around his midfield partner , collecting and poking short tactical passes to him before nipping past perplexed defenders .
given a similar brief to wesley sneijder , iniesta ghosts around in front of the back four , ready to play the killer ball to david villa or feint his way into his own goal-scoring position .
germany 's bastian schweinsteiger - who looked imperious until the semi-final - was made to look ordinary by iniesta on wednesday night while sami khedira was constantly pulled out of position by his movement .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tricky andres iniesta faces tough tackling nigel de jong nigel de jong will probably interchange with mark van bommel when it comes to dealing with xavi and iniesta as they approach the dutch back four , but de jong is more likely to get the first bite at iniesta due to his better mobility .
de jong has matured into a more intelligent yet still very combative defensive midfielder after coming under criticism for his often overly-physical game .
he 'll need his wits about him to deal with iniesta but armed as he is now with a fully engaged brain to go with his quick feet , de jong 's defenders will be well protected .
xavi hernandez versus mark van bommel mark van bommel has drawn both praise and jeers for his all-action approach to games at this world cup , drawing widespread criticism for a number of fully committed tackles which have left opponents wincing .
a volatile player who has a reputation for niggly fouls and a fast mouth , van bommel 's temperament has been a source of debate for most of his career .
however , his performances as a whole have been outstanding in south africa and his team 's defensive record has as much to do with his policing of the region in front of the penalty area as it does the actual defensive work of the back four .
facing spain , a team who will spend a lot of time in his neighborhood , means that van bommel will have a busy evening on sunday and he will have to keep his cool under what will be a concerted amount of pressure .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : xavi hernandez goes head-to-head with mark van bommel xavi will be a constant threat to van bommel 's peace .
both he and iniesta will be right in the dutchman 's face , leaving the languid build up behind them to the likes of xabi alonso and busquets .
xavi will bring the ball into van bommel 's zone and look to draw him into either making a rash tackle within striking distance of the goal , or pull him out of position enough to bypass him with threaded passes .
with iniesta buzzing round him and xavi forcing him to chase clipped exchanges , van bommel needs to be disciplined .
xavi 's goal threat has been reduced in recent years but his damage comes from playing people in .
he will hope that the dutch get frustrated by chasing the game before choosing the moment to strike .

on sunday , he leads them into the world cup final . in the hysteria that surrounded spain after they won their first ever trophy at the european championships in 2008 , it was easy to forget one of the more unsavoury chapters of their recent history , given their imperious march to the title in austria and switzerland .
it took place in 2004 when most of the spain team who would go on to become european champions were just starting to come through and show promise .
their coach at the time , luis aragones , allegedly used a racist slur to motivate striker jose antonio reyes to stand up to thierry henry of france .
while the comment itself was deplorable enough , the spanish fa 's reluctance to take action was even more so .
aragones was , of course , allowed to stay in his job and four years after the scandal , he led spain to the euro 2008 title .
the glory of that achievement , and the belief of his supporters that he was just a ' man of his time , ' glossed over the fact that aragones was seen by many as a difficult , volatile man and an opinionated , abusive coach .
but he got results , and as such , he was tolerated and indulged .
two years on and spain have the chance to claim the ultimate title when they face the netherlands in the final of the 2010 fifa world cup on sunday .
they have lost only two games in the last 55 they 've played and have shown the same confidence and class in south africa as they did in austria and switzerland .
if they win the world cup , it will be an achievement which will put even winning euro 2008 in the shade .
has all this been achieved with a raging , anachronistic coach at the helm ?
has a ' man of his time ' used bullying tactics to take this team to within one game of being crowned champions of the world ?
the answer is of course no .
vicente del bosque , a man and coach infinitely less brash or controversial than his predecessor , has brought spain to the cusp of winning the greatest prize with his mixture of calm advice and fatherly protection .
coach sticks with successful tactics but changes atmosphere del bosque is the polar opposite of the combustible aragones and yet the team has n't suffered from such a radical change at the top .
from the day he took over as coach , he insisted that nothing would change on the pitch .
spain had just enjoyed its finest hour and del bosque knew not to rock the boat by shaking up the system .
he kept the nucleus of the euro 2008 team intact along with aragones ' tactical plan .
it was n't broken , so why fix it ?
bildunterschrift : del bosque recognised that spain did not need rebuilding on the pitch but needed calm off it instead , he changed the approach off the pitch , replacing the haranguing of players with the quiet coaxing which had got the best out of the real madrid teams he had coached in the past .
the result is a happy , comfortable squad in which the potentially damaging barcelona-real madrid split has no place .
if no complaints about del bosque or rumours of feuds among players have leaked from the dressing room it is because there have n't been any .
the players have been made to feel they are partners in the team 's success by del bosque 's inclusive approach .
after weathering the storm of criticism which followed the switzerland defeat in spain 's first game in south africa , the quiet man of spanish soccer consulted those who knew best what went wrong – his players .
together they worked out how to put things right .
some saw this as weakness , as deferring to the players .
del bosque knew it was a way to win trust and cement a bond .
it was intelligent , not weak .
a thoughtful man , unafraid to make difficult decisions while he has been accused of being too gentle in the past , del bosque is no push over and is certainly not afraid of making big decisions .
he left out in-form players such as marcus senna , daniel aranzubia and alvarao dominguez from his final squad list and has shown during the tournament that there 's no place for sentiment by benching the misfiring fernando torres for the semi-final defeat of germany .
having had his fair share of dealing with difficult choices in club management , del bosque has handled the national set-up with aplomb .
bildunterschrift : the spain coach has brought in the players he needed to make the existing system operate better del bosque arrived as coach with an envious reputation for success .
as real madrid coach , the former los blancos defender won the champions league twice , la liga twice and the europa league during his four seasons in charge .
his dismissal – for being too docile and not marketable enough to coach the galacticos project – is one of the biggest stains on real madrid 's increasingly tainted record .
despite his long-standing allegiance to real , del bosque is astute enough not to buy into the club rivalries .
he picks the players who fit the system , regardless of their team colours .
find the player for the system , not the other way round del bosque has been forced by necessity to change certain things in the team line-up but he has been keen to point out that his additions are more about evolution than revolution .
fresh legs in the form of the barcelona trio pedro , sergi busquets and gerard pique have been installed to give the system new bite but the coach has n't tampered with anything for the sake of adding a certain player .
the ideal player is found to play a certain position in the system – not the other way round .
now del bosque has the chance to add the world cup to the european title won by his predecessor with a team that knows exactly what it is doing after years of honing a devastating pressing game built around some of the best ball players and passers in the world .
and it did n't take a lot of shouting and swearing .

but questions still surround the tragedy . some 40,000 people gathered sunday in the bosnian town of srebrenica , where the massacre widely described as europe 's worst atrocity since world war ii occurred 15 years ago .
srebrenica was a un-protected enclave besieged by bosnian serb forces throughout the 1992-95 war .
but un troops there were quickly overrun when the serbs entered the town , rounded up its bosnian muslim population and killed more than 8,000 men and boys .
as part of sunday 's ceremony , 775 recently identified massacre victims in coffins draped in green were interred at the potocari war cemetery , where more than 4,500 are already buried .
several world leaders attended the commemoration ceremony , including us president barack obama , british prime minister david cameron and turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan .
recognizing the international community 's failure to respond to the bloody bosnian war , obama called the massacre " a stain on our collective conscience . "
also at the ceremony was serbian president boris tadic , whose presence many bosnians resented .
serbia has been criticized for its perceived reluctance to capture ratko mladic , the general who led the attack on srebrenica .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un soldiers reinforce defensive positions in sarajevo during the 1992-1995 bosnian war slow search for victims on friday , thousands of people lined the main street of sarajevo as trucks bearing more coffins passed through on the way to srebrenica , some 100 miles to the south-east in eastern bosnia .
in the drina valley , the remains of 8,372 victims of the massacre have been exhumed from 275 mass graves in recent years .
so far 6,557 victims have been identified , and many more murdered muslim civilians are still missing .
the search is slow and tedious , as corpses were tossed into mass graves , often to be dug up again later with bulldozers only to be hastily buried again elsewhere . manfred eisele , an army major general in the german armed forces responsible for planning the un 's peacekeeping operations from 1994 to 1998 , said that 15 years after the srebrenica massacre , it was still difficult to shed light on events . he said he had doubts that those responsible in the un security council had the power or the intention to guarantee the protection of the 40,000 muslim civilians in the srebrenica " safe area . "
' they did n't prevent the drama ' many analysts now place much of the blame for the genocide on the dutch government . fearing for the safety of its 450 soldiers stationed in the area , the dutch government failed to order a un-proposed air attack on serb troops .
the dutch were easily overpowered and the massacre unfolded .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ex-bosnian-serb general ratko mladic is wanted for crimes against humanity german lawyer axel hagedorn , who represents about 8,000 relatives of the victims , is trying to invalidate the un 's immunity before the highest court in the netherlands , as well as the european court of justice .
" the un has a clear responsibility , it should have decided against the dutch , " hagedorn said .
" if the un had to go to court , then it would no longer be possible for the dutch state to blame the un , or the un to blame the dutch state , which is what 's happening now . "
lessons of history the massacre of srebrenica , but also the genocide in rwanda and cambodia , are seen as signs of the un 's failure . the united nations still has not learned its lesson , general eisele said .
" the readiness of states to take responsibility for hard-pressed minorities and also to recognize this protective responsibility is still dramatically underdeveloped , " he said .
" a direct consequence can be seen in the nato deployment … for the kosovo-albanians , who were subjected to massive human rights violations by their own government . "
today , only about three to five percent of the population in srebrenica is muslim , most of them women still searching for relatives .
many families went into exile to canada , new zealand and the united states .

but questions still surround the tragedy . some 40,000 people gathered sunday in the bosnian town of srebrenica , where the massacre widely described as europe 's worst atrocity since world war ii occurred 15 years ago .
srebrenica was a un-protected enclave besieged by bosnian serb forces throughout the 1992-95 war .
but un troops there were quickly overrun when the serbs entered the town , rounded up its bosnian muslim population and killed more than 8,000 men and boys .
as part of sunday 's ceremony , 775 recently identified massacre victims in coffins draped in green were interred at the potocari war cemetery , where more than 4,500 are already buried .
several world leaders attended the commemoration ceremony , including us president barack obama , british prime minister david cameron and turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan .
recognizing the international community 's failure to respond to the bloody bosnian war , obama called the massacre " a stain on our collective conscience . "
also at the ceremony was serbian president boris tadic , whose presence many bosnians resented .
serbia has been criticized for its perceived reluctance to capture ratko mladic , the general who led the attack on srebrenica .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un soldiers reinforce defensive positions in sarajevo during the 1992-1995 bosnian war slow search for victims on friday , thousands of people lined the main street of sarajevo as trucks bearing more coffins passed through on the way to srebrenica , some 100 miles to the south-east in eastern bosnia .
in the drina valley , the remains of 8,372 victims of the massacre have been exhumed from 275 mass graves in recent years .
so far 6,557 victims have been identified , and many more murdered muslim civilians are still missing .
the search is slow and tedious , as corpses were tossed into mass graves , often to be dug up again later with bulldozers only to be hastily buried again elsewhere . manfred eisele , an army major general in the german armed forces responsible for planning the un 's peacekeeping operations from 1994 to 1998 , said that 15 years after the srebrenica massacre , it was still difficult to shed light on events . he said he had doubts that those responsible in the un security council had the power or the intention to guarantee the protection of the 40,000 muslim civilians in the srebrenica " safe area . "
' they did n't prevent the drama ' many analysts now place much of the blame for the genocide on the dutch government . fearing for the safety of its 450 soldiers stationed in the area , the dutch government failed to order a un-proposed air attack on serb troops .
the dutch were easily overpowered and the massacre unfolded .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ex-bosnian-serb general ratko mladic is wanted for crimes against humanity german lawyer axel hagedorn , who represents about 8,000 relatives of the victims , is trying to invalidate the un 's immunity before the highest court in the netherlands , as well as the european court of justice .
" the un has a clear responsibility , it should have decided against the dutch , " hagedorn said .
" if the un had to go to court , then it would no longer be possible for the dutch state to blame the un , or the un to blame the dutch state , which is what 's happening now . "
lessons of history the massacre of srebrenica , but also the genocide in rwanda and cambodia , are seen as signs of the un 's failure . the united nations still has not learned its lesson , general eisele said .
" the readiness of states to take responsibility for hard-pressed minorities and also to recognize this protective responsibility is still dramatically underdeveloped , " he said .
" a direct consequence can be seen in the nato deployment … for the kosovo-albanians , who were subjected to massive human rights violations by their own government . "
today , only about three to five percent of the population in srebrenica is muslim , most of them women still searching for relatives .
many families went into exile to canada , new zealand and the united states .

here , dw ’ s nick amies looks at the key battles which could determine who wins the 2010 world cup . wesley sneijder versus sergio busquets few would dispute that wesley sneijder has been one of the players of the tournament .
the inter milan playmaker has been at the heart of much of holland 's ingenuity and has weighed in with a hugely impressive five goals from his roaming creative role in the midfield .
with mark van bommel and nigel de jong charged with more defensive duties , sneijder will again have the job of driving the dutch on , probing for openings for arjen robben and robin van persie and hitting his own shots from distance .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wesley sneijder will try to bypass spain 's sergio busquets the man whose job it will be to deny sneijder space is sergio busquets .
now barcelona 's first choice defensive midfielder , busquets has already faced off against sneijder in the champions league semi-finals last season and came off second best .
still only 21 , busquets unseated marcos senna from the same role in the spain team and is now the man to patrol ahead of the spanish back four .
he will need to close sneijder down fast , denying him time and space to play in others or shoot , much as he did against mesut oezil and lukas podolski in the semi-final win over germany .
it will not be an easy task but its imperative for spain that he succeeds .
david villa versus joris mathijsen david villa has shown at this world cup why the best teams in europe were all clambering for his signature before the tournament began .
the new barcelona forward has hit five goals on the way to the final and has taken spain 's scoring burden on his shoulders with aplomb .
not the tallest man on the field , villa can still cause problems in the air just by making the effort but his danger lies at his feet .
villa has impeccable timing which , given the quality of the ball-playing midfielders in his team , makes him a deadly striker .
spain like to play across the box and probe for openings and villa is the fox in the box .
it only takes a subtle flick or fast through ball for villa to spring his trap .
precise acceleration means he 's rarely caught offside and with little or no back lift in his shot , he needs very little space to take advantage of an opportunity .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : david villa will have to get past dutch defender joris mathijsen joris mathijsen 's solid performances in south africa have cemented his position as one of holland 's best defenders .
a player who goes about his business with quiet efficiency , mathijsen is a well drilled back who will know all about the threat david villa poses .
much like villa , mathijsen has a low centre of gravity and can turn quickly and accelerate at speed so will be ready to stay with the spain forward should he break .
mathijsen 's performance against uruguay 's diego forlan in the semi-final reduced the striker to long shots .
the dutch will be hoping that mathijsen will frustrate the spanish forward to the same extent – but with a different outcome : forlan scored from distance .
arjen robben versus joan capdevila after laboring a little at the start of the tournament due to an injury picked up in a pre-world cup warm-up game , arjen robben has since shown his most devastating form .
most dangerous when cutting in from the right to aim his lethal left footed shots at goal , robben has turned a number of left-backs inside out over the course of this tournament and shown most of them a clean pair of heels while racing past them .
robben will be allowed to roam at will but will be given the right channel as his own to penetrate , hitting the by-line to deliver crosses or swerving into the area to shoot at goal .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : arjen robben will be looking to torment joan capdevila experienced villareal left-back capdevila will have seen it all before , however , coming up as he did against robben when the dutchman was a real madrid player , but questions remain over whether his aging legs will be able to cope this time around .
capdevila 's head is a wise one though and will use his guile as much as his skill to keep an eye on robben with the more athletic sergio ramos likely to be lurking in support just in case .
robben will not have things all his own way though .
capdevila still possesses enough speed to threaten as an overlapping attacking option and the dutchman may be forced to track back to prevent the spaniard from getting into dangerous positions behind him .
andres iniesta versus nigel de jong it 's no surprise that spain 's return to confidence and competence has coincided with the recovery of andres iniesta from injury .
while xavi hernandez probes , iniesta flits and darts like a dragonfly around his midfield partner , collecting and poking short tactical passes to him before nipping past perplexed defenders .
given a similar brief to wesley sneijder , iniesta ghosts around in front of the back four , ready to play the killer ball to david villa or feint his way into his own goal-scoring position .
germany 's bastian schweinsteiger - who looked imperious until the semi-final - was made to look ordinary by iniesta on wednesday night while sami khedira was constantly pulled out of position by his movement .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tricky andres iniesta faces tough tackling nigel de jong nigel de jong will probably interchange with mark van bommel when it comes to dealing with xavi and iniesta as they approach the dutch back four , but de jong is more likely to get the first bite at iniesta due to his better mobility .
de jong has matured into a more intelligent yet still very combative defensive midfielder after coming under criticism for his often overly-physical game .
he 'll need his wits about him to deal with iniesta but armed as he is now with a fully engaged brain to go with his quick feet , de jong 's defenders will be well protected .
xavi hernandez versus mark van bommel mark van bommel has drawn both praise and jeers for his all-action approach to games at this world cup , drawing widespread criticism for a number of fully committed tackles which have left opponents wincing .
a volatile player who has a reputation for niggly fouls and a fast mouth , van bommel 's temperament has been a source of debate for most of his career .
however , his performances as a whole have been outstanding in south africa and his team 's defensive record has as much to do with his policing of the region in front of the penalty area as it does the actual defensive work of the back four .
facing spain , a team who will spend a lot of time in his neighborhood , means that van bommel will have a busy evening on sunday and he will have to keep his cool under what will be a concerted amount of pressure .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : xavi hernandez goes head-to-head with mark van bommel xavi will be a constant threat to van bommel 's peace .
both he and iniesta will be right in the dutchman 's face , leaving the languid build up behind them to the likes of xabi alonso and busquets .
xavi will bring the ball into van bommel 's zone and look to draw him into either making a rash tackle within striking distance of the goal , or pull him out of position enough to bypass him with threaded passes .
with iniesta buzzing round him and xavi forcing him to chase clipped exchanges , van bommel needs to be disciplined .
xavi 's goal threat has been reduced in recent years but his damage comes from playing people in .
he will hope that the dutch get frustrated by chasing the game before choosing the moment to strike .

here , dw ’ s nick amies looks at the key battles which could determine who wins the 2010 world cup . wesley sneijder versus sergio busquets few would dispute that wesley sneijder has been one of the players of the tournament .
the inter milan playmaker has been at the heart of much of holland 's ingenuity and has weighed in with a hugely impressive five goals from his roaming creative role in the midfield .
with mark van bommel and nigel de jong charged with more defensive duties , sneijder will again have the job of driving the dutch on , probing for openings for arjen robben and robin van persie and hitting his own shots from distance .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wesley sneijder will try to bypass spain 's sergio busquets the man whose job it will be to deny sneijder space is sergio busquets .
now barcelona 's first choice defensive midfielder , busquets has already faced off against sneijder in the champions league semi-finals last season and came off second best .
still only 21 , busquets unseated marcos senna from the same role in the spain team and is now the man to patrol ahead of the spanish back four .
he will need to close sneijder down fast , denying him time and space to play in others or shoot , much as he did against mesut oezil and lukas podolski in the semi-final win over germany .
it will not be an easy task but its imperative for spain that he succeeds .
david villa versus joris mathijsen david villa has shown at this world cup why the best teams in europe were all clambering for his signature before the tournament began .
the new barcelona forward has hit five goals on the way to the final and has taken spain 's scoring burden on his shoulders with aplomb .
not the tallest man on the field , villa can still cause problems in the air just by making the effort but his danger lies at his feet .
villa has impeccable timing which , given the quality of the ball-playing midfielders in his team , makes him a deadly striker .
spain like to play across the box and probe for openings and villa is the fox in the box .
it only takes a subtle flick or fast through ball for villa to spring his trap .
precise acceleration means he 's rarely caught offside and with little or no back lift in his shot , he needs very little space to take advantage of an opportunity .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : david villa will have to get past dutch defender joris mathijsen joris mathijsen 's solid performances in south africa have cemented his position as one of holland 's best defenders .
a player who goes about his business with quiet efficiency , mathijsen is a well drilled back who will know all about the threat david villa poses .
much like villa , mathijsen has a low centre of gravity and can turn quickly and accelerate at speed so will be ready to stay with the spain forward should he break .
mathijsen 's performance against uruguay 's diego forlan in the semi-final reduced the striker to long shots .
the dutch will be hoping that mathijsen will frustrate the spanish forward to the same extent – but with a different outcome : forlan scored from distance .
arjen robben versus joan capdevila after laboring a little at the start of the tournament due to an injury picked up in a pre-world cup warm-up game , arjen robben has since shown his most devastating form .
most dangerous when cutting in from the right to aim his lethal left footed shots at goal , robben has turned a number of left-backs inside out over the course of this tournament and shown most of them a clean pair of heels while racing past them .
robben will be allowed to roam at will but will be given the right channel as his own to penetrate , hitting the by-line to deliver crosses or swerving into the area to shoot at goal .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : arjen robben will be looking to torment joan capdevila experienced villareal left-back capdevila will have seen it all before , however , coming up as he did against robben when the dutchman was a real madrid player , but questions remain over whether his aging legs will be able to cope this time around .
capdevila 's head is a wise one though and will use his guile as much as his skill to keep an eye on robben with the more athletic sergio ramos likely to be lurking in support just in case .
robben will not have things all his own way though .
capdevila still possesses enough speed to threaten as an overlapping attacking option and the dutchman may be forced to track back to prevent the spaniard from getting into dangerous positions behind him .
andres iniesta versus nigel de jong it 's no surprise that spain 's return to confidence and competence has coincided with the recovery of andres iniesta from injury .
while xavi hernandez probes , iniesta flits and darts like a dragonfly around his midfield partner , collecting and poking short tactical passes to him before nipping past perplexed defenders .
given a similar brief to wesley sneijder , iniesta ghosts around in front of the back four , ready to play the killer ball to david villa or feint his way into his own goal-scoring position .
germany 's bastian schweinsteiger - who looked imperious until the semi-final - was made to look ordinary by iniesta on wednesday night while sami khedira was constantly pulled out of position by his movement .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tricky andres iniesta faces tough tackling nigel de jong nigel de jong will probably interchange with mark van bommel when it comes to dealing with xavi and iniesta as they approach the dutch back four , but de jong is more likely to get the first bite at iniesta due to his better mobility .
de jong has matured into a more intelligent yet still very combative defensive midfielder after coming under criticism for his often overly-physical game .
he 'll need his wits about him to deal with iniesta but armed as he is now with a fully engaged brain to go with his quick feet , de jong 's defenders will be well protected .
xavi hernandez versus mark van bommel mark van bommel has drawn both praise and jeers for his all-action approach to games at this world cup , drawing widespread criticism for a number of fully committed tackles which have left opponents wincing .
a volatile player who has a reputation for niggly fouls and a fast mouth , van bommel 's temperament has been a source of debate for most of his career .
however , his performances as a whole have been outstanding in south africa and his team 's defensive record has as much to do with his policing of the region in front of the penalty area as it does the actual defensive work of the back four .
facing spain , a team who will spend a lot of time in his neighborhood , means that van bommel will have a busy evening on sunday and he will have to keep his cool under what will be a concerted amount of pressure .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : xavi hernandez goes head-to-head with mark van bommel xavi will be a constant threat to van bommel 's peace .
both he and iniesta will be right in the dutchman 's face , leaving the languid build up behind them to the likes of xabi alonso and busquets .
xavi will bring the ball into van bommel 's zone and look to draw him into either making a rash tackle within striking distance of the goal , or pull him out of position enough to bypass him with threaded passes .
with iniesta buzzing round him and xavi forcing him to chase clipped exchanges , van bommel needs to be disciplined .
xavi 's goal threat has been reduced in recent years but his damage comes from playing people in .
he will hope that the dutch get frustrated by chasing the game before choosing the moment to strike .

xavi 's goal threat has been reduced in recent years but his damage comes from playing people in .
he will hope that the dutch get frustrated by chasing the game before choosing the moment to strike .

here , dw ’ s nick amies looks at the key battles which could determine who wins the 2010 world cup . wesley sneijder versus sergio busquets few would dispute that wesley sneijder has been one of the players of the tournament .
the inter milan playmaker has been at the heart of much of holland 's ingenuity and has weighed in with a hugely impressive five goals from his roaming creative role in the midfield .
with mark van bommel and nigel de jong charged with more defensive duties , sneijder will again have the job of driving the dutch on , probing for openings for arjen robben and robin van persie and hitting his own shots from distance .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wesley sneijder will try to bypass spain 's sergio busquets the man whose job it will be to deny sneijder space is sergio busquets .
now barcelona 's first choice defensive midfielder , busquets has already faced off against sneijder in the champions league semi-finals last season and came off second best .
still only 21 , busquets unseated marcos senna from the same role in the spain team and is now the man to patrol ahead of the spanish back four .
he will need to close sneijder down fast , denying him time and space to play in others or shoot , much as he did against mesut oezil and lukas podolski in the semi-final win over germany .
it will not be an easy task but its imperative for spain that he succeeds .
david villa versus joris mathijsen david villa has shown at this world cup why the best teams in europe were all clambering for his signature before the tournament began .
the new barcelona forward has hit five goals on the way to the final and has taken spain 's scoring burden on his shoulders with aplomb .
not the tallest man on the field , villa can still cause problems in the air just by making the effort but his danger lies at his feet .
villa has impeccable timing which , given the quality of the ball-playing midfielders in his team , makes him a deadly striker .
spain like to play across the box and probe for openings and villa is the fox in the box .
it only takes a subtle flick or fast through ball for villa to spring his trap .
precise acceleration means he 's rarely caught offside and with little or no back lift in his shot , he needs very little space to take advantage of an opportunity .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : david villa will have to get past dutch defender joris mathijsen joris mathijsen 's solid performances in south africa have cemented his position as one of holland 's best defenders .
a player who goes about his business with quiet efficiency , mathijsen is a well drilled back who will know all about the threat david villa poses .
much like villa , mathijsen has a low centre of gravity and can turn quickly and accelerate at speed so will be ready to stay with the spain forward should he break .
mathijsen 's performance against uruguay 's diego forlan in the semi-final reduced the striker to long shots .
the dutch will be hoping that mathijsen will frustrate the spanish forward to the same extent – but with a different outcome : forlan scored from distance .
arjen robben versus joan capdevila after laboring a little at the start of the tournament due to an injury picked up in a pre-world cup warm-up game , arjen robben has since shown his most devastating form .
most dangerous when cutting in from the right to aim his lethal left footed shots at goal , robben has turned a number of left-backs inside out over the course of this tournament and shown most of them a clean pair of heels while racing past them .
robben will be allowed to roam at will but will be given the right channel as his own to penetrate , hitting the by-line to deliver crosses or swerving into the area to shoot at goal .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : arjen robben will be looking to torment joan capdevila experienced villareal left-back capdevila will have seen it all before , however , coming up as he did against robben when the dutchman was a real madrid player , but questions remain over whether his aging legs will be able to cope this time around .
capdevila 's head is a wise one though and will use his guile as much as his skill to keep an eye on robben with the more athletic sergio ramos likely to be lurking in support just in case .
robben will not have things all his own way though .
capdevila still possesses enough speed to threaten as an overlapping attacking option and the dutchman may be forced to track back to prevent the spaniard from getting into dangerous positions behind him .
andres iniesta versus nigel de jong it 's no surprise that spain 's return to confidence and competence has coincided with the recovery of andres iniesta from injury .
while xavi hernandez probes , iniesta flits and darts like a dragonfly around his midfield partner , collecting and poking short tactical passes to him before nipping past perplexed defenders .
given a similar brief to wesley sneijder , iniesta ghosts around in front of the back four , ready to play the killer ball to david villa or feint his way into his own goal-scoring position .
germany 's bastian schweinsteiger - who looked imperious until the semi-final - was made to look ordinary by iniesta on wednesday night while sami khedira was constantly pulled out of position by his movement .

spain beat the netherlands 1-0 , with the barcelona man netting late in extra-time , after 90 minutes failed to produce a goal . spain has won its first world cup , overcoming the netherlands at soccer city stadium , johannesburg .
vicente del bosque 's team , favorites before the tournament began , confirmed their place at the top of the soccer world , two years after claiming the 2008 european championship .
andres iniesta scored the extra-time goal which secured the prize .
the barcelona midfielder collected a pass from cesc fabregas and fired a right-foot shot that beat maarten stekelenburg in the dutch goal .
the breakthrough came in the 116th minute of the game .
" it 's incredible , " said iniesta after the match .
" there are n't the words to describe what i am feeling . "
bildunterschrift : iniesta scored after receiving a pass from fabregas deep into extra time the game only really came alive in extra time , after an uninspiring first 90 minutes in which the referee was often at the center of attention . twelve players were shown yellow , while dutch defender johnny heitinga saw red with ten minutes of extra time remaining .
heitinga pulled iniesta back on the edge of the box , and howard webb gave him his marching orders .
both sides had chances to win it in the added 30 minutes .
spanish substitute cesc fabregas could n't provide the finish when one-on-one , while joris mathijsen headed a corner over the bar from inside the six yard box at the other end .
spain were marginally the better team in normal time , although the netherlands had the best opening . arjen robben was played through by wesley sneijder and , one-on-one with iker casillas , could only hit his shot against the goalkeeper 's foot .
the bayern winger 's pace continued to cause the spanish defense problems , as the netherlands played on the counter attack .
spain tried to play their brand of intricate football , but were not at their fluid best .
dangerman david villa thought he had grabbed the lead mid-way through the second half .
his close-range shot was somehow deflected over the bar by heitinga .
spanish right-back sergio ramos also got himself in promising positions , only to fluff his lines .
he did well to get his head on a fifth-minute corner and draw a full-length save from stekelenburg .
but ramos should have done better with a second-half effort , heading over when unmarked six yards out .
the netherlands arguably should have been down to ten men in the first half .
dutch midfielder nigel de jong led with his studs when trying to win a bouncing ball and karate-kicked xabi alonso high in the chest .
the referee only showed yellow . bildunterschrift : de jong 's challenge was verging on assault spanish coach vincente del bosque admitted that his side had been in difficulty at times .
" it was a hard game .
we started well and then they had chances in the second half .
but after that i believed we were slightly superior . " dutch coach bert van marwijk took the defeat with grace , but could not hide his disappointment .
" the best team won .
i am disappointed .
it is a world championship and we have just lost a final . " del bosque again left striker fernando torres out of his starting 11 , preferring barcelona winger pedro , in the same team that started the semifinal win over germany .
torres came on late in extra time , but quickly pulled up injured . the netherlands made two changes to its line-up .
midfielder nigel de jong and right back gregory van der wiel returned to the team after missing the semifinal triumph against uruguay due to suspension . spain were co-favourites before the tournament , but lost their opening game to switzerland .
they got things together to qualify from group h , and have won each of their knockout games just 1-0 . third defeat in finals while spain was playing in its first final , the netherlands have now lost the three world cup finals they have competed in .
the oranje were runners-up in 1974 and 1978 .
bert van marwijk 's team knocked out knocked out brazil in the quarterfinal , and scored double the number of goals spain had before this evening . spain became the first european team to win a world cup held outside europe . an estimated 700 million people were watching the game on television around the globe .
however , the stadium itself was about 10,000 people short of being full .
fans were lucky enough to catch a glimpse of former president nelson mandela , who had to miss the opening ceremonies on june 11 after his great-granddaughter died in a car accident .
the icon of south african democracy was driven onto the field in a golf cart .

here , dw ’ s nick amies looks at the key battles which could determine who wins the 2010 world cup . wesley sneijder versus sergio busquets few would dispute that wesley sneijder has been one of the players of the tournament .
the inter milan playmaker has been at the heart of much of holland 's ingenuity and has weighed in with a hugely impressive five goals from his roaming creative role in the midfield .
with mark van bommel and nigel de jong charged with more defensive duties , sneijder will again have the job of driving the dutch on , probing for openings for arjen robben and robin van persie and hitting his own shots from distance .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wesley sneijder will try to bypass spain 's sergio busquets the man whose job it will be to deny sneijder space is sergio busquets .
now barcelona 's first choice defensive midfielder , busquets has already faced off against sneijder in the champions league semi-finals last season and came off second best .
still only 21 , busquets unseated marcos senna from the same role in the spain team and is now the man to patrol ahead of the spanish back four .
he will need to close sneijder down fast , denying him time and space to play in others or shoot , much as he did against mesut oezil and lukas podolski in the semi-final win over germany .
it will not be an easy task but its imperative for spain that he succeeds .
david villa versus joris mathijsen david villa has shown at this world cup why the best teams in europe were all clambering for his signature before the tournament began .
the new barcelona forward has hit five goals on the way to the final and has taken spain 's scoring burden on his shoulders with aplomb .
not the tallest man on the field , villa can still cause problems in the air just by making the effort but his danger lies at his feet .
villa has impeccable timing which , given the quality of the ball-playing midfielders in his team , makes him a deadly striker .
spain like to play across the box and probe for openings and villa is the fox in the box .
it only takes a subtle flick or fast through ball for villa to spring his trap .
precise acceleration means he 's rarely caught offside and with little or no back lift in his shot , he needs very little space to take advantage of an opportunity .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : david villa will have to get past dutch defender joris mathijsen joris mathijsen 's solid performances in south africa have cemented his position as one of holland 's best defenders .
a player who goes about his business with quiet efficiency , mathijsen is a well drilled back who will know all about the threat david villa poses .
much like villa , mathijsen has a low centre of gravity and can turn quickly and accelerate at speed so will be ready to stay with the spain forward should he break .
mathijsen 's performance against uruguay 's diego forlan in the semi-final reduced the striker to long shots .
the dutch will be hoping that mathijsen will frustrate the spanish forward to the same extent – but with a different outcome : forlan scored from distance .
arjen robben versus joan capdevila after laboring a little at the start of the tournament due to an injury picked up in a pre-world cup warm-up game , arjen robben has since shown his most devastating form .
most dangerous when cutting in from the right to aim his lethal left footed shots at goal , robben has turned a number of left-backs inside out over the course of this tournament and shown most of them a clean pair of heels while racing past them .
robben will be allowed to roam at will but will be given the right channel as his own to penetrate , hitting the by-line to deliver crosses or swerving into the area to shoot at goal .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : arjen robben will be looking to torment joan capdevila experienced villareal left-back capdevila will have seen it all before , however , coming up as he did against robben when the dutchman was a real madrid player , but questions remain over whether his aging legs will be able to cope this time around .
capdevila 's head is a wise one though and will use his guile as much as his skill to keep an eye on robben with the more athletic sergio ramos likely to be lurking in support just in case .
robben will not have things all his own way though .
capdevila still possesses enough speed to threaten as an overlapping attacking option and the dutchman may be forced to track back to prevent the spaniard from getting into dangerous positions behind him .

xavi will bring the ball into van bommel 's zone and look to draw him into either making a rash tackle within striking distance of the goal , or pull him out of position enough to bypass him with threaded passes .
with iniesta buzzing round him and xavi forcing him to chase clipped exchanges , van bommel needs to be disciplined .
xavi 's goal threat has been reduced in recent years but his damage comes from playing people in .

but questions still surround the tragedy . some 40,000 people gathered sunday in the bosnian town of srebrenica , where the massacre widely described as europe 's worst atrocity since world war ii occurred 15 years ago .
srebrenica was a un-protected enclave besieged by bosnian serb forces throughout the 1992-95 war .
but un troops there were quickly overrun when the serbs entered the town , rounded up its bosnian muslim population and killed more than 8,000 men and boys .
as part of sunday 's ceremony , 775 recently identified massacre victims in coffins draped in green were interred at the potocari war cemetery , where more than 4,500 are already buried .
several world leaders attended the commemoration ceremony , including us president barack obama , british prime minister david cameron and turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan .
recognizing the international community 's failure to respond to the bloody bosnian war , obama called the massacre " a stain on our collective conscience . "
also at the ceremony was serbian president boris tadic , whose presence many bosnians resented .
serbia has been criticized for its perceived reluctance to capture ratko mladic , the general who led the attack on srebrenica .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un soldiers reinforce defensive positions in sarajevo during the 1992-1995 bosnian war slow search for victims on friday , thousands of people lined the main street of sarajevo as trucks bearing more coffins passed through on the way to srebrenica , some 100 miles to the south-east in eastern bosnia .
in the drina valley , the remains of 8,372 victims of the massacre have been exhumed from 275 mass graves in recent years .
so far 6,557 victims have been identified , and many more murdered muslim civilians are still missing .
the search is slow and tedious , as corpses were tossed into mass graves , often to be dug up again later with bulldozers only to be hastily buried again elsewhere . manfred eisele , an army major general in the german armed forces responsible for planning the un 's peacekeeping operations from 1994 to 1998 , said that 15 years after the srebrenica massacre , it was still difficult to shed light on events . he said he had doubts that those responsible in the un security council had the power or the intention to guarantee the protection of the 40,000 muslim civilians in the srebrenica " safe area . "
' they did n't prevent the drama ' many analysts now place much of the blame for the genocide on the dutch government . fearing for the safety of its 450 soldiers stationed in the area , the dutch government failed to order a un-proposed air attack on serb troops .
the dutch were easily overpowered and the massacre unfolded .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ex-bosnian-serb general ratko mladic is wanted for crimes against humanity german lawyer axel hagedorn , who represents about 8,000 relatives of the victims , is trying to invalidate the un 's immunity before the highest court in the netherlands , as well as the european court of justice .
" the un has a clear responsibility , it should have decided against the dutch , " hagedorn said .
" if the un had to go to court , then it would no longer be possible for the dutch state to blame the un , or the un to blame the dutch state , which is what 's happening now . "
lessons of history the massacre of srebrenica , but also the genocide in rwanda and cambodia , are seen as signs of the un 's failure . the united nations still has not learned its lesson , general eisele said .
" the readiness of states to take responsibility for hard-pressed minorities and also to recognize this protective responsibility is still dramatically underdeveloped , " he said .
" a direct consequence can be seen in the nato deployment … for the kosovo-albanians , who were subjected to massive human rights violations by their own government . "
today , only about three to five percent of the population in srebrenica is muslim , most of them women still searching for relatives .
many families went into exile to canada , new zealand and the united states .

as part of sunday 's ceremony , 775 recently identified massacre victims in coffins draped in green were interred at the potocari war cemetery , where more than 4,500 are already buried .
several world leaders attended the commemoration ceremony , including us president barack obama , british prime minister david cameron and turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan .
recognizing the international community 's failure to respond to the bloody bosnian war , obama called the massacre " a stain on our collective conscience . "
also at the ceremony was serbian president boris tadic , whose presence many bosnians resented .
serbia has been criticized for its perceived reluctance to capture ratko mladic , the general who led the attack on srebrenica .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un soldiers reinforce defensive positions in sarajevo during the 1992-1995 bosnian war slow search for victims on friday , thousands of people lined the main street of sarajevo as trucks bearing more coffins passed through on the way to srebrenica , some 100 miles to the south-east in eastern bosnia .
in the drina valley , the remains of 8,372 victims of the massacre have been exhumed from 275 mass graves in recent years .
so far 6,557 victims have been identified , and many more murdered muslim civilians are still missing .

"
' they did n't prevent the drama ' many analysts now place much of the blame for the genocide on the dutch government . fearing for the safety of its 450 soldiers stationed in the area , the dutch government failed to order a un-proposed air attack on serb troops .

" if the un had to go to court , then it would no longer be possible for the dutch state to blame the un , or the un to blame the dutch state , which is what 's happening now . "
lessons of history the massacre of srebrenica , but also the genocide in rwanda and cambodia , are seen as signs of the un 's failure . the united nations still has not learned its lesson , general eisele said .
" the readiness of states to take responsibility for hard-pressed minorities and also to recognize this protective responsibility is still dramatically underdeveloped , " he said .
" a direct consequence can be seen in the nato deployment … for the kosovo-albanians , who were subjected to massive human rights violations by their own government . "

as part of sunday 's ceremony , 775 recently identified massacre victims in coffins draped in green were interred at the potocari war cemetery , where more than 4,500 are already buried .
several world leaders attended the commemoration ceremony , including us president barack obama , british prime minister david cameron and turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan .
recognizing the international community 's failure to respond to the bloody bosnian war , obama called the massacre " a stain on our collective conscience . "
also at the ceremony was serbian president boris tadic , whose presence many bosnians resented .
serbia has been criticized for its perceived reluctance to capture ratko mladic , the general who led the attack on srebrenica .

spain beat the netherlands 1-0 , with the barcelona man netting late in extra-time , after 90 minutes failed to produce a goal . spain has won its first world cup , overcoming the netherlands at soccer city stadium , johannesburg .
vicente del bosque 's team , favorites before the tournament began , confirmed their place at the top of the soccer world , two years after claiming the 2008 european championship .
andres iniesta scored the extra-time goal which secured the prize .
the barcelona midfielder collected a pass from cesc fabregas and fired a right-foot shot that beat maarten stekelenburg in the dutch goal .
the breakthrough came in the 116th minute of the game .
" it 's incredible , " said iniesta after the match .
" there are n't the words to describe what i am feeling . "
bildunterschrift : iniesta scored after receiving a pass from fabregas deep into extra time the game only really came alive in extra time , after an uninspiring first 90 minutes in which the referee was often at the center of attention . twelve players were shown yellow , while dutch defender johnny heitinga saw red with ten minutes of extra time remaining .
heitinga pulled iniesta back on the edge of the box , and howard webb gave him his marching orders .
both sides had chances to win it in the added 30 minutes .
spanish substitute cesc fabregas could n't provide the finish when one-on-one , while joris mathijsen headed a corner over the bar from inside the six yard box at the other end .
spain were marginally the better team in normal time , although the netherlands had the best opening . arjen robben was played through by wesley sneijder and , one-on-one with iker casillas , could only hit his shot against the goalkeeper 's foot .
the bayern winger 's pace continued to cause the spanish defense problems , as the netherlands played on the counter attack .
spain tried to play their brand of intricate football , but were not at their fluid best .
dangerman david villa thought he had grabbed the lead mid-way through the second half .
his close-range shot was somehow deflected over the bar by heitinga .
spanish right-back sergio ramos also got himself in promising positions , only to fluff his lines .
he did well to get his head on a fifth-minute corner and draw a full-length save from stekelenburg .
but ramos should have done better with a second-half effort , heading over when unmarked six yards out .
the netherlands arguably should have been down to ten men in the first half .
dutch midfielder nigel de jong led with his studs when trying to win a bouncing ball and karate-kicked xabi alonso high in the chest .
the referee only showed yellow . bildunterschrift : de jong 's challenge was verging on assault spanish coach vincente del bosque admitted that his side had been in difficulty at times .
" it was a hard game .
we started well and then they had chances in the second half .
but after that i believed we were slightly superior . " dutch coach bert van marwijk took the defeat with grace , but could not hide his disappointment .
" the best team won .
i am disappointed .
it is a world championship and we have just lost a final . " del bosque again left striker fernando torres out of his starting 11 , preferring barcelona winger pedro , in the same team that started the semifinal win over germany .
torres came on late in extra time , but quickly pulled up injured . the netherlands made two changes to its line-up .
midfielder nigel de jong and right back gregory van der wiel returned to the team after missing the semifinal triumph against uruguay due to suspension . spain were co-favourites before the tournament , but lost their opening game to switzerland .
they got things together to qualify from group h , and have won each of their knockout games just 1-0 . third defeat in finals while spain was playing in its first final , the netherlands have now lost the three world cup finals they have competed in .
the oranje were runners-up in 1974 and 1978 .
bert van marwijk 's team knocked out knocked out brazil in the quarterfinal , and scored double the number of goals spain had before this evening . spain became the first european team to win a world cup held outside europe . an estimated 700 million people were watching the game on television around the globe .
however , the stadium itself was about 10,000 people short of being full .
fans were lucky enough to catch a glimpse of former president nelson mandela , who had to miss the opening ceremonies on june 11 after his great-granddaughter died in a car accident .
the icon of south african democracy was driven onto the field in a golf cart .

spain beat the netherlands 1-0 , with the barcelona man netting late in extra-time , after 90 minutes failed to produce a goal . spain has won its first world cup , overcoming the netherlands at soccer city stadium , johannesburg .
vicente del bosque 's team , favorites before the tournament began , confirmed their place at the top of the soccer world , two years after claiming the 2008 european championship .
andres iniesta scored the extra-time goal which secured the prize .
the barcelona midfielder collected a pass from cesc fabregas and fired a right-foot shot that beat maarten stekelenburg in the dutch goal .
the breakthrough came in the 116th minute of the game .
" it 's incredible , " said iniesta after the match .
" there are n't the words to describe what i am feeling . "
bildunterschrift : iniesta scored after receiving a pass from fabregas deep into extra time the game only really came alive in extra time , after an uninspiring first 90 minutes in which the referee was often at the center of attention . twelve players were shown yellow , while dutch defender johnny heitinga saw red with ten minutes of extra time remaining .
heitinga pulled iniesta back on the edge of the box , and howard webb gave him his marching orders .
both sides had chances to win it in the added 30 minutes .
spanish substitute cesc fabregas could n't provide the finish when one-on-one , while joris mathijsen headed a corner over the bar from inside the six yard box at the other end .
spain were marginally the better team in normal time , although the netherlands had the best opening . arjen robben was played through by wesley sneijder and , one-on-one with iker casillas , could only hit his shot against the goalkeeper 's foot .
the bayern winger 's pace continued to cause the spanish defense problems , as the netherlands played on the counter attack .
spain tried to play their brand of intricate football , but were not at their fluid best .
dangerman david villa thought he had grabbed the lead mid-way through the second half .
his close-range shot was somehow deflected over the bar by heitinga .
spanish right-back sergio ramos also got himself in promising positions , only to fluff his lines .
he did well to get his head on a fifth-minute corner and draw a full-length save from stekelenburg .
but ramos should have done better with a second-half effort , heading over when unmarked six yards out .
the netherlands arguably should have been down to ten men in the first half .
dutch midfielder nigel de jong led with his studs when trying to win a bouncing ball and karate-kicked xabi alonso high in the chest .
the referee only showed yellow . bildunterschrift : de jong 's challenge was verging on assault spanish coach vincente del bosque admitted that his side had been in difficulty at times .
" it was a hard game .
we started well and then they had chances in the second half .
but after that i believed we were slightly superior . " dutch coach bert van marwijk took the defeat with grace , but could not hide his disappointment .
" the best team won .
i am disappointed .
it is a world championship and we have just lost a final . " del bosque again left striker fernando torres out of his starting 11 , preferring barcelona winger pedro , in the same team that started the semifinal win over germany .
torres came on late in extra time , but quickly pulled up injured . the netherlands made two changes to its line-up .
midfielder nigel de jong and right back gregory van der wiel returned to the team after missing the semifinal triumph against uruguay due to suspension . spain were co-favourites before the tournament , but lost their opening game to switzerland .
they got things together to qualify from group h , and have won each of their knockout games just 1-0 . third defeat in finals while spain was playing in its first final , the netherlands have now lost the three world cup finals they have competed in .
the oranje were runners-up in 1974 and 1978 .
bert van marwijk 's team knocked out knocked out brazil in the quarterfinal , and scored double the number of goals spain had before this evening . spain became the first european team to win a world cup held outside europe . an estimated 700 million people were watching the game on television around the globe .

he had an impressive cv but did he have the vision to lead the most potent attacking team on earth ?
on sunday , he leads them into the world cup final . in the hysteria that surrounded spain after they won their first ever trophy at the european championships in 2008 , it was easy to forget one of the more unsavoury chapters of their recent history , given their imperious march to the title in austria and switzerland .
it took place in 2004 when most of the spain team who would go on to become european champions were just starting to come through and show promise .
their coach at the time , luis aragones , allegedly used a racist slur to motivate striker jose antonio reyes to stand up to thierry henry of france .
while the comment itself was deplorable enough , the spanish fa 's reluctance to take action was even more so .
aragones was , of course , allowed to stay in his job and four years after the scandal , he led spain to the euro 2008 title .
the glory of that achievement , and the belief of his supporters that he was just a ' man of his time , ' glossed over the fact that aragones was seen by many as a difficult , volatile man and an opinionated , abusive coach .
but he got results , and as such , he was tolerated and indulged .
two years on and spain have the chance to claim the ultimate title when they face the netherlands in the final of the 2010 fifa world cup on sunday .
they have lost only two games in the last 55 they 've played and have shown the same confidence and class in south africa as they did in austria and switzerland .
if they win the world cup , it will be an achievement which will put even winning euro 2008 in the shade .
has all this been achieved with a raging , anachronistic coach at the helm ?
has a ' man of his time ' used bullying tactics to take this team to within one game of being crowned champions of the world ?
the answer is of course no .
vicente del bosque , a man and coach infinitely less brash or controversial than his predecessor , has brought spain to the cusp of winning the greatest prize with his mixture of calm advice and fatherly protection .
coach sticks with successful tactics but changes atmosphere del bosque is the polar opposite of the combustible aragones and yet the team has n't suffered from such a radical change at the top .
from the day he took over as coach , he insisted that nothing would change on the pitch .
spain had just enjoyed its finest hour and del bosque knew not to rock the boat by shaking up the system .
he kept the nucleus of the euro 2008 team intact along with aragones ' tactical plan .
it was n't broken , so why fix it ?
bildunterschrift : del bosque recognised that spain did not need rebuilding on the pitch but needed calm off it instead , he changed the approach off the pitch , replacing the haranguing of players with the quiet coaxing which had got the best out of the real madrid teams he had coached in the past .
the result is a happy , comfortable squad in which the potentially damaging barcelona-real madrid split has no place .
if no complaints about del bosque or rumours of feuds among players have leaked from the dressing room it is because there have n't been any .
the players have been made to feel they are partners in the team 's success by del bosque 's inclusive approach .
after weathering the storm of criticism which followed the switzerland defeat in spain 's first game in south africa , the quiet man of spanish soccer consulted those who knew best what went wrong – his players .
together they worked out how to put things right .
some saw this as weakness , as deferring to the players .
del bosque knew it was a way to win trust and cement a bond .
it was intelligent , not weak .
a thoughtful man , unafraid to make difficult decisions while he has been accused of being too gentle in the past , del bosque is no push over and is certainly not afraid of making big decisions .
he left out in-form players such as marcus senna , daniel aranzubia and alvarao dominguez from his final squad list and has shown during the tournament that there 's no place for sentiment by benching the misfiring fernando torres for the semi-final defeat of germany .
having had his fair share of dealing with difficult choices in club management , del bosque has handled the national set-up with aplomb .
bildunterschrift : the spain coach has brought in the players he needed to make the existing system operate better del bosque arrived as coach with an envious reputation for success .
as real madrid coach , the former los blancos defender won the champions league twice , la liga twice and the europa league during his four seasons in charge .
his dismissal – for being too docile and not marketable enough to coach the galacticos project – is one of the biggest stains on real madrid 's increasingly tainted record .
despite his long-standing allegiance to real , del bosque is astute enough not to buy into the club rivalries .
he picks the players who fit the system , regardless of their team colours .
find the player for the system , not the other way round del bosque has been forced by necessity to change certain things in the team line-up but he has been keen to point out that his additions are more about evolution than revolution .
fresh legs in the form of the barcelona trio pedro , sergi busquets and gerard pique have been installed to give the system new bite but the coach has n't tampered with anything for the sake of adding a certain player .
the ideal player is found to play a certain position in the system – not the other way round .
now del bosque has the chance to add the world cup to the european title won by his predecessor with a team that knows exactly what it is doing after years of honing a devastating pressing game built around some of the best ball players and passers in the world .
and it did n't take a lot of shouting and swearing .

here , dw ’ s nick amies looks at the key battles which could determine who wins the 2010 world cup . wesley sneijder versus sergio busquets few would dispute that wesley sneijder has been one of the players of the tournament .
the inter milan playmaker has been at the heart of much of holland 's ingenuity and has weighed in with a hugely impressive five goals from his roaming creative role in the midfield .
with mark van bommel and nigel de jong charged with more defensive duties , sneijder will again have the job of driving the dutch on , probing for openings for arjen robben and robin van persie and hitting his own shots from distance .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wesley sneijder will try to bypass spain 's sergio busquets the man whose job it will be to deny sneijder space is sergio busquets .
now barcelona 's first choice defensive midfielder , busquets has already faced off against sneijder in the champions league semi-finals last season and came off second best .
still only 21 , busquets unseated marcos senna from the same role in the spain team and is now the man to patrol ahead of the spanish back four .
he will need to close sneijder down fast , denying him time and space to play in others or shoot , much as he did against mesut oezil and lukas podolski in the semi-final win over germany .
it will not be an easy task but its imperative for spain that he succeeds .
david villa versus joris mathijsen david villa has shown at this world cup why the best teams in europe were all clambering for his signature before the tournament began .
the new barcelona forward has hit five goals on the way to the final and has taken spain 's scoring burden on his shoulders with aplomb .
not the tallest man on the field , villa can still cause problems in the air just by making the effort but his danger lies at his feet .
villa has impeccable timing which , given the quality of the ball-playing midfielders in his team , makes him a deadly striker .
spain like to play across the box and probe for openings and villa is the fox in the box .
it only takes a subtle flick or fast through ball for villa to spring his trap .
precise acceleration means he 's rarely caught offside and with little or no back lift in his shot , he needs very little space to take advantage of an opportunity .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : david villa will have to get past dutch defender joris mathijsen joris mathijsen 's solid performances in south africa have cemented his position as one of holland 's best defenders .
a player who goes about his business with quiet efficiency , mathijsen is a well drilled back who will know all about the threat david villa poses .
much like villa , mathijsen has a low centre of gravity and can turn quickly and accelerate at speed so will be ready to stay with the spain forward should he break .
mathijsen 's performance against uruguay 's diego forlan in the semi-final reduced the striker to long shots .
the dutch will be hoping that mathijsen will frustrate the spanish forward to the same extent – but with a different outcome : forlan scored from distance .
arjen robben versus joan capdevila after laboring a little at the start of the tournament due to an injury picked up in a pre-world cup warm-up game , arjen robben has since shown his most devastating form .
most dangerous when cutting in from the right to aim his lethal left footed shots at goal , robben has turned a number of left-backs inside out over the course of this tournament and shown most of them a clean pair of heels while racing past them .
robben will be allowed to roam at will but will be given the right channel as his own to penetrate , hitting the by-line to deliver crosses or swerving into the area to shoot at goal .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : arjen robben will be looking to torment joan capdevila experienced villareal left-back capdevila will have seen it all before , however , coming up as he did against robben when the dutchman was a real madrid player , but questions remain over whether his aging legs will be able to cope this time around .
capdevila 's head is a wise one though and will use his guile as much as his skill to keep an eye on robben with the more athletic sergio ramos likely to be lurking in support just in case .
robben will not have things all his own way though .
capdevila still possesses enough speed to threaten as an overlapping attacking option and the dutchman may be forced to track back to prevent the spaniard from getting into dangerous positions behind him .
andres iniesta versus nigel de jong it 's no surprise that spain 's return to confidence and competence has coincided with the recovery of andres iniesta from injury .
while xavi hernandez probes , iniesta flits and darts like a dragonfly around his midfield partner , collecting and poking short tactical passes to him before nipping past perplexed defenders .
given a similar brief to wesley sneijder , iniesta ghosts around in front of the back four , ready to play the killer ball to david villa or feint his way into his own goal-scoring position .
germany 's bastian schweinsteiger - who looked imperious until the semi-final - was made to look ordinary by iniesta on wednesday night while sami khedira was constantly pulled out of position by his movement .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tricky andres iniesta faces tough tackling nigel de jong nigel de jong will probably interchange with mark van bommel when it comes to dealing with xavi and iniesta as they approach the dutch back four , but de jong is more likely to get the first bite at iniesta due to his better mobility .
de jong has matured into a more intelligent yet still very combative defensive midfielder after coming under criticism for his often overly-physical game .
he 'll need his wits about him to deal with iniesta but armed as he is now with a fully engaged brain to go with his quick feet , de jong 's defenders will be well protected .
xavi hernandez versus mark van bommel mark van bommel has drawn both praise and jeers for his all-action approach to games at this world cup , drawing widespread criticism for a number of fully committed tackles which have left opponents wincing .
a volatile player who has a reputation for niggly fouls and a fast mouth , van bommel 's temperament has been a source of debate for most of his career .
however , his performances as a whole have been outstanding in south africa and his team 's defensive record has as much to do with his policing of the region in front of the penalty area as it does the actual defensive work of the back four .
facing spain , a team who will spend a lot of time in his neighborhood , means that van bommel will have a busy evening on sunday and he will have to keep his cool under what will be a concerted amount of pressure .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : xavi hernandez goes head-to-head with mark van bommel xavi will be a constant threat to van bommel 's peace .
both he and iniesta will be right in the dutchman 's face , leaving the languid build up behind them to the likes of xabi alonso and busquets .
xavi will bring the ball into van bommel 's zone and look to draw him into either making a rash tackle within striking distance of the goal , or pull him out of position enough to bypass him with threaded passes .
with iniesta buzzing round him and xavi forcing him to chase clipped exchanges , van bommel needs to be disciplined .
xavi 's goal threat has been reduced in recent years but his damage comes from playing people in .
he will hope that the dutch get frustrated by chasing the game before choosing the moment to strike .

he had an impressive cv but did he have the vision to lead the most potent attacking team on earth ?
on sunday , he leads them into the world cup final . in the hysteria that surrounded spain after they won their first ever trophy at the european championships in 2008 , it was easy to forget one of the more unsavoury chapters of their recent history , given their imperious march to the title in austria and switzerland .
it took place in 2004 when most of the spain team who would go on to become european champions were just starting to come through and show promise .
their coach at the time , luis aragones , allegedly used a racist slur to motivate striker jose antonio reyes to stand up to thierry henry of france .
while the comment itself was deplorable enough , the spanish fa 's reluctance to take action was even more so .
aragones was , of course , allowed to stay in his job and four years after the scandal , he led spain to the euro 2008 title .
the glory of that achievement , and the belief of his supporters that he was just a ' man of his time , ' glossed over the fact that aragones was seen by many as a difficult , volatile man and an opinionated , abusive coach .
but he got results , and as such , he was tolerated and indulged .
two years on and spain have the chance to claim the ultimate title when they face the netherlands in the final of the 2010 fifa world cup on sunday .
they have lost only two games in the last 55 they 've played and have shown the same confidence and class in south africa as they did in austria and switzerland .
if they win the world cup , it will be an achievement which will put even winning euro 2008 in the shade .
has all this been achieved with a raging , anachronistic coach at the helm ?
has a ' man of his time ' used bullying tactics to take this team to within one game of being crowned champions of the world ?
the answer is of course no .
vicente del bosque , a man and coach infinitely less brash or controversial than his predecessor , has brought spain to the cusp of winning the greatest prize with his mixture of calm advice and fatherly protection .
coach sticks with successful tactics but changes atmosphere del bosque is the polar opposite of the combustible aragones and yet the team has n't suffered from such a radical change at the top .
from the day he took over as coach , he insisted that nothing would change on the pitch .
spain had just enjoyed its finest hour and del bosque knew not to rock the boat by shaking up the system .
he kept the nucleus of the euro 2008 team intact along with aragones ' tactical plan .
it was n't broken , so why fix it ?
bildunterschrift : del bosque recognised that spain did not need rebuilding on the pitch but needed calm off it instead , he changed the approach off the pitch , replacing the haranguing of players with the quiet coaxing which had got the best out of the real madrid teams he had coached in the past .
the result is a happy , comfortable squad in which the potentially damaging barcelona-real madrid split has no place .
if no complaints about del bosque or rumours of feuds among players have leaked from the dressing room it is because there have n't been any .
the players have been made to feel they are partners in the team 's success by del bosque 's inclusive approach .
after weathering the storm of criticism which followed the switzerland defeat in spain 's first game in south africa , the quiet man of spanish soccer consulted those who knew best what went wrong – his players .
together they worked out how to put things right .
some saw this as weakness , as deferring to the players .
del bosque knew it was a way to win trust and cement a bond .
it was intelligent , not weak .
a thoughtful man , unafraid to make difficult decisions while he has been accused of being too gentle in the past , del bosque is no push over and is certainly not afraid of making big decisions .
he left out in-form players such as marcus senna , daniel aranzubia and alvarao dominguez from his final squad list and has shown during the tournament that there 's no place for sentiment by benching the misfiring fernando torres for the semi-final defeat of germany .
having had his fair share of dealing with difficult choices in club management , del bosque has handled the national set-up with aplomb .
bildunterschrift : the spain coach has brought in the players he needed to make the existing system operate better del bosque arrived as coach with an envious reputation for success .
as real madrid coach , the former los blancos defender won the champions league twice , la liga twice and the europa league during his four seasons in charge .
his dismissal – for being too docile and not marketable enough to coach the galacticos project – is one of the biggest stains on real madrid 's increasingly tainted record .
despite his long-standing allegiance to real , del bosque is astute enough not to buy into the club rivalries .
he picks the players who fit the system , regardless of their team colours .
find the player for the system , not the other way round del bosque has been forced by necessity to change certain things in the team line-up but he has been keen to point out that his additions are more about evolution than revolution .
fresh legs in the form of the barcelona trio pedro , sergi busquets and gerard pique have been installed to give the system new bite but the coach has n't tampered with anything for the sake of adding a certain player .
the ideal player is found to play a certain position in the system – not the other way round .
now del bosque has the chance to add the world cup to the european title won by his predecessor with a team that knows exactly what it is doing after years of honing a devastating pressing game built around some of the best ball players and passers in the world .
and it did n't take a lot of shouting and swearing .

he had an impressive cv but did he have the vision to lead the most potent attacking team on earth ?
on sunday , he leads them into the world cup final . in the hysteria that surrounded spain after they won their first ever trophy at the european championships in 2008 , it was easy to forget one of the more unsavoury chapters of their recent history , given their imperious march to the title in austria and switzerland .
it took place in 2004 when most of the spain team who would go on to become european champions were just starting to come through and show promise .
their coach at the time , luis aragones , allegedly used a racist slur to motivate striker jose antonio reyes to stand up to thierry henry of france .
while the comment itself was deplorable enough , the spanish fa 's reluctance to take action was even more so .
aragones was , of course , allowed to stay in his job and four years after the scandal , he led spain to the euro 2008 title .
the glory of that achievement , and the belief of his supporters that he was just a ' man of his time , ' glossed over the fact that aragones was seen by many as a difficult , volatile man and an opinionated , abusive coach .
but he got results , and as such , he was tolerated and indulged .
two years on and spain have the chance to claim the ultimate title when they face the netherlands in the final of the 2010 fifa world cup on sunday .
they have lost only two games in the last 55 they 've played and have shown the same confidence and class in south africa as they did in austria and switzerland .
if they win the world cup , it will be an achievement which will put even winning euro 2008 in the shade .
has all this been achieved with a raging , anachronistic coach at the helm ?
has a ' man of his time ' used bullying tactics to take this team to within one game of being crowned champions of the world ?
the answer is of course no .
vicente del bosque , a man and coach infinitely less brash or controversial than his predecessor , has brought spain to the cusp of winning the greatest prize with his mixture of calm advice and fatherly protection .
coach sticks with successful tactics but changes atmosphere del bosque is the polar opposite of the combustible aragones and yet the team has n't suffered from such a radical change at the top .
from the day he took over as coach , he insisted that nothing would change on the pitch .
spain had just enjoyed its finest hour and del bosque knew not to rock the boat by shaking up the system .
he kept the nucleus of the euro 2008 team intact along with aragones ' tactical plan .
it was n't broken , so why fix it ?
bildunterschrift : del bosque recognised that spain did not need rebuilding on the pitch but needed calm off it instead , he changed the approach off the pitch , replacing the haranguing of players with the quiet coaxing which had got the best out of the real madrid teams he had coached in the past .
the result is a happy , comfortable squad in which the potentially damaging barcelona-real madrid split has no place .
if no complaints about del bosque or rumours of feuds among players have leaked from the dressing room it is because there have n't been any .
the players have been made to feel they are partners in the team 's success by del bosque 's inclusive approach .
after weathering the storm of criticism which followed the switzerland defeat in spain 's first game in south africa , the quiet man of spanish soccer consulted those who knew best what went wrong – his players .
together they worked out how to put things right .
some saw this as weakness , as deferring to the players .
del bosque knew it was a way to win trust and cement a bond .
it was intelligent , not weak .
a thoughtful man , unafraid to make difficult decisions while he has been accused of being too gentle in the past , del bosque is no push over and is certainly not afraid of making big decisions .
he left out in-form players such as marcus senna , daniel aranzubia and alvarao dominguez from his final squad list and has shown during the tournament that there 's no place for sentiment by benching the misfiring fernando torres for the semi-final defeat of germany .
having had his fair share of dealing with difficult choices in club management , del bosque has handled the national set-up with aplomb .
bildunterschrift : the spain coach has brought in the players he needed to make the existing system operate better del bosque arrived as coach with an envious reputation for success .
as real madrid coach , the former los blancos defender won the champions league twice , la liga twice and the europa league during his four seasons in charge .
his dismissal – for being too docile and not marketable enough to coach the galacticos project – is one of the biggest stains on real madrid 's increasingly tainted record .
despite his long-standing allegiance to real , del bosque is astute enough not to buy into the club rivalries .
he picks the players who fit the system , regardless of their team colours .
find the player for the system , not the other way round del bosque has been forced by necessity to change certain things in the team line-up but he has been keen to point out that his additions are more about evolution than revolution .
fresh legs in the form of the barcelona trio pedro , sergi busquets and gerard pique have been installed to give the system new bite but the coach has n't tampered with anything for the sake of adding a certain player .
the ideal player is found to play a certain position in the system – not the other way round .
now del bosque has the chance to add the world cup to the european title won by his predecessor with a team that knows exactly what it is doing after years of honing a devastating pressing game built around some of the best ball players and passers in the world .
and it did n't take a lot of shouting and swearing .

spain had just enjoyed its finest hour and del bosque knew not to rock the boat by shaking up the system .
he kept the nucleus of the euro 2008 team intact along with aragones ' tactical plan .
it was n't broken , so why fix it ?
bildunterschrift : del bosque recognised that spain did not need rebuilding on the pitch but needed calm off it instead , he changed the approach off the pitch , replacing the haranguing of players with the quiet coaxing which had got the best out of the real madrid teams he had coached in the past .
the result is a happy , comfortable squad in which the potentially damaging barcelona-real madrid split has no place .
if no complaints about del bosque or rumours of feuds among players have leaked from the dressing room it is because there have n't been any .
the players have been made to feel they are partners in the team 's success by del bosque 's inclusive approach .
after weathering the storm of criticism which followed the switzerland defeat in spain 's first game in south africa , the quiet man of spanish soccer consulted those who knew best what went wrong – his players .
together they worked out how to put things right .
some saw this as weakness , as deferring to the players .
del bosque knew it was a way to win trust and cement a bond .
it was intelligent , not weak .
a thoughtful man , unafraid to make difficult decisions while he has been accused of being too gentle in the past , del bosque is no push over and is certainly not afraid of making big decisions .
he left out in-form players such as marcus senna , daniel aranzubia and alvarao dominguez from his final squad list and has shown during the tournament that there 's no place for sentiment by benching the misfiring fernando torres for the semi-final defeat of germany .
having had his fair share of dealing with difficult choices in club management , del bosque has handled the national set-up with aplomb .
bildunterschrift : the spain coach has brought in the players he needed to make the existing system operate better del bosque arrived as coach with an envious reputation for success .
as real madrid coach , the former los blancos defender won the champions league twice , la liga twice and the europa league during his four seasons in charge .
his dismissal – for being too docile and not marketable enough to coach the galacticos project – is one of the biggest stains on real madrid 's increasingly tainted record .
despite his long-standing allegiance to real , del bosque is astute enough not to buy into the club rivalries .
he picks the players who fit the system , regardless of their team colours .
find the player for the system , not the other way round del bosque has been forced by necessity to change certain things in the team line-up but he has been keen to point out that his additions are more about evolution than revolution .
fresh legs in the form of the barcelona trio pedro , sergi busquets and gerard pique have been installed to give the system new bite but the coach has n't tampered with anything for the sake of adding a certain player .
the ideal player is found to play a certain position in the system – not the other way round .
now del bosque has the chance to add the world cup to the european title won by his predecessor with a team that knows exactly what it is doing after years of honing a devastating pressing game built around some of the best ball players and passers in the world .
and it did n't take a lot of shouting and swearing .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : dossier : 2010 fifa world cup spain , netherlands , germany dominate dw top xi spain 's world cup win down to possession , not goals youthful germany hold heads high and look to future spanish enjoy football fiesta after victory over devastated dutch world cup -pipe- 11.07.2010 spain , netherlands gear up for clash to be world 's best großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : both finalists have a number of potential match winners in what is an intriguing match-up , spain and the netherlands meet in the world cup final in johannesburg on sunday night .
here , dw ’ s nick amies looks at the key battles which could determine who wins the 2010 world cup . wesley sneijder versus sergio busquets few would dispute that wesley sneijder has been one of the players of the tournament .
the inter milan playmaker has been at the heart of much of holland 's ingenuity and has weighed in with a hugely impressive five goals from his roaming creative role in the midfield .
with mark van bommel and nigel de jong charged with more defensive duties , sneijder will again have the job of driving the dutch on , probing for openings for arjen robben and robin van persie and hitting his own shots from distance .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wesley sneijder will try to bypass spain 's sergio busquets the man whose job it will be to deny sneijder space is sergio busquets .
now barcelona 's first choice defensive midfielder , busquets has already faced off against sneijder in the champions league semi-finals last season and came off second best .
still only 21 , busquets unseated marcos senna from the same role in the spain team and is now the man to patrol ahead of the spanish back four .
he will need to close sneijder down fast , denying him time and space to play in others or shoot , much as he did against mesut oezil and lukas podolski in the semi-final win over germany .
it will not be an easy task but its imperative for spain that he succeeds .
david villa versus joris mathijsen david villa has shown at this world cup why the best teams in europe were all clambering for his signature before the tournament began .
the new barcelona forward has hit five goals on the way to the final and has taken spain 's scoring burden on his shoulders with aplomb .
not the tallest man on the field , villa can still cause problems in the air just by making the effort but his danger lies at his feet .
villa has impeccable timing which , given the quality of the ball-playing midfielders in his team , makes him a deadly striker .
spain like to play across the box and probe for openings and villa is the fox in the box .
it only takes a subtle flick or fast through ball for villa to spring his trap .
precise acceleration means he 's rarely caught offside and with little or no back lift in his shot , he needs very little space to take advantage of an opportunity .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : david villa will have to get past dutch defender joris mathijsen joris mathijsen 's solid performances in south africa have cemented his position as one of holland 's best defenders .
a player who goes about his business with quiet efficiency , mathijsen is a well drilled back who will know all about the threat david villa poses .
much like villa , mathijsen has a low centre of gravity and can turn quickly and accelerate at speed so will be ready to stay with the spain forward should he break .
mathijsen 's performance against uruguay 's diego forlan in the semi-final reduced the striker to long shots .
the dutch will be hoping that mathijsen will frustrate the spanish forward to the same extent – but with a different outcome : forlan scored from distance .
arjen robben versus joan capdevila after laboring a little at the start of the tournament due to an injury picked up in a pre-world cup warm-up game , arjen robben has since shown his most devastating form .
most dangerous when cutting in from the right to aim his lethal left footed shots at goal , robben has turned a number of left-backs inside out over the course of this tournament and shown most of them a clean pair of heels while racing past them .
robben will be allowed to roam at will but will be given the right channel as his own to penetrate , hitting the by-line to deliver crosses or swerving into the area to shoot at goal .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : arjen robben will be looking to torment joan capdevila experienced villareal left-back capdevila will have seen it all before , however , coming up as he did against robben when the dutchman was a real madrid player , but questions remain over whether his aging legs will be able to cope this time around .
capdevila 's head is a wise one though and will use his guile as much as his skill to keep an eye on robben with the more athletic sergio ramos likely to be lurking in support just in case .
robben will not have things all his own way though .
capdevila still possesses enough speed to threaten as an overlapping attacking option and the dutchman may be forced to track back to prevent the spaniard from getting into dangerous positions behind him .
andres iniesta versus nigel de jong it 's no surprise that spain 's return to confidence and competence has coincided with the recovery of andres iniesta from injury .
while xavi hernandez probes , iniesta flits and darts like a dragonfly around his midfield partner , collecting and poking short tactical passes to him before nipping past perplexed defenders .
given a similar brief to wesley sneijder , iniesta ghosts around in front of the back four , ready to play the killer ball to david villa or feint his way into his own goal-scoring position .
germany 's bastian schweinsteiger - who looked imperious until the semi-final - was made to look ordinary by iniesta on wednesday night while sami khedira was constantly pulled out of position by his movement .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tricky andres iniesta faces tough tackling nigel de jong nigel de jong will probably interchange with mark van bommel when it comes to dealing with xavi and iniesta as they approach the dutch back four , but de jong is more likely to get the first bite at iniesta due to his better mobility .
de jong has matured into a more intelligent yet still very combative defensive midfielder after coming under criticism for his often overly-physical game .
he 'll need his wits about him to deal with iniesta but armed as he is now with a fully engaged brain to go with his quick feet , de jong 's defenders will be well protected .
xavi hernandez versus mark van bommel mark van bommel has drawn both praise and jeers for his all-action approach to games at this world cup , drawing widespread criticism for a number of fully committed tackles which have left opponents wincing .
a volatile player who has a reputation for niggly fouls and a fast mouth , van bommel 's temperament has been a source of debate for most of his career .
however , his performances as a whole have been outstanding in south africa and his team 's defensive record has as much to do with his policing of the region in front of the penalty area as it does the actual defensive work of the back four .
facing spain , a team who will spend a lot of time in his neighborhood , means that van bommel will have a busy evening on sunday and he will have to keep his cool under what will be a concerted amount of pressure .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : xavi hernandez goes head-to-head with mark van bommel xavi will be a constant threat to van bommel 's peace .
both he and iniesta will be right in the dutchman 's face , leaving the languid build up behind them to the likes of xabi alonso and busquets .
xavi will bring the ball into van bommel 's zone and look to draw him into either making a rash tackle within striking distance of the goal , or pull him out of position enough to bypass him with threaded passes .
with iniesta buzzing round him and xavi forcing him to chase clipped exchanges , van bommel needs to be disciplined .
xavi 's goal threat has been reduced in recent years but his damage comes from playing people in .
he will hope that the dutch get frustrated by chasing the game before choosing the moment to strike .

the " amalthea , " commissioned by a libyan charity , will not attempt to break the israeli blockade . a ship , loaded with humanitarian aid destined for palestinians in the gaza strip , has set sail from greece for the egyptian port of el-arish .
following intense diplomatic pressure from israel , the ship , which has been chartered by a libyan charity , will not attempt to break through the israeli blockade .
israeli defense minister ehud barak called the libyan aid vessel 's planned journey an " unnecessary provocation . "
the aid shipment will be transported overland from el-arish to the palestinian enclave in the hamas-controlled gaza strip .
greek radio said there were 27 people on board the " amalthea , " including 13 libyan activists , a nigerian and a syrian national .
the moldavian-flagged , greek-owned cargo ship left from lavrio on saturday afternoon carrying 2,000 tons of food and medical aid supplied by the gaddafi international charity and development association .
the charity is headed by saif al-islam gaddafi , a son of the libyan leader .
the vessel was originally scheduled to sail directly to the gaza strip , but greek diplomatic sources in athens confirmed it would travel instead to el-arish following diplomatic talks between greek deputy foreign minister dimitris droutsas and israeli foreign minister avigdor lieberman .
at the end of may , an international gaza flotilla tried to break through the israeli blockade .
nine people were killed , mainly turkish nationals , when the israeli military intercepted and used force to seize control of the ship .
following widespread international condemnation israel finally agreed to relax the blockade .

we 're proud of you !
that 's what we want to say to our national team .
third place in the world cup is a well-deserved reward for their fantastic performance this time round .
they 've created unforgettable moments .
in years to come we 'll still be saying : do you remember the round of sixteen match against england in south africa 2010 ? that disallowed goal for the english , and the subsequent 4-1 thrashing by our team .
do you remember the quarterfinal against argentina ?
when thomas mueller , bastian schweinsteiger and mesut oezil pulverized the " gauchos " ' defense and sent the pre-match favourites packing with a resounding 4-0 victory ?
from nobodies to stars let 's be honest , who really thought that this young team would create such memorable highlights ?
the german team is now being celebrated across the world for their inspirational offensive football .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche welle 's stefan nestler is dazzled by the german side talented players , who not so long ago were playing for the german football association 's junior team , whom no-one had even heard of abroad , hammered the world 's best into disarray .
international sports reporters became familiar with how to pronounce the names of the german players – and were full of respect for germany 's new football flair .
it was n't only fans at home who were upset when the team met their match in the semi finals against spain .
football fans from across the world reported that they were sorry that this amazing german side had n't made it into the final .
time to perfect their game we do n't need to grieve for what could have been .
this team belongs to the future .
thomas mueller , the biggest discovery of this world cup , is 20 years old , mesut oezil is 21 , sami khedira , 23 .
and even leading players like bastian schweinsteiger or the captain , philipp lahm , are only in their mid twenties .
they can play together for a few more years yet , and have time to perfect their game further .
and other talents are following on behind .
the seeds sown by the german football association in training young players are bearing fruit . above all , the pool of young players , trained to first-class standards , technically and tactically , promises a golden future for german football .
national team coach , joachim loew , should be praised for his part in this success story , in which he has personally played a major hand .
he must be eager to carry on as well .
in this instance , the german football association would be well-advised to hold onto him .
they should follow the motto : never change a winning team !
even if it never quite hit the jackpot .

however , today , many victims of the war crimes have still not been identified . since 2006 , the international committee on missing persons -lrb- icmp -rrb- has used dna analysis to link bone fragments and other organic material buried in bosnia 's mass graves with the dna of potential relatives who have donated their genetic material to be matched up with the victims . qiagen , a german company based in hilden outside dusseldorf in western germany , has developed the technology used for much of the biological and genetic testing . " there are quite a number of difficulties , especially in the extraction of older bones , which have been buried in the ground for years under very adverse conditions , " said scientist mario scherer , who works on samples from bosnia . " the quality of the genetic material in these bones is impaired by chemical and physical agents and processes through decomposition by bacteria very strongly , " he added .

" we also must make sure that no additional external contamination is acquired during the process , " said thomas parsons , the director of forensic science at the international commission on missing persons , in a 2006 interview on qiagen 's website . " the small amounts of dna that we are working with can reach the levels of pcr -lrb- detection of polymerase chain reaction -rrb- technology , so it is easy to pick up any exogenous contamination that may be present , " he added . dna identification is crucial bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dna analysis is the only possibility for identifying the victims , say experts parsons ' colleagues from icmp use qiagen 's techniques to extract genetic molecules from bones that have been buried for 15 years .

however , today , many victims of the war crimes have still not been identified . since 2006 , the international committee on missing persons -lrb- icmp -rrb- has used dna analysis to link bone fragments and other organic material buried in bosnia 's mass graves with the dna of potential relatives who have donated their genetic material to be matched up with the victims . qiagen , a german company based in hilden outside dusseldorf in western germany , has developed the technology used for much of the biological and genetic testing . " there are quite a number of difficulties , especially in the extraction of older bones , which have been buried in the ground for years under very adverse conditions , " said scientist mario scherer , who works on samples from bosnia . " the quality of the genetic material in these bones is impaired by chemical and physical agents and processes through decomposition by bacteria very strongly , " he added .
" the aim is to extract the genetic material as cleanly as possible . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : identification brings closure for the victims ' relatives scherer works mostly with his centrifuge , a blue , futuristic-looking cube just larger than a microwave oven .
it sits on scherer 's laboratory bench and he puts his samples inside , where the biological material can be separated after being spun around at high speed . the genetic material is cleaned with so-called pillars , or plastic tubes filled with a material that binds to the genetic molecules and separates them from interfering substances . special precautions initially , qiagen 's scientists thought that their centrifuge would mainly be used to analyze simple dna sources , such as blood samples . but it soon became clear that the blue cube could also read more problematic samples of genetic molecules , even from bones that have been buried for many years . other scientists working in this field agree that special precautions must be taken even from the moment of extraction from the field . " we also must make sure that no additional external contamination is acquired during the process , " said thomas parsons , the director of forensic science at the international commission on missing persons , in a 2006 interview on qiagen 's website . " the small amounts of dna that we are working with can reach the levels of pcr -lrb- detection of polymerase chain reaction -rrb- technology , so it is easy to pick up any exogenous contamination that may be present , " he added . dna identification is crucial bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dna analysis is the only possibility for identifying the victims , say experts parsons ' colleagues from icmp use qiagen 's techniques to extract genetic molecules from bones that have been buried for 15 years . " dna is really the only mode for identification , " said rene huel , the head of the ipmc laboratory in sarajevo .
" other , more traditional ways of identification could not be applied here in this region . " after the war in bosnia , many thousands of people are still unaccounted for .
many bones discovered in mass graves could not initially be identified .
there are hundreds of bags of bones in cold storage , which are still waiting to be examined . huel added that their job is that much harder because the perpetrators have done everything to conceal the extent of war crimes . " you do not have one individual in one grave site , " he said . " you may have one individual in four or five grave sites .
we try to bring back as much of the body as possible .
to bring back the missing person to the family is one of the big challenges we face . " scientists are able to find dna fragments from the pieces of bone buried around bosnia .
then , they can compare that with the results of dna from possible relatives in the region who have agreed to provide blood samples . since work began , the icmp has been able to describe the fate of more than 15,000 missing people .
during the past 12 months alone , 775 more victims have been identified . the scientists have informed their living relatives so that they can be buried on the anniversary of the srebrenica massacre .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : dossier : 2010 fifa world cup spain , netherlands , germany dominate dw top xi spain 's world cup win down to possession , not goals youthful germany hold heads high and look to future spanish enjoy football fiesta after victory over devastated dutch world cup -pipe- 11.07.2010 spain , netherlands gear up for clash to be world 's best großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : both finalists have a number of potential match winners in what is an intriguing match-up , spain and the netherlands meet in the world cup final in johannesburg on sunday night .
here , dw ’ s nick amies looks at the key battles which could determine who wins the 2010 world cup . wesley sneijder versus sergio busquets few would dispute that wesley sneijder has been one of the players of the tournament .
the inter milan playmaker has been at the heart of much of holland 's ingenuity and has weighed in with a hugely impressive five goals from his roaming creative role in the midfield .
with mark van bommel and nigel de jong charged with more defensive duties , sneijder will again have the job of driving the dutch on , probing for openings for arjen robben and robin van persie and hitting his own shots from distance .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wesley sneijder will try to bypass spain 's sergio busquets the man whose job it will be to deny sneijder space is sergio busquets .
now barcelona 's first choice defensive midfielder , busquets has already faced off against sneijder in the champions league semi-finals last season and came off second best .
still only 21 , busquets unseated marcos senna from the same role in the spain team and is now the man to patrol ahead of the spanish back four .
he will need to close sneijder down fast , denying him time and space to play in others or shoot , much as he did against mesut oezil and lukas podolski in the semi-final win over germany .
it will not be an easy task but its imperative for spain that he succeeds .
david villa versus joris mathijsen david villa has shown at this world cup why the best teams in europe were all clambering for his signature before the tournament began .
the new barcelona forward has hit five goals on the way to the final and has taken spain 's scoring burden on his shoulders with aplomb .
not the tallest man on the field , villa can still cause problems in the air just by making the effort but his danger lies at his feet .
villa has impeccable timing which , given the quality of the ball-playing midfielders in his team , makes him a deadly striker .
spain like to play across the box and probe for openings and villa is the fox in the box .
it only takes a subtle flick or fast through ball for villa to spring his trap .
precise acceleration means he 's rarely caught offside and with little or no back lift in his shot , he needs very little space to take advantage of an opportunity .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : david villa will have to get past dutch defender joris mathijsen joris mathijsen 's solid performances in south africa have cemented his position as one of holland 's best defenders .
a player who goes about his business with quiet efficiency , mathijsen is a well drilled back who will know all about the threat david villa poses .
much like villa , mathijsen has a low centre of gravity and can turn quickly and accelerate at speed so will be ready to stay with the spain forward should he break .
mathijsen 's performance against uruguay 's diego forlan in the semi-final reduced the striker to long shots .
the dutch will be hoping that mathijsen will frustrate the spanish forward to the same extent – but with a different outcome : forlan scored from distance .
arjen robben versus joan capdevila after laboring a little at the start of the tournament due to an injury picked up in a pre-world cup warm-up game , arjen robben has since shown his most devastating form .
most dangerous when cutting in from the right to aim his lethal left footed shots at goal , robben has turned a number of left-backs inside out over the course of this tournament and shown most of them a clean pair of heels while racing past them .
robben will be allowed to roam at will but will be given the right channel as his own to penetrate , hitting the by-line to deliver crosses or swerving into the area to shoot at goal .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : arjen robben will be looking to torment joan capdevila experienced villareal left-back capdevila will have seen it all before , however , coming up as he did against robben when the dutchman was a real madrid player , but questions remain over whether his aging legs will be able to cope this time around .
capdevila 's head is a wise one though and will use his guile as much as his skill to keep an eye on robben with the more athletic sergio ramos likely to be lurking in support just in case .
robben will not have things all his own way though .
capdevila still possesses enough speed to threaten as an overlapping attacking option and the dutchman may be forced to track back to prevent the spaniard from getting into dangerous positions behind him .
andres iniesta versus nigel de jong it 's no surprise that spain 's return to confidence and competence has coincided with the recovery of andres iniesta from injury .
while xavi hernandez probes , iniesta flits and darts like a dragonfly around his midfield partner , collecting and poking short tactical passes to him before nipping past perplexed defenders .
given a similar brief to wesley sneijder , iniesta ghosts around in front of the back four , ready to play the killer ball to david villa or feint his way into his own goal-scoring position .
germany 's bastian schweinsteiger - who looked imperious until the semi-final - was made to look ordinary by iniesta on wednesday night while sami khedira was constantly pulled out of position by his movement .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tricky andres iniesta faces tough tackling nigel de jong nigel de jong will probably interchange with mark van bommel when it comes to dealing with xavi and iniesta as they approach the dutch back four , but de jong is more likely to get the first bite at iniesta due to his better mobility .
de jong has matured into a more intelligent yet still very combative defensive midfielder after coming under criticism for his often overly-physical game .
he 'll need his wits about him to deal with iniesta but armed as he is now with a fully engaged brain to go with his quick feet , de jong 's defenders will be well protected .
xavi hernandez versus mark van bommel mark van bommel has drawn both praise and jeers for his all-action approach to games at this world cup , drawing widespread criticism for a number of fully committed tackles which have left opponents wincing .
a volatile player who has a reputation for niggly fouls and a fast mouth , van bommel 's temperament has been a source of debate for most of his career .
however , his performances as a whole have been outstanding in south africa and his team 's defensive record has as much to do with his policing of the region in front of the penalty area as it does the actual defensive work of the back four .
facing spain , a team who will spend a lot of time in his neighborhood , means that van bommel will have a busy evening on sunday and he will have to keep his cool under what will be a concerted amount of pressure .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : xavi hernandez goes head-to-head with mark van bommel xavi will be a constant threat to van bommel 's peace .
both he and iniesta will be right in the dutchman 's face , leaving the languid build up behind them to the likes of xabi alonso and busquets .
xavi will bring the ball into van bommel 's zone and look to draw him into either making a rash tackle within striking distance of the goal , or pull him out of position enough to bypass him with threaded passes .
with iniesta buzzing round him and xavi forcing him to chase clipped exchanges , van bommel needs to be disciplined .
xavi 's goal threat has been reduced in recent years but his damage comes from playing people in .
he will hope that the dutch get frustrated by chasing the game before choosing the moment to strike .

spain beat the netherlands 1-0 , with the barcelona man netting late in extra-time , after 90 minutes failed to produce a goal . spain has won its first world cup , overcoming the netherlands at soccer city stadium , johannesburg .
vicente del bosque 's team , favorites before the tournament began , confirmed their place at the top of the soccer world , two years after claiming the 2008 european championship .
andres iniesta scored the extra-time goal which secured the prize .
the barcelona midfielder collected a pass from cesc fabregas and fired a right-foot shot that beat maarten stekelenburg in the dutch goal .
the breakthrough came in the 116th minute of the game .
" it 's incredible , " said iniesta after the match .
" there are n't the words to describe what i am feeling . "
bildunterschrift : iniesta scored after receiving a pass from fabregas deep into extra time the game only really came alive in extra time , after an uninspiring first 90 minutes in which the referee was often at the center of attention . twelve players were shown yellow , while dutch defender johnny heitinga saw red with ten minutes of extra time remaining .
heitinga pulled iniesta back on the edge of the box , and howard webb gave him his marching orders .
both sides had chances to win it in the added 30 minutes .
spanish substitute cesc fabregas could n't provide the finish when one-on-one , while joris mathijsen headed a corner over the bar from inside the six yard box at the other end .
spain were marginally the better team in normal time , although the netherlands had the best opening . arjen robben was played through by wesley sneijder and , one-on-one with iker casillas , could only hit his shot against the goalkeeper 's foot .
the bayern winger 's pace continued to cause the spanish defense problems , as the netherlands played on the counter attack .
spain tried to play their brand of intricate football , but were not at their fluid best .
dangerman david villa thought he had grabbed the lead mid-way through the second half .
his close-range shot was somehow deflected over the bar by heitinga .
spanish right-back sergio ramos also got himself in promising positions , only to fluff his lines .
he did well to get his head on a fifth-minute corner and draw a full-length save from stekelenburg .
but ramos should have done better with a second-half effort , heading over when unmarked six yards out .
the netherlands arguably should have been down to ten men in the first half .
dutch midfielder nigel de jong led with his studs when trying to win a bouncing ball and karate-kicked xabi alonso high in the chest .
the referee only showed yellow . bildunterschrift : de jong 's challenge was verging on assault spanish coach vincente del bosque admitted that his side had been in difficulty at times .
" it was a hard game .
we started well and then they had chances in the second half .
but after that i believed we were slightly superior . " dutch coach bert van marwijk took the defeat with grace , but could not hide his disappointment .
" the best team won .
i am disappointed .
it is a world championship and we have just lost a final . " del bosque again left striker fernando torres out of his starting 11 , preferring barcelona winger pedro , in the same team that started the semifinal win over germany .
torres came on late in extra time , but quickly pulled up injured . the netherlands made two changes to its line-up .
midfielder nigel de jong and right back gregory van der wiel returned to the team after missing the semifinal triumph against uruguay due to suspension . spain were co-favourites before the tournament , but lost their opening game to switzerland .
they got things together to qualify from group h , and have won each of their knockout games just 1-0 . third defeat in finals while spain was playing in its first final , the netherlands have now lost the three world cup finals they have competed in .
the oranje were runners-up in 1974 and 1978 .
bert van marwijk 's team knocked out knocked out brazil in the quarterfinal , and scored double the number of goals spain had before this evening . spain became the first european team to win a world cup held outside europe . an estimated 700 million people were watching the game on television around the globe .
however , the stadium itself was about 10,000 people short of being full .
fans were lucky enough to catch a glimpse of former president nelson mandela , who had to miss the opening ceremonies on june 11 after his great-granddaughter died in a car accident .
the icon of south african democracy was driven onto the field in a golf cart .

but questions still surround the tragedy . some 40,000 people gathered sunday in the bosnian town of srebrenica , where the massacre widely described as europe 's worst atrocity since world war ii occurred 15 years ago .
srebrenica was a un-protected enclave besieged by bosnian serb forces throughout the 1992-95 war .
but un troops there were quickly overrun when the serbs entered the town , rounded up its bosnian muslim population and killed more than 8,000 men and boys .
as part of sunday 's ceremony , 775 recently identified massacre victims in coffins draped in green were interred at the potocari war cemetery , where more than 4,500 are already buried .
several world leaders attended the commemoration ceremony , including us president barack obama , british prime minister david cameron and turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan .
recognizing the international community 's failure to respond to the bloody bosnian war , obama called the massacre " a stain on our collective conscience . "
also at the ceremony was serbian president boris tadic , whose presence many bosnians resented .
serbia has been criticized for its perceived reluctance to capture ratko mladic , the general who led the attack on srebrenica .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un soldiers reinforce defensive positions in sarajevo during the 1992-1995 bosnian war slow search for victims on friday , thousands of people lined the main street of sarajevo as trucks bearing more coffins passed through on the way to srebrenica , some 100 miles to the south-east in eastern bosnia .
in the drina valley , the remains of 8,372 victims of the massacre have been exhumed from 275 mass graves in recent years .
so far 6,557 victims have been identified , and many more murdered muslim civilians are still missing .
the search is slow and tedious , as corpses were tossed into mass graves , often to be dug up again later with bulldozers only to be hastily buried again elsewhere . manfred eisele , an army major general in the german armed forces responsible for planning the un 's peacekeeping operations from 1994 to 1998 , said that 15 years after the srebrenica massacre , it was still difficult to shed light on events . he said he had doubts that those responsible in the un security council had the power or the intention to guarantee the protection of the 40,000 muslim civilians in the srebrenica " safe area . "
' they did n't prevent the drama ' many analysts now place much of the blame for the genocide on the dutch government . fearing for the safety of its 450 soldiers stationed in the area , the dutch government failed to order a un-proposed air attack on serb troops .
the dutch were easily overpowered and the massacre unfolded .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ex-bosnian-serb general ratko mladic is wanted for crimes against humanity german lawyer axel hagedorn , who represents about 8,000 relatives of the victims , is trying to invalidate the un 's immunity before the highest court in the netherlands , as well as the european court of justice .
" the un has a clear responsibility , it should have decided against the dutch , " hagedorn said .
" if the un had to go to court , then it would no longer be possible for the dutch state to blame the un , or the un to blame the dutch state , which is what 's happening now . "
lessons of history the massacre of srebrenica , but also the genocide in rwanda and cambodia , are seen as signs of the un 's failure . the united nations still has not learned its lesson , general eisele said .
" the readiness of states to take responsibility for hard-pressed minorities and also to recognize this protective responsibility is still dramatically underdeveloped , " he said .
" a direct consequence can be seen in the nato deployment … for the kosovo-albanians , who were subjected to massive human rights violations by their own government . "
today , only about three to five percent of the population in srebrenica is muslim , most of them women still searching for relatives .
many families went into exile to canada , new zealand and the united states .

he had an impressive cv but did he have the vision to lead the most potent attacking team on earth ?
on sunday , he leads them into the world cup final . in the hysteria that surrounded spain after they won their first ever trophy at the european championships in 2008 , it was easy to forget one of the more unsavoury chapters of their recent history , given their imperious march to the title in austria and switzerland .
it took place in 2004 when most of the spain team who would go on to become european champions were just starting to come through and show promise .
their coach at the time , luis aragones , allegedly used a racist slur to motivate striker jose antonio reyes to stand up to thierry henry of france .
while the comment itself was deplorable enough , the spanish fa 's reluctance to take action was even more so .
aragones was , of course , allowed to stay in his job and four years after the scandal , he led spain to the euro 2008 title .
the glory of that achievement , and the belief of his supporters that he was just a ' man of his time , ' glossed over the fact that aragones was seen by many as a difficult , volatile man and an opinionated , abusive coach .
but he got results , and as such , he was tolerated and indulged .
two years on and spain have the chance to claim the ultimate title when they face the netherlands in the final of the 2010 fifa world cup on sunday .
they have lost only two games in the last 55 they 've played and have shown the same confidence and class in south africa as they did in austria and switzerland .
if they win the world cup , it will be an achievement which will put even winning euro 2008 in the shade .
has all this been achieved with a raging , anachronistic coach at the helm ?
has a ' man of his time ' used bullying tactics to take this team to within one game of being crowned champions of the world ?
the answer is of course no .
vicente del bosque , a man and coach infinitely less brash or controversial than his predecessor , has brought spain to the cusp of winning the greatest prize with his mixture of calm advice and fatherly protection .
coach sticks with successful tactics but changes atmosphere del bosque is the polar opposite of the combustible aragones and yet the team has n't suffered from such a radical change at the top .
from the day he took over as coach , he insisted that nothing would change on the pitch .
spain had just enjoyed its finest hour and del bosque knew not to rock the boat by shaking up the system .
he kept the nucleus of the euro 2008 team intact along with aragones ' tactical plan .
it was n't broken , so why fix it ?
bildunterschrift : del bosque recognised that spain did not need rebuilding on the pitch but needed calm off it instead , he changed the approach off the pitch , replacing the haranguing of players with the quiet coaxing which had got the best out of the real madrid teams he had coached in the past .
the result is a happy , comfortable squad in which the potentially damaging barcelona-real madrid split has no place .
if no complaints about del bosque or rumours of feuds among players have leaked from the dressing room it is because there have n't been any .
the players have been made to feel they are partners in the team 's success by del bosque 's inclusive approach .
after weathering the storm of criticism which followed the switzerland defeat in spain 's first game in south africa , the quiet man of spanish soccer consulted those who knew best what went wrong – his players .
together they worked out how to put things right .
some saw this as weakness , as deferring to the players .
del bosque knew it was a way to win trust and cement a bond .
it was intelligent , not weak .
a thoughtful man , unafraid to make difficult decisions while he has been accused of being too gentle in the past , del bosque is no push over and is certainly not afraid of making big decisions .
he left out in-form players such as marcus senna , daniel aranzubia and alvarao dominguez from his final squad list and has shown during the tournament that there 's no place for sentiment by benching the misfiring fernando torres for the semi-final defeat of germany .
having had his fair share of dealing with difficult choices in club management , del bosque has handled the national set-up with aplomb .
bildunterschrift : the spain coach has brought in the players he needed to make the existing system operate better del bosque arrived as coach with an envious reputation for success .
as real madrid coach , the former los blancos defender won the champions league twice , la liga twice and the europa league during his four seasons in charge .
his dismissal – for being too docile and not marketable enough to coach the galacticos project – is one of the biggest stains on real madrid 's increasingly tainted record .
despite his long-standing allegiance to real , del bosque is astute enough not to buy into the club rivalries .
he picks the players who fit the system , regardless of their team colours .
find the player for the system , not the other way round del bosque has been forced by necessity to change certain things in the team line-up but he has been keen to point out that his additions are more about evolution than revolution .
fresh legs in the form of the barcelona trio pedro , sergi busquets and gerard pique have been installed to give the system new bite but the coach has n't tampered with anything for the sake of adding a certain player .
the ideal player is found to play a certain position in the system – not the other way round .
now del bosque has the chance to add the world cup to the european title won by his predecessor with a team that knows exactly what it is doing after years of honing a devastating pressing game built around some of the best ball players and passers in the world .
and it did n't take a lot of shouting and swearing .

as real madrid coach , the former los blancos defender won the champions league twice , la liga twice and the europa league during his four seasons in charge .
his dismissal – for being too docile and not marketable enough to coach the galacticos project – is one of the biggest stains on real madrid 's increasingly tainted record .

he had an impressive cv but did he have the vision to lead the most potent attacking team on earth ?
on sunday , he leads them into the world cup final . in the hysteria that surrounded spain after they won their first ever trophy at the european championships in 2008 , it was easy to forget one of the more unsavoury chapters of their recent history , given their imperious march to the title in austria and switzerland .
it took place in 2004 when most of the spain team who would go on to become european champions were just starting to come through and show promise .
their coach at the time , luis aragones , allegedly used a racist slur to motivate striker jose antonio reyes to stand up to thierry henry of france .
while the comment itself was deplorable enough , the spanish fa 's reluctance to take action was even more so .
aragones was , of course , allowed to stay in his job and four years after the scandal , he led spain to the euro 2008 title .
the glory of that achievement , and the belief of his supporters that he was just a ' man of his time , ' glossed over the fact that aragones was seen by many as a difficult , volatile man and an opinionated , abusive coach .
but he got results , and as such , he was tolerated and indulged .
two years on and spain have the chance to claim the ultimate title when they face the netherlands in the final of the 2010 fifa world cup on sunday .
they have lost only two games in the last 55 they 've played and have shown the same confidence and class in south africa as they did in austria and switzerland .
if they win the world cup , it will be an achievement which will put even winning euro 2008 in the shade .
has all this been achieved with a raging , anachronistic coach at the helm ?
has a ' man of his time ' used bullying tactics to take this team to within one game of being crowned champions of the world ?
the answer is of course no .
vicente del bosque , a man and coach infinitely less brash or controversial than his predecessor , has brought spain to the cusp of winning the greatest prize with his mixture of calm advice and fatherly protection .
coach sticks with successful tactics but changes atmosphere del bosque is the polar opposite of the combustible aragones and yet the team has n't suffered from such a radical change at the top .
from the day he took over as coach , he insisted that nothing would change on the pitch .
spain had just enjoyed its finest hour and del bosque knew not to rock the boat by shaking up the system .
he kept the nucleus of the euro 2008 team intact along with aragones ' tactical plan .
it was n't broken , so why fix it ?
bildunterschrift : del bosque recognised that spain did not need rebuilding on the pitch but needed calm off it instead , he changed the approach off the pitch , replacing the haranguing of players with the quiet coaxing which had got the best out of the real madrid teams he had coached in the past .
the result is a happy , comfortable squad in which the potentially damaging barcelona-real madrid split has no place .
if no complaints about del bosque or rumours of feuds among players have leaked from the dressing room it is because there have n't been any .
the players have been made to feel they are partners in the team 's success by del bosque 's inclusive approach .
after weathering the storm of criticism which followed the switzerland defeat in spain 's first game in south africa , the quiet man of spanish soccer consulted those who knew best what went wrong – his players .
together they worked out how to put things right .
some saw this as weakness , as deferring to the players .
del bosque knew it was a way to win trust and cement a bond .
it was intelligent , not weak .
a thoughtful man , unafraid to make difficult decisions while he has been accused of being too gentle in the past , del bosque is no push over and is certainly not afraid of making big decisions .
he left out in-form players such as marcus senna , daniel aranzubia and alvarao dominguez from his final squad list and has shown during the tournament that there 's no place for sentiment by benching the misfiring fernando torres for the semi-final defeat of germany .
having had his fair share of dealing with difficult choices in club management , del bosque has handled the national set-up with aplomb .

but questions still surround the tragedy . some 40,000 people gathered sunday in the bosnian town of srebrenica , where the massacre widely described as europe 's worst atrocity since world war ii occurred 15 years ago .
srebrenica was a un-protected enclave besieged by bosnian serb forces throughout the 1992-95 war .
but un troops there were quickly overrun when the serbs entered the town , rounded up its bosnian muslim population and killed more than 8,000 men and boys .
as part of sunday 's ceremony , 775 recently identified massacre victims in coffins draped in green were interred at the potocari war cemetery , where more than 4,500 are already buried .
several world leaders attended the commemoration ceremony , including us president barack obama , british prime minister david cameron and turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan .
recognizing the international community 's failure to respond to the bloody bosnian war , obama called the massacre " a stain on our collective conscience . "
also at the ceremony was serbian president boris tadic , whose presence many bosnians resented .
serbia has been criticized for its perceived reluctance to capture ratko mladic , the general who led the attack on srebrenica .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un soldiers reinforce defensive positions in sarajevo during the 1992-1995 bosnian war slow search for victims on friday , thousands of people lined the main street of sarajevo as trucks bearing more coffins passed through on the way to srebrenica , some 100 miles to the south-east in eastern bosnia .
in the drina valley , the remains of 8,372 victims of the massacre have been exhumed from 275 mass graves in recent years .
so far 6,557 victims have been identified , and many more murdered muslim civilians are still missing .
the search is slow and tedious , as corpses were tossed into mass graves , often to be dug up again later with bulldozers only to be hastily buried again elsewhere . manfred eisele , an army major general in the german armed forces responsible for planning the un 's peacekeeping operations from 1994 to 1998 , said that 15 years after the srebrenica massacre , it was still difficult to shed light on events . he said he had doubts that those responsible in the un security council had the power or the intention to guarantee the protection of the 40,000 muslim civilians in the srebrenica " safe area . "
' they did n't prevent the drama ' many analysts now place much of the blame for the genocide on the dutch government . fearing for the safety of its 450 soldiers stationed in the area , the dutch government failed to order a un-proposed air attack on serb troops .
the dutch were easily overpowered and the massacre unfolded .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ex-bosnian-serb general ratko mladic is wanted for crimes against humanity german lawyer axel hagedorn , who represents about 8,000 relatives of the victims , is trying to invalidate the un 's immunity before the highest court in the netherlands , as well as the european court of justice .
" the un has a clear responsibility , it should have decided against the dutch , " hagedorn said .
" if the un had to go to court , then it would no longer be possible for the dutch state to blame the un , or the un to blame the dutch state , which is what 's happening now . "
lessons of history the massacre of srebrenica , but also the genocide in rwanda and cambodia , are seen as signs of the un 's failure . the united nations still has not learned its lesson , general eisele said .
" the readiness of states to take responsibility for hard-pressed minorities and also to recognize this protective responsibility is still dramatically underdeveloped , " he said .
" a direct consequence can be seen in the nato deployment … for the kosovo-albanians , who were subjected to massive human rights violations by their own government . "
today , only about three to five percent of the population in srebrenica is muslim , most of them women still searching for relatives .
many families went into exile to canada , new zealand and the united states .

we 're proud of you !
that 's what we want to say to our national team .
third place in the world cup is a well-deserved reward for their fantastic performance this time round .
they 've created unforgettable moments .
in years to come we 'll still be saying : do you remember the round of sixteen match against england in south africa 2010 ? that disallowed goal for the english , and the subsequent 4-1 thrashing by our team .
do you remember the quarterfinal against argentina ?
when thomas mueller , bastian schweinsteiger and mesut oezil pulverized the " gauchos " ' defense and sent the pre-match favourites packing with a resounding 4-0 victory ?
from nobodies to stars let 's be honest , who really thought that this young team would create such memorable highlights ?
the german team is now being celebrated across the world for their inspirational offensive football .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche welle 's stefan nestler is dazzled by the german side talented players , who not so long ago were playing for the german football association 's junior team , whom no-one had even heard of abroad , hammered the world 's best into disarray .
international sports reporters became familiar with how to pronounce the names of the german players – and were full of respect for germany 's new football flair .
it was n't only fans at home who were upset when the team met their match in the semi finals against spain .
football fans from across the world reported that they were sorry that this amazing german side had n't made it into the final .
time to perfect their game we do n't need to grieve for what could have been .
this team belongs to the future .
thomas mueller , the biggest discovery of this world cup , is 20 years old , mesut oezil is 21 , sami khedira , 23 .
and even leading players like bastian schweinsteiger or the captain , philipp lahm , are only in their mid twenties .
they can play together for a few more years yet , and have time to perfect their game further .
and other talents are following on behind .
the seeds sown by the german football association in training young players are bearing fruit . above all , the pool of young players , trained to first-class standards , technically and tactically , promises a golden future for german football .
national team coach , joachim loew , should be praised for his part in this success story , in which he has personally played a major hand .
he must be eager to carry on as well .
in this instance , the german football association would be well-advised to hold onto him .

we 're proud of you !
that 's what we want to say to our national team .
third place in the world cup is a well-deserved reward for their fantastic performance this time round .
they 've created unforgettable moments .
in years to come we 'll still be saying : do you remember the round of sixteen match against england in south africa 2010 ? that disallowed goal for the english , and the subsequent 4-1 thrashing by our team .
do you remember the quarterfinal against argentina ?
when thomas mueller , bastian schweinsteiger and mesut oezil pulverized the " gauchos " ' defense and sent the pre-match favourites packing with a resounding 4-0 victory ?
from nobodies to stars let 's be honest , who really thought that this young team would create such memorable highlights ?
the german team is now being celebrated across the world for their inspirational offensive football .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche welle 's stefan nestler is dazzled by the german side talented players , who not so long ago were playing for the german football association 's junior team , whom no-one had even heard of abroad , hammered the world 's best into disarray .
international sports reporters became familiar with how to pronounce the names of the german players – and were full of respect for germany 's new football flair .
it was n't only fans at home who were upset when the team met their match in the semi finals against spain .
football fans from across the world reported that they were sorry that this amazing german side had n't made it into the final .
time to perfect their game we do n't need to grieve for what could have been .
this team belongs to the future .
thomas mueller , the biggest discovery of this world cup , is 20 years old , mesut oezil is 21 , sami khedira , 23 .
and even leading players like bastian schweinsteiger or the captain , philipp lahm , are only in their mid twenties .
they can play together for a few more years yet , and have time to perfect their game further .
and other talents are following on behind .
the seeds sown by the german football association in training young players are bearing fruit . above all , the pool of young players , trained to first-class standards , technically and tactically , promises a golden future for german football .
national team coach , joachim loew , should be praised for his part in this success story , in which he has personally played a major hand .
he must be eager to carry on as well .
in this instance , the german football association would be well-advised to hold onto him .
they should follow the motto : never change a winning team !
even if it never quite hit the jackpot .

spain beat the netherlands 1-0 , with the barcelona man netting late in extra-time , after 90 minutes failed to produce a goal . spain has won its first world cup , overcoming the netherlands at soccer city stadium , johannesburg .
vicente del bosque 's team , favorites before the tournament began , confirmed their place at the top of the soccer world , two years after claiming the 2008 european championship .
andres iniesta scored the extra-time goal which secured the prize .
the barcelona midfielder collected a pass from cesc fabregas and fired a right-foot shot that beat maarten stekelenburg in the dutch goal .
the breakthrough came in the 116th minute of the game .
" it 's incredible , " said iniesta after the match .
" there are n't the words to describe what i am feeling . "
bildunterschrift : iniesta scored after receiving a pass from fabregas deep into extra time the game only really came alive in extra time , after an uninspiring first 90 minutes in which the referee was often at the center of attention . twelve players were shown yellow , while dutch defender johnny heitinga saw red with ten minutes of extra time remaining .
heitinga pulled iniesta back on the edge of the box , and howard webb gave him his marching orders .
both sides had chances to win it in the added 30 minutes .
spanish substitute cesc fabregas could n't provide the finish when one-on-one , while joris mathijsen headed a corner over the bar from inside the six yard box at the other end .
spain were marginally the better team in normal time , although the netherlands had the best opening . arjen robben was played through by wesley sneijder and , one-on-one with iker casillas , could only hit his shot against the goalkeeper 's foot .
the bayern winger 's pace continued to cause the spanish defense problems , as the netherlands played on the counter attack .
spain tried to play their brand of intricate football , but were not at their fluid best .
dangerman david villa thought he had grabbed the lead mid-way through the second half .
his close-range shot was somehow deflected over the bar by heitinga .
spanish right-back sergio ramos also got himself in promising positions , only to fluff his lines .
he did well to get his head on a fifth-minute corner and draw a full-length save from stekelenburg .
but ramos should have done better with a second-half effort , heading over when unmarked six yards out .
the netherlands arguably should have been down to ten men in the first half .
dutch midfielder nigel de jong led with his studs when trying to win a bouncing ball and karate-kicked xabi alonso high in the chest .
the referee only showed yellow . bildunterschrift : de jong 's challenge was verging on assault spanish coach vincente del bosque admitted that his side had been in difficulty at times .
" it was a hard game .
we started well and then they had chances in the second half .
but after that i believed we were slightly superior . " dutch coach bert van marwijk took the defeat with grace , but could not hide his disappointment .
" the best team won .
i am disappointed .
it is a world championship and we have just lost a final . " del bosque again left striker fernando torres out of his starting 11 , preferring barcelona winger pedro , in the same team that started the semifinal win over germany .
torres came on late in extra time , but quickly pulled up injured . the netherlands made two changes to its line-up .
midfielder nigel de jong and right back gregory van der wiel returned to the team after missing the semifinal triumph against uruguay due to suspension . spain were co-favourites before the tournament , but lost their opening game to switzerland .
they got things together to qualify from group h , and have won each of their knockout games just 1-0 . third defeat in finals while spain was playing in its first final , the netherlands have now lost the three world cup finals they have competed in .
the oranje were runners-up in 1974 and 1978 .
bert van marwijk 's team knocked out knocked out brazil in the quarterfinal , and scored double the number of goals spain had before this evening . spain became the first european team to win a world cup held outside europe . an estimated 700 million people were watching the game on television around the globe .
however , the stadium itself was about 10,000 people short of being full .
fans were lucky enough to catch a glimpse of former president nelson mandela , who had to miss the opening ceremonies on june 11 after his great-granddaughter died in a car accident .
the icon of south african democracy was driven onto the field in a golf cart .

here , dw ’ s nick amies looks at the key battles which could determine who wins the 2010 world cup . wesley sneijder versus sergio busquets few would dispute that wesley sneijder has been one of the players of the tournament .
the inter milan playmaker has been at the heart of much of holland 's ingenuity and has weighed in with a hugely impressive five goals from his roaming creative role in the midfield .
with mark van bommel and nigel de jong charged with more defensive duties , sneijder will again have the job of driving the dutch on , probing for openings for arjen robben and robin van persie and hitting his own shots from distance .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wesley sneijder will try to bypass spain 's sergio busquets the man whose job it will be to deny sneijder space is sergio busquets .
now barcelona 's first choice defensive midfielder , busquets has already faced off against sneijder in the champions league semi-finals last season and came off second best .
still only 21 , busquets unseated marcos senna from the same role in the spain team and is now the man to patrol ahead of the spanish back four .
he will need to close sneijder down fast , denying him time and space to play in others or shoot , much as he did against mesut oezil and lukas podolski in the semi-final win over germany .
it will not be an easy task but its imperative for spain that he succeeds .
david villa versus joris mathijsen david villa has shown at this world cup why the best teams in europe were all clambering for his signature before the tournament began .
the new barcelona forward has hit five goals on the way to the final and has taken spain 's scoring burden on his shoulders with aplomb .
not the tallest man on the field , villa can still cause problems in the air just by making the effort but his danger lies at his feet .
villa has impeccable timing which , given the quality of the ball-playing midfielders in his team , makes him a deadly striker .
spain like to play across the box and probe for openings and villa is the fox in the box .
it only takes a subtle flick or fast through ball for villa to spring his trap .
precise acceleration means he 's rarely caught offside and with little or no back lift in his shot , he needs very little space to take advantage of an opportunity .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : david villa will have to get past dutch defender joris mathijsen joris mathijsen 's solid performances in south africa have cemented his position as one of holland 's best defenders .
a player who goes about his business with quiet efficiency , mathijsen is a well drilled back who will know all about the threat david villa poses .
much like villa , mathijsen has a low centre of gravity and can turn quickly and accelerate at speed so will be ready to stay with the spain forward should he break .
mathijsen 's performance against uruguay 's diego forlan in the semi-final reduced the striker to long shots .
the dutch will be hoping that mathijsen will frustrate the spanish forward to the same extent – but with a different outcome : forlan scored from distance .
arjen robben versus joan capdevila after laboring a little at the start of the tournament due to an injury picked up in a pre-world cup warm-up game , arjen robben has since shown his most devastating form .
most dangerous when cutting in from the right to aim his lethal left footed shots at goal , robben has turned a number of left-backs inside out over the course of this tournament and shown most of them a clean pair of heels while racing past them .
robben will be allowed to roam at will but will be given the right channel as his own to penetrate , hitting the by-line to deliver crosses or swerving into the area to shoot at goal .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : arjen robben will be looking to torment joan capdevila experienced villareal left-back capdevila will have seen it all before , however , coming up as he did against robben when the dutchman was a real madrid player , but questions remain over whether his aging legs will be able to cope this time around .
capdevila 's head is a wise one though and will use his guile as much as his skill to keep an eye on robben with the more athletic sergio ramos likely to be lurking in support just in case .
robben will not have things all his own way though .
capdevila still possesses enough speed to threaten as an overlapping attacking option and the dutchman may be forced to track back to prevent the spaniard from getting into dangerous positions behind him .
andres iniesta versus nigel de jong it 's no surprise that spain 's return to confidence and competence has coincided with the recovery of andres iniesta from injury .
while xavi hernandez probes , iniesta flits and darts like a dragonfly around his midfield partner , collecting and poking short tactical passes to him before nipping past perplexed defenders .
given a similar brief to wesley sneijder , iniesta ghosts around in front of the back four , ready to play the killer ball to david villa or feint his way into his own goal-scoring position .
germany 's bastian schweinsteiger - who looked imperious until the semi-final - was made to look ordinary by iniesta on wednesday night while sami khedira was constantly pulled out of position by his movement .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tricky andres iniesta faces tough tackling nigel de jong nigel de jong will probably interchange with mark van bommel when it comes to dealing with xavi and iniesta as they approach the dutch back four , but de jong is more likely to get the first bite at iniesta due to his better mobility .
de jong has matured into a more intelligent yet still very combative defensive midfielder after coming under criticism for his often overly-physical game .
he 'll need his wits about him to deal with iniesta but armed as he is now with a fully engaged brain to go with his quick feet , de jong 's defenders will be well protected .
xavi hernandez versus mark van bommel mark van bommel has drawn both praise and jeers for his all-action approach to games at this world cup , drawing widespread criticism for a number of fully committed tackles which have left opponents wincing .
a volatile player who has a reputation for niggly fouls and a fast mouth , van bommel 's temperament has been a source of debate for most of his career .
however , his performances as a whole have been outstanding in south africa and his team 's defensive record has as much to do with his policing of the region in front of the penalty area as it does the actual defensive work of the back four .
facing spain , a team who will spend a lot of time in his neighborhood , means that van bommel will have a busy evening on sunday and he will have to keep his cool under what will be a concerted amount of pressure .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : xavi hernandez goes head-to-head with mark van bommel xavi will be a constant threat to van bommel 's peace .
both he and iniesta will be right in the dutchman 's face , leaving the languid build up behind them to the likes of xabi alonso and busquets .
xavi will bring the ball into van bommel 's zone and look to draw him into either making a rash tackle within striking distance of the goal , or pull him out of position enough to bypass him with threaded passes .
with iniesta buzzing round him and xavi forcing him to chase clipped exchanges , van bommel needs to be disciplined .
xavi 's goal threat has been reduced in recent years but his damage comes from playing people in .
he will hope that the dutch get frustrated by chasing the game before choosing the moment to strike .

spain beat the netherlands 1-0 , with the barcelona man netting late in extra-time , after 90 minutes failed to produce a goal . spain has won its first world cup , overcoming the netherlands at soccer city stadium , johannesburg .
vicente del bosque 's team , favorites before the tournament began , confirmed their place at the top of the soccer world , two years after claiming the 2008 european championship .
andres iniesta scored the extra-time goal which secured the prize .
the barcelona midfielder collected a pass from cesc fabregas and fired a right-foot shot that beat maarten stekelenburg in the dutch goal .
the breakthrough came in the 116th minute of the game .
" it 's incredible , " said iniesta after the match .
" there are n't the words to describe what i am feeling . "
bildunterschrift : iniesta scored after receiving a pass from fabregas deep into extra time the game only really came alive in extra time , after an uninspiring first 90 minutes in which the referee was often at the center of attention . twelve players were shown yellow , while dutch defender johnny heitinga saw red with ten minutes of extra time remaining .
heitinga pulled iniesta back on the edge of the box , and howard webb gave him his marching orders .
both sides had chances to win it in the added 30 minutes .
spanish substitute cesc fabregas could n't provide the finish when one-on-one , while joris mathijsen headed a corner over the bar from inside the six yard box at the other end .
spain were marginally the better team in normal time , although the netherlands had the best opening . arjen robben was played through by wesley sneijder and , one-on-one with iker casillas , could only hit his shot against the goalkeeper 's foot .
the bayern winger 's pace continued to cause the spanish defense problems , as the netherlands played on the counter attack .
spain tried to play their brand of intricate football , but were not at their fluid best .
dangerman david villa thought he had grabbed the lead mid-way through the second half .
his close-range shot was somehow deflected over the bar by heitinga .
spanish right-back sergio ramos also got himself in promising positions , only to fluff his lines .
he did well to get his head on a fifth-minute corner and draw a full-length save from stekelenburg .
but ramos should have done better with a second-half effort , heading over when unmarked six yards out .
the netherlands arguably should have been down to ten men in the first half .
dutch midfielder nigel de jong led with his studs when trying to win a bouncing ball and karate-kicked xabi alonso high in the chest .
the referee only showed yellow . bildunterschrift : de jong 's challenge was verging on assault spanish coach vincente del bosque admitted that his side had been in difficulty at times .
" it was a hard game .
we started well and then they had chances in the second half .
but after that i believed we were slightly superior . " dutch coach bert van marwijk took the defeat with grace , but could not hide his disappointment .
" the best team won .
i am disappointed .
it is a world championship and we have just lost a final . " del bosque again left striker fernando torres out of his starting 11 , preferring barcelona winger pedro , in the same team that started the semifinal win over germany .
torres came on late in extra time , but quickly pulled up injured . the netherlands made two changes to its line-up .
midfielder nigel de jong and right back gregory van der wiel returned to the team after missing the semifinal triumph against uruguay due to suspension . spain were co-favourites before the tournament , but lost their opening game to switzerland .
they got things together to qualify from group h , and have won each of their knockout games just 1-0 . third defeat in finals while spain was playing in its first final , the netherlands have now lost the three world cup finals they have competed in .
the oranje were runners-up in 1974 and 1978 .
bert van marwijk 's team knocked out knocked out brazil in the quarterfinal , and scored double the number of goals spain had before this evening . spain became the first european team to win a world cup held outside europe . an estimated 700 million people were watching the game on television around the globe .
however , the stadium itself was about 10,000 people short of being full .
fans were lucky enough to catch a glimpse of former president nelson mandela , who had to miss the opening ceremonies on june 11 after his great-granddaughter died in a car accident .
the icon of south african democracy was driven onto the field in a golf cart .

the sueddeutsche zeitung in munich said germany was lucky to beat uruguay in saturday 's playoff .

praise flowing in from across the world it was n't just the germans who were impressed by their team 's performance .

bildunterschrift : iniesta scored after receiving a pass from fabregas deep into extra time the game only really came alive in extra time , after an uninspiring first 90 minutes in which the referee was often at the center of attention . twelve players were shown yellow , while dutch defender johnny heitinga saw red with ten minutes of extra time remaining .
heitinga pulled iniesta back on the edge of the box , and howard webb gave him his marching orders .
both sides had chances to win it in the added 30 minutes .
spanish substitute cesc fabregas could n't provide the finish when one-on-one , while joris mathijsen headed a corner over the bar from inside the six yard box at the other end .
spain were marginally the better team in normal time , although the netherlands had the best opening . arjen robben was played through by wesley sneijder and , one-on-one with iker casillas , could only hit his shot against the goalkeeper 's foot .
the bayern winger 's pace continued to cause the spanish defense problems , as the netherlands played on the counter attack .
spain tried to play their brand of intricate football , but were not at their fluid best .
dangerman david villa thought he had grabbed the lead mid-way through the second half .
his close-range shot was somehow deflected over the bar by heitinga .
spanish right-back sergio ramos also got himself in promising positions , only to fluff his lines .
he did well to get his head on a fifth-minute corner and draw a full-length save from stekelenburg .
but ramos should have done better with a second-half effort , heading over when unmarked six yards out .
the netherlands arguably should have been down to ten men in the first half .
dutch midfielder nigel de jong led with his studs when trying to win a bouncing ball and karate-kicked xabi alonso high in the chest .
the referee only showed yellow . bildunterschrift : de jong 's challenge was verging on assault spanish coach vincente del bosque admitted that his side had been in difficulty at times .
" it was a hard game .
we started well and then they had chances in the second half .
but after that i believed we were slightly superior . " dutch coach bert van marwijk took the defeat with grace , but could not hide his disappointment .
" the best team won .
i am disappointed .
it is a world championship and we have just lost a final . " del bosque again left striker fernando torres out of his starting 11 , preferring barcelona winger pedro , in the same team that started the semifinal win over germany .
torres came on late in extra time , but quickly pulled up injured . the netherlands made two changes to its line-up .
midfielder nigel de jong and right back gregory van der wiel returned to the team after missing the semifinal triumph against uruguay due to suspension . spain were co-favourites before the tournament , but lost their opening game to switzerland .
they got things together to qualify from group h , and have won each of their knockout games just 1-0 . third defeat in finals while spain was playing in its first final , the netherlands have now lost the three world cup finals they have competed in .
the oranje were runners-up in 1974 and 1978 .
bert van marwijk 's team knocked out knocked out brazil in the quarterfinal , and scored double the number of goals spain had before this evening . spain became the first european team to win a world cup held outside europe . an estimated 700 million people were watching the game on television around the globe .
however , the stadium itself was about 10,000 people short of being full .
fans were lucky enough to catch a glimpse of former president nelson mandela , who had to miss the opening ceremonies on june 11 after his great-granddaughter died in a car accident .
the icon of south african democracy was driven onto the field in a golf cart .

we 're proud of you !
that 's what we want to say to our national team .
third place in the world cup is a well-deserved reward for their fantastic performance this time round .
they 've created unforgettable moments .
in years to come we 'll still be saying : do you remember the round of sixteen match against england in south africa 2010 ? that disallowed goal for the english , and the subsequent 4-1 thrashing by our team .
do you remember the quarterfinal against argentina ?
when thomas mueller , bastian schweinsteiger and mesut oezil pulverized the " gauchos " ' defense and sent the pre-match favourites packing with a resounding 4-0 victory ?
from nobodies to stars let 's be honest , who really thought that this young team would create such memorable highlights ?
the german team is now being celebrated across the world for their inspirational offensive football .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche welle 's stefan nestler is dazzled by the german side talented players , who not so long ago were playing for the german football association 's junior team , whom no-one had even heard of abroad , hammered the world 's best into disarray .
international sports reporters became familiar with how to pronounce the names of the german players – and were full of respect for germany 's new football flair .
it was n't only fans at home who were upset when the team met their match in the semi finals against spain .
football fans from across the world reported that they were sorry that this amazing german side had n't made it into the final .
time to perfect their game we do n't need to grieve for what could have been .
this team belongs to the future .
thomas mueller , the biggest discovery of this world cup , is 20 years old , mesut oezil is 21 , sami khedira , 23 .
and even leading players like bastian schweinsteiger or the captain , philipp lahm , are only in their mid twenties .
they can play together for a few more years yet , and have time to perfect their game further .
and other talents are following on behind .
the seeds sown by the german football association in training young players are bearing fruit . above all , the pool of young players , trained to first-class standards , technically and tactically , promises a golden future for german football .
national team coach , joachim loew , should be praised for his part in this success story , in which he has personally played a major hand .
he must be eager to carry on as well .
in this instance , the german football association would be well-advised to hold onto him .
they should follow the motto : never change a winning team !
even if it never quite hit the jackpot .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de war crimes -pipe- 11.07.2010 thousands in bosnia mourn at anniversary of srebrenica massacre großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hundreds of recently identified victims were burried on sunday bosnia and herzegovina on sunday marks 15 years since 8,000 muslim men and boys were systematically killed by bosnian serb forces in what became known as the srebrenica massacre .
but questions still surround the tragedy . some 40,000 people gathered sunday in the bosnian town of srebrenica , where the massacre widely described as europe 's worst atrocity since world war ii occurred 15 years ago .
srebrenica was a un-protected enclave besieged by bosnian serb forces throughout the 1992-95 war .
but un troops there were quickly overrun when the serbs entered the town , rounded up its bosnian muslim population and killed more than 8,000 men and boys .
as part of sunday 's ceremony , 775 recently identified massacre victims in coffins draped in green were interred at the potocari war cemetery , where more than 4,500 are already buried .
several world leaders attended the commemoration ceremony , including us president barack obama , british prime minister david cameron and turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan .
recognizing the international community 's failure to respond to the bloody bosnian war , obama called the massacre " a stain on our collective conscience . "
also at the ceremony was serbian president boris tadic , whose presence many bosnians resented .
serbia has been criticized for its perceived reluctance to capture ratko mladic , the general who led the attack on srebrenica .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un soldiers reinforce defensive positions in sarajevo during the 1992-1995 bosnian war slow search for victims on friday , thousands of people lined the main street of sarajevo as trucks bearing more coffins passed through on the way to srebrenica , some 100 miles to the south-east in eastern bosnia .
in the drina valley , the remains of 8,372 victims of the massacre have been exhumed from 275 mass graves in recent years .
so far 6,557 victims have been identified , and many more murdered muslim civilians are still missing .
the search is slow and tedious , as corpses were tossed into mass graves , often to be dug up again later with bulldozers only to be hastily buried again elsewhere . manfred eisele , an army major general in the german armed forces responsible for planning the un 's peacekeeping operations from 1994 to 1998 , said that 15 years after the srebrenica massacre , it was still difficult to shed light on events . he said he had doubts that those responsible in the un security council had the power or the intention to guarantee the protection of the 40,000 muslim civilians in the srebrenica " safe area . "
' they did n't prevent the drama ' many analysts now place much of the blame for the genocide on the dutch government . fearing for the safety of its 450 soldiers stationed in the area , the dutch government failed to order a un-proposed air attack on serb troops .
the dutch were easily overpowered and the massacre unfolded .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ex-bosnian-serb general ratko mladic is wanted for crimes against humanity german lawyer axel hagedorn , who represents about 8,000 relatives of the victims , is trying to invalidate the un 's immunity before the highest court in the netherlands , as well as the european court of justice .
" the un has a clear responsibility , it should have decided against the dutch , " hagedorn said .
" if the un had to go to court , then it would no longer be possible for the dutch state to blame the un , or the un to blame the dutch state , which is what 's happening now . "
lessons of history the massacre of srebrenica , but also the genocide in rwanda and cambodia , are seen as signs of the un 's failure . the united nations still has not learned its lesson , general eisele said .
" the readiness of states to take responsibility for hard-pressed minorities and also to recognize this protective responsibility is still dramatically underdeveloped , " he said .
" a direct consequence can be seen in the nato deployment … for the kosovo-albanians , who were subjected to massive human rights violations by their own government . "
today , only about three to five percent of the population in srebrenica is muslim , most of them women still searching for relatives .
many families went into exile to canada , new zealand and the united states .

the " amalthea , " commissioned by a libyan charity , will not attempt to break the israeli blockade . a ship , loaded with humanitarian aid destined for palestinians in the gaza strip , has set sail from greece for the egyptian port of el-arish .
following intense diplomatic pressure from israel , the ship , which has been chartered by a libyan charity , will not attempt to break through the israeli blockade .
israeli defense minister ehud barak called the libyan aid vessel 's planned journey an " unnecessary provocation . "
the aid shipment will be transported overland from el-arish to the palestinian enclave in the hamas-controlled gaza strip .
greek radio said there were 27 people on board the " amalthea , " including 13 libyan activists , a nigerian and a syrian national .
the moldavian-flagged , greek-owned cargo ship left from lavrio on saturday afternoon carrying 2,000 tons of food and medical aid supplied by the gaddafi international charity and development association .
the charity is headed by saif al-islam gaddafi , a son of the libyan leader .
the vessel was originally scheduled to sail directly to the gaza strip , but greek diplomatic sources in athens confirmed it would travel instead to el-arish following diplomatic talks between greek deputy foreign minister dimitris droutsas and israeli foreign minister avigdor lieberman .
at the end of may , an international gaza flotilla tried to break through the israeli blockade .
nine people were killed , mainly turkish nationals , when the israeli military intercepted and used force to seize control of the ship .
following widespread international condemnation israel finally agreed to relax the blockade .

here , dw ’ s nick amies looks at the key battles which could determine who wins the 2010 world cup . wesley sneijder versus sergio busquets few would dispute that wesley sneijder has been one of the players of the tournament .
the inter milan playmaker has been at the heart of much of holland 's ingenuity and has weighed in with a hugely impressive five goals from his roaming creative role in the midfield .
with mark van bommel and nigel de jong charged with more defensive duties , sneijder will again have the job of driving the dutch on , probing for openings for arjen robben and robin van persie and hitting his own shots from distance .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wesley sneijder will try to bypass spain 's sergio busquets the man whose job it will be to deny sneijder space is sergio busquets .
now barcelona 's first choice defensive midfielder , busquets has already faced off against sneijder in the champions league semi-finals last season and came off second best .
still only 21 , busquets unseated marcos senna from the same role in the spain team and is now the man to patrol ahead of the spanish back four .
he will need to close sneijder down fast , denying him time and space to play in others or shoot , much as he did against mesut oezil and lukas podolski in the semi-final win over germany .
it will not be an easy task but its imperative for spain that he succeeds .
david villa versus joris mathijsen david villa has shown at this world cup why the best teams in europe were all clambering for his signature before the tournament began .
the new barcelona forward has hit five goals on the way to the final and has taken spain 's scoring burden on his shoulders with aplomb .
not the tallest man on the field , villa can still cause problems in the air just by making the effort but his danger lies at his feet .
villa has impeccable timing which , given the quality of the ball-playing midfielders in his team , makes him a deadly striker .
spain like to play across the box and probe for openings and villa is the fox in the box .
it only takes a subtle flick or fast through ball for villa to spring his trap .
precise acceleration means he 's rarely caught offside and with little or no back lift in his shot , he needs very little space to take advantage of an opportunity .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : david villa will have to get past dutch defender joris mathijsen joris mathijsen 's solid performances in south africa have cemented his position as one of holland 's best defenders .
a player who goes about his business with quiet efficiency , mathijsen is a well drilled back who will know all about the threat david villa poses .
much like villa , mathijsen has a low centre of gravity and can turn quickly and accelerate at speed so will be ready to stay with the spain forward should he break .
mathijsen 's performance against uruguay 's diego forlan in the semi-final reduced the striker to long shots .
the dutch will be hoping that mathijsen will frustrate the spanish forward to the same extent – but with a different outcome : forlan scored from distance .
arjen robben versus joan capdevila after laboring a little at the start of the tournament due to an injury picked up in a pre-world cup warm-up game , arjen robben has since shown his most devastating form .
most dangerous when cutting in from the right to aim his lethal left footed shots at goal , robben has turned a number of left-backs inside out over the course of this tournament and shown most of them a clean pair of heels while racing past them .
robben will be allowed to roam at will but will be given the right channel as his own to penetrate , hitting the by-line to deliver crosses or swerving into the area to shoot at goal .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : arjen robben will be looking to torment joan capdevila experienced villareal left-back capdevila will have seen it all before , however , coming up as he did against robben when the dutchman was a real madrid player , but questions remain over whether his aging legs will be able to cope this time around .
capdevila 's head is a wise one though and will use his guile as much as his skill to keep an eye on robben with the more athletic sergio ramos likely to be lurking in support just in case .
robben will not have things all his own way though .
capdevila still possesses enough speed to threaten as an overlapping attacking option and the dutchman may be forced to track back to prevent the spaniard from getting into dangerous positions behind him .
andres iniesta versus nigel de jong it 's no surprise that spain 's return to confidence and competence has coincided with the recovery of andres iniesta from injury .
while xavi hernandez probes , iniesta flits and darts like a dragonfly around his midfield partner , collecting and poking short tactical passes to him before nipping past perplexed defenders .
given a similar brief to wesley sneijder , iniesta ghosts around in front of the back four , ready to play the killer ball to david villa or feint his way into his own goal-scoring position .
germany 's bastian schweinsteiger - who looked imperious until the semi-final - was made to look ordinary by iniesta on wednesday night while sami khedira was constantly pulled out of position by his movement .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tricky andres iniesta faces tough tackling nigel de jong nigel de jong will probably interchange with mark van bommel when it comes to dealing with xavi and iniesta as they approach the dutch back four , but de jong is more likely to get the first bite at iniesta due to his better mobility .
de jong has matured into a more intelligent yet still very combative defensive midfielder after coming under criticism for his often overly-physical game .
he 'll need his wits about him to deal with iniesta but armed as he is now with a fully engaged brain to go with his quick feet , de jong 's defenders will be well protected .
xavi hernandez versus mark van bommel mark van bommel has drawn both praise and jeers for his all-action approach to games at this world cup , drawing widespread criticism for a number of fully committed tackles which have left opponents wincing .
a volatile player who has a reputation for niggly fouls and a fast mouth , van bommel 's temperament has been a source of debate for most of his career .
however , his performances as a whole have been outstanding in south africa and his team 's defensive record has as much to do with his policing of the region in front of the penalty area as it does the actual defensive work of the back four .
facing spain , a team who will spend a lot of time in his neighborhood , means that van bommel will have a busy evening on sunday and he will have to keep his cool under what will be a concerted amount of pressure .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : xavi hernandez goes head-to-head with mark van bommel xavi will be a constant threat to van bommel 's peace .
both he and iniesta will be right in the dutchman 's face , leaving the languid build up behind them to the likes of xabi alonso and busquets .
xavi will bring the ball into van bommel 's zone and look to draw him into either making a rash tackle within striking distance of the goal , or pull him out of position enough to bypass him with threaded passes .
with iniesta buzzing round him and xavi forcing him to chase clipped exchanges , van bommel needs to be disciplined .
xavi 's goal threat has been reduced in recent years but his damage comes from playing people in .
he will hope that the dutch get frustrated by chasing the game before choosing the moment to strike .

the " amalthea , " commissioned by a libyan charity , will not attempt to break the israeli blockade . a ship , loaded with humanitarian aid destined for palestinians in the gaza strip , has set sail from greece for the egyptian port of el-arish .
following intense diplomatic pressure from israel , the ship , which has been chartered by a libyan charity , will not attempt to break through the israeli blockade .
israeli defense minister ehud barak called the libyan aid vessel 's planned journey an " unnecessary provocation . "
the aid shipment will be transported overland from el-arish to the palestinian enclave in the hamas-controlled gaza strip .
greek radio said there were 27 people on board the " amalthea , " including 13 libyan activists , a nigerian and a syrian national .
the moldavian-flagged , greek-owned cargo ship left from lavrio on saturday afternoon carrying 2,000 tons of food and medical aid supplied by the gaddafi international charity and development association .
the charity is headed by saif al-islam gaddafi , a son of the libyan leader .
the vessel was originally scheduled to sail directly to the gaza strip , but greek diplomatic sources in athens confirmed it would travel instead to el-arish following diplomatic talks between greek deputy foreign minister dimitris droutsas and israeli foreign minister avigdor lieberman .
at the end of may , an international gaza flotilla tried to break through the israeli blockade .
nine people were killed , mainly turkish nationals , when the israeli military intercepted and used force to seize control of the ship .
following widespread international condemnation israel finally agreed to relax the blockade .

we 're proud of you !
that 's what we want to say to our national team .
third place in the world cup is a well-deserved reward for their fantastic performance this time round .
they 've created unforgettable moments .
in years to come we 'll still be saying : do you remember the round of sixteen match against england in south africa 2010 ? that disallowed goal for the english , and the subsequent 4-1 thrashing by our team .
do you remember the quarterfinal against argentina ?
when thomas mueller , bastian schweinsteiger and mesut oezil pulverized the " gauchos " ' defense and sent the pre-match favourites packing with a resounding 4-0 victory ?
from nobodies to stars let 's be honest , who really thought that this young team would create such memorable highlights ?
the german team is now being celebrated across the world for their inspirational offensive football .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche welle 's stefan nestler is dazzled by the german side talented players , who not so long ago were playing for the german football association 's junior team , whom no-one had even heard of abroad , hammered the world 's best into disarray .
international sports reporters became familiar with how to pronounce the names of the german players – and were full of respect for germany 's new football flair .
it was n't only fans at home who were upset when the team met their match in the semi finals against spain .
football fans from across the world reported that they were sorry that this amazing german side had n't made it into the final .
time to perfect their game we do n't need to grieve for what could have been .
this team belongs to the future .
thomas mueller , the biggest discovery of this world cup , is 20 years old , mesut oezil is 21 , sami khedira , 23 .
and even leading players like bastian schweinsteiger or the captain , philipp lahm , are only in their mid twenties .
they can play together for a few more years yet , and have time to perfect their game further .
and other talents are following on behind .
the seeds sown by the german football association in training young players are bearing fruit . above all , the pool of young players , trained to first-class standards , technically and tactically , promises a golden future for german football .
national team coach , joachim loew , should be praised for his part in this success story , in which he has personally played a major hand .
he must be eager to carry on as well .
in this instance , the german football association would be well-advised to hold onto him .
they should follow the motto : never change a winning team !
even if it never quite hit the jackpot .

the decision came after a legal challenge to the catalan region 's statute of autonomy by the opposition conservative people 's party which favors a unified spain .
the statute of autonomy was approved by catalan voters in a referendum in 2006 .
the statute gave the catalan regional government greater powers in taxation and judicial matters as well as more control over airports , ports and immigration .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police said 1.1 million people attended the rally the court ruled that the term " nation " defining catalonia in the statute had no legal value because " the constitution only knows one nation , spain . "
widespread support saturday 's march in support of the statute of autonomy was led by the socialist leader of the regional government josé montilla .
a huge catalan flag with the slogan " we are a nation , we decide ourselves " was unfurled while the crowd held up thousands of red and yellow catalan banners .
the statute has the support of the vast majority of political parties , trades union and social organizations in catalonia , where a sizeable minority would like to see the wealthy region break away from spain .

but the opposition conservative claim the statute undermined the idea of spain as a unified state .
it was approved by the parliament in madrid in 2006 afer it was endorsed by catalan voters in a referendum .
catalonia is home to around seven million of spain 's population of some 47 million , and accounts for 25 percent of its gross domestic product .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : dossier : 2010 fifa world cup spain , netherlands , germany dominate dw top xi spain 's world cup win down to possession , not goals youthful germany hold heads high and look to future spanish enjoy football fiesta after victory over devastated dutch world cup -pipe- 11.07.2010 fatherly coach del bosque quietly coaxes spain to new heights großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not one to rant , vicente del bosque still gets results few people got excited when vicente del bosque took charge of spain .
he had an impressive cv but did he have the vision to lead the most potent attacking team on earth ?
on sunday , he leads them into the world cup final . in the hysteria that surrounded spain after they won their first ever trophy at the european championships in 2008 , it was easy to forget one of the more unsavoury chapters of their recent history , given their imperious march to the title in austria and switzerland .
it took place in 2004 when most of the spain team who would go on to become european champions were just starting to come through and show promise .
their coach at the time , luis aragones , allegedly used a racist slur to motivate striker jose antonio reyes to stand up to thierry henry of france .
while the comment itself was deplorable enough , the spanish fa 's reluctance to take action was even more so .
aragones was , of course , allowed to stay in his job and four years after the scandal , he led spain to the euro 2008 title .
the glory of that achievement , and the belief of his supporters that he was just a ' man of his time , ' glossed over the fact that aragones was seen by many as a difficult , volatile man and an opinionated , abusive coach .
but he got results , and as such , he was tolerated and indulged .
two years on and spain have the chance to claim the ultimate title when they face the netherlands in the final of the 2010 fifa world cup on sunday .
they have lost only two games in the last 55 they 've played and have shown the same confidence and class in south africa as they did in austria and switzerland .
if they win the world cup , it will be an achievement which will put even winning euro 2008 in the shade .
has all this been achieved with a raging , anachronistic coach at the helm ?
has a ' man of his time ' used bullying tactics to take this team to within one game of being crowned champions of the world ?
the answer is of course no .
vicente del bosque , a man and coach infinitely less brash or controversial than his predecessor , has brought spain to the cusp of winning the greatest prize with his mixture of calm advice and fatherly protection .
coach sticks with successful tactics but changes atmosphere del bosque is the polar opposite of the combustible aragones and yet the team has n't suffered from such a radical change at the top .
from the day he took over as coach , he insisted that nothing would change on the pitch .
spain had just enjoyed its finest hour and del bosque knew not to rock the boat by shaking up the system .
he kept the nucleus of the euro 2008 team intact along with aragones ' tactical plan .
it was n't broken , so why fix it ?
bildunterschrift : del bosque recognised that spain did not need rebuilding on the pitch but needed calm off it instead , he changed the approach off the pitch , replacing the haranguing of players with the quiet coaxing which had got the best out of the real madrid teams he had coached in the past .
the result is a happy , comfortable squad in which the potentially damaging barcelona-real madrid split has no place .
if no complaints about del bosque or rumours of feuds among players have leaked from the dressing room it is because there have n't been any .
the players have been made to feel they are partners in the team 's success by del bosque 's inclusive approach .
after weathering the storm of criticism which followed the switzerland defeat in spain 's first game in south africa , the quiet man of spanish soccer consulted those who knew best what went wrong – his players .
together they worked out how to put things right .
some saw this as weakness , as deferring to the players .
del bosque knew it was a way to win trust and cement a bond .
it was intelligent , not weak .
a thoughtful man , unafraid to make difficult decisions while he has been accused of being too gentle in the past , del bosque is no push over and is certainly not afraid of making big decisions .
he left out in-form players such as marcus senna , daniel aranzubia and alvarao dominguez from his final squad list and has shown during the tournament that there 's no place for sentiment by benching the misfiring fernando torres for the semi-final defeat of germany .
having had his fair share of dealing with difficult choices in club management , del bosque has handled the national set-up with aplomb .
bildunterschrift : the spain coach has brought in the players he needed to make the existing system operate better del bosque arrived as coach with an envious reputation for success .
as real madrid coach , the former los blancos defender won the champions league twice , la liga twice and the europa league during his four seasons in charge .
his dismissal – for being too docile and not marketable enough to coach the galacticos project – is one of the biggest stains on real madrid 's increasingly tainted record .
despite his long-standing allegiance to real , del bosque is astute enough not to buy into the club rivalries .
he picks the players who fit the system , regardless of their team colours .
find the player for the system , not the other way round del bosque has been forced by necessity to change certain things in the team line-up but he has been keen to point out that his additions are more about evolution than revolution .
fresh legs in the form of the barcelona trio pedro , sergi busquets and gerard pique have been installed to give the system new bite but the coach has n't tampered with anything for the sake of adding a certain player .
the ideal player is found to play a certain position in the system – not the other way round .
now del bosque has the chance to add the world cup to the european title won by his predecessor with a team that knows exactly what it is doing after years of honing a devastating pressing game built around some of the best ball players and passers in the world .
and it did n't take a lot of shouting and swearing .

however , today , many victims of the war crimes have still not been identified . since 2006 , the international committee on missing persons -lrb- icmp -rrb- has used dna analysis to link bone fragments and other organic material buried in bosnia 's mass graves with the dna of potential relatives who have donated their genetic material to be matched up with the victims . qiagen , a german company based in hilden outside dusseldorf in western germany , has developed the technology used for much of the biological and genetic testing . " there are quite a number of difficulties , especially in the extraction of older bones , which have been buried in the ground for years under very adverse conditions , " said scientist mario scherer , who works on samples from bosnia .

" we also must make sure that no additional external contamination is acquired during the process , " said thomas parsons , the director of forensic science at the international commission on missing persons , in a 2006 interview on qiagen 's website .

but questions still surround the tragedy . some 40,000 people gathered sunday in the bosnian town of srebrenica , where the massacre widely described as europe 's worst atrocity since world war ii occurred 15 years ago .
srebrenica was a un-protected enclave besieged by bosnian serb forces throughout the 1992-95 war .
but un troops there were quickly overrun when the serbs entered the town , rounded up its bosnian muslim population and killed more than 8,000 men and boys .
as part of sunday 's ceremony , 775 recently identified massacre victims in coffins draped in green were interred at the potocari war cemetery , where more than 4,500 are already buried .
several world leaders attended the commemoration ceremony , including us president barack obama , british prime minister david cameron and turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan .
recognizing the international community 's failure to respond to the bloody bosnian war , obama called the massacre " a stain on our collective conscience . "
also at the ceremony was serbian president boris tadic , whose presence many bosnians resented .
serbia has been criticized for its perceived reluctance to capture ratko mladic , the general who led the attack on srebrenica .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un soldiers reinforce defensive positions in sarajevo during the 1992-1995 bosnian war slow search for victims on friday , thousands of people lined the main street of sarajevo as trucks bearing more coffins passed through on the way to srebrenica , some 100 miles to the south-east in eastern bosnia .
in the drina valley , the remains of 8,372 victims of the massacre have been exhumed from 275 mass graves in recent years .
so far 6,557 victims have been identified , and many more murdered muslim civilians are still missing .
the search is slow and tedious , as corpses were tossed into mass graves , often to be dug up again later with bulldozers only to be hastily buried again elsewhere . manfred eisele , an army major general in the german armed forces responsible for planning the un 's peacekeeping operations from 1994 to 1998 , said that 15 years after the srebrenica massacre , it was still difficult to shed light on events . he said he had doubts that those responsible in the un security council had the power or the intention to guarantee the protection of the 40,000 muslim civilians in the srebrenica " safe area . "
' they did n't prevent the drama ' many analysts now place much of the blame for the genocide on the dutch government . fearing for the safety of its 450 soldiers stationed in the area , the dutch government failed to order a un-proposed air attack on serb troops .
the dutch were easily overpowered and the massacre unfolded .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ex-bosnian-serb general ratko mladic is wanted for crimes against humanity german lawyer axel hagedorn , who represents about 8,000 relatives of the victims , is trying to invalidate the un 's immunity before the highest court in the netherlands , as well as the european court of justice .
" the un has a clear responsibility , it should have decided against the dutch , " hagedorn said .
" if the un had to go to court , then it would no longer be possible for the dutch state to blame the un , or the un to blame the dutch state , which is what 's happening now . "
lessons of history the massacre of srebrenica , but also the genocide in rwanda and cambodia , are seen as signs of the un 's failure . the united nations still has not learned its lesson , general eisele said .
" the readiness of states to take responsibility for hard-pressed minorities and also to recognize this protective responsibility is still dramatically underdeveloped , " he said .
" a direct consequence can be seen in the nato deployment … for the kosovo-albanians , who were subjected to massive human rights violations by their own government . "
today , only about three to five percent of the population in srebrenica is muslim , most of them women still searching for relatives .
many families went into exile to canada , new zealand and the united states .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : dossier : 2010 fifa world cup spain , netherlands , germany dominate dw top xi spain 's world cup win down to possession , not goals youthful germany hold heads high and look to future spanish enjoy football fiesta after victory over devastated dutch world cup -pipe- 11.07.2010 spain , netherlands gear up for clash to be world 's best großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : both finalists have a number of potential match winners in what is an intriguing match-up , spain and the netherlands meet in the world cup final in johannesburg on sunday night .
here , dw ’ s nick amies looks at the key battles which could determine who wins the 2010 world cup . wesley sneijder versus sergio busquets few would dispute that wesley sneijder has been one of the players of the tournament .
the inter milan playmaker has been at the heart of much of holland 's ingenuity and has weighed in with a hugely impressive five goals from his roaming creative role in the midfield .
with mark van bommel and nigel de jong charged with more defensive duties , sneijder will again have the job of driving the dutch on , probing for openings for arjen robben and robin van persie and hitting his own shots from distance .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wesley sneijder will try to bypass spain 's sergio busquets the man whose job it will be to deny sneijder space is sergio busquets .
now barcelona 's first choice defensive midfielder , busquets has already faced off against sneijder in the champions league semi-finals last season and came off second best .
still only 21 , busquets unseated marcos senna from the same role in the spain team and is now the man to patrol ahead of the spanish back four .
he will need to close sneijder down fast , denying him time and space to play in others or shoot , much as he did against mesut oezil and lukas podolski in the semi-final win over germany .
it will not be an easy task but its imperative for spain that he succeeds .
david villa versus joris mathijsen david villa has shown at this world cup why the best teams in europe were all clambering for his signature before the tournament began .
the new barcelona forward has hit five goals on the way to the final and has taken spain 's scoring burden on his shoulders with aplomb .
not the tallest man on the field , villa can still cause problems in the air just by making the effort but his danger lies at his feet .
villa has impeccable timing which , given the quality of the ball-playing midfielders in his team , makes him a deadly striker .
spain like to play across the box and probe for openings and villa is the fox in the box .
it only takes a subtle flick or fast through ball for villa to spring his trap .
precise acceleration means he 's rarely caught offside and with little or no back lift in his shot , he needs very little space to take advantage of an opportunity .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : david villa will have to get past dutch defender joris mathijsen joris mathijsen 's solid performances in south africa have cemented his position as one of holland 's best defenders .
a player who goes about his business with quiet efficiency , mathijsen is a well drilled back who will know all about the threat david villa poses .
much like villa , mathijsen has a low centre of gravity and can turn quickly and accelerate at speed so will be ready to stay with the spain forward should he break .
mathijsen 's performance against uruguay 's diego forlan in the semi-final reduced the striker to long shots .
the dutch will be hoping that mathijsen will frustrate the spanish forward to the same extent – but with a different outcome : forlan scored from distance .
arjen robben versus joan capdevila after laboring a little at the start of the tournament due to an injury picked up in a pre-world cup warm-up game , arjen robben has since shown his most devastating form .
most dangerous when cutting in from the right to aim his lethal left footed shots at goal , robben has turned a number of left-backs inside out over the course of this tournament and shown most of them a clean pair of heels while racing past them .
robben will be allowed to roam at will but will be given the right channel as his own to penetrate , hitting the by-line to deliver crosses or swerving into the area to shoot at goal .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : arjen robben will be looking to torment joan capdevila experienced villareal left-back capdevila will have seen it all before , however , coming up as he did against robben when the dutchman was a real madrid player , but questions remain over whether his aging legs will be able to cope this time around .
capdevila 's head is a wise one though and will use his guile as much as his skill to keep an eye on robben with the more athletic sergio ramos likely to be lurking in support just in case .
robben will not have things all his own way though .
capdevila still possesses enough speed to threaten as an overlapping attacking option and the dutchman may be forced to track back to prevent the spaniard from getting into dangerous positions behind him .
andres iniesta versus nigel de jong it 's no surprise that spain 's return to confidence and competence has coincided with the recovery of andres iniesta from injury .
while xavi hernandez probes , iniesta flits and darts like a dragonfly around his midfield partner , collecting and poking short tactical passes to him before nipping past perplexed defenders .
given a similar brief to wesley sneijder , iniesta ghosts around in front of the back four , ready to play the killer ball to david villa or feint his way into his own goal-scoring position .
germany 's bastian schweinsteiger - who looked imperious until the semi-final - was made to look ordinary by iniesta on wednesday night while sami khedira was constantly pulled out of position by his movement .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tricky andres iniesta faces tough tackling nigel de jong nigel de jong will probably interchange with mark van bommel when it comes to dealing with xavi and iniesta as they approach the dutch back four , but de jong is more likely to get the first bite at iniesta due to his better mobility .
de jong has matured into a more intelligent yet still very combative defensive midfielder after coming under criticism for his often overly-physical game .
he 'll need his wits about him to deal with iniesta but armed as he is now with a fully engaged brain to go with his quick feet , de jong 's defenders will be well protected .
xavi hernandez versus mark van bommel mark van bommel has drawn both praise and jeers for his all-action approach to games at this world cup , drawing widespread criticism for a number of fully committed tackles which have left opponents wincing .
a volatile player who has a reputation for niggly fouls and a fast mouth , van bommel 's temperament has been a source of debate for most of his career .
however , his performances as a whole have been outstanding in south africa and his team 's defensive record has as much to do with his policing of the region in front of the penalty area as it does the actual defensive work of the back four .
facing spain , a team who will spend a lot of time in his neighborhood , means that van bommel will have a busy evening on sunday and he will have to keep his cool under what will be a concerted amount of pressure .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : xavi hernandez goes head-to-head with mark van bommel xavi will be a constant threat to van bommel 's peace .
both he and iniesta will be right in the dutchman 's face , leaving the languid build up behind them to the likes of xabi alonso and busquets .
xavi will bring the ball into van bommel 's zone and look to draw him into either making a rash tackle within striking distance of the goal , or pull him out of position enough to bypass him with threaded passes .
with iniesta buzzing round him and xavi forcing him to chase clipped exchanges , van bommel needs to be disciplined .
xavi 's goal threat has been reduced in recent years but his damage comes from playing people in .
he will hope that the dutch get frustrated by chasing the game before choosing the moment to strike .

however , today , many victims of the war crimes have still not been identified . since 2006 , the international committee on missing persons -lrb- icmp -rrb- has used dna analysis to link bone fragments and other organic material buried in bosnia 's mass graves with the dna of potential relatives who have donated their genetic material to be matched up with the victims . qiagen , a german company based in hilden outside dusseldorf in western germany , has developed the technology used for much of the biological and genetic testing . " there are quite a number of difficulties , especially in the extraction of older bones , which have been buried in the ground for years under very adverse conditions , " said scientist mario scherer , who works on samples from bosnia . " the quality of the genetic material in these bones is impaired by chemical and physical agents and processes through decomposition by bacteria very strongly , " he added .
" the aim is to extract the genetic material as cleanly as possible . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : identification brings closure for the victims ' relatives scherer works mostly with his centrifuge , a blue , futuristic-looking cube just larger than a microwave oven .
it sits on scherer 's laboratory bench and he puts his samples inside , where the biological material can be separated after being spun around at high speed . the genetic material is cleaned with so-called pillars , or plastic tubes filled with a material that binds to the genetic molecules and separates them from interfering substances . special precautions initially , qiagen 's scientists thought that their centrifuge would mainly be used to analyze simple dna sources , such as blood samples . but it soon became clear that the blue cube could also read more problematic samples of genetic molecules , even from bones that have been buried for many years . other scientists working in this field agree that special precautions must be taken even from the moment of extraction from the field . " we also must make sure that no additional external contamination is acquired during the process , " said thomas parsons , the director of forensic science at the international commission on missing persons , in a 2006 interview on qiagen 's website . " the small amounts of dna that we are working with can reach the levels of pcr -lrb- detection of polymerase chain reaction -rrb- technology , so it is easy to pick up any exogenous contamination that may be present , " he added . dna identification is crucial bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dna analysis is the only possibility for identifying the victims , say experts parsons ' colleagues from icmp use qiagen 's techniques to extract genetic molecules from bones that have been buried for 15 years . " dna is really the only mode for identification , " said rene huel , the head of the ipmc laboratory in sarajevo .
" other , more traditional ways of identification could not be applied here in this region . " after the war in bosnia , many thousands of people are still unaccounted for .
many bones discovered in mass graves could not initially be identified .
there are hundreds of bags of bones in cold storage , which are still waiting to be examined . huel added that their job is that much harder because the perpetrators have done everything to conceal the extent of war crimes . " you do not have one individual in one grave site , " he said . " you may have one individual in four or five grave sites .
we try to bring back as much of the body as possible .
to bring back the missing person to the family is one of the big challenges we face . " scientists are able to find dna fragments from the pieces of bone buried around bosnia .
then , they can compare that with the results of dna from possible relatives in the region who have agreed to provide blood samples . since work began , the icmp has been able to describe the fate of more than 15,000 missing people .
during the past 12 months alone , 775 more victims have been identified . the scientists have informed their living relatives so that they can be buried on the anniversary of the srebrenica massacre . " hopefully we will have an impact on a greater world , " huel said . " people will realize that these crimes or what they are committing hidden will not be hidden .
this type of dna technology can tell the truth about what has happened . " author : michael lange / cyrus farivar editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : dossier : 2010 fifa world cup spain , netherlands , germany dominate dw top xi spain 's world cup win down to possession , not goals youthful germany hold heads high and look to future spanish enjoy football fiesta after victory over devastated dutch world cup -pipe- 11.07.2010 spain , netherlands gear up for clash to be world 's best großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : both finalists have a number of potential match winners in what is an intriguing match-up , spain and the netherlands meet in the world cup final in johannesburg on sunday night .
here , dw ’ s nick amies looks at the key battles which could determine who wins the 2010 world cup . wesley sneijder versus sergio busquets few would dispute that wesley sneijder has been one of the players of the tournament .
the inter milan playmaker has been at the heart of much of holland 's ingenuity and has weighed in with a hugely impressive five goals from his roaming creative role in the midfield .
with mark van bommel and nigel de jong charged with more defensive duties , sneijder will again have the job of driving the dutch on , probing for openings for arjen robben and robin van persie and hitting his own shots from distance .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wesley sneijder will try to bypass spain 's sergio busquets the man whose job it will be to deny sneijder space is sergio busquets .
now barcelona 's first choice defensive midfielder , busquets has already faced off against sneijder in the champions league semi-finals last season and came off second best .
still only 21 , busquets unseated marcos senna from the same role in the spain team and is now the man to patrol ahead of the spanish back four .
he will need to close sneijder down fast , denying him time and space to play in others or shoot , much as he did against mesut oezil and lukas podolski in the semi-final win over germany .
it will not be an easy task but its imperative for spain that he succeeds .
david villa versus joris mathijsen david villa has shown at this world cup why the best teams in europe were all clambering for his signature before the tournament began .
the new barcelona forward has hit five goals on the way to the final and has taken spain 's scoring burden on his shoulders with aplomb .
not the tallest man on the field , villa can still cause problems in the air just by making the effort but his danger lies at his feet .
villa has impeccable timing which , given the quality of the ball-playing midfielders in his team , makes him a deadly striker .
spain like to play across the box and probe for openings and villa is the fox in the box .
it only takes a subtle flick or fast through ball for villa to spring his trap .
precise acceleration means he 's rarely caught offside and with little or no back lift in his shot , he needs very little space to take advantage of an opportunity .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : david villa will have to get past dutch defender joris mathijsen joris mathijsen 's solid performances in south africa have cemented his position as one of holland 's best defenders .
a player who goes about his business with quiet efficiency , mathijsen is a well drilled back who will know all about the threat david villa poses .
much like villa , mathijsen has a low centre of gravity and can turn quickly and accelerate at speed so will be ready to stay with the spain forward should he break .
mathijsen 's performance against uruguay 's diego forlan in the semi-final reduced the striker to long shots .
the dutch will be hoping that mathijsen will frustrate the spanish forward to the same extent – but with a different outcome : forlan scored from distance .
arjen robben versus joan capdevila after laboring a little at the start of the tournament due to an injury picked up in a pre-world cup warm-up game , arjen robben has since shown his most devastating form .
most dangerous when cutting in from the right to aim his lethal left footed shots at goal , robben has turned a number of left-backs inside out over the course of this tournament and shown most of them a clean pair of heels while racing past them .
robben will be allowed to roam at will but will be given the right channel as his own to penetrate , hitting the by-line to deliver crosses or swerving into the area to shoot at goal .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : arjen robben will be looking to torment joan capdevila experienced villareal left-back capdevila will have seen it all before , however , coming up as he did against robben when the dutchman was a real madrid player , but questions remain over whether his aging legs will be able to cope this time around .
capdevila 's head is a wise one though and will use his guile as much as his skill to keep an eye on robben with the more athletic sergio ramos likely to be lurking in support just in case .
robben will not have things all his own way though .
capdevila still possesses enough speed to threaten as an overlapping attacking option and the dutchman may be forced to track back to prevent the spaniard from getting into dangerous positions behind him .
andres iniesta versus nigel de jong it 's no surprise that spain 's return to confidence and competence has coincided with the recovery of andres iniesta from injury .
while xavi hernandez probes , iniesta flits and darts like a dragonfly around his midfield partner , collecting and poking short tactical passes to him before nipping past perplexed defenders .
given a similar brief to wesley sneijder , iniesta ghosts around in front of the back four , ready to play the killer ball to david villa or feint his way into his own goal-scoring position .
germany 's bastian schweinsteiger - who looked imperious until the semi-final - was made to look ordinary by iniesta on wednesday night while sami khedira was constantly pulled out of position by his movement .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tricky andres iniesta faces tough tackling nigel de jong nigel de jong will probably interchange with mark van bommel when it comes to dealing with xavi and iniesta as they approach the dutch back four , but de jong is more likely to get the first bite at iniesta due to his better mobility .
de jong has matured into a more intelligent yet still very combative defensive midfielder after coming under criticism for his often overly-physical game .
he 'll need his wits about him to deal with iniesta but armed as he is now with a fully engaged brain to go with his quick feet , de jong 's defenders will be well protected .
xavi hernandez versus mark van bommel mark van bommel has drawn both praise and jeers for his all-action approach to games at this world cup , drawing widespread criticism for a number of fully committed tackles which have left opponents wincing .
a volatile player who has a reputation for niggly fouls and a fast mouth , van bommel 's temperament has been a source of debate for most of his career .
however , his performances as a whole have been outstanding in south africa and his team 's defensive record has as much to do with his policing of the region in front of the penalty area as it does the actual defensive work of the back four .
facing spain , a team who will spend a lot of time in his neighborhood , means that van bommel will have a busy evening on sunday and he will have to keep his cool under what will be a concerted amount of pressure .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : xavi hernandez goes head-to-head with mark van bommel xavi will be a constant threat to van bommel 's peace .
both he and iniesta will be right in the dutchman 's face , leaving the languid build up behind them to the likes of xabi alonso and busquets .
xavi will bring the ball into van bommel 's zone and look to draw him into either making a rash tackle within striking distance of the goal , or pull him out of position enough to bypass him with threaded passes .
with iniesta buzzing round him and xavi forcing him to chase clipped exchanges , van bommel needs to be disciplined .
xavi 's goal threat has been reduced in recent years but his damage comes from playing people in .
he will hope that the dutch get frustrated by chasing the game before choosing the moment to strike .

we 're proud of you !
that 's what we want to say to our national team .
third place in the world cup is a well-deserved reward for their fantastic performance this time round .
they 've created unforgettable moments .
in years to come we 'll still be saying : do you remember the round of sixteen match against england in south africa 2010 ? that disallowed goal for the english , and the subsequent 4-1 thrashing by our team .
do you remember the quarterfinal against argentina ?
when thomas mueller , bastian schweinsteiger and mesut oezil pulverized the " gauchos " ' defense and sent the pre-match favourites packing with a resounding 4-0 victory ?
from nobodies to stars let 's be honest , who really thought that this young team would create such memorable highlights ?
the german team is now being celebrated across the world for their inspirational offensive football .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche welle 's stefan nestler is dazzled by the german side talented players , who not so long ago were playing for the german football association 's junior team , whom no-one had even heard of abroad , hammered the world 's best into disarray .
international sports reporters became familiar with how to pronounce the names of the german players – and were full of respect for germany 's new football flair .
it was n't only fans at home who were upset when the team met their match in the semi finals against spain .
football fans from across the world reported that they were sorry that this amazing german side had n't made it into the final .
time to perfect their game we do n't need to grieve for what could have been .
this team belongs to the future .
thomas mueller , the biggest discovery of this world cup , is 20 years old , mesut oezil is 21 , sami khedira , 23 .
and even leading players like bastian schweinsteiger or the captain , philipp lahm , are only in their mid twenties .
they can play together for a few more years yet , and have time to perfect their game further .
and other talents are following on behind .
the seeds sown by the german football association in training young players are bearing fruit . above all , the pool of young players , trained to first-class standards , technically and tactically , promises a golden future for german football .
national team coach , joachim loew , should be praised for his part in this success story , in which he has personally played a major hand .
he must be eager to carry on as well .
in this instance , the german football association would be well-advised to hold onto him .
they should follow the motto : never change a winning team !
even if it never quite hit the jackpot .

" it 's incredible , " said iniesta after the match .
" there are n't the words to describe what i am feeling . "
bildunterschrift : iniesta scored after receiving a pass from fabregas deep into extra time the game only really came alive in extra time , after an uninspiring first 90 minutes in which the referee was often at the center of attention . twelve players were shown yellow , while dutch defender johnny heitinga saw red with ten minutes of extra time remaining .
heitinga pulled iniesta back on the edge of the box , and howard webb gave him his marching orders .
both sides had chances to win it in the added 30 minutes .
spanish substitute cesc fabregas could n't provide the finish when one-on-one , while joris mathijsen headed a corner over the bar from inside the six yard box at the other end .
spain were marginally the better team in normal time , although the netherlands had the best opening . arjen robben was played through by wesley sneijder and , one-on-one with iker casillas , could only hit his shot against the goalkeeper 's foot .
the bayern winger 's pace continued to cause the spanish defense problems , as the netherlands played on the counter attack .
spain tried to play their brand of intricate football , but were not at their fluid best .
dangerman david villa thought he had grabbed the lead mid-way through the second half .
his close-range shot was somehow deflected over the bar by heitinga .
spanish right-back sergio ramos also got himself in promising positions , only to fluff his lines .
he did well to get his head on a fifth-minute corner and draw a full-length save from stekelenburg .
but ramos should have done better with a second-half effort , heading over when unmarked six yards out .
the netherlands arguably should have been down to ten men in the first half .
dutch midfielder nigel de jong led with his studs when trying to win a bouncing ball and karate-kicked xabi alonso high in the chest .
the referee only showed yellow . bildunterschrift : de jong 's challenge was verging on assault spanish coach vincente del bosque admitted that his side had been in difficulty at times .
" it was a hard game .
we started well and then they had chances in the second half .
but after that i believed we were slightly superior . " dutch coach bert van marwijk took the defeat with grace , but could not hide his disappointment .
" the best team won .
i am disappointed .
it is a world championship and we have just lost a final . " del bosque again left striker fernando torres out of his starting 11 , preferring barcelona winger pedro , in the same team that started the semifinal win over germany .
torres came on late in extra time , but quickly pulled up injured . the netherlands made two changes to its line-up .
midfielder nigel de jong and right back gregory van der wiel returned to the team after missing the semifinal triumph against uruguay due to suspension . spain were co-favourites before the tournament , but lost their opening game to switzerland .
they got things together to qualify from group h , and have won each of their knockout games just 1-0 . third defeat in finals while spain was playing in its first final , the netherlands have now lost the three world cup finals they have competed in .
