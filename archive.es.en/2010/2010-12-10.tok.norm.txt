but guests gathered around an empty chair to congratulate the laureate , who was not represented at the ceremony . the nobel peace prize committee has concluded its award ceremony in oslo with the prizewinner and guest of honor , imprisoned chinese dissident liu xiaobo , absent .
the prize was meant to " point out the relationship between human rights , democracy and peace " , nobel peace prize committee chairman thorbjoern jagland said in his opening comments .
he called liu a symbol of the " non-violent struggle for such -lsb- human -rsb- rights in china " , and compared him with nelson mandela .
he went on to say that liu had done nothing but exercise his civil rights , and called on china to release him .
in his absence , norwegian actress liv ullmann read a final statement titled " i have no enemies " released by liu 's supporters after his sentencing a year ago .
in it , liu said " there is no force that can put an end to the human quest for freedom , and china will in the end become a nation ruled by law , where human rights reign supreme . "
he also spoke of his wife , liu xia , who is now under house arrest in beijing , saying her love " is the sunlight that leaps over high walls and penetrates the iron bars of my prison window . "
international solidarity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : liu xiaobo is considered a criminal by the chinese authorities throughout friday , western governments paid tribute to liu 's contribution to democracy and human rights , calling on china to release the dissident from prison .
in berlin , german human rights commissioner markus loening praised liu 's courageous stand for human rights .
" the participation of germany as well as all eu partners represented in oslo and many other countries in the ceremony in oslo is therefore a simple sign of respect for liu xiaobo and for all who work to promote human rights and democracy without resorting to violence , " a statement from loening on the german foreign ministry website said .
united states president barack obama meanwhile hailed liu as a beacon of freedom : " the values he espouses are universal , his struggle is peaceful , and he should be released as soon as possible , " obama said .
event overshadowed the event in the norwegian capital was overshadowed not only by liu 's absence , but also by china 's wider anger at his selection .
several nations decided to boycott the ceremony at beijing 's request after the chinese government condemned the decision to award the prize to the democracy activist .
almost a third of the 50 countries invited to the event stayed away , including russia , pakistan and saudi arabia .
many of those not attending are thought to have bowed to chinese pressure .
serbia , which was heavily criticized by the european union for its initial decision not to attend , decided at the last minute to send an ombudsman after all .
chinese media condemn choice bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an empty chair represented liu at the ceremony official chinese media have slammed the choice of liu as nobel peace prize laureate , calling it an attempt to impose foreign values on china .
liu has been a critic of the chinese government since the tiananmen square massacre of 1989 .
liu took a prominent part in the protests there and was sentenced to two years in prison .
he was jailed last december for 11 years on subversion charges after he co-authored a document called charter 08 , which calls for political reform in china .
authorities have also cracked down on activists in the run-up to the ceremony and have prevented liu 's family and friends from attending .
empty chair the nobel committee chose to represent liu with an empty chair during the ceremony , calling this a symbol of the chinese policy to isolate and repress dissidents .
in a moving gesture , jagland placed the nobel diploma on the vacant seat .
it is the first time that a laureate under detention has not been formally represented since 1935 , when nazi germany stopped the pacifist carl von ossietzky from attending .
it is also the first time since then that the prize money of 1.13 million euros -lrb- $ 1.5 million -rrb- will not be handed out .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de development policy -pipe- 10.12.2010 opinion : poor countries can afford social protection großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sub-saharan nation of lesotho has established a pension system that costs less than two percent of gni a recent report suggests that even poor countries can afford basic social protection schemes - and these schemes pay off in terms of economic development , argues commentator dr markus loewe . the recommendations made in this week 's european report on development , drafted by the florence-based european university institute in florence and funded by the european commission and some european union member states , will surprise few experts .
what is remarkable about this latest report is how clearly its authors , most of whom are economists , advocate stronger government engagement in social policies - even in the low-income countries of sub-saharan africa .
basic social protection schemes , the authors suggest , could contribute to growth and poverty reduction , and assist developing countries in reaching the millennium development goals .
the report draws on recent research that highlights the importance of social protection to the economic and political development of countries .
people without access to a social safety net risk falling -lrb- even deeper -rrb- into poverty when faced with a shock like illness or a bad harvest .
they may then have to turn to savings , sell livestock or other assets or send their children to work rather than school in order to finance their daily needs .
in this way , they lose means of livelihoods that might otherwise help them to establish at least a modest existence on their own .
more seriously , households without social protection tend to shy away from investing savings at the outset , instead hoarding income to stay liquid and to prepare for a possible loss of future income or unexpected expenditures .
empirical studies suggest that families , and especially those who work in the informal sector , are more likely to invest when they have access to basic social protection schemes . such investment promotes economic growth precisely where it is most likely to help reduce poverty .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : where families have no safety net , they may be forced to sell income-producing assets like cattle in hard times finally , social protection schemes contribute to political stability .
by reducing poverty and economic insecurity , they lower the chances that a people will resort to violence to achieve political aims .
above all , though , such schemes show citizens that the state feels responsible and cares for them .
many studies point out that , where public social protection schemes exist , citizens identify more closely with the state and show a willingness to fulfill their obligations to the community .
so basic social protection helps not only to reduce poverty but also acts as insurance for business activities and the material basis of a social contract accepted by every citizen .
many will ask how low-income countries can be expected to finance social protection schemes - and rightly so .
it is rarely the case that the majority of a population is covered by social protection systems that the members themselves finance through contributions - social and private insurance schemes and community-based mutual insurance associations , for instance .
this is because , in low-income countries especially , contributions to such schemes are too high for many people .
at the same time , the idea of social transfer schemes financed by the state from tax revenues is often rejected on the grounds that governments in low-income countries do not enjoy wide enough budget margins to be able to fund such schemes .
yet this year 's european report on development -lrb- erd -rrb- reflects a turning point in the academic debate .
even low-income countries that can not afford comprehensive social protection for all their citizens can find satisfactory solutions for particularly vulnerable groups .
for example lesotho , among other african countries , has created a tax-financed system that grants a modest flat pension to everybody over a certain age .
although lesotho is a poor country , the program costs less than two percent of gross national income , and in many households it benefits not only the elderly but also their student grandchildren who want to lay better foundations for their later working lives .
similarly , ethiopia has developed a program that provides poor families jobs in rural infrastructure construction .
the international labor organization estimates that the total cost of establishing both of these programs as well as an unconditional cash transfer program for orphans would not exceed six percent of national income in any sub-saharan african country .
unfortunately , the 2010 erd does not explain how and by whom social protection is to be organized where the state is unwilling or unable to do so .
in such cases , social protection can be provided only by non-governmental actors through , for example , micro-insurance schemes .
the erd restricts the definition of social protection to action conducted by the state , and so does not consider this course of action .
where efficient government does not exist , self-help in the shape of , say , mutual insurance continues to be the only way out .
this is now true of a quarter to a half of all countries in sub-saharan africa , as noted in last year 's erd .

but the west seems unmoved . despite changes in afghan law and a constitution designed to protect women 's rights , violence and abuse of women continue to be a serious problem in the country , and the government is not doing enough to prevent it .
that is the conclusion of a new report published by the united nations assistance mission in afghanistan -lrb- unama -rrb- .
the most common forms of abuse include forced and child marriage , honor killings and giving away girls to settle disputes under the tradition of baad .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the report says violence against afghan women is still widespread " the report describes the prevalence of these practices , " georgette gagnon , unama 's director of human rights , said at a press conference .
" it looks at the consequences these practices have on the lives of afghan women and girls and the community as a whole and it also looks at the efforts of the afghan government to address violence against women . "
one of these efforts , the 2009 law of elimination of violence against women -lrb- evaw -rrb- , came under particular scrutiny .
the law , which gagnon described as " a huge gain of legal protection of women 's rights , " criminalizes buying and selling women for marriage , forcing a woman to marry without her consent , forcing girls to marry when they are underage , and forcing girls and women to commit self-immolation - when they set themselves on fire .
ignorance and lack of enforcement but according to the report , the new law is not being enforced in many parts of the country , and is often not even known .
bele grau , program manager for afghanistan at the women 's rights organisation medica mondiale agreed with this assessment .
" on the theoretical and legal level the situation is getting better – but in practice it is often not implemented , " she told deutsche welle .
" this law has been in force for a year , but a lot of judges do n't even know it , and if they do , they do n't enforce it . "
the un women 's organization unifem says that around 87 percent of afghan women suffer from domestic violence , and that half of all girls are married under the age of 15 .
on top of this , grau says that many of the rights that women have won are repealed by new laws .
she cites one recent regulation that bans women who have run away from an abusive home from seeking refuge with strangers .
this in practice leaves many women only the unrealistic option of going to relatives .
many women are also still imprisoned for running away , in contravention of the evaw law .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : westerwelle suggested democracy can not be imposed on afghanistan the report found that much of the abuse is founded in afghan tradition .
" one very harmful practice that we heard a lot about is baad , which is the giving away of girls to settle disputes , " said gagnon .
" many of the women told us that instead of a murderer being punished , an innocent girl is punished and she has to spend all her life in slavery and is subjected to cruel violence .
sometimes she is forced to sleep with the animals in the barn . "
western indifference the report sets out a number of recommendations for the afghan government to deal with the problem , but grau says that the west has an obligation to apply pressure in order to protect women 's rights – not least because this is often used to add legitimacy to the war in afghanistan .
" we 've noticed this in most of the western governments , " she said .
" for the past year , all the talk is about withdrawal of troops , and negotiations with the taliban etc . , and that afghans have to work out for themselves how much democracy or women 's rights they want .
these are now all internal afghan issues that are n't discussed or even noticed anymore .
the german government is no exception to this . "
she believes that pressure could be exhorted through the financial aid the west gives to the afghan government .
" the western governments still give afghanistan a lot of development money , " she said .
" and when they make conditions for giving this money , we think they should make them for human rights and women 's rights , not just for taking over security duties . "
" the issue of women 's rights was also one of the justifications for the war itself , but that is suddenly disappearing from the agenda , " she added .
" earlier this year , -lrb- german foreign minister guido -rrb- westerwelle said , ' well , afghanistan is not switzerland , ' and with that everything is swept from the table . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 10.12.2010 hanover hit new high with win over struggling stuttgart großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : goal hero ya konan can now boast nine for the season hanover continued to surpass expectations , rising to second in the standings with a 2-1 win over beleaguered stuttgart .
now , just third from bottom , stuttgart has decided to dump its coach , jens keller . ivorian didier ya konan scored twice to give hanover a 2-1 win over stuttgart on friday , taking his team to second place in the bundesliga ahead of the weekend 's main soccer action .
the loss was also the final straw for stuttgart 's management , which announced on saturday that it had fired coach jens keller .
after a cautious start by both sides , ya konan had the first major chance of the match in the 20th minute , with a shot that was stopped by stuttgart keeper sven ulreich .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while stuttgart battled back , they were unable to gain a much-needed point the breakthrough came on 35 minutes , after stuttgart left back arthur boka got a defensive foot to a ball from hanover 's lars stindl - only to divert it to ya konan .
the striker took advantage and passed the ball through ulreich 's legs to take his tally for the season to eight .
stuttgart responded positively , pressing throughout the game , and - with just a quarter of an hour to go - managed to equalize as georg niedermeier jumped to head a timo gebhart free kick into the far corner .
the comeback was short-lived .
after another attempt on the hanover goal , this time from philip degen , hanover swiftly counter-attacked .
ya konan latched onto a high ball from christian schulz to score through ulreich 's legs for a second time .
' an exceptional start ' the win means that hanover have already recorded one more victory than in the whole of last season .
" it is exceptional what we have achieved in the first half of the season , " said hanover technical director joerg schmadtke .
stuttgart is now without a win in its last five games and is third from the bottom with only 12 points from 16 games .
this dreary realization was enough for the team to pull the plug on jen keller 's 59-day rein as head coach .
the hottest prospect to replace him is bruno labaddia , who coached hamburg until the end of april .

dw 's ben knight does n't think so . most of my friends are losers .
i mean that in a good way , obviously .
they are all talented and creative and sometimes even a bit inspired , but they are also , each and every last one of them , work-shy fops .
obviously i am as well : it takes one to know one , as we used to say in primary school .
there 's a great sequence in the movie " trainspotting " where junkie hero renton explains the complex art of staying on the dole .

both cities have also become famous for hanging their new economic hopes on the " creative industries . "
this very spongy term refers to anything from actor to fashion designer , to independent shopkeeper , to web designer , and includes all the attendant skill sets , cameramen , lighting technicians , office managers etc .
the point is you do n't make anything - you delight , you entertain , you disseminate knowledge and information , or you sing cabaret songs naked in a disused warehouse in front of an audience of twelve .
by capitalizing on the cache and the large student population , the two cities deliberately encouraged a whole class of freelance migrants engaged in some kind of creative endeavor in an attempt to re-invent the city 's economy .
but the similarity with manchester ends when it comes to the social security system .
in berlin , many creative types live - at least partially - on the standard long-term unemployment benefit called hartz iv .
it does n't help the job statistics , but it does mean that the city 's economy is run , to a certain extent , by the welfare state .
social security for the middle class bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unemployment center : the lifeblood of a creative economy when it comes to dealing with the job center to claim your benefits , being an artist is a double-edged sword .
most artists do not earn enough to live from their art , so they are understandably unwilling to mention the meager side earnings their talents bring .
they live double lives : naked dadaist performance artists at night , out-of-work it specialists by day .
but others have a little more nerve , and tell their case manager they are " professional " artists .
if they have a degree as well -lrb- a degree puts you in a different , more exclusive waiting room -rrb- they get special dispensation from the endless round of pointless job applications and interviews that most hartz iv recipients are forced to take .
instead , professional unemployed artists are allowed to count applications for grants and scholarships as their applications , and can get the state to pay for acting lessons .

the decision marks a profound change for germany , where compulsory service was re-introduced 50 years ago . senior officials in germany 's coalition government have agreed to suspend military conscription as of july 1 , 2011 .
defense minister karl theodor zu guttenberg 's proposal was accepted during closed-door talks in berlin on thursday evening .
the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- of chancellor angela merkel and its bavarian sister party the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- have both in principle approved abolishing the draft at party conferences in the past six weeks .
their other coalition partner , the pro-business free democrats , had included stopping conscription in their manifesto during last year 's general election .
sources taking part in the meeting said the next step would be for merkel 's cabinet to approve a draft bill that could be put to parliament ; this is expected to happen on december 15 .
troop reduction bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : defense minister guttenberg says the change will save money guttenberg 's plan would also see troop numbers reduced the current level of 250,000 soldiers to 185,000 .
of these , 170,000 would be professional soldiers , with volunteers making up the remainder .
with his reform , guttenberg hopes to save up to 8.3 billion euros .
however , the suspension of conscription could create some new problems ; for instance , the alternative community service offered to those who refuse military service would also be dropped .
social and welfare institutions fear that this could lead to a lack of personnel , as in the past they have relied heavily on youngsters who want to avoid military service .
the suspension also means that student numbers are likely to climb , posing problems for universities .
compulsory military service in germany lasts for six months and only applies to young men .
women are allowed to join the german army , the bundeswehr , either as professionals or volunteers , but are not obliged to do so .

you have to pay a one-euro entrance fee , and while the mulled wine , roasted almonds and arts-and-craft knick-knacks are much the same as in any other christmas market , you are treated to a live ballet show , based on a russian fairytale , to go with your sense of exclusivity .
you also see more security guards .
some , like the ones taking your entry ticket , are dressed as toy soldiers in keeping with the winter fairytale theme .
others wear army boots and the thick , riot-police-style boiler suits emblazoned with the large reflective " security " badge on the back . recent threats of " mumbai style attacks " have boosted the private security business in the past few weeks .
thomas ostmann , berlin manager of german security company agsus , noticed a rise in demand immediately . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : recent terrorist threats in berlin have heightened demand for security firms " yes , we 've definitely noticed that , " he told deutsche welle .
" ahead of the christmas markets , we felt a rise in anxiety among the stand owners .
it is going down a little now , but there is significantly more manpower and security on the markets . "
security boom the added holiday season demand has come on top of a general expansion in the security industry over the past decade .
germany currently has 4,000 security companies , up 1,000 over a decade ago .
the number of people employed in the industry has doubled and sales , too , with revenue this year expected to reach 4.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 5.9 billion -rrb- . sven hallscheidt , spokesman for the german chambers of industry and commerce -lrb- dihk -rrb- , attributes the growing demand for security services by individuals and companies to a deep social change .
" it 's a development in society , " he said .
" on the one hand , it is influenced by reports in the media – we all know the reports about possible terrorist attacks – but also reports of attacks in public generally . " the security business is not only expanding but also becoming more complex .
company security is taking on an evermore important role , requiring a new breed of skilled workers – from guards and logistics planners to engineers – to create security systems . essential as the police and that role is extending beyond guarding buildings , cash logistics and the likes into areas such as critical infrastructure , making the private security industry as essential as the police . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the police no longer have the resources to protect essential infrastructure bodo pfalzgraf , chairman of the berlin police union , says the police force in germany simply does n't have the capacity to meet the country 's security requirements .
" first of all , we have in germany about as many police employees as there are employees in the private security industry , it 's 50 – 50 , " he told deutsche welle .
" in my opinion , the infrastructure of german security is inconceivable without private security personnel .
they guard nuclear power stations – they 're not just skin-headed , tattooed bouncers . " the growing importance of the private security sector , however , is also raising questions over jurisdiction , with some politicians warning against the dangers of over-privatizing security – particularly in airports . no special privileges but security manager ostmann says that even in places like christmas markets where private companies protect public spaces , the rules about what guards can and ca n't do are clear .
" the police always have the final say , " he said .
" we have the same rights as any other citizen , but we have no special powers .
and there are no difficulties over areas of competence .
i 'd say it is a very good partnership . " official agreements , like contracts , are organized on a state government level between the police and private security firms but there are still ambiguities , according to pfalzgraf . " a danger exists if there is no clear delineation between the two , and the government is not providing one at the moment , " he said .
" today , anyone can start a private security firm – they have to fulfil very few conditions .
and as of may 1 , 2011 , there 's going to be another opening of the market in europe – in other words , eastern european companies from poland , czech republic and lithuania will be able to start security services here .

you have to pay a one-euro entrance fee , and while the mulled wine , roasted almonds and arts-and-craft knick-knacks are much the same as in any other christmas market , you are treated to a live ballet show , based on a russian fairytale , to go with your sense of exclusivity .
you also see more security guards .
some , like the ones taking your entry ticket , are dressed as toy soldiers in keeping with the winter fairytale theme .
others wear army boots and the thick , riot-police-style boiler suits emblazoned with the large reflective " security " badge on the back . recent threats of " mumbai style attacks " have boosted the private security business in the past few weeks .
thomas ostmann , berlin manager of german security company agsus , noticed a rise in demand immediately . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : recent terrorist threats in berlin have heightened demand for security firms " yes , we 've definitely noticed that , " he told deutsche welle .
" ahead of the christmas markets , we felt a rise in anxiety among the stand owners .
it is going down a little now , but there is significantly more manpower and security on the markets . "
security boom the added holiday season demand has come on top of a general expansion in the security industry over the past decade .
germany currently has 4,000 security companies , up 1,000 over a decade ago .
the number of people employed in the industry has doubled and sales , too , with revenue this year expected to reach 4.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 5.9 billion -rrb- . sven hallscheidt , spokesman for the german chambers of industry and commerce -lrb- dihk -rrb- , attributes the growing demand for security services by individuals and companies to a deep social change .
" it 's a development in society , " he said .
" on the one hand , it is influenced by reports in the media – we all know the reports about possible terrorist attacks – but also reports of attacks in public generally . " the security business is not only expanding but also becoming more complex .
company security is taking on an evermore important role , requiring a new breed of skilled workers – from guards and logistics planners to engineers – to create security systems . essential as the police and that role is extending beyond guarding buildings , cash logistics and the likes into areas such as critical infrastructure , making the private security industry as essential as the police . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the police no longer have the resources to protect essential infrastructure bodo pfalzgraf , chairman of the berlin police union , says the police force in germany simply does n't have the capacity to meet the country 's security requirements .
" first of all , we have in germany about as many police employees as there are employees in the private security industry , it 's 50 – 50 , " he told deutsche welle .
" in my opinion , the infrastructure of german security is inconceivable without private security personnel .
they guard nuclear power stations – they 're not just skin-headed , tattooed bouncers . " the growing importance of the private security sector , however , is also raising questions over jurisdiction , with some politicians warning against the dangers of over-privatizing security – particularly in airports . no special privileges but security manager ostmann says that even in places like christmas markets where private companies protect public spaces , the rules about what guards can and ca n't do are clear .
" the police always have the final say , " he said .
" we have the same rights as any other citizen , but we have no special powers .
and there are no difficulties over areas of competence .
i 'd say it is a very good partnership . " official agreements , like contracts , are organized on a state government level between the police and private security firms but there are still ambiguities , according to pfalzgraf . " a danger exists if there is no clear delineation between the two , and the government is not providing one at the moment , " he said .
" today , anyone can start a private security firm – they have to fulfil very few conditions .
and as of may 1 , 2011 , there 's going to be another opening of the market in europe – in other words , eastern european companies from poland , czech republic and lithuania will be able to start security services here .
that i think is a problem . " pfalzgraf believes it 's high time the state creates more rigorous industry standards to cope with the rising need for private security firms .
as for shoppers in berlin 's christmas markets , they 're fine with such distinctions – as long they feel safe . author : ben knight editor : john blau send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

after pressure from china , 20 nations have said they wo n't be attending the ceremony . a total of 65 countries have embassies in the norwegian capital of oslo and recently they 've all received the same two pieces of mail . an invitation from the nobel prize committee to attend the award ceremony for the 2011 nobel winners and a letter from the chinese embassy requesting they steer clear of the event . " we have noticed that the chinese are very engaged this year , " said geir lundestad , director of the nobel institute .
" they want as few nations as possible to accept the invitation .
now we 'll see who does not come for political reasons and who have other reasons . " the nobel committee has said 44 nations will be sending envoys to the ceremony , including eu member states , the united states , japan , india , south korea , south africa , indonesia and brazil . political , social motives bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at the ceremony , 20 countries will have empty chairs but another 20 countries have said they will not be in attendance .
serbia cited its interest in maintaining good relations with china for its absence , but other countries , including russia , are offering other reasons .
moscow has said scheduling difficulties - not political considerations - were keeping it away . but the scheduling conflicts veil russia 's political motive not to attend , according to sergei lukashevsky , the head of moscow 's sakharov museum . " that russia is not participating in the nobel peace prize 's award ceremony once again makes it clear that human rights do not play a prominent role in our foreign policy , " he said . " russia and china are members of the shanghai organization for cooperation and one of its goals is the fight against so-called extremism , " lukashevsky added .
" what that really means is that the countries support each other when it comes to fighting uncomfortable political situations . several countries in the middle east as well as afghanistan , pakistan and the philippines are also avoiding the ceremony because for economic and political reasons , according to rainer sollich , head of deutsche welle 's arabic department . " they are all states that have problems concerning human rights and operate under the understanding that they would n't want china at a ceremony honoring someone they view as an opponent of their regime . " china 's confucius prize china 's policy regarding the award ceremony and the still-imprisoned dissident liu has been clear .
referring to the nobel committee , chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman jiang yu said , " we will not change because of interference by a few clowns . " beijing awarded its own version of the nobel peace prize on thursday by giving the " confucius peace prize " to former taiwan vice-president lien chan .
like with liu 's nobel , chan was not in attendance to claim the award and his office said he was unaware of the prize . china has blocked access to the website of norwegian broadcaster nrk , the station said on thursday .
access to the bbc and cnn has also been affected ahead of friday 's ceremony , according to nrk . conspicuous absence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more protests in support of liu are scheduled for thursday friday will mark only the second time in the more than 100-year history of the prize that neither the laureate nor a representative will be able to come accept the award .
german journalist and pacifist carl von ossietzky , who was locked up in a nazi concentration camp , could not travel to oslo for his prize ceremony in 1936 . in addition to liu and ossietzky , myanmar 's aung san suu kyi was also barred from receiving her nobel peace prize in 1991 . liu has long been an outspoken opponent of chinese leadership in beijing and was at the forefront of the 1989 tiananmen square protests .
he was jailed in december 2009 for 11 years on subversion charges after co-authoring " charter 08 , " a manifesto that called for political reform in china . nobel officials said an empty chair would be used to represent liu 's absence . the 20 nations which will not attend the nobel ceremony are : afghanistan , china , colombia , cuba , egypt , iran , iraq , kazakhstan , morocco , pakistan , the philippines , russia , saudi arabia , serbia , sri lanka , sudan , tunisia , ukraine , venezuela and vietnam . authors : matthias von hein , jegor winogradow / sms -lrb- afp -rrb- editor : jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in its one-hundred-year history , this is the first time that the prize is awarded to a chinese citizen .
yet , the laureate , his family members , and even close friends are incarcerated in their own country .
no one can come to receive the award . the scottish pen has produced a " liu xiaobo chair " , which has been sent over to oslo .
now it stands in the city hall .
this empty chair is a reminder that its owner , who should enjoy the highest international honor today , is absent from the ceremony , banquet and concert , which are devoted to him . the host country 's king , the queen , european royal families , foreign ambassadors and representatives , as well as guests from overseas gather in the bright hall decorated with flowers and make a toast to xiaobo .
but many of us are still melancholy , and we ask , where is liu xiaobo and his beloved liu xia ?
let us travel through time and space and visit liu xia first . we are in haidian district , beijing , yuyuantan south road number 9 .
from a distance one can see the white building where the lius live .
the police cars are parked in front of the house ; several policemen parade around .
journalists from far and near are cordoned off some hundred meters away .
no one is allowed to get into the forbidden zone . thin , with a shaven head -lrb- or short-cropped hair -rrb- , liu xia is sitting alone in the empty home .
rinse the ashtray the coffee table wiped take the glass cups boil two cups of longjing or oolong aside the table you sit looking at the cup in front of the empty seat stare at the cup , listen is there the move of key in the hole ...
the cup in the hand , you take a sip lifted the cup to the sun cup and your fingers penetrated by the sun palm was stained by the transparent green delicate a hint of panic is there too the cup on the opposite site you know will be empty for a long time it takes long till the man opens your door -lrb- from liu ’ s poem " sunshine and cups - to my little finger , who drinks tea every day " -rrb- liu xia may wait for a long time , maybe another ten years .
now we visit xiaobo in jinzhou prison in the small chinese town nanshan in liaoning province .
entering the gate , we see several scattered buildings .
surprisingly , we see a huge office wall on which is written boldly ' 1984 ' .
a few months ago , liu xia , accompanied by the stainless steel mouse liu di , wang jinbo , mo zhixu and wang zhongxia , came here for a visit .
they were amazed at orwell ’ s rebirth in a chinese prison . snickering , they took pictures in front of the " 1984 wall " .
several officers rushed to them and took them into custody .
separately , they were interrogated for hours . we enter xiaobo ’ s cell now .
he shares with five other prisoners a 3 by 4 meter space .
his head is bald , shaved like an ordinary criminal .
his body is swollen by the padded jacket and trousers .
scarf , hat and gloves are a must in the cell because the concrete floor of the prison is cold .
the small window beneath the high ceiling is always open .
in winter , the indoor temperature is higher than outdoors ; it is a few degrees above zero .
the odor of the open toilet bucket in the corner is neutralized by the cold air , but one can not ignore the stench of the daily waste of several men .
the smell not only fills the room , it penetrates through clothes , and into the pores of the skin . this is the first winter that xiaobo spends in a prison in northern china .
he will have to adjust himself to the circumstances .
he does not know whether he will have frostbite .
to sit and lie on the concrete floors all year round may cause neck and spine pain and lead to kidney problems .
his stomach disease has given him a hard time since his imprisonment .
xiaobo has exited his cell today , but he does not want to show it to others otherwise his cell-mates might become cynical and angry .
sitting there , his thoughts fly to oslo .
he has had constant dreams about it .
who will be there at the ceremony ?
who will receive the prize for me ?
it could not be liu xia .
she has not sent any sign of life for a while .
my acceptance speech is long written in my head , but who can read it out aloud for me ?
does the king wear a majestic tuxedo , and the queen her crown at the banquet ?
will the distinguished guests think of the dead in tiananmen square and the tiananmen mothers and make a toast ?
sitting in the dungeon , xiaobo does not know that the announcement of his award induced a tsunami in zhongnanhai , and the rulers had a mild concussion , followed by delusions : they believe that their enemies are all over the world , so the grip on the naughty writers and the guy who held the crab dinner party must be tightened .
they must not go outside the country , otherwise they could endanger national security .
liu xiaobo ’ s dinner on december 10 , 2010 may look like this : boiled vegetables with sand , and a few pieces of fat meat as a special treat .
he might have an extra piece of steamed bread , and his rice bowl could also be refilled today .
in short , it is a privileged meal that will long be remembered , because it is a meal that will leave the stomach truly filled .
after all , he is the first chinese to win the nobel peace prize .

in its one-hundred-year history , this is the first time that the prize is awarded to a chinese citizen .
yet , the laureate , his family members , and even close friends are incarcerated in their own country .
no one can come to receive the award . the scottish pen has produced a " liu xiaobo chair " , which has been sent over to oslo .
now it stands in the city hall .
this empty chair is a reminder that its owner , who should enjoy the highest international honor today , is absent from the ceremony , banquet and concert , which are devoted to him . the host country 's king , the queen , european royal families , foreign ambassadors and representatives , as well as guests from overseas gather in the bright hall decorated with flowers and make a toast to xiaobo .
but many of us are still melancholy , and we ask , where is liu xiaobo and his beloved liu xia ?
let us travel through time and space and visit liu xia first . we are in haidian district , beijing , yuyuantan south road number 9 .
from a distance one can see the white building where the lius live .
the police cars are parked in front of the house ; several policemen parade around .
journalists from far and near are cordoned off some hundred meters away .
no one is allowed to get into the forbidden zone . thin , with a shaven head -lrb- or short-cropped hair -rrb- , liu xia is sitting alone in the empty home .
rinse the ashtray the coffee table wiped take the glass cups boil two cups of longjing or oolong aside the table you sit looking at the cup in front of the empty seat stare at the cup , listen is there the move of key in the hole ...
the cup in the hand , you take a sip lifted the cup to the sun cup and your fingers penetrated by the sun palm was stained by the transparent green delicate a hint of panic is there too the cup on the opposite site you know will be empty for a long time it takes long till the man opens your door -lrb- from liu ’ s poem " sunshine and cups - to my little finger , who drinks tea every day " -rrb- liu xia may wait for a long time , maybe another ten years .
now we visit xiaobo in jinzhou prison in the small chinese town nanshan in liaoning province .
entering the gate , we see several scattered buildings .
surprisingly , we see a huge office wall on which is written boldly ' 1984 ' .
a few months ago , liu xia , accompanied by the stainless steel mouse liu di , wang jinbo , mo zhixu and wang zhongxia , came here for a visit .
they were amazed at orwell ’ s rebirth in a chinese prison . snickering , they took pictures in front of the " 1984 wall " .
several officers rushed to them and took them into custody .
separately , they were interrogated for hours . we enter xiaobo ’ s cell now .
he shares with five other prisoners a 3 by 4 meter space .
his head is bald , shaved like an ordinary criminal .
his body is swollen by the padded jacket and trousers .
scarf , hat and gloves are a must in the cell because the concrete floor of the prison is cold .
the small window beneath the high ceiling is always open .
in winter , the indoor temperature is higher than outdoors ; it is a few degrees above zero .
the odor of the open toilet bucket in the corner is neutralized by the cold air , but one can not ignore the stench of the daily waste of several men .
the smell not only fills the room , it penetrates through clothes , and into the pores of the skin . this is the first winter that xiaobo spends in a prison in northern china .
he will have to adjust himself to the circumstances .
he does not know whether he will have frostbite .
to sit and lie on the concrete floors all year round may cause neck and spine pain and lead to kidney problems .
his stomach disease has given him a hard time since his imprisonment .
xiaobo has exited his cell today , but he does not want to show it to others otherwise his cell-mates might become cynical and angry .
sitting there , his thoughts fly to oslo .
he has had constant dreams about it .
who will be there at the ceremony ?
who will receive the prize for me ?
it could not be liu xia .
she has not sent any sign of life for a while .
my acceptance speech is long written in my head , but who can read it out aloud for me ?
does the king wear a majestic tuxedo , and the queen her crown at the banquet ?
will the distinguished guests think of the dead in tiananmen square and the tiananmen mothers and make a toast ?
sitting in the dungeon , xiaobo does not know that the announcement of his award induced a tsunami in zhongnanhai , and the rulers had a mild concussion , followed by delusions : they believe that their enemies are all over the world , so the grip on the naughty writers and the guy who held the crab dinner party must be tightened .
they must not go outside the country , otherwise they could endanger national security .
liu xiaobo ’ s dinner on december 10 , 2010 may look like this : boiled vegetables with sand , and a few pieces of fat meat as a special treat .
he might have an extra piece of steamed bread , and his rice bowl could also be refilled today .
in short , it is a privileged meal that will long be remembered , because it is a meal that will leave the stomach truly filled .
after all , he is the first chinese to win the nobel peace prize .

but guests gathered around an empty chair to congratulate the laureate , who was not represented at the ceremony . the nobel peace prize committee has concluded its award ceremony in oslo with the prizewinner and guest of honor , imprisoned chinese dissident liu xiaobo , absent .
the prize was meant to " point out the relationship between human rights , democracy and peace " , nobel peace prize committee chairman thorbjoern jagland said in his opening comments .
he called liu a symbol of the " non-violent struggle for such -lsb- human -rsb- rights in china " , and compared him with nelson mandela .
he went on to say that liu had done nothing but exercise his civil rights , and called on china to release him .
in his absence , norwegian actress liv ullmann read a final statement titled " i have no enemies " released by liu 's supporters after his sentencing a year ago .
in it , liu said " there is no force that can put an end to the human quest for freedom , and china will in the end become a nation ruled by law , where human rights reign supreme . "
he also spoke of his wife , liu xia , who is now under house arrest in beijing , saying her love " is the sunlight that leaps over high walls and penetrates the iron bars of my prison window . "
international solidarity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : liu xiaobo is considered a criminal by the chinese authorities throughout friday , western governments paid tribute to liu 's contribution to democracy and human rights , calling on china to release the dissident from prison .
in berlin , german human rights commissioner markus loening praised liu 's courageous stand for human rights .
" the participation of germany as well as all eu partners represented in oslo and many other countries in the ceremony in oslo is therefore a simple sign of respect for liu xiaobo and for all who work to promote human rights and democracy without resorting to violence , " a statement from loening on the german foreign ministry website said .
united states president barack obama meanwhile hailed liu as a beacon of freedom : " the values he espouses are universal , his struggle is peaceful , and he should be released as soon as possible , " obama said .
event overshadowed the event in the norwegian capital was overshadowed not only by liu 's absence , but also by china 's wider anger at his selection .
several nations decided to boycott the ceremony at beijing 's request after the chinese government condemned the decision to award the prize to the democracy activist .
almost a third of the 50 countries invited to the event stayed away , including russia , pakistan and saudi arabia .
many of those not attending are thought to have bowed to chinese pressure .
serbia , which was heavily criticized by the european union for its initial decision not to attend , decided at the last minute to send an ombudsman after all .
chinese media condemn choice bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an empty chair represented liu at the ceremony official chinese media have slammed the choice of liu as nobel peace prize laureate , calling it an attempt to impose foreign values on china .
liu has been a critic of the chinese government since the tiananmen square massacre of 1989 .
liu took a prominent part in the protests there and was sentenced to two years in prison .
he was jailed last december for 11 years on subversion charges after he co-authored a document called charter 08 , which calls for political reform in china .
authorities have also cracked down on activists in the run-up to the ceremony and have prevented liu 's family and friends from attending .
empty chair the nobel committee chose to represent liu with an empty chair during the ceremony , calling this a symbol of the chinese policy to isolate and repress dissidents .
in a moving gesture , jagland placed the nobel diploma on the vacant seat .
it is the first time that a laureate under detention has not been formally represented since 1935 , when nazi germany stopped the pacifist carl von ossietzky from attending .
it is also the first time since then that the prize money of 1.13 million euros -lrb- $ 1.5 million -rrb- will not be handed out .

meanwhile , chinese pressure seems to have galvanized western democracies . it will forever remain the symbol of this year 's nobel peace prize ceremony in oslo .
as dignitaries from around the world stood and applauded , norwegian nobel committee chairman thorbjoern jagland placed the blue clad nobel diploma on the empty chair , where liu xiaobo would have sat .
liu , a 54-year-old literary critic and democracy advocate , is serving an 11-year prison sentence for subversion , handed down last year after he co-authored a bold appeal for human rights and political reform .
a sign of china 's weakness in his speech at the ceremony , jagland noted liu 's imprisonment and regretted that he was not present to receive the award .
" this fact alone shows that the award was necessary and appropriate , " jagland said . he added that despite all of china 's economic strength , its weakness was manifested " in the need to imprison a man for 11 years merely for expressing his opinions on how his country should be governed . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a flower is placed near a picture of liu xiaobo in hong kong on friday liu xiaobo had told his wife that he would like this year ’ s peace prize to be dedicated to " the lost souls from june 4 " .
he was referring to the many activists who died during the firing by government troops on the tiananmen square in beijing .
the nobel committee has accepted his wish .
jagland also said that , although none of the committee ’ s members had ever met liu , " we feel that we know him .
we have studied him closely over a long period of time " .
chinese pressure backfires while china had successfully pressured more than a dozen countries not to attend the ceremony to honor liu xiaobo , it seemed in oslo that its efforts also backfired in a way . after all , it was the chinese government 's pressure which transformed liu into a cause celebre among global rights activists .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chinese citizens clash with troops near tiananmen square in beijing in 1989 moreover , the pressure felt in oslo even hours before the ceremony , seemed to be galvanizing the west , reminding citizens of democracies of the values the nobel peace prize stands for .
china 's pressure tactics had continued unabated on friday .
amnesty international 's oslo representatives said that members of norway 's chinese community were being pressured by chinese diplomats to join anti-nobel protests planned for saturday .
the nobel committee chairman emphasized that the committee ’ s intention had been to make a statement about the relationship between human rights , democracy and peace .
the rights democracies around the world enjoyed today were fought for and won by people who took great risks .
" they did so for others .
that is why liu xiaobo deserves our support , " jagland said .

" there is a spirit that is uniting us all , " the german chancellor told reporters during a break in the talks .
" if the euro fails , the european union fails , too . "
president sarkozy , meanwhile , pledged that germany and france " will defend the euro , because the euro is europe . "
sarkozy also backed germany 's opposition to creating unified european sovereign bonds .
the idea of harmonizing some eurozone debt , as suggested by several members of the currency union , has met with strong opposition from germany and france , whose balance sheets are relatively healthy .
" french and german citizens would not be happy if we were to bundle the debts together , " the french president said .
he argued that the concept might be worth considering in the future , but only after the bloc 's members ramp up their economic and political cooperation .
" we should not put the cart before the horse , " sarkozy told reporters .
european leaders , or bullies ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france and germany are unwilling to unify european debts earlier in the week , merkel and germany had come under fire over this issue from luxembourg 's prime minister jean-claude juncker , who also heads the eurozone .
juncker said that creating taboo subjects without even considering the ideas of others was " a very un-european way of dealing with european issues . " as the two largest eu members , france and germany both have a sizeable share of the voting power within the bloc , and need relatively little support from other countries in order to secure a majority .
" without agreement from france and germany - the historic motors of european integration and two economies that make up half of the eurozone 's gross domestic product - nothing very important is possible , " professor henrik uterwedde from the franco-german institute in ludwigsburg told deutsche welle .
" so on the one hand , they must reach agreements , and help the union move forward , but at the same time , they do n't always do enough to treat the other members as equal partners and involve them in the decision-making processes . "
friday 's meeting was in preparation for the eu summit in brussels on december 16 and 17 , at which the bloc 's economic difficulties such as unemployment and national debt are bound to top the agenda .
troop deployment symbolic of closer cooperation while sarkozy and merkel discussed the harmonization of economic policies like labor and taxation laws , saying this would improve the eurozone 's coherence as an economic bloc , military leaders just across the border were preparing a more visible symbol of franco-german cooperation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the last german battalions in france had a very different mission the first german battalion to be stationed on french soil since the nazi occupation in world war ii officially took up their post near the border-city of strasbourg on friday .
german defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg and his french counterpart alain juppe attended a ceremony to mark the event .
" german soldiers are today welcome in france , " merkel said across the border in freiburg .
" for me , that has great symbolism , after all that germany was guilty of during the nazi era . "
the battalion , which will eventually consist of 600 soldiers , is part of the joint franco-german brigade .
" i was always surprised that the franco-german brigade only consisted of french soldiers in germany , " sarkozy said .
" we are two sovereign nations , two countries at peace , two countries that founded europe . "
franco-german genesis of eu sarkozy was referring to the forerunner of the modern-day european union , the european coal and steel community .
this trade-oriented union was established in 1953 as part of post-war efforts to negate the possibility of future conflict between france and germany by making them economically interdependent .
between 1870 and 1945 , the two neighbors fought three devastating wars .
" above all else , i think putting these german troops in france is a symbolic exercise , " franco-german expert , professor henrik uterwedde said .
" but sometimes symbolism is important . "
" that famous photo of -lsb- former german chancellor -rsb- helmut kohl and -lsb- then french president -rsb- francois mitterand standing hand-in-hand at the world war one commemorations in verdun in 1984 was pure symbolism , too - but it was a hugely significant image . "
bildunterschrift : sometimes symbolism can move mountains the alsace region where the german battalion us now stationed spans the franco-german border , and has changed hands several times over the centuries .

that doesn ’ t hold true for some other countries . the charge that us foreign policy is hypocritical is all but new , but the wikileaks data release has added some additional fuel to it .
just a few days ago , libya 's leader muammar gaddafi lauded the organization for exposing us " hypocrisy " through its diplomacy conducted behind closed doors , in comments published via the state news agency jana .
according to gaddafi , the leaked cables " proved that america is not what it has led allies and friends to believe it to be " and that " us relations with its allies are hypocritical . "
while there is certainly an expected discrepancy in the tone and style of these confidential reports and the language us diplomats use in public , the cables actually reveal that the us has been largely consistent with the overall messages and themes it conveys to its international partners in private and in public , argue scholars interviewed by deutsche welle . " there 's nothing in these cables that is different from what we actually know about us foreign policy without these cables , " says thomas risse , director of the center for transnational relations , foreign and security policy at the free university of berlin .
" the whole approach by these people from wikileaks seems to be that there is a public side to us foreign policy and then there is this secret side and that there is some sort conspiracy involved in all this , " he says .
" and i do n't see a huge mismatch actually between what the us says in public and what it does . "
clear goals one of the dominant topics in these cables are us security interests and the fact that washington considers transnational terrorism a major threat , adds risse : " that is exactly what barack obama and hillary clinton would say every day . "
the same is true for other top issues such as the iranian nuclear program , the spread of nuclear and ballistic missiles and the stabilization of afghanistan , says dan reiter , a professor of international relations at emory university in atlanta : " at the broadest level i think the cables reveal that the goals the us is engaging in private are essentially similar to the goals that it is espousing in public . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : saudi king abdullah urged the president barack obama to take action against iran asked whether the insights gained from reading the frank assessments of diplomats engaged in shaping and carrying out us foreign policy will alter their view of the us role or status in the world , risse and reiter both answer with a resounding no . " the us is not an empire , there are very clear limits to us influence in the world , " says risse .
" of course the us is a superpower .
it has interests in all corners of the world , it does try to influence other governments , but that 's ok .
there 's nothing that would get me worked up about this at all . "
no puppet master the cables are " not terribly surprising , " notes reiter .
" one does n't get an image of the united states as this all-powerful puppet master trying to pull the strings of various governments around the world to serve its corporate interests .
that 's an image which does not emerge . "
instead , the cables paint a picture of the us acting as one would expect a major power to do so , adds reiter .
" i do n't think that anything we see is terribly different from the way most states have conducted their foreign policy in the modern era . "
what 's more surprising to the analysts is the behavior of arab countries that becomes evident in the cables .
while the opposition of arab states to iran 's nuclear program has been known in foreign policy circles for some time , the contrast between confidential assessments made in private and public statements is particularly stark . double talk " the level of hypocrisy that comes out of these cables is much higher for instance in the middle east , " says risse .
" it 's very clear from these cables that most arab states feel really threatened by iranian nuclear power , however they would never say that in public .
in fact , they say the opposite in public . "
according to the cables , king abdullah of saudi arabia and king hamed ibn isa khalifa of bahrain are among arab leaders who pressed the us to attack iran .
king abdullah repeatedly exhorted the united states to " cut off the head of the snake " and take military action against tehran 's nuclear facilities .
open questions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : to evaluate the cables properly , scholars need more information about the documents in contrast to that , conclude the experts , the general outlines of us foreign policy are pretty much in sync with what the wikileaks documents have revealed so far and they have n't unearthed anything entirely unexpected .
nevertheless , argues risse , the document dump still poses a serious problem : " if you look at these cables from the perspective of an academic or historian , the real big question is what is the sample , ? " says risse . " is this a random selection , is this a selection that is representative of the whole or what exactly is it .
we have absolutely no way to judge this . "
risse notes , that even if all 250,000 cables are published in the end , it is still not clear how large a sample this is , how relevant the cables are or were in the decision-making processes for us officials and what the criteria were to publish them .

that doesn ’ t hold true for some other countries . the charge that us foreign policy is hypocritical is all but new , but the wikileaks data release has added some additional fuel to it .
just a few days ago , libya 's leader muammar gaddafi lauded the organization for exposing us " hypocrisy " through its diplomacy conducted behind closed doors , in comments published via the state news agency jana .
according to gaddafi , the leaked cables " proved that america is not what it has led allies and friends to believe it to be " and that " us relations with its allies are hypocritical . "
while there is certainly an expected discrepancy in the tone and style of these confidential reports and the language us diplomats use in public , the cables actually reveal that the us has been largely consistent with the overall messages and themes it conveys to its international partners in private and in public , argue scholars interviewed by deutsche welle . " there 's nothing in these cables that is different from what we actually know about us foreign policy without these cables , " says thomas risse , director of the center for transnational relations , foreign and security policy at the free university of berlin .
" the whole approach by these people from wikileaks seems to be that there is a public side to us foreign policy and then there is this secret side and that there is some sort conspiracy involved in all this , " he says .
" and i do n't see a huge mismatch actually between what the us says in public and what it does . "
clear goals one of the dominant topics in these cables are us security interests and the fact that washington considers transnational terrorism a major threat , adds risse : " that is exactly what barack obama and hillary clinton would say every day . "
the same is true for other top issues such as the iranian nuclear program , the spread of nuclear and ballistic missiles and the stabilization of afghanistan , says dan reiter , a professor of international relations at emory university in atlanta : " at the broadest level i think the cables reveal that the goals the us is engaging in private are essentially similar to the goals that it is espousing in public . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : saudi king abdullah urged the president barack obama to take action against iran asked whether the insights gained from reading the frank assessments of diplomats engaged in shaping and carrying out us foreign policy will alter their view of the us role or status in the world , risse and reiter both answer with a resounding no . " the us is not an empire , there are very clear limits to us influence in the world , " says risse .
" of course the us is a superpower .
it has interests in all corners of the world , it does try to influence other governments , but that 's ok .
there 's nothing that would get me worked up about this at all . "
no puppet master the cables are " not terribly surprising , " notes reiter .
" one does n't get an image of the united states as this all-powerful puppet master trying to pull the strings of various governments around the world to serve its corporate interests .
that 's an image which does not emerge . "
instead , the cables paint a picture of the us acting as one would expect a major power to do so , adds reiter .
" i do n't think that anything we see is terribly different from the way most states have conducted their foreign policy in the modern era . "
what 's more surprising to the analysts is the behavior of arab countries that becomes evident in the cables .
while the opposition of arab states to iran 's nuclear program has been known in foreign policy circles for some time , the contrast between confidential assessments made in private and public statements is particularly stark . double talk " the level of hypocrisy that comes out of these cables is much higher for instance in the middle east , " says risse .
" it 's very clear from these cables that most arab states feel really threatened by iranian nuclear power , however they would never say that in public .
in fact , they say the opposite in public . "
according to the cables , king abdullah of saudi arabia and king hamed ibn isa khalifa of bahrain are among arab leaders who pressed the us to attack iran .
king abdullah repeatedly exhorted the united states to " cut off the head of the snake " and take military action against tehran 's nuclear facilities .
open questions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : to evaluate the cables properly , scholars need more information about the documents in contrast to that , conclude the experts , the general outlines of us foreign policy are pretty much in sync with what the wikileaks documents have revealed so far and they have n't unearthed anything entirely unexpected .
nevertheless , argues risse , the document dump still poses a serious problem : " if you look at these cables from the perspective of an academic or historian , the real big question is what is the sample , ? " says risse . " is this a random selection , is this a selection that is representative of the whole or what exactly is it .
we have absolutely no way to judge this . "
risse notes , that even if all 250,000 cables are published in the end , it is still not clear how large a sample this is , how relevant the cables are or were in the decision-making processes for us officials and what the criteria were to publish them .
without those answers , many of which could be provided by wikileaks , a thorough assessment of the cables and its content wo n't be possible . author : michael knigge editor : rob mudge send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" there is a spirit that is uniting us all , " the german chancellor told reporters during a break in the talks .
" if the euro fails , the european union fails , too . "
president sarkozy , meanwhile , pledged that germany and france " will defend the euro , because the euro is europe . "
sarkozy also backed germany 's opposition to creating unified european sovereign bonds .
the idea of harmonizing some eurozone debt , as suggested by several members of the currency union , has met with strong opposition from germany and france , whose balance sheets are relatively healthy .
" french and german citizens would not be happy if we were to bundle the debts together , " the french president said .
he argued that the concept might be worth considering in the future , but only after the bloc 's members ramp up their economic and political cooperation .
" we should not put the cart before the horse , " sarkozy told reporters .
european leaders , or bullies ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france and germany are unwilling to unify european debts earlier in the week , merkel and germany had come under fire over this issue from luxembourg 's prime minister jean-claude juncker , who also heads the eurozone .
juncker said that creating taboo subjects without even considering the ideas of others was " a very un-european way of dealing with european issues . " as the two largest eu members , france and germany both have a sizeable share of the voting power within the bloc , and need relatively little support from other countries in order to secure a majority .
" without agreement from france and germany - the historic motors of european integration and two economies that make up half of the eurozone 's gross domestic product - nothing very important is possible , " professor henrik uterwedde from the franco-german institute in ludwigsburg told deutsche welle .
" so on the one hand , they must reach agreements , and help the union move forward , but at the same time , they do n't always do enough to treat the other members as equal partners and involve them in the decision-making processes . "
friday 's meeting was in preparation for the eu summit in brussels on december 16 and 17 , at which the bloc 's economic difficulties such as unemployment and national debt are bound to top the agenda .
troop deployment symbolic of closer cooperation while sarkozy and merkel discussed the harmonization of economic policies like labor and taxation laws , saying this would improve the eurozone 's coherence as an economic bloc , military leaders just across the border were preparing a more visible symbol of franco-german cooperation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the last german battalions in france had a very different mission the first german battalion to be stationed on french soil since the nazi occupation in world war ii officially took up their post near the border-city of strasbourg on friday .
german defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg and his french counterpart alain juppe attended a ceremony to mark the event .
" german soldiers are today welcome in france , " merkel said across the border in freiburg .
" for me , that has great symbolism , after all that germany was guilty of during the nazi era . "
the battalion , which will eventually consist of 600 soldiers , is part of the joint franco-german brigade .
" i was always surprised that the franco-german brigade only consisted of french soldiers in germany , " sarkozy said .
" we are two sovereign nations , two countries at peace , two countries that founded europe . "
franco-german genesis of eu sarkozy was referring to the forerunner of the modern-day european union , the european coal and steel community .
this trade-oriented union was established in 1953 as part of post-war efforts to negate the possibility of future conflict between france and germany by making them economically interdependent .
between 1870 and 1945 , the two neighbors fought three devastating wars .
" above all else , i think putting these german troops in france is a symbolic exercise , " franco-german expert , professor henrik uterwedde said .
" but sometimes symbolism is important . "
" that famous photo of -lsb- former german chancellor -rsb- helmut kohl and -lsb- then french president -rsb- francois mitterand standing hand-in-hand at the world war one commemorations in verdun in 1984 was pure symbolism , too - but it was a hugely significant image . "
bildunterschrift : sometimes symbolism can move mountains the alsace region where the german battalion us now stationed spans the franco-german border , and has changed hands several times over the centuries .

standing alongside serb prime minister mirko cvetkovic , he said that the eu " regrets the decision of serbia not to attend " the ceremony and added that serbia was " expected to embrace euro values and coordinate " with partners .
his words had a deep impact : while the foreign minister of serbia had originally defended the country 's decision not to attend the ceremony , serbia decided to send its ombudsman for human rights , sasa jankovic , to oslo .
serbia was the only eu candidate that originally decided to stay away from the ceremony honoring chinese human rights activist liu xiaobo .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the chinese government refused to let liu xiaobo attend the ceremony : his seat remained empty after the announcement of this year 's laureate , china had protested against the nobel committee 's decision and had urged other countries to boycott the ceremony .
serbia followed china 's call , as it relies on chinese government support for serbia 's opposition to an independent kosovo .
caught between a rock and a hard place but serbia is caught in a clash of interests , because it wants to join the 27-nation bloc of the european union .
fuele and other eu representatives clarified that serbia needed to comply with the joint decision of eu member states to send representatives to oslo in order not to lessen its chances of becoming a member state .
pedrag simic , political scientist at the university of belgrad says that despite serbia 's goal to join the european union , the country would still rely on four pillars of international politics - brussels , washington , moscow , and peking .
" a small country can only follow one superpower , " he said .
simic added that serbia 's attempts to be loyal to both china and the european union had to result in a dilemma such as the current one at some point .

but the west seems unmoved . despite changes in afghan law and a constitution designed to protect women 's rights , violence and abuse of women continue to be a serious problem in the country , and the government is not doing enough to prevent it .
that is the conclusion of a new report published by the united nations assistance mission in afghanistan -lrb- unama -rrb- .
the most common forms of abuse include forced and child marriage , honor killings and giving away girls to settle disputes under the tradition of baad .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the report says violence against afghan women is still widespread " the report describes the prevalence of these practices , " georgette gagnon , unama 's director of human rights , said at a press conference .
" it looks at the consequences these practices have on the lives of afghan women and girls and the community as a whole and it also looks at the efforts of the afghan government to address violence against women . "
one of these efforts , the 2009 law of elimination of violence against women -lrb- evaw -rrb- , came under particular scrutiny .
the law , which gagnon described as " a huge gain of legal protection of women 's rights , " criminalizes buying and selling women for marriage , forcing a woman to marry without her consent , forcing girls to marry when they are underage , and forcing girls and women to commit self-immolation - when they set themselves on fire .
ignorance and lack of enforcement but according to the report , the new law is not being enforced in many parts of the country , and is often not even known .
bele grau , program manager for afghanistan at the women 's rights organisation medica mondiale agreed with this assessment .
" on the theoretical and legal level the situation is getting better – but in practice it is often not implemented , " she told deutsche welle .
" this law has been in force for a year , but a lot of judges do n't even know it , and if they do , they do n't enforce it . "
the un women 's organization unifem says that around 87 percent of afghan women suffer from domestic violence , and that half of all girls are married under the age of 15 .
on top of this , grau says that many of the rights that women have won are repealed by new laws .
she cites one recent regulation that bans women who have run away from an abusive home from seeking refuge with strangers .
this in practice leaves many women only the unrealistic option of going to relatives .
many women are also still imprisoned for running away , in contravention of the evaw law .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : westerwelle suggested democracy can not be imposed on afghanistan the report found that much of the abuse is founded in afghan tradition .
" one very harmful practice that we heard a lot about is baad , which is the giving away of girls to settle disputes , " said gagnon .
" many of the women told us that instead of a murderer being punished , an innocent girl is punished and she has to spend all her life in slavery and is subjected to cruel violence .
sometimes she is forced to sleep with the animals in the barn . "
western indifference the report sets out a number of recommendations for the afghan government to deal with the problem , but grau says that the west has an obligation to apply pressure in order to protect women 's rights – not least because this is often used to add legitimacy to the war in afghanistan .
" we 've noticed this in most of the western governments , " she said .
" for the past year , all the talk is about withdrawal of troops , and negotiations with the taliban etc . , and that afghans have to work out for themselves how much democracy or women 's rights they want .
these are now all internal afghan issues that are n't discussed or even noticed anymore .
the german government is no exception to this . "
she believes that pressure could be exhorted through the financial aid the west gives to the afghan government .
" the western governments still give afghanistan a lot of development money , " she said .
" and when they make conditions for giving this money , we think they should make them for human rights and women 's rights , not just for taking over security duties . "
" the issue of women 's rights was also one of the justifications for the war itself , but that is suddenly disappearing from the agenda , " she added .
" earlier this year , -lrb- german foreign minister guido -rrb- westerwelle said , ' well , afghanistan is not switzerland , ' and with that everything is swept from the table . "

products from traditional european toymakers like lego and playmobil are in high demand . german parents typically spend oodles on their kids for christmas .
but with the buoyant economy this season , they 're spending even more .
so much more , in fact , that retailers are scrambling to stock hot products , like playmobil 's " robo-gangster " toy car with figures or lego 's " stars wars " spaceship .
some manufacturers now warn they may no longer be able to fulfill everyone 's christmas wish .
" we know that from now until christmas demand will be growing daily -lrb- so -rrb- we ca n't guarantee 100 percent that every product will be available right up to december 24 , " said dirk engehausen , the lego deutschland managing director , in an interview with the german news station n-tv .
other german and european manufacturers have a similar holiday message to convey : they have n't run out of any products yet , but supplies are depleting fast and finding the one or other popular product a few days before christmas could prove to be a real treasure hunt .

record-breaking sales " more products were actually sold last year than the year before , " kahnt said .
" that surprised us .
but no one really thought that sales this year would be so good . "
the german toy industry association -lrb- dvsi -rrb- expects sales to increase six percent this to 2.52 billion euros , compared to 2.38 billion euros the year .
if that mark is reached , the holiday sales will be a huge factor .
retailers generate more than 40 percent of their annual revenue during the holiday shopping season .
for sure , numbers like these will make manufacturers and retailers happy .
their big challenge now is to deliver enough toys to make kids – and their parents – just as happy .

products from traditional european toymakers like lego and playmobil are in high demand . german parents typically spend oodles on their kids for christmas .
but with the buoyant economy this season , they 're spending even more .
so much more , in fact , that retailers are scrambling to stock hot products , like playmobil 's " robo-gangster " toy car with figures or lego 's " stars wars " spaceship .
some manufacturers now warn they may no longer be able to fulfill everyone 's christmas wish .
" we know that from now until christmas demand will be growing daily -lrb- so -rrb- we ca n't guarantee 100 percent that every product will be available right up to december 24 , " said dirk engehausen , the lego deutschland managing director , in an interview with the german news station n-tv .
other german and european manufacturers have a similar holiday message to convey : they have n't run out of any products yet , but supplies are depleting fast and finding the one or other popular product a few days before christmas could prove to be a real treasure hunt .
hurry while the supply lasts " none of our products have completely sold out in germany but some stores have run out of select products , " playmobil spokeswoman judith schweinitz told deutsche welle .

each december in oslo , the arguments about whether the right recipient was chosen can be just as fierce as the threats these winners often face because of their work .
individuals who take a stand for peace and reconciliation in difficult conflict situations tend to have more enemies than friends .
by awarding the detained chinese professor of literature and democracy activist , liu xiabo , this year 's peace prize in oslo on october 8 , the nobel committee made an apt comment on the changing global balance of power .
this is how its decision should be interpreted .
a rising power like china needs to respect human and civil rights for the benefit of all mankind - that was the message from oslo .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : adrienne woltersdorf , the head of deutsche welle 's chinese service , is in oslo it is a slap in the chinese authorities ' face .
they have reacted accordingly and suppressed any domestic discourse about the so eagerly awaited - and now so despised - first chinese nobel laureate in history .
in addition , many activists , including liu 's wife liu xia , were preemptively intimidated or simply put under house arrest .
the regime 's harsh reactions show that the norwegian jury really touched a nerve in beijing .
but it is ridiculous that those loyal to the regime allege that the nobel committee intended to provocatively and maliciously challenge china 's rise .
the truth , in fact , is the precise opposite .
for quite some time , even veteran cadres of the mao era have been calling for more freedom of thought in china .
just recently , a group of influential former cadres reiterated this demand in a letter to the new party leadership .
a rapidly changing society , they argued , needs freedom of debate and opportunity for criticism in order to make wise decisions for the future .
such voices will be encouraged by the nobel peace prize , and only the chinese can decide how china should develop .
in this sense , the peace prize for liu xiaobo is also a unique chance for the badly divided and marginalized chinese democracy movement .
oslo could thus become the starting point for a new movement .
but before this happens , democracy activists inside and outside of china will have to prove that they can restrain their somtimes excessive egos , and dedicate themselves to the collective cause .
the powers-that-be in beijing will do everything they can to continue to marginalize the proponents of democracy .
they have given sufficient proof during the past weeks that they are perfectly capable of doing this .
but the chinese civil rights activists now have an internationally recognized leader .
they have a prudent manifesto - liu xiaobo 's " charter ' 08 " document - they have a sympathetic international audience , and they have the internet ; all that they 're missing is a single movement to unite them .

dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content .
australia offers support to wikileaks founder , operation payback begins should assange be extradited to the united states ?
why ?
he did not spy , he did not steal all the data that was passed along to him - nor is he a us citizen .
the us has been caught with the pants way down and of course , does n't like it one bit .
the us has sprung a " leaki " in its " weaki " and does n't like it one " bitty . "
as the saying goes … those who live in glass houses should not be throwing stones . - vera , germany i believe asange did bring out the true colors of individuals , opinion makers and governments in the present context of world politics .
everyone should admire his forthright exposure , however bitter it may be ; more so the americans who expect democracies and freedom to speech to flourish around the globe .
extradition and implicating him will only show the us in bad light . - mohan , india no , he should n't be extradited .
it 's a witch hunt to divert blame from the people who should be overseeing us security .
we 've paid good money for homeland security .
whose fault is it that thousands of secret documents were released ? - wayne , us definitely not .
supporting corruption and lack of common sense has been the m.o. for too long .
someone needs to wake up the people over here , wikileaks is a good start . - gene , us the us has only itself to blame for the leaks ... its a schoolyard bully that 's now having a tantrum and calling on its buddies to help it in a scrap because it knows it ca n't nuke everyone that does n't agree with it .
in australia the us is seen as a gutless mongrel that will do anything to get its own way especially concerning energy drilling . - tom , australia julian assange is a xxi century hero , in the sixties the fight against the empire was with " guerrillas , " today the fight is with internet .
and he 's going to win . - crstina , spain the us is paranoid about wikileaks .
a typical response of killing the messenger .
no extradition of julian assange .
the eu should promote transparency and be more open about foreign policies and clarity of diplomatic mores in language . - j. , the netherlands no way jose !
who cares about america ?
not me anyway : -rrb- i 'm so happy about wikileaks and anything that harms america .
they think an insult to us is immoral , and that they are somehow better than the rest of us .
they are just greedy , self-important and power-obsessed .
everything they touch is tarnished .
they are so last century .
bring on the rise of china and india !
how dare they think they can " spy " on other countries in the un ! - brian , ireland if any european country extradites julian assange to the united states , it will be for a political " crime . "
is europe the running dog of the us , or a group of sovereign nations dedicated to freedom of the press , freedom of the individual and people having the right to know what is going on ?
kevin rudd claims that the core problem is the failure by the us to protect its diplomatic communications .
i think the core problem is the behavior of the us .
the reason that wikileaks has not released the diplomatic communications of other countries -lrb- eg : germany , australia -rrb- is that they are better behaved and do not goose-step on the world stage , trying to take over the world . - charles , australia i believe that having all that " secret " info available for everybody to learn was not the " status quo " however it was disclosed and it is done .
the fellow in jail in the united kingdom is actually a journalist devoted to inform the public .
if he ever is extradited to the us he can claim " freedom of expression . "
now , in terms of those " ladies " claiming sex crimes , that is a bit doubtful .
they have waited until now , come on !
i believe that it was a politically manipulated act to get him behind bars .
and if those allegedly " crimes " were committed in sweden , should n't he then be extradited to that country ? - elena , us no .
he 's a hero who has struck a powerful blow for freedom !
he should be given the medal of freedom award ! - michael , us no , he should not be extradited to the us ; he has not been charged with any us crime .
whatever one thinks about wikileaks , mr. assange is taking a principled stand against the establishment for personal convictions and at great risk to himself .
if the political solution is to restrict freedom of the internet it will amplify assange 's stance : that many elected politicians are duplicitous control freaks who need their over-used and abused powers curtailed .
he deserves respect , support and applause for his courage . - a. , japan i believe that assange is being targeted for what he did .
if he 's found guilty of real sexual misconduct , i believe he should be punished , but as far as the internet crap , i believe he 'll prevail .
he 'll probably either wimp out for future stuff , or he 'll feel more emboldened .
i 'd like to see the hackers messing with mastercard put to be punished though .
it causes too many undeserving people a lot of pain . - joe , us i am completely baffled by the case .
mr. assange has been arrested in a country -lrb- uk -rrb- which belongs to the interpol group of countries so , according to the rules , he might be obviously extradited to sweden - country which relies on " the rules " within the interpol group .
at the same time , mr. assange has been accused of allegedly having broken the law of another country -lrb- usa -rrb- which is also in the interpol group .
in addition , his own country -lrb- australia -rrb- has now given a hint of standing up for him by offering him legal help , not ruling out his extradition to australia -lrb- being also the interpol member . -rrb-
in addition , there is the international court of justice in the hague -lrb- operating within the uno . -rrb-
so international law , respective rules of law of the countries mentioned , international organizations -lrb- interpol , uno , eu -rrb- are all to be bundled in this case which is too much intricate to the ' untrained eye ' in this " legal maze .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : focus : china and the west - cooperation , competition and confrontation china flexed its muscles in 2010 us has fallen in esteem of many chinese predictions of america 's demise as superpower are greatly exaggerated does beijing have a grip on germany 's sinologists ? human rights -pipe- 10.12.2010 " on the day when liu xiaobo is absent at the nobel prize ceremony " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tienchi martin-liao tienchi martin-liao , president of the independent chinese pen center , a position that liu xiaobo has also held , has her own thoughts . today is the day when liu xiaobo receives the nobel peace prize .
in its one-hundred-year history , this is the first time that the prize is awarded to a chinese citizen .
yet , the laureate , his family members , and even close friends are incarcerated in their own country .
no one can come to receive the award . the scottish pen has produced a " liu xiaobo chair " , which has been sent over to oslo .
now it stands in the city hall .
this empty chair is a reminder that its owner , who should enjoy the highest international honor today , is absent from the ceremony , banquet and concert , which are devoted to him . the host country 's king , the queen , european royal families , foreign ambassadors and representatives , as well as guests from overseas gather in the bright hall decorated with flowers and make a toast to xiaobo .
but many of us are still melancholy , and we ask , where is liu xiaobo and his beloved liu xia ?
let us travel through time and space and visit liu xia first . we are in haidian district , beijing , yuyuantan south road number 9 .
from a distance one can see the white building where the lius live .
the police cars are parked in front of the house ; several policemen parade around .
journalists from far and near are cordoned off some hundred meters away .
no one is allowed to get into the forbidden zone . thin , with a shaven head -lrb- or short-cropped hair -rrb- , liu xia is sitting alone in the empty home .
rinse the ashtray the coffee table wiped take the glass cups boil two cups of longjing or oolong aside the table you sit looking at the cup in front of the empty seat stare at the cup , listen is there the move of key in the hole ...
the cup in the hand , you take a sip lifted the cup to the sun cup and your fingers penetrated by the sun palm was stained by the transparent green delicate a hint of panic is there too the cup on the opposite site you know will be empty for a long time it takes long till the man opens your door -lrb- from liu ’ s poem " sunshine and cups - to my little finger , who drinks tea every day " -rrb- liu xia may wait for a long time , maybe another ten years .
now we visit xiaobo in jinzhou prison in the small chinese town nanshan in liaoning province .
entering the gate , we see several scattered buildings .
surprisingly , we see a huge office wall on which is written boldly ' 1984 ' .
a few months ago , liu xia , accompanied by the stainless steel mouse liu di , wang jinbo , mo zhixu and wang zhongxia , came here for a visit .
they were amazed at orwell ’ s rebirth in a chinese prison . snickering , they took pictures in front of the " 1984 wall " .
several officers rushed to them and took them into custody .
separately , they were interrogated for hours . we enter xiaobo ’ s cell now .
he shares with five other prisoners a 3 by 4 meter space .
his head is bald , shaved like an ordinary criminal .
his body is swollen by the padded jacket and trousers .
scarf , hat and gloves are a must in the cell because the concrete floor of the prison is cold .
the small window beneath the high ceiling is always open .
in winter , the indoor temperature is higher than outdoors ; it is a few degrees above zero .
the odor of the open toilet bucket in the corner is neutralized by the cold air , but one can not ignore the stench of the daily waste of several men .
the smell not only fills the room , it penetrates through clothes , and into the pores of the skin . this is the first winter that xiaobo spends in a prison in northern china .
he will have to adjust himself to the circumstances .
he does not know whether he will have frostbite .
to sit and lie on the concrete floors all year round may cause neck and spine pain and lead to kidney problems .
his stomach disease has given him a hard time since his imprisonment .
xiaobo has exited his cell today , but he does not want to show it to others otherwise his cell-mates might become cynical and angry .
sitting there , his thoughts fly to oslo .
he has had constant dreams about it .
who will be there at the ceremony ?
who will receive the prize for me ?
it could not be liu xia .
she has not sent any sign of life for a while .
my acceptance speech is long written in my head , but who can read it out aloud for me ?
does the king wear a majestic tuxedo , and the queen her crown at the banquet ?
will the distinguished guests think of the dead in tiananmen square and the tiananmen mothers and make a toast ?
sitting in the dungeon , xiaobo does not know that the announcement of his award induced a tsunami in zhongnanhai , and the rulers had a mild concussion , followed by delusions : they believe that their enemies are all over the world , so the grip on the naughty writers and the guy who held the crab dinner party must be tightened .
they must not go outside the country , otherwise they could endanger national security .
liu xiaobo ’ s dinner on december 10 , 2010 may look like this : boiled vegetables with sand , and a few pieces of fat meat as a special treat .
he might have an extra piece of steamed bread , and his rice bowl could also be refilled today .
in short , it is a privileged meal that will long be remembered , because it is a meal that will leave the stomach truly filled .
after all , he is the first chinese to win the nobel peace prize .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de retail -pipe- 10.12.2010 toys r ' scarce in german stores großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lego hopes to fufill every child 's wish this christmas toy makers and retailers in germany could n't be happier : christmas shoppers appear to have a near insatiable appetite for toys .
products from traditional european toymakers like lego and playmobil are in high demand . german parents typically spend oodles on their kids for christmas .
but with the buoyant economy this season , they 're spending even more .
so much more , in fact , that retailers are scrambling to stock hot products , like playmobil 's " robo-gangster " toy car with figures or lego 's " stars wars " spaceship .
some manufacturers now warn they may no longer be able to fulfill everyone 's christmas wish .
" we know that from now until christmas demand will be growing daily -lrb- so -rrb- we ca n't guarantee 100 percent that every product will be available right up to december 24 , " said dirk engehausen , the lego deutschland managing director , in an interview with the german news station n-tv .
other german and european manufacturers have a similar holiday message to convey : they have n't run out of any products yet , but supplies are depleting fast and finding the one or other popular product a few days before christmas could prove to be a real treasure hunt .
hurry while the supply lasts " none of our products have completely sold out in germany but some stores have run out of select products , " playmobil spokeswoman judith schweinitz told deutsche welle .
" if you 're really determined to find these , you will but you might have to look around . "
while manufacturers had projected stronger holiday sales , few if any thought they would so strong .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : children in germany can expect plenty of gifts this year " we anticipated more demand this christmas but we 're surprised nevertheless by how huge the demand has been , " said heinrich huentelsmann , a ravensburger spokesperson .
" our tiptoi product , for instance , is still available but is becoming hard to find . "
that toy is one of the few that the german maker of games , puzzle and toys manufacturers in china .
more than 85 percent of its products are made in europe .
" we can react very quickly to demand in europe because most of our production is here , " huentelsmann told deutsche welle .
" we do n't have long logistics paths . "
ravensburger expects it will be able to deliver all products right up to christmas , he said .
but the company is n't making any guarantees .
anticipating greater demand this year , lego delivered 10 percent more products to retailers in advance of the holiday shopping season , according to company spokeswoman helena seppelfricke .
but with some products , like the company 's classic fire department set and " technik " series , in huge demand , she admits the company could easily have delivered more .
" same procedure " most european traditional toymakers including lego , which is based in denmark with additional production sites in hungary , the czech republic and mexico , show their new products at trade events early in the year and begin talks with its buyer at the same time .
however , their ability to boost production to meet unexpected christmas demand generally decreases the closer the holiday shopping season approaches .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : playmobil toys are as popular as ever " it 's pretty much the same procedure every year , " said steffen kahnt , deputy director of germany 's federal association of toy retailer -lrb- bvs -rrb- .
" retailers need to decide how many products to order and manufacturers how many to make .
but no one really knows what the demand will be , especially for new products .
so you hope you make the right call . "
stockpiling products is n't a viable option in the competitive toy sector , according to kahnt .
both manufacturers and retailers , he says , strive to have only as much stock as they see necessary to better control their operating costs .
that said , the industry may want to up production for the 2011 gift season , if the past 24 months are any indication .
record-breaking sales " more products were actually sold last year than the year before , " kahnt said .
" that surprised us .
but no one really thought that sales this year would be so good . "
the german toy industry association -lrb- dvsi -rrb- expects sales to increase six percent this to 2.52 billion euros , compared to 2.38 billion euros the year .
if that mark is reached , the holiday sales will be a huge factor .
retailers generate more than 40 percent of their annual revenue during the holiday shopping season .
for sure , numbers like these will make manufacturers and retailers happy .
their big challenge now is to deliver enough toys to make kids – and their parents – just as happy .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : focus : china and the west - cooperation , competition and confrontation china flexed its muscles in 2010 us has fallen in esteem of many chinese predictions of america 's demise as superpower are greatly exaggerated does beijing have a grip on germany 's sinologists ? china -pipe- 10.12.2010 opinion : a new chance for china 's democracy movement großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the massive protests by the chinese government against the nobel peace prize for liu xiaobo show just how afraid the leaders in beijing are of critics such as liu , deutsche welle 's adrienne woltersdorf argues . the nobel peace prize has repeatedly been among the most controversial awards worldwide .
each december in oslo , the arguments about whether the right recipient was chosen can be just as fierce as the threats these winners often face because of their work .
individuals who take a stand for peace and reconciliation in difficult conflict situations tend to have more enemies than friends .
by awarding the detained chinese professor of literature and democracy activist , liu xiabo , this year 's peace prize in oslo on october 8 , the nobel committee made an apt comment on the changing global balance of power .
this is how its decision should be interpreted .
a rising power like china needs to respect human and civil rights for the benefit of all mankind - that was the message from oslo .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : adrienne woltersdorf , the head of deutsche welle 's chinese service , is in oslo it is a slap in the chinese authorities ' face .
they have reacted accordingly and suppressed any domestic discourse about the so eagerly awaited - and now so despised - first chinese nobel laureate in history .
in addition , many activists , including liu 's wife liu xia , were preemptively intimidated or simply put under house arrest .
the regime 's harsh reactions show that the norwegian jury really touched a nerve in beijing .
but it is ridiculous that those loyal to the regime allege that the nobel committee intended to provocatively and maliciously challenge china 's rise .
the truth , in fact , is the precise opposite .
for quite some time , even veteran cadres of the mao era have been calling for more freedom of thought in china .
just recently , a group of influential former cadres reiterated this demand in a letter to the new party leadership .
a rapidly changing society , they argued , needs freedom of debate and opportunity for criticism in order to make wise decisions for the future .
such voices will be encouraged by the nobel peace prize , and only the chinese can decide how china should develop .
in this sense , the peace prize for liu xiaobo is also a unique chance for the badly divided and marginalized chinese democracy movement .
oslo could thus become the starting point for a new movement .
but before this happens , democracy activists inside and outside of china will have to prove that they can restrain their somtimes excessive egos , and dedicate themselves to the collective cause .
the powers-that-be in beijing will do everything they can to continue to marginalize the proponents of democracy .
they have given sufficient proof during the past weeks that they are perfectly capable of doing this .
but the chinese civil rights activists now have an internationally recognized leader .
they have a prudent manifesto - liu xiaobo 's " charter ' 08 " document - they have a sympathetic international audience , and they have the internet ; all that they 're missing is a single movement to unite them .

the capital is also easily the arty-fartiest place in the country .
coincidence ?
dw 's ben knight does n't think so . most of my friends are losers .
i mean that in a good way , obviously .
they are all talented and creative and sometimes even a bit inspired , but they are also , each and every last one of them , work-shy fops .
obviously i am as well : it takes one to know one , as we used to say in primary school .
there 's a great sequence in the movie " trainspotting " where junkie hero renton explains the complex art of staying on the dole .
it entails reverse-psychology tricks like going to a job interview and appearing psychotically eager to work in a leisure center .
the film shows that such efforts require invention , nerve , subtlety , selfishness , discipline and some drugs - the exact elements of a successful artistic career .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an artist at work there is probably no clearer illustration of one of the deeper truths of life in a western european social democracy : the attributes of an artist are exactly the same as the ones you need to successfully maintain your unemployment .
this is heightened in berlin , where it takes the sacrifice of an artist to truly perfect the art of not earning your living .
creative industries there are , they say , some broad similarities between my hometown , manchester , and berlin .
both were throbbing industrial powerhouses in the 19th century , lost their luster and declined in the late 20th century , only to become trendy pop cultural centers in the last 20 years - manchester not so much anymore , but you get the general idea .
both cities have also become famous for hanging their new economic hopes on the " creative industries . "
this very spongy term refers to anything from actor to fashion designer , to independent shopkeeper , to web designer , and includes all the attendant skill sets , cameramen , lighting technicians , office managers etc .
the point is you do n't make anything - you delight , you entertain , you disseminate knowledge and information , or you sing cabaret songs naked in a disused warehouse in front of an audience of twelve .
by capitalizing on the cache and the large student population , the two cities deliberately encouraged a whole class of freelance migrants engaged in some kind of creative endeavor in an attempt to re-invent the city 's economy .
but the similarity with manchester ends when it comes to the social security system .
in berlin , many creative types live - at least partially - on the standard long-term unemployment benefit called hartz iv .
it does n't help the job statistics , but it does mean that the city 's economy is run , to a certain extent , by the welfare state .
social security for the middle class bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unemployment center : the lifeblood of a creative economy when it comes to dealing with the job center to claim your benefits , being an artist is a double-edged sword .
most artists do not earn enough to live from their art , so they are understandably unwilling to mention the meager side earnings their talents bring .
they live double lives : naked dadaist performance artists at night , out-of-work it specialists by day .
but others have a little more nerve , and tell their case manager they are " professional " artists .
if they have a degree as well -lrb- a degree puts you in a different , more exclusive waiting room -rrb- they get special dispensation from the endless round of pointless job applications and interviews that most hartz iv recipients are forced to take .
instead , professional unemployed artists are allowed to count applications for grants and scholarships as their applications , and can get the state to pay for acting lessons .
so there 's a tip , if the hard times are getting to you .
ben knight does n't really think his friends are losers .

dutch police have arrested a teenager accused of taking part in the attacks . dutch authorities on friday said police in the netherlands arrested a 16-year-old who has admitted to attacking websites belonging to wikileaks opponents .
a spokesman for the national prosecutor 's office said the teenager had " admitted launching attacks on visa and mastercard sites . "
a statement said he was probably " part of a larger group of hackers . "
hackers unite hackers from around the world have stepped up cyber attacks following the arrest of wikileaks boss julian assange .
assange is wanted by sweden in connection with sexual misconduct charges the online attacks have mainly targeted companies that have deprived wikileaks of their services , including the websites of the online payment service paypal , and the credit card giants visa and mastercard , which had stopped processing donations for wikileaks .
also targeted were amazon.com , which had banished wikileaks from using its rented servers , a swiss bank and the website of the swedish prosecutor who had issued an arrest warrant for assange on charges of sexual misconduct .
the group of hackers , which calls itself " anonymous , " says it wants to keep the internet open and free .
wikileaks has distanced itself from the cyber attacks , but said they reflected public opinion .
in a statement , the organization said it had no contact with anonymous and had not received prior notice of any of the group 's actions .
assange : " charges fabricated " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : julian assange says he is innocent of the charges assange is currently in a british jail after handing himself in to police on tuesday . police have moved the wikileaks ' chief from the main part of wandsworth prison to an isolation unit , his lawyer said friday . " the prison authorities are doing it for his own safety , presumably , " jennifer robinson , one of assange 's legal team told the afp news agency . assange has been refused the use of his own laptop but will be given a prison computer with limited internet access , the guardian newspaper reported friday .
assange says the swedish sexual misconduct charges are a fabrication intended to stop his organization from continuing to publish confidential documents .
wikileaks is facing international condemnation for its publication of confidential material , often concerning diplomatic relations between countries .
some of the documents have caused embarrassment to the nations concerned .
assange is due to appear in a london court for a second time on tuesday , when prosecutors want to question him about allegations of rape and sexual molestation made by two women .

but guests gathered around an empty chair to congratulate the laureate , who was not represented at the ceremony . the nobel peace prize committee has concluded its award ceremony in oslo with the prizewinner and guest of honor , imprisoned chinese dissident liu xiaobo , absent .
the prize was meant to " point out the relationship between human rights , democracy and peace " , nobel peace prize committee chairman thorbjoern jagland said in his opening comments .
he called liu a symbol of the " non-violent struggle for such -lsb- human -rsb- rights in china " , and compared him with nelson mandela .
he went on to say that liu had done nothing but exercise his civil rights , and called on china to release him .
in his absence , norwegian actress liv ullmann read a final statement titled " i have no enemies " released by liu 's supporters after his sentencing a year ago .
in it , liu said " there is no force that can put an end to the human quest for freedom , and china will in the end become a nation ruled by law , where human rights reign supreme . "
he also spoke of his wife , liu xia , who is now under house arrest in beijing , saying her love " is the sunlight that leaps over high walls and penetrates the iron bars of my prison window . "
international solidarity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : liu xiaobo is considered a criminal by the chinese authorities throughout friday , western governments paid tribute to liu 's contribution to democracy and human rights , calling on china to release the dissident from prison .
in berlin , german human rights commissioner markus loening praised liu 's courageous stand for human rights .
" the participation of germany as well as all eu partners represented in oslo and many other countries in the ceremony in oslo is therefore a simple sign of respect for liu xiaobo and for all who work to promote human rights and democracy without resorting to violence , " a statement from loening on the german foreign ministry website said .
united states president barack obama meanwhile hailed liu as a beacon of freedom : " the values he espouses are universal , his struggle is peaceful , and he should be released as soon as possible , " obama said .
event overshadowed the event in the norwegian capital was overshadowed not only by liu 's absence , but also by china 's wider anger at his selection .
several nations decided to boycott the ceremony at beijing 's request after the chinese government condemned the decision to award the prize to the democracy activist .
almost a third of the 50 countries invited to the event stayed away , including russia , pakistan and saudi arabia .
many of those not attending are thought to have bowed to chinese pressure .
serbia , which was heavily criticized by the european union for its initial decision not to attend , decided at the last minute to send an ombudsman after all .
chinese media condemn choice bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an empty chair represented liu at the ceremony official chinese media have slammed the choice of liu as nobel peace prize laureate , calling it an attempt to impose foreign values on china .
liu has been a critic of the chinese government since the tiananmen square massacre of 1989 .
liu took a prominent part in the protests there and was sentenced to two years in prison .
he was jailed last december for 11 years on subversion charges after he co-authored a document called charter 08 , which calls for political reform in china .
authorities have also cracked down on activists in the run-up to the ceremony and have prevented liu 's family and friends from attending .
empty chair the nobel committee chose to represent liu with an empty chair during the ceremony , calling this a symbol of the chinese policy to isolate and repress dissidents .
in a moving gesture , jagland placed the nobel diploma on the vacant seat .
it is the first time that a laureate under detention has not been formally represented since 1935 , when nazi germany stopped the pacifist carl von ossietzky from attending .
it is also the first time since then that the prize money of 1.13 million euros -lrb- $ 1.5 million -rrb- will not be handed out .

but guests gathered around an empty chair to congratulate the laureate , who was not represented at the ceremony . the nobel peace prize committee has concluded its award ceremony in oslo with the prizewinner and guest of honor , imprisoned chinese dissident liu xiaobo , absent .
the prize was meant to " point out the relationship between human rights , democracy and peace " , nobel peace prize committee chairman thorbjoern jagland said in his opening comments .
he called liu a symbol of the " non-violent struggle for such -lsb- human -rsb- rights in china " , and compared him with nelson mandela .
he went on to say that liu had done nothing but exercise his civil rights , and called on china to release him .
in his absence , norwegian actress liv ullmann read a final statement titled " i have no enemies " released by liu 's supporters after his sentencing a year ago .
in it , liu said " there is no force that can put an end to the human quest for freedom , and china will in the end become a nation ruled by law , where human rights reign supreme . "
he also spoke of his wife , liu xia , who is now under house arrest in beijing , saying her love " is the sunlight that leaps over high walls and penetrates the iron bars of my prison window . "
international solidarity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : liu xiaobo is considered a criminal by the chinese authorities throughout friday , western governments paid tribute to liu 's contribution to democracy and human rights , calling on china to release the dissident from prison .
in berlin , german human rights commissioner markus loening praised liu 's courageous stand for human rights .
" the participation of germany as well as all eu partners represented in oslo and many other countries in the ceremony in oslo is therefore a simple sign of respect for liu xiaobo and for all who work to promote human rights and democracy without resorting to violence , " a statement from loening on the german foreign ministry website said .
united states president barack obama meanwhile hailed liu as a beacon of freedom : " the values he espouses are universal , his struggle is peaceful , and he should be released as soon as possible , " obama said .
event overshadowed the event in the norwegian capital was overshadowed not only by liu 's absence , but also by china 's wider anger at his selection .
several nations decided to boycott the ceremony at beijing 's request after the chinese government condemned the decision to award the prize to the democracy activist .
almost a third of the 50 countries invited to the event stayed away , including russia , pakistan and saudi arabia .
many of those not attending are thought to have bowed to chinese pressure .
serbia , which was heavily criticized by the european union for its initial decision not to attend , decided at the last minute to send an ombudsman after all .
chinese media condemn choice bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an empty chair represented liu at the ceremony official chinese media have slammed the choice of liu as nobel peace prize laureate , calling it an attempt to impose foreign values on china .
liu has been a critic of the chinese government since the tiananmen square massacre of 1989 .
liu took a prominent part in the protests there and was sentenced to two years in prison .
he was jailed last december for 11 years on subversion charges after he co-authored a document called charter 08 , which calls for political reform in china .
authorities have also cracked down on activists in the run-up to the ceremony and have prevented liu 's family and friends from attending .
empty chair the nobel committee chose to represent liu with an empty chair during the ceremony , calling this a symbol of the chinese policy to isolate and repress dissidents .
in a moving gesture , jagland placed the nobel diploma on the vacant seat .
it is the first time that a laureate under detention has not been formally represented since 1935 , when nazi germany stopped the pacifist carl von ossietzky from attending .
it is also the first time since then that the prize money of 1.13 million euros -lrb- $ 1.5 million -rrb- will not be handed out .

what is remarkable about this latest report is how clearly its authors , most of whom are economists , advocate stronger government engagement in social policies - even in the low-income countries of sub-saharan africa .
basic social protection schemes , the authors suggest , could contribute to growth and poverty reduction , and assist developing countries in reaching the millennium development goals .
the report draws on recent research that highlights the importance of social protection to the economic and political development of countries .
people without access to a social safety net risk falling -lrb- even deeper -rrb- into poverty when faced with a shock like illness or a bad harvest .
they may then have to turn to savings , sell livestock or other assets or send their children to work rather than school in order to finance their daily needs .
in this way , they lose means of livelihoods that might otherwise help them to establish at least a modest existence on their own .
more seriously , households without social protection tend to shy away from investing savings at the outset , instead hoarding income to stay liquid and to prepare for a possible loss of future income or unexpected expenditures .
empirical studies suggest that families , and especially those who work in the informal sector , are more likely to invest when they have access to basic social protection schemes . such investment promotes economic growth precisely where it is most likely to help reduce poverty .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : where families have no safety net , they may be forced to sell income-producing assets like cattle in hard times finally , social protection schemes contribute to political stability .
by reducing poverty and economic insecurity , they lower the chances that a people will resort to violence to achieve political aims .
above all , though , such schemes show citizens that the state feels responsible and cares for them .
many studies point out that , where public social protection schemes exist , citizens identify more closely with the state and show a willingness to fulfill their obligations to the community .
so basic social protection helps not only to reduce poverty but also acts as insurance for business activities and the material basis of a social contract accepted by every citizen .
many will ask how low-income countries can be expected to finance social protection schemes - and rightly so .
it is rarely the case that the majority of a population is covered by social protection systems that the members themselves finance through contributions - social and private insurance schemes and community-based mutual insurance associations , for instance .
this is because , in low-income countries especially , contributions to such schemes are too high for many people .
at the same time , the idea of social transfer schemes financed by the state from tax revenues is often rejected on the grounds that governments in low-income countries do not enjoy wide enough budget margins to be able to fund such schemes .
yet this year 's european report on development -lrb- erd -rrb- reflects a turning point in the academic debate .
even low-income countries that can not afford comprehensive social protection for all their citizens can find satisfactory solutions for particularly vulnerable groups .
for example lesotho , among other african countries , has created a tax-financed system that grants a modest flat pension to everybody over a certain age .
although lesotho is a poor country , the program costs less than two percent of gross national income , and in many households it benefits not only the elderly but also their student grandchildren who want to lay better foundations for their later working lives .
similarly , ethiopia has developed a program that provides poor families jobs in rural infrastructure construction .
the international labor organization estimates that the total cost of establishing both of these programs as well as an unconditional cash transfer program for orphans would not exceed six percent of national income in any sub-saharan african country .
unfortunately , the 2010 erd does not explain how and by whom social protection is to be organized where the state is unwilling or unable to do so .
in such cases , social protection can be provided only by non-governmental actors through , for example , micro-insurance schemes .
the erd restricts the definition of social protection to action conducted by the state , and so does not consider this course of action .
where efficient government does not exist , self-help in the shape of , say , mutual insurance continues to be the only way out .
this is now true of a quarter to a half of all countries in sub-saharan africa , as noted in last year 's erd .

in its one-hundred-year history , this is the first time that the prize is awarded to a chinese citizen .
yet , the laureate , his family members , and even close friends are incarcerated in their own country .
no one can come to receive the award . the scottish pen has produced a " liu xiaobo chair " , which has been sent over to oslo .
now it stands in the city hall .
this empty chair is a reminder that its owner , who should enjoy the highest international honor today , is absent from the ceremony , banquet and concert , which are devoted to him . the host country 's king , the queen , european royal families , foreign ambassadors and representatives , as well as guests from overseas gather in the bright hall decorated with flowers and make a toast to xiaobo .
but many of us are still melancholy , and we ask , where is liu xiaobo and his beloved liu xia ?
let us travel through time and space and visit liu xia first . we are in haidian district , beijing , yuyuantan south road number 9 .
from a distance one can see the white building where the lius live .
the police cars are parked in front of the house ; several policemen parade around .
journalists from far and near are cordoned off some hundred meters away .
no one is allowed to get into the forbidden zone . thin , with a shaven head -lrb- or short-cropped hair -rrb- , liu xia is sitting alone in the empty home .
rinse the ashtray the coffee table wiped take the glass cups boil two cups of longjing or oolong aside the table you sit looking at the cup in front of the empty seat stare at the cup , listen is there the move of key in the hole ...
the cup in the hand , you take a sip lifted the cup to the sun cup and your fingers penetrated by the sun palm was stained by the transparent green delicate a hint of panic is there too the cup on the opposite site you know will be empty for a long time it takes long till the man opens your door -lrb- from liu ’ s poem " sunshine and cups - to my little finger , who drinks tea every day " -rrb- liu xia may wait for a long time , maybe another ten years .
now we visit xiaobo in jinzhou prison in the small chinese town nanshan in liaoning province .
entering the gate , we see several scattered buildings .
surprisingly , we see a huge office wall on which is written boldly ' 1984 ' .
a few months ago , liu xia , accompanied by the stainless steel mouse liu di , wang jinbo , mo zhixu and wang zhongxia , came here for a visit .
they were amazed at orwell ’ s rebirth in a chinese prison . snickering , they took pictures in front of the " 1984 wall " .
several officers rushed to them and took them into custody .
separately , they were interrogated for hours . we enter xiaobo ’ s cell now .
he shares with five other prisoners a 3 by 4 meter space .
his head is bald , shaved like an ordinary criminal .
his body is swollen by the padded jacket and trousers .
scarf , hat and gloves are a must in the cell because the concrete floor of the prison is cold .
the small window beneath the high ceiling is always open .
in winter , the indoor temperature is higher than outdoors ; it is a few degrees above zero .
the odor of the open toilet bucket in the corner is neutralized by the cold air , but one can not ignore the stench of the daily waste of several men .
the smell not only fills the room , it penetrates through clothes , and into the pores of the skin . this is the first winter that xiaobo spends in a prison in northern china .
he will have to adjust himself to the circumstances .
he does not know whether he will have frostbite .
to sit and lie on the concrete floors all year round may cause neck and spine pain and lead to kidney problems .
his stomach disease has given him a hard time since his imprisonment .
xiaobo has exited his cell today , but he does not want to show it to others otherwise his cell-mates might become cynical and angry .
sitting there , his thoughts fly to oslo .
he has had constant dreams about it .
who will be there at the ceremony ?
who will receive the prize for me ?
it could not be liu xia .
she has not sent any sign of life for a while .
my acceptance speech is long written in my head , but who can read it out aloud for me ?
does the king wear a majestic tuxedo , and the queen her crown at the banquet ?
will the distinguished guests think of the dead in tiananmen square and the tiananmen mothers and make a toast ?
sitting in the dungeon , xiaobo does not know that the announcement of his award induced a tsunami in zhongnanhai , and the rulers had a mild concussion , followed by delusions : they believe that their enemies are all over the world , so the grip on the naughty writers and the guy who held the crab dinner party must be tightened .
they must not go outside the country , otherwise they could endanger national security .
liu xiaobo ’ s dinner on december 10 , 2010 may look like this : boiled vegetables with sand , and a few pieces of fat meat as a special treat .
he might have an extra piece of steamed bread , and his rice bowl could also be refilled today .
in short , it is a privileged meal that will long be remembered , because it is a meal that will leave the stomach truly filled .
after all , he is the first chinese to win the nobel peace prize .

after pressure from china , 20 nations have said they wo n't be attending the ceremony . a total of 65 countries have embassies in the norwegian capital of oslo and recently they 've all received the same two pieces of mail . an invitation from the nobel prize committee to attend the award ceremony for the 2011 nobel winners and a letter from the chinese embassy requesting they steer clear of the event . " we have noticed that the chinese are very engaged this year , " said geir lundestad , director of the nobel institute .
" they want as few nations as possible to accept the invitation .
now we 'll see who does not come for political reasons and who have other reasons . " the nobel committee has said 44 nations will be sending envoys to the ceremony , including eu member states , the united states , japan , india , south korea , south africa , indonesia and brazil . political , social motives bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at the ceremony , 20 countries will have empty chairs but another 20 countries have said they will not be in attendance .
serbia cited its interest in maintaining good relations with china for its absence , but other countries , including russia , are offering other reasons .
moscow has said scheduling difficulties - not political considerations - were keeping it away . but the scheduling conflicts veil russia 's political motive not to attend , according to sergei lukashevsky , the head of moscow 's sakharov museum . " that russia is not participating in the nobel peace prize 's award ceremony once again makes it clear that human rights do not play a prominent role in our foreign policy , " he said . " russia and china are members of the shanghai organization for cooperation and one of its goals is the fight against so-called extremism , " lukashevsky added .
" what that really means is that the countries support each other when it comes to fighting uncomfortable political situations . several countries in the middle east as well as afghanistan , pakistan and the philippines are also avoiding the ceremony because for economic and political reasons , according to rainer sollich , head of deutsche welle 's arabic department . " they are all states that have problems concerning human rights and operate under the understanding that they would n't want china at a ceremony honoring someone they view as an opponent of their regime . " china 's confucius prize china 's policy regarding the award ceremony and the still-imprisoned dissident liu has been clear .
referring to the nobel committee , chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman jiang yu said , " we will not change because of interference by a few clowns . " beijing awarded its own version of the nobel peace prize on thursday by giving the " confucius peace prize " to former taiwan vice-president lien chan .
like with liu 's nobel , chan was not in attendance to claim the award and his office said he was unaware of the prize . china has blocked access to the website of norwegian broadcaster nrk , the station said on thursday .
access to the bbc and cnn has also been affected ahead of friday 's ceremony , according to nrk . conspicuous absence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more protests in support of liu are scheduled for thursday friday will mark only the second time in the more than 100-year history of the prize that neither the laureate nor a representative will be able to come accept the award .
german journalist and pacifist carl von ossietzky , who was locked up in a nazi concentration camp , could not travel to oslo for his prize ceremony in 1936 . in addition to liu and ossietzky , myanmar 's aung san suu kyi was also barred from receiving her nobel peace prize in 1991 . liu has long been an outspoken opponent of chinese leadership in beijing and was at the forefront of the 1989 tiananmen square protests .
he was jailed in december 2009 for 11 years on subversion charges after co-authoring " charter 08 , " a manifesto that called for political reform in china . nobel officials said an empty chair would be used to represent liu 's absence . the 20 nations which will not attend the nobel ceremony are : afghanistan , china , colombia , cuba , egypt , iran , iraq , kazakhstan , morocco , pakistan , the philippines , russia , saudi arabia , serbia , sri lanka , sudan , tunisia , ukraine , venezuela and vietnam . authors : matthias von hein , jegor winogradow / sms -lrb- afp -rrb- editor : jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 10.12.2010 hanover hit new high with win over struggling stuttgart großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : goal hero ya konan can now boast nine for the season hanover continued to surpass expectations , rising to second in the standings with a 2-1 win over beleaguered stuttgart .
now , just third from bottom , stuttgart has decided to dump its coach , jens keller . ivorian didier ya konan scored twice to give hanover a 2-1 win over stuttgart on friday , taking his team to second place in the bundesliga ahead of the weekend 's main soccer action .
the loss was also the final straw for stuttgart 's management , which announced on saturday that it had fired coach jens keller .
after a cautious start by both sides , ya konan had the first major chance of the match in the 20th minute , with a shot that was stopped by stuttgart keeper sven ulreich .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while stuttgart battled back , they were unable to gain a much-needed point the breakthrough came on 35 minutes , after stuttgart left back arthur boka got a defensive foot to a ball from hanover 's lars stindl - only to divert it to ya konan .
the striker took advantage and passed the ball through ulreich 's legs to take his tally for the season to eight .
stuttgart responded positively , pressing throughout the game , and - with just a quarter of an hour to go - managed to equalize as georg niedermeier jumped to head a timo gebhart free kick into the far corner .
the comeback was short-lived .
after another attempt on the hanover goal , this time from philip degen , hanover swiftly counter-attacked .
ya konan latched onto a high ball from christian schulz to score through ulreich 's legs for a second time .
' an exceptional start ' the win means that hanover have already recorded one more victory than in the whole of last season .
" it is exceptional what we have achieved in the first half of the season , " said hanover technical director joerg schmadtke .
stuttgart is now without a win in its last five games and is third from the bottom with only 12 points from 16 games .
this dreary realization was enough for the team to pull the plug on jen keller 's 59-day rein as head coach .
the hottest prospect to replace him is bruno labaddia , who coached hamburg until the end of april .
in saturday 's football , bayern host st. pauli , hamburg entertain bayer leverkusen and cologne are at home to eintracht frankfurt .

other than the nobel peace prize , which was awarded this year to liu xiaobo , numerous prizes for human rights activists are awarded on this day all over the world .
58-year-old lawyer asma jahangir , recipient of unesco / bilbao prize for 2010 , is the current president of the supreme court bar association and a founding member of the human rights commission of pakistan , the country 's leading independent human rights body .
' it increases one 's responsibilities ' she is a brilliant speaker and a relentless champion of people 's rights .
and yet , there are moments when even asma jahangir seems tired : when she talks about how much still remains to be done in pakistan despite some improvements .
asma jahangir laughs heartily and admits that she too is a normal human being with strengths and weaknesses .
she is happy about the international recognition that comes with the unesco / bilbao prize .
" it is indeed a matter of happiness and pride , but at the same time it increases one 's responsibility .
people expect more from you .
one has to strategize more , keeping in mind one 's integrity .
it draws a ' red line ' for you . "
the journey asma jahangir was born in a rich family in lahore .
when the pakistani government suppressed the independence movement in the late sixties in east pakistan , today 's bangladesh , asma 's father protested and was repeatedly jailed or put under house arrest .
asma jahangir believes this experience has truly formed her .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : asma jahangir has been campaigning for human rights for several decades " what i have learnt is that you are no longer materialistic after that .
the way my father worked altruistically , and the manner in which he used to go behind bars and come back home smilingly was inspirational .
he passed away when he was only 61 .
he had cancer , and we knew he would leave us soon .
i remember my sister and i were sitting at his deathbed , and he looked at us and said , ' i am not going to die , i will live through you ' , " reminisces jahangir .
asma jahangir followed his words .
with her inheritance she founded a women 's forum in 1980 together with her sister , hina jilani , a lawyer herself .
in her numerous jobs , for example as chairperson of the human rights commission of pakistan , or as united nations special rapporteur on freedom of religion or belief , she has raised her voice against the discrimination of religious minorities , against " honor " killings , or the treatment of minors in pakistani jails .
it has not been easy for her .
" women face difficulties at all levels .
they face hardship in society and at the workplace .
women also have to struggle within their households .
therefore , if any woman asserts herself , people find it difficult to accept .
they can also be very cruel towards that woman , " opines jahangir . she remembers that her own in-laws also found it difficult to accept that their son had married a woman who was not a typical pakistani wife .
but with time , both her family and society have accepted her achievements .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a demonstration for minority rights in pakistan dreams for a better pakistan for pakistan , asma jahangir has many dreams .
" firstly , i want to see economic prosperity in pakistan .
the indignity of poverty makes me despair .
pakistanis are a very dignified people .
they have suffered a great deal .
they have resisted oppression .
and yet , the image of pakistan projected in the world is mostly negative .
the positive side of pakistan is not shown .
i think pakistan has wasted its human capital . "
she has learnt to suppress her anger , even when she is being accused of blasphemy or treason .
but asma jahangir emphasizes that a life in anger is not worth living .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de afghanistan -pipe- 10.12.2010 afghan women still oppressed and abused , un report says großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : afghan girls are often given away to settle disputes a new report published by the united nations assistance mission in afghanistan -lrb- unama -rrb- has found that the lives of afghan women have improved little since the fall of the taliban .
but the west seems unmoved . despite changes in afghan law and a constitution designed to protect women 's rights , violence and abuse of women continue to be a serious problem in the country , and the government is not doing enough to prevent it .
that is the conclusion of a new report published by the united nations assistance mission in afghanistan -lrb- unama -rrb- .
the most common forms of abuse include forced and child marriage , honor killings and giving away girls to settle disputes under the tradition of baad .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the report says violence against afghan women is still widespread " the report describes the prevalence of these practices , " georgette gagnon , unama 's director of human rights , said at a press conference .
" it looks at the consequences these practices have on the lives of afghan women and girls and the community as a whole and it also looks at the efforts of the afghan government to address violence against women . "
one of these efforts , the 2009 law of elimination of violence against women -lrb- evaw -rrb- , came under particular scrutiny .
the law , which gagnon described as " a huge gain of legal protection of women 's rights , " criminalizes buying and selling women for marriage , forcing a woman to marry without her consent , forcing girls to marry when they are underage , and forcing girls and women to commit self-immolation - when they set themselves on fire .
ignorance and lack of enforcement but according to the report , the new law is not being enforced in many parts of the country , and is often not even known .
bele grau , program manager for afghanistan at the women 's rights organisation medica mondiale agreed with this assessment .
" on the theoretical and legal level the situation is getting better – but in practice it is often not implemented , " she told deutsche welle .
" this law has been in force for a year , but a lot of judges do n't even know it , and if they do , they do n't enforce it . "
the un women 's organization unifem says that around 87 percent of afghan women suffer from domestic violence , and that half of all girls are married under the age of 15 .
on top of this , grau says that many of the rights that women have won are repealed by new laws .
she cites one recent regulation that bans women who have run away from an abusive home from seeking refuge with strangers .
this in practice leaves many women only the unrealistic option of going to relatives .
many women are also still imprisoned for running away , in contravention of the evaw law .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : westerwelle suggested democracy can not be imposed on afghanistan the report found that much of the abuse is founded in afghan tradition .
" one very harmful practice that we heard a lot about is baad , which is the giving away of girls to settle disputes , " said gagnon .
" many of the women told us that instead of a murderer being punished , an innocent girl is punished and she has to spend all her life in slavery and is subjected to cruel violence .
sometimes she is forced to sleep with the animals in the barn . "
western indifference the report sets out a number of recommendations for the afghan government to deal with the problem , but grau says that the west has an obligation to apply pressure in order to protect women 's rights – not least because this is often used to add legitimacy to the war in afghanistan .
" we 've noticed this in most of the western governments , " she said .
" for the past year , all the talk is about withdrawal of troops , and negotiations with the taliban etc . , and that afghans have to work out for themselves how much democracy or women 's rights they want .
these are now all internal afghan issues that are n't discussed or even noticed anymore .
the german government is no exception to this . "
she believes that pressure could be exhorted through the financial aid the west gives to the afghan government .
" the western governments still give afghanistan a lot of development money , " she said .
" and when they make conditions for giving this money , we think they should make them for human rights and women 's rights , not just for taking over security duties . "
" the issue of women 's rights was also one of the justifications for the war itself , but that is suddenly disappearing from the agenda , " she added .
" earlier this year , -lrb- german foreign minister guido -rrb- westerwelle said , ' well , afghanistan is not switzerland , ' and with that everything is swept from the table . "

but the west seems unmoved . despite changes in afghan law and a constitution designed to protect women 's rights , violence and abuse of women continue to be a serious problem in the country , and the government is not doing enough to prevent it .
that is the conclusion of a new report published by the united nations assistance mission in afghanistan -lrb- unama -rrb- .
the most common forms of abuse include forced and child marriage , honor killings and giving away girls to settle disputes under the tradition of baad .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the report says violence against afghan women is still widespread " the report describes the prevalence of these practices , " georgette gagnon , unama 's director of human rights , said at a press conference .
" it looks at the consequences these practices have on the lives of afghan women and girls and the community as a whole and it also looks at the efforts of the afghan government to address violence against women . "
one of these efforts , the 2009 law of elimination of violence against women -lrb- evaw -rrb- , came under particular scrutiny .
the law , which gagnon described as " a huge gain of legal protection of women 's rights , " criminalizes buying and selling women for marriage , forcing a woman to marry without her consent , forcing girls to marry when they are underage , and forcing girls and women to commit self-immolation - when they set themselves on fire .
ignorance and lack of enforcement but according to the report , the new law is not being enforced in many parts of the country , and is often not even known .
bele grau , program manager for afghanistan at the women 's rights organisation medica mondiale agreed with this assessment .
" on the theoretical and legal level the situation is getting better – but in practice it is often not implemented , " she told deutsche welle .
" this law has been in force for a year , but a lot of judges do n't even know it , and if they do , they do n't enforce it . "
the un women 's organization unifem says that around 87 percent of afghan women suffer from domestic violence , and that half of all girls are married under the age of 15 .
on top of this , grau says that many of the rights that women have won are repealed by new laws .
she cites one recent regulation that bans women who have run away from an abusive home from seeking refuge with strangers .
this in practice leaves many women only the unrealistic option of going to relatives .
many women are also still imprisoned for running away , in contravention of the evaw law .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : westerwelle suggested democracy can not be imposed on afghanistan the report found that much of the abuse is founded in afghan tradition .
" one very harmful practice that we heard a lot about is baad , which is the giving away of girls to settle disputes , " said gagnon .
" many of the women told us that instead of a murderer being punished , an innocent girl is punished and she has to spend all her life in slavery and is subjected to cruel violence .
sometimes she is forced to sleep with the animals in the barn . "
western indifference the report sets out a number of recommendations for the afghan government to deal with the problem , but grau says that the west has an obligation to apply pressure in order to protect women 's rights – not least because this is often used to add legitimacy to the war in afghanistan .
" we 've noticed this in most of the western governments , " she said .
" for the past year , all the talk is about withdrawal of troops , and negotiations with the taliban etc . , and that afghans have to work out for themselves how much democracy or women 's rights they want .
these are now all internal afghan issues that are n't discussed or even noticed anymore .
the german government is no exception to this . "
she believes that pressure could be exhorted through the financial aid the west gives to the afghan government .
" the western governments still give afghanistan a lot of development money , " she said .
" and when they make conditions for giving this money , we think they should make them for human rights and women 's rights , not just for taking over security duties . "
" the issue of women 's rights was also one of the justifications for the war itself , but that is suddenly disappearing from the agenda , " she added .
" earlier this year , -lrb- german foreign minister guido -rrb- westerwelle said , ' well , afghanistan is not switzerland , ' and with that everything is swept from the table . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de film -pipe- 10.12.2010 director von donnersmarck makes hollywood debut with ' the tourist ' großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german names have been behind some of hollywood 's major hits - and flops big stars , big budgets and big expectations : that 's what awaits filmmakers who make the switch to hollywood .
florian henckel von donnersmarck is the most recent german director to switch to hollywood with " the tourist . " angelina jolie 's new film " the tourist " sees the actress purring , posing and prodding men from paris to venice - a bit like how the film itself got its start .
dissatisfied with the original script , jolie called up german director florian henckel von donnersmarck and convinced him .
if you 'll rewrite the script and direct , she said , i 'm in .
the movie is the director 's second , following his 2006 oscar-winning debut film , " the lives of others . "
von donnersmarck made his way across the pond for his big-budget hollywood premiere , but the capital of show business is a bit different than the director had imagined .
" i had thought that everything would be a bit more lascivious , adventurous and sexually decadent - that everybody would sleep with everybody , " he told dpa news agency .
" but really it 's just hardworking people that do n't go to bed too late because they have to get up at six for an appointment with their personal trainers . "
the first result of von donnersmarck 's venture to hollywood opens on december 10 in the us and makes its german debut on december 16 .
poor reviews ahead of the us premiere do n't bode well for the film , however , with variety calling it " a euro-chic trifle " .
the hollywood reporter website said the film was " served under a label promising first-class champagne " but tasted like " last night 's prosecco . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a door opened for director von donnersmarck after his 2007 oscar win never far from home the 37-year-old director moved to tinseltown just six months after his 2007 oscar win , as calls from agents and other industry insiders began to pour in .
but a change of location is nothing new for the cologne-born director , who spent stints of his childhood in brussels , berlin and new york and studied in st. petersburg and oxford .
on the other hand , the director insists his home country has n't left his thoughts or his work .
" in my mind , i have n't left germany , " said von donnersmarck in an interview with the weekly frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung .
" i would lose much too much by not being able to keep making german films and taking up german topics and themes . "
that may set him apart from some of his german colleagues , who have made the switch from making films at home to creating hollywood blockbusters .
hollywood superstars , german roots von donnersmarck 's story sounds a bit like that of wolfgang petersen , director of 1981 's " das boot " -lrb- " the boat " -rrb- , which garnered a host of oscar nominations -lrb- although no wins -rrb- and catapulted its director to international fame .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " das boot " -lrb- 1981 -rrb- is a dramatic war film following the fate of a world war ii submarine petersen made the move from hamburg to hollywood , where he went on to direct major hits , including " in the line of fire " -lrb- 1993 -rrb- , " air force one " -lrb- 1997 -rrb- and " troy " -lrb- 2004 -rrb- .
although petersen now enjoys being one of the few directors with the privilege of making the " final cut " on his films , it had n't always been smooth sailing .
his 2006 " poseidon " was a flop in comparison with its massive $ 160-million budget .
petersen is n't the only german-born director to have churned out international blockbusters in the last two decades .
he 's joined by roland emmerich , director of thrillers heavy on special effects like " independence day " -lrb- 1996 -rrb- , " the patriot " -lrb- 2000 -rrb- and " the day after tomorrow " -lrb- 2004 -rrb- .
the director got his foot in the door in hollywood with 1994 's " stargate . "
emmerich had begun his career in his home country with a series of lesser-known films , first in german and then in english .
the move to hollywood filmmaking was a shock in at least one way for the self-described penny-pincher from southern germany .
" i have the nature of a very thrifty person , " emmerich said in 1994 .
" so it 's really strange to suddenly be on top of a project with more than a 50 million dollar budget . "
like von donnersmarck , emmerich still draws inspiration from germany and returned to potsdam to direct his most recent film , " anonymous , " set for release in 2011 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hirschbiegel 's " downfall " -lrb- 2004 -rrb- follows hitler in his final days no guarantees but even oscar nominations and star-studded casts have n't been enough to save some of von donnersmarck 's germany-to-hollywood colleagues from box office defeat .
oliver hirschbiegel 's 2004 drama " downfall " garnered an oscar nomination for best foreign language film and paved the way for the director 's la debut with 2007 's " the invasion . "
but despite a cast including nicole kidman and daniel craig , the movie was a flop and fell millions of dollars short of its budget .
german-born director mennan yapo , who has turkish roots , suffered a similar fate after his direction in 2004 's " lautlos " -lrb- " soundless " -rrb- drew international acclaim .
he followed up with " the premonition , " starring sandra bullock , about a housewife with a chilling suspicion , but critics generally panned the effort .
it remains to be seen whether " the tourist " will live up to its hollywood-sized expectations , despite initial negative reviews in the us .
but if not , von donnersmarck can reassure himself with the fact that he 's already an oscar-winner , unlike some of his predecessors .
if the film turns out to be a success after all , he may just become another in a long line of german-speaking directors to go down in hollywood 's movie-making history , from fritz lang to billy wilder .

florian henckel von donnersmarck is the most recent german director to switch to hollywood with " the tourist . " angelina jolie 's new film " the tourist " sees the actress purring , posing and prodding men from paris to venice - a bit like how the film itself got its start .
dissatisfied with the original script , jolie called up german director florian henckel von donnersmarck and convinced him .
if you 'll rewrite the script and direct , she said , i 'm in .
the movie is the director 's second , following his 2006 oscar-winning debut film , " the lives of others . "
von donnersmarck made his way across the pond for his big-budget hollywood premiere , but the capital of show business is a bit different than the director had imagined .
" i had thought that everything would be a bit more lascivious , adventurous and sexually decadent - that everybody would sleep with everybody , " he told dpa news agency .
" but really it 's just hardworking people that do n't go to bed too late because they have to get up at six for an appointment with their personal trainers . "
the first result of von donnersmarck 's venture to hollywood opens on december 10 in the us and makes its german debut on december 16 .
poor reviews ahead of the us premiere do n't bode well for the film , however , with variety calling it " a euro-chic trifle " .
the hollywood reporter website said the film was " served under a label promising first-class champagne " but tasted like " last night 's prosecco . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a door opened for director von donnersmarck after his 2007 oscar win never far from home the 37-year-old director moved to tinseltown just six months after his 2007 oscar win , as calls from agents and other industry insiders began to pour in .
but a change of location is nothing new for the cologne-born director , who spent stints of his childhood in brussels , berlin and new york and studied in st. petersburg and oxford .
on the other hand , the director insists his home country has n't left his thoughts or his work .
" in my mind , i have n't left germany , " said von donnersmarck in an interview with the weekly frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung .
" i would lose much too much by not being able to keep making german films and taking up german topics and themes . "
that may set him apart from some of his german colleagues , who have made the switch from making films at home to creating hollywood blockbusters .
hollywood superstars , german roots von donnersmarck 's story sounds a bit like that of wolfgang petersen , director of 1981 's " das boot " -lrb- " the boat " -rrb- , which garnered a host of oscar nominations -lrb- although no wins -rrb- and catapulted its director to international fame .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " das boot " -lrb- 1981 -rrb- is a dramatic war film following the fate of a world war ii submarine petersen made the move from hamburg to hollywood , where he went on to direct major hits , including " in the line of fire " -lrb- 1993 -rrb- , " air force one " -lrb- 1997 -rrb- and " troy " -lrb- 2004 -rrb- .
although petersen now enjoys being one of the few directors with the privilege of making the " final cut " on his films , it had n't always been smooth sailing .
his 2006 " poseidon " was a flop in comparison with its massive $ 160-million budget .
petersen is n't the only german-born director to have churned out international blockbusters in the last two decades .
he 's joined by roland emmerich , director of thrillers heavy on special effects like " independence day " -lrb- 1996 -rrb- , " the patriot " -lrb- 2000 -rrb- and " the day after tomorrow " -lrb- 2004 -rrb- .
the director got his foot in the door in hollywood with 1994 's " stargate . "
emmerich had begun his career in his home country with a series of lesser-known films , first in german and then in english .
the move to hollywood filmmaking was a shock in at least one way for the self-described penny-pincher from southern germany .
" i have the nature of a very thrifty person , " emmerich said in 1994 .
" so it 's really strange to suddenly be on top of a project with more than a 50 million dollar budget . "
like von donnersmarck , emmerich still draws inspiration from germany and returned to potsdam to direct his most recent film , " anonymous , " set for release in 2011 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hirschbiegel 's " downfall " -lrb- 2004 -rrb- follows hitler in his final days no guarantees but even oscar nominations and star-studded casts have n't been enough to save some of von donnersmarck 's germany-to-hollywood colleagues from box office defeat .
oliver hirschbiegel 's 2004 drama " downfall " garnered an oscar nomination for best foreign language film and paved the way for the director 's la debut with 2007 's " the invasion . "
but despite a cast including nicole kidman and daniel craig , the movie was a flop and fell millions of dollars short of its budget .
german-born director mennan yapo , who has turkish roots , suffered a similar fate after his direction in 2004 's " lautlos " -lrb- " soundless " -rrb- drew international acclaim .
he followed up with " the premonition , " starring sandra bullock , about a housewife with a chilling suspicion , but critics generally panned the effort .
it remains to be seen whether " the tourist " will live up to its hollywood-sized expectations , despite initial negative reviews in the us .
but if not , von donnersmarck can reassure himself with the fact that he 's already an oscar-winner , unlike some of his predecessors .
if the film turns out to be a success after all , he may just become another in a long line of german-speaking directors to go down in hollywood 's movie-making history , from fritz lang to billy wilder .

now , the project has four other eu member states on baord . on wednesday and thursday , the first meeting of the electric solar wind sail -lrb- esail -rrb- – newly sponsored by the european union - was held at the finnish metereological institute in helsinki .
earlier this year , the european union gave its blessing with 1.7 million euro -lrb- 2.25 million dollars -rrb- to construct laboratory prototypes of the esail project , whose ultimate goal is to launch the sail into space on a one kilogram estonian nanosatellite by the end of 2012 .
esail is now a joint operation with representatives from finland , estonia , germany , italy and sweden .
solar wind is a constant stream of charged particles that emanate from the sun .
a solar sail , which has been used previously , is made of a material that blocks those particles and then propel a spacecraft forward - in the same way a seafaring vessel uses wind to fill its sails .
however , this new finnish design , which was invented in 2006 by pekka janhunen , a researcher at the finnish meteorological institute , creates a " virtual " sail by forming an electric field with a radius of 100 meters from a small wire .
" the field forms an obstacle and so the solar wind particles are scattered in different directions , " he told deutsche welle .
" it 's more like an electric parachute than a sail .
it creates an enhanced friction between the solar wind flow and the wire . "
moving 50 kilometers per second if successful , janhunen added , then anything that this small wire was attached to , could theoretically travel approximately 50 kilometers per second , or " a factor of four or five faster than anything else ever constructed . "
using solar wind as a propulsion system in this way can only really be used between planets , so this type of design would be best for earth-mars , or other types of longer distance missions .
other astronomers are also excited about the prospect of this technology .
" in the other solar sail projects the energy comes from solar photons , the weightless ' light-particles ' .
this project gets the energy from the ions in the solar wind , " explained timo laitinen , an astronomy lecturer at the university of turku in finland , in an interview with deutsche welle .
" the technology is completely different , and to my understanding more feasible than the ' traditional ' solar sail technology . "

meanwhile , chinese pressure seems to have galvanized western democracies . it will forever remain the symbol of this year 's nobel peace prize ceremony in oslo .
as dignitaries from around the world stood and applauded , norwegian nobel committee chairman thorbjoern jagland placed the blue clad nobel diploma on the empty chair , where liu xiaobo would have sat .
liu , a 54-year-old literary critic and democracy advocate , is serving an 11-year prison sentence for subversion , handed down last year after he co-authored a bold appeal for human rights and political reform .
a sign of china 's weakness in his speech at the ceremony , jagland noted liu 's imprisonment and regretted that he was not present to receive the award .
" this fact alone shows that the award was necessary and appropriate , " jagland said . he added that despite all of china 's economic strength , its weakness was manifested " in the need to imprison a man for 11 years merely for expressing his opinions on how his country should be governed . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a flower is placed near a picture of liu xiaobo in hong kong on friday liu xiaobo had told his wife that he would like this year ’ s peace prize to be dedicated to " the lost souls from june 4 " .
he was referring to the many activists who died during the firing by government troops on the tiananmen square in beijing .
the nobel committee has accepted his wish .
jagland also said that , although none of the committee ’ s members had ever met liu , " we feel that we know him .
we have studied him closely over a long period of time " .
chinese pressure backfires while china had successfully pressured more than a dozen countries not to attend the ceremony to honor liu xiaobo , it seemed in oslo that its efforts also backfired in a way . after all , it was the chinese government 's pressure which transformed liu into a cause celebre among global rights activists .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chinese citizens clash with troops near tiananmen square in beijing in 1989 moreover , the pressure felt in oslo even hours before the ceremony , seemed to be galvanizing the west , reminding citizens of democracies of the values the nobel peace prize stands for .
china 's pressure tactics had continued unabated on friday .
amnesty international 's oslo representatives said that members of norway 's chinese community were being pressured by chinese diplomats to join anti-nobel protests planned for saturday .
the nobel committee chairman emphasized that the committee ’ s intention had been to make a statement about the relationship between human rights , democracy and peace .
the rights democracies around the world enjoyed today were fought for and won by people who took great risks .
" they did so for others .
that is why liu xiaobo deserves our support , " jagland said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de russia -pipe- 10.12.2010 immigrant workers have few rights in russia großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : illegal workers have little money and even fewer rights every year , million of migrant workers from the former soviet republics arrive in russia .
the economic situation in their home countries is so dire , they 'll take any job they can get . russia is a land of hope , at least for the 12 million migrant workers who arrive each year from poor countries in central asia and eastern europe .
the nation has the second highest number of guest workers in the world .
a recent study by the world bank estimated the country had 12.3 million migrant workers , but the russian goverment puts the number closer to five million . the immigrant workers come mainly from uzbekistan , tajikistan , kyrgyzstan , moldova and ukraine .
since the collapse of the soviet union , the economies in these countries have struggled to take off .
tajikistan , for example , remains one of the poorest countries in the world , with a third of its large enterprises either out of date or dysfunctional .
each year , more than 700,000 tajiks leave for russia with hopes of earning money .
no other choice once in russia , the impoverished foreigners will take almost any job , often working in construction , sweeping streets , or gardening . it 's back-breaking physical labor , up to fourteen hours a day .
the average paycheck is the equivalent of 300 euros -lrb- $ 420 -rrb- per month , but a big chunk goes towards housing and meals .
only by living extremely frugally are migrant workers able to send money back home .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the average worker earns less than 100 euros per week yet somehow , they manage .
in 2009 , tajik migrant workers sent 1.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 2 billion -rrb- back to their families - that 's nearly 40 of percent of the gross national product of tajikistan .
most foreigners from former soviet republics are in russia illegally .
in order to curb the influx of workers during the current economic crisis , the russian state only awards work permits to one million migrant workers a year .
nevertheless , each year up to twelve million migrants make their way to russia .
it 's pretty easy for workers to enter russia initially , but if they overstay the three month grace period without getting a visa , they become illegal and are often exploited by their employers .
slaves without rights the illegal workers are virtually without rights , and accordingly are often victims of fraud .
gavchar jurayeva , head of the human rights organization , " migration and law " in moscow , speaks of " voluntary slavery . "
the workers , she says , are bought by intermediaries in tajikistan , and promised " mountains of gold . " once in russia , the foreign workers are sold to the next agent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia is dependent on its foreign workers " they are virtually slaves , because they are dependent on the intermediaries , who take their passports until the debts are paid off , " said jurayeva .
the head of the moscow human rights centre " memorial " , svetlana gannushkina , speaks of a " systematic hunt " by the militia targeted at guest workers .
every year , about half a million working migrants are deported from russia , and given a five year travel ban . migrant workers are often blackmailed by the police during passport controls .
right-wing violence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guest workers are often victims of xenophobic violence corrupt officials are n't the only ones pursuing migrant workers .
they are also hunted by russian neo-nazis .
each year , up to 600 attacks on foreigners are registered in russia .
one in six cases is fatal .
russia is dependent on migrant labor from the former soviet republics .
demographic experts believe that the nation 's population will shrink over the next twenty years , reducing the number of working people to twelve million - or 17 percent of the economically active population .
vladimir mukomel , a sociologist at the russian academy of sciences , says that given the aging population : " the work of immigrants from the former soviet union is only alternative for the country . "

that doesn ’ t hold true for some other countries . the charge that us foreign policy is hypocritical is all but new , but the wikileaks data release has added some additional fuel to it .
just a few days ago , libya 's leader muammar gaddafi lauded the organization for exposing us " hypocrisy " through its diplomacy conducted behind closed doors , in comments published via the state news agency jana .
according to gaddafi , the leaked cables " proved that america is not what it has led allies and friends to believe it to be " and that " us relations with its allies are hypocritical . "
while there is certainly an expected discrepancy in the tone and style of these confidential reports and the language us diplomats use in public , the cables actually reveal that the us has been largely consistent with the overall messages and themes it conveys to its international partners in private and in public , argue scholars interviewed by deutsche welle . " there 's nothing in these cables that is different from what we actually know about us foreign policy without these cables , " says thomas risse , director of the center for transnational relations , foreign and security policy at the free university of berlin .
" the whole approach by these people from wikileaks seems to be that there is a public side to us foreign policy and then there is this secret side and that there is some sort conspiracy involved in all this , " he says .
" and i do n't see a huge mismatch actually between what the us says in public and what it does . "
clear goals one of the dominant topics in these cables are us security interests and the fact that washington considers transnational terrorism a major threat , adds risse : " that is exactly what barack obama and hillary clinton would say every day . "
the same is true for other top issues such as the iranian nuclear program , the spread of nuclear and ballistic missiles and the stabilization of afghanistan , says dan reiter , a professor of international relations at emory university in atlanta : " at the broadest level i think the cables reveal that the goals the us is engaging in private are essentially similar to the goals that it is espousing in public . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : saudi king abdullah urged the president barack obama to take action against iran asked whether the insights gained from reading the frank assessments of diplomats engaged in shaping and carrying out us foreign policy will alter their view of the us role or status in the world , risse and reiter both answer with a resounding no . " the us is not an empire , there are very clear limits to us influence in the world , " says risse .
" of course the us is a superpower .
it has interests in all corners of the world , it does try to influence other governments , but that 's ok .
there 's nothing that would get me worked up about this at all . "
no puppet master the cables are " not terribly surprising , " notes reiter .
" one does n't get an image of the united states as this all-powerful puppet master trying to pull the strings of various governments around the world to serve its corporate interests .
that 's an image which does not emerge . "
instead , the cables paint a picture of the us acting as one would expect a major power to do so , adds reiter .
" i do n't think that anything we see is terribly different from the way most states have conducted their foreign policy in the modern era . "
what 's more surprising to the analysts is the behavior of arab countries that becomes evident in the cables .
while the opposition of arab states to iran 's nuclear program has been known in foreign policy circles for some time , the contrast between confidential assessments made in private and public statements is particularly stark . double talk " the level of hypocrisy that comes out of these cables is much higher for instance in the middle east , " says risse .
" it 's very clear from these cables that most arab states feel really threatened by iranian nuclear power , however they would never say that in public .
in fact , they say the opposite in public . "
according to the cables , king abdullah of saudi arabia and king hamed ibn isa khalifa of bahrain are among arab leaders who pressed the us to attack iran .
king abdullah repeatedly exhorted the united states to " cut off the head of the snake " and take military action against tehran 's nuclear facilities .

that doesn ’ t hold true for some other countries . the charge that us foreign policy is hypocritical is all but new , but the wikileaks data release has added some additional fuel to it .
just a few days ago , libya 's leader muammar gaddafi lauded the organization for exposing us " hypocrisy " through its diplomacy conducted behind closed doors , in comments published via the state news agency jana .
according to gaddafi , the leaked cables " proved that america is not what it has led allies and friends to believe it to be " and that " us relations with its allies are hypocritical . "
while there is certainly an expected discrepancy in the tone and style of these confidential reports and the language us diplomats use in public , the cables actually reveal that the us has been largely consistent with the overall messages and themes it conveys to its international partners in private and in public , argue scholars interviewed by deutsche welle . " there 's nothing in these cables that is different from what we actually know about us foreign policy without these cables , " says thomas risse , director of the center for transnational relations , foreign and security policy at the free university of berlin .
" the whole approach by these people from wikileaks seems to be that there is a public side to us foreign policy and then there is this secret side and that there is some sort conspiracy involved in all this , " he says .
" and i do n't see a huge mismatch actually between what the us says in public and what it does . "
clear goals one of the dominant topics in these cables are us security interests and the fact that washington considers transnational terrorism a major threat , adds risse : " that is exactly what barack obama and hillary clinton would say every day . "
the same is true for other top issues such as the iranian nuclear program , the spread of nuclear and ballistic missiles and the stabilization of afghanistan , says dan reiter , a professor of international relations at emory university in atlanta : " at the broadest level i think the cables reveal that the goals the us is engaging in private are essentially similar to the goals that it is espousing in public . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : saudi king abdullah urged the president barack obama to take action against iran asked whether the insights gained from reading the frank assessments of diplomats engaged in shaping and carrying out us foreign policy will alter their view of the us role or status in the world , risse and reiter both answer with a resounding no . " the us is not an empire , there are very clear limits to us influence in the world , " says risse .
" of course the us is a superpower .
it has interests in all corners of the world , it does try to influence other governments , but that 's ok .
there 's nothing that would get me worked up about this at all . "
no puppet master the cables are " not terribly surprising , " notes reiter .
" one does n't get an image of the united states as this all-powerful puppet master trying to pull the strings of various governments around the world to serve its corporate interests .
that 's an image which does not emerge . "
instead , the cables paint a picture of the us acting as one would expect a major power to do so , adds reiter .
" i do n't think that anything we see is terribly different from the way most states have conducted their foreign policy in the modern era . "
what 's more surprising to the analysts is the behavior of arab countries that becomes evident in the cables .
while the opposition of arab states to iran 's nuclear program has been known in foreign policy circles for some time , the contrast between confidential assessments made in private and public statements is particularly stark . double talk " the level of hypocrisy that comes out of these cables is much higher for instance in the middle east , " says risse .
" it 's very clear from these cables that most arab states feel really threatened by iranian nuclear power , however they would never say that in public .
in fact , they say the opposite in public . "
according to the cables , king abdullah of saudi arabia and king hamed ibn isa khalifa of bahrain are among arab leaders who pressed the us to attack iran .
king abdullah repeatedly exhorted the united states to " cut off the head of the snake " and take military action against tehran 's nuclear facilities .
open questions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : to evaluate the cables properly , scholars need more information about the documents in contrast to that , conclude the experts , the general outlines of us foreign policy are pretty much in sync with what the wikileaks documents have revealed so far and they have n't unearthed anything entirely unexpected .
nevertheless , argues risse , the document dump still poses a serious problem : " if you look at these cables from the perspective of an academic or historian , the real big question is what is the sample , ? " says risse . " is this a random selection , is this a selection that is representative of the whole or what exactly is it .
we have absolutely no way to judge this . "
risse notes , that even if all 250,000 cables are published in the end , it is still not clear how large a sample this is , how relevant the cables are or were in the decision-making processes for us officials and what the criteria were to publish them .

you have to pay a one-euro entrance fee , and while the mulled wine , roasted almonds and arts-and-craft knick-knacks are much the same as in any other christmas market , you are treated to a live ballet show , based on a russian fairytale , to go with your sense of exclusivity .
you also see more security guards .
some , like the ones taking your entry ticket , are dressed as toy soldiers in keeping with the winter fairytale theme .
others wear army boots and the thick , riot-police-style boiler suits emblazoned with the large reflective " security " badge on the back . recent threats of " mumbai style attacks " have boosted the private security business in the past few weeks .
thomas ostmann , berlin manager of german security company agsus , noticed a rise in demand immediately . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : recent terrorist threats in berlin have heightened demand for security firms " yes , we 've definitely noticed that , " he told deutsche welle .
" ahead of the christmas markets , we felt a rise in anxiety among the stand owners .
it is going down a little now , but there is significantly more manpower and security on the markets . "
security boom the added holiday season demand has come on top of a general expansion in the security industry over the past decade .
germany currently has 4,000 security companies , up 1,000 over a decade ago .
the number of people employed in the industry has doubled and sales , too , with revenue this year expected to reach 4.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 5.9 billion -rrb- . sven hallscheidt , spokesman for the german chambers of industry and commerce -lrb- dihk -rrb- , attributes the growing demand for security services by individuals and companies to a deep social change .
" it 's a development in society , " he said .
" on the one hand , it is influenced by reports in the media – we all know the reports about possible terrorist attacks – but also reports of attacks in public generally . " the security business is not only expanding but also becoming more complex .
company security is taking on an evermore important role , requiring a new breed of skilled workers – from guards and logistics planners to engineers – to create security systems . essential as the police and that role is extending beyond guarding buildings , cash logistics and the likes into areas such as critical infrastructure , making the private security industry as essential as the police . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the police no longer have the resources to protect essential infrastructure bodo pfalzgraf , chairman of the berlin police union , says the police force in germany simply does n't have the capacity to meet the country 's security requirements .
" first of all , we have in germany about as many police employees as there are employees in the private security industry , it 's 50 – 50 , " he told deutsche welle .
" in my opinion , the infrastructure of german security is inconceivable without private security personnel .
they guard nuclear power stations – they 're not just skin-headed , tattooed bouncers . " the growing importance of the private security sector , however , is also raising questions over jurisdiction , with some politicians warning against the dangers of over-privatizing security – particularly in airports . no special privileges but security manager ostmann says that even in places like christmas markets where private companies protect public spaces , the rules about what guards can and ca n't do are clear .
" the police always have the final say , " he said .
" we have the same rights as any other citizen , but we have no special powers .
and there are no difficulties over areas of competence .
i 'd say it is a very good partnership . " official agreements , like contracts , are organized on a state government level between the police and private security firms but there are still ambiguities , according to pfalzgraf . " a danger exists if there is no clear delineation between the two , and the government is not providing one at the moment , " he said .
" today , anyone can start a private security firm – they have to fulfil very few conditions .
and as of may 1 , 2011 , there 's going to be another opening of the market in europe – in other words , eastern european companies from poland , czech republic and lithuania will be able to start security services here .
that i think is a problem . " pfalzgraf believes it 's high time the state creates more rigorous industry standards to cope with the rising need for private security firms .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de finance -pipe- 10.12.2010 cancun divided over how to pay for consequences of climate change großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how can cancun help poorer nations face climate change ?
the goal of a legally binding treaty to reduce pollution has fallen by the wayside , so efforts in cancun have been focusing on a fund to help channel hundreds of billions of dollars in aid towards poor countries . enshrined in the copenhagen accord was the pledge to raise billions of dollars of climate aid .
the headline figures were impressive : 100 billion dollars -lrb- 76 billion euro -rrb- a year as of 2020 , and at least seven billion euros from the eu over the next few years to get the ball rolling .
yet the nitty gritty details of how that money should be managed and distributed were left for cancun . but negotiations on the fund are being stalled because the us want to tie the creation of the fund to other issues , in particular they want big developing emitting countries , particularly china to be more transparent about the action they are taking to mitigate the effects of climate change . " that essentially puts a handbrake on how far we can go in creating a fund , " steve herz , a climate policy advisor at greenpeace told deutsche welle .
" it risks a watered down decision , " he added . a new draft proposal has spelled out the technicalities for setting up a global climate fund .
it will help poor nations create a mechanism to share clean technologies , protect tropical forests and help the poor adapt to impacts ranging from storms to rising sea levels . in a revision , the text explicitly calls for a role for women in the fight against climate change . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : environmentalists want the money to help poor nations adapt to climate change " at last women , who are among the most affected by climate change , are not being ignored , " said executive director of oxfam jeremy hobbs at a press conference . but some environmentalists criticized the draft for removing a reference to ensuring that 50 percent of assistance goes toward helping people adapt to climate change . " the current draft sees too many important decisions pushed down the road , " hobbs said . the omission would allow wealthy nations to meet pledges through other means , such as offering technical know-how to help curb emissions of greenhouse gases blamed for global warming . role of the world bank negotiators said they saw steady progress in setting up the architecture of a future climate fund .
a remaining sticking point is whether to include a role for international bodies , such as the world bank , in administering aid . donor countries want to have guarantees that the money is actually spent on global climate protection .
the developing countries receiving the funds want freedom of choice on their national measures and no preconditions , for example , on policy priorities . " there 's a tug of war going on right now .
the dispute is about the trustee role , " said steve herz . donor countries want the world bank to play a role as trustee , which - according to herz - " could mean that they just cut cheques , but it could also mean a broader role in implementing and conceiving projects " . negotiators are currently trying to agree on the scope of the trustee role . as the globe 's largest poverty-fighting institution , with 65 years of experience in development finance , the world bank says it can play a helpful role . " our specialty is essentially delivering results at scale .
the world has lots of pilots and lots of wonderful experiments going on a small scale and those are really good .
but what the world really needs now is scale .
i think we can play a helpful role in bringing together the overall packages , " andrew steer , special envoy for climate change at the world bank , told deutsche welle . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : loans to create solar energy plants could generate income , according to the world bank but there are some delegations that are very skeptical about the world bank administering the funds .
in particular , developing countries oppose a climate fund managed by the bank and instead want the unfccc to be the fund 's manager . the un ambassadors of bolivia , pablo solon , summed up their reservations : " to have the world bank as the entity that is going to manage this is something that we do not support , " solon told deutsche welle . " why ?
because as you know , there has been a crisis , an international crisis and part of the reason for this crisis is the imf and the world bank , which have imposed a policy that has provoked this crisis " . the world bank has also been criticized for not acting progressively enough on climate related issues . " it continues to promote as its central paradigm fossil fuel based energy production , " said steve herz a report by oil change international and sierra club said the world bank increased its lending for fossil fuels from 1.5 billion dollars in 2006 to 6.2 billion dollars in 2010 . carbon markets on the sidelines of the conference , the world bank launched a new multi-million dollar fund to help emerging market countries set up their own carbon markets carbon markets create a profit-generating system whereby a cap is put on the total amount of carbon emissions and companies can trade in surplus rights to emit carbon dioxide into the atmosphere .
the idea is to create a market based system that incentivizes companies to reduce carbon emissions . the world bank thinks this system can play a bigger role .
" today only two percent of clean development mechanism money goes to africa and we have found that in our own portfolio of carbon markets , we have more than 20 percent going to africa and it works fine .
in other words , we believe that it is possible to extend the reach of carbon markets and offsets to those low income countries , " steer said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : carbon markets have allowed china 's wind energy sector to expand rapidly friends of the earth , an environmental advocacy group is strongly critical of carbon markets . " carbon markets are an irreparably flawed means of addressing climate change , " said karen orenstein of friends of the earth us .
" they further entrench the economic arrangements that facilitate the north 's over-consumption and have landed us in this climate crisis in the first place . " nnimmo bassey , executive director of environmental rights action in nigeria and chair of friends of the earth international , thinks that the negotiations are missing the real issues by concentrating too much on market issues . " all the negotiators talk about is how to use the market to soften global warming – carbon offsetting by planting a tree somewhere in africa while you keep polluting in europe , " he told deutsche welle . " this is not a solution , because pollution emissions have to stop at the source .
and they are not talking about lifestyle changes ; they are not talking about less consumption and less of production . " with talks due to end on friday , many negotiators believed they could come to agreement in three key areas : the architecture of a global climate fund , aid to discourage deforestation , and verification of countries ' climate pledges . author : natalia dannenberg -lrb- afp , dpa -rrb- editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

meanwhile , russia 's prime minister accuses the us of hypocrisy over the affair . the un commissioner for human rights navi pillay expressed dismay over the withdrawal of financial and internet services to the controversial wikileaks website .
pillay said that measures taken by companies - which wikileaks ' supporters claim are due to pressure from foreign governments - could represent an infringement of the right to freedom of expression . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pillay said courts should decide on the balance between security and freedom " i 'm concerned about reports of pressure exerted on private companies , including banks , credit card companies , and internet service providers to close down credit lines for donations to wikileaks as well as to stop hosting the website or its mother sites , " navi pillay told a news conference on thursday .
" they could be interpreted as an attempt to censor the publication of information , thus potentially violating wikileaks ' right to freedom of expression . "
payments suspended , account closed wikileaks angered the us and other governments with the release in november of 250,000 confidential diplomatic cables , with washington saying the information could put american lives in danger .
credit card firms mastercard and visa later suspended payments made to wikileaks , while the swiss post office shut down a bank account opened by wikileaks founder julian assange .
pillay said the case " raises complex human rights questions about balancing freedom of information and the need to protect national security or public order . "
" if wikileaks has committed any recognizable illegal acts then this should be handled through the legal system and not through pressure and intimidation including on third parties , " said pillay a former un war crimes judge .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : assange was arrested in london , and awaits a hearing pillay noted that such questions were not related to charges against assange for crimes including rape in sweden .
supporters of assange claim that the charges against him have been manufactured as part of a bid to halt the website 's activities , along with the pressure on firms to cut wikileaks ' income stream .
' pot calls kettle black , ' putin russian prime minister vladimir putin said that assange 's arrest in britain , for extradition , was " undemocratic " and accused the us of " hypocrisy " for attacking russia 's record on democracy .
" if we are talking about democracy , it should be complete .

is that democracy ?

although no over-arching treaty to tackle climate change is up for grabs this year , struggles over principles risk progress on smaller achievements in the final hours of negotiations . japan 's hard line on the kyoto protocol remains the main concern for parties trying to bridge differences on a range of issues , including forestry protection , climate finance and accounting methodologies .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the japanese delegation has come in for criticism japan has refused to climb down from its refusal to consider extending kyoto when its first commitment period expires in 2012 , despite openings for compromises throughout the talks .
" we know that european union countries insist on a second commitment period , but we think this is n't a fair way of dealing with emissions globally , " said japanese negotiator akira yamada on thursday evening , describing this dispute as " ongoing " and " difficult . "
kyoto binds 37 wealthy nations to cut their greenhouse gas emissions , but japan does not want to be part of an agreement that does n't include binding rules for the world ’ s top two emitters , china and the us .
developing countries see kyoto as crucial for holding the industrialized world to account for a problem that is mostly of its making .
it seemed that a crisis over kyoto might be avoided earlier in the conference , following conciliatory language from china and india , but by the end of the week environmental groups were naming japan as the " worst " participant at the talks .
" they should show more flexibility and not pick a fight where it is not necessary , " said david turnbull , executive director of the climate action network , an umbrella group of environmental organizations .
anger at brazil yet harsh criticism has also been leveled at certain developing countries , among them brazil , amid fears that even lesser gains may slip through negotiators ' fingers in cancun .
brazil has been widely applauded for how it is tackling the destruction of the amazon .
indeed , last week it announced that its rate of deforestation dropped 14 percent over a 12-month period in 2010 , to reach its lowest level on record .
yet environmental groups accused brazil on thursday of rolling back gains in discussions on forestry protection measures because of its resistance to a system with international checks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : global deforestation rates have slowed over the last 10 years don lehr , a spokesperson for the eco-systems climate alliance , described talks on forestry on thursday as deadlocked .
" if we are not going to break down the sovereignty issues , we ’ ll never deal with climate change , " said rosalind reeve of global witness , an organisation that tracks resource exploitation , in reference to brazil 's position .
" you need a monitoring system that works nationally and internationally to build integrity .
there ’ s two sides to this equation ; there ’ s carbon and there ’ s safeguards . "
brazil has long been wary of efforts to secure international monitoring commitments in a global system to curb deforestation which would reward conservation in poor countries . despite the concerns of countries like brazil and papua new guinea , many have hoped to see cancun at least achieve an agreement on the scheme known as redd - reducing emissions from deforestation and degradation .
that is looking difficult on friday .
" we are not in favour of monitoring in an international process , " said a senior brazilian negotiator , suggesting that it would simply add excessive layers of bureaucracy that would " overcharge " domestic measures .
money matters though the situation could change in the final hours of talks , efforts to agree on a fund to help poor countries pay for their response to climate change also appear stalled . " saying , as has been said , ' well we won ’ t talk about a climate fund until we are clear about the rules ' then other people say ' well we won ’ t talk about the rules until a climate fund can exist ' - that kind of thing is just going to delay things too much and get us into silly posturing , " said jeremy hobbs , executive director of oxfam , which campaigns against poverty . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : progess at the talks has been painfully slow rich countries pledged in copenhagen last year to raise $ 30 billion -lrb- 22 billion euros -rrb- over the next few years to help developing countries already begin to meet the costs of climate change .
developing countries have expressed dismay that much of that pledged money appears to have been watered down through technical measures .
the fast start finance is supposed to help build trust in rich countries ’ pledges to deliver $ 100 billion dollars annually as of 2020 for a so-called green fund for developing countries , which in turn might make poorer countries amenable to adopting their own binding emissions cuts .
details of the fund - such as who will have control of it , where the money will come from and the conditions of its use - were supposed to be ironed out in cancun .
but these , too , appear to remain points of contest as the conference draws to a close .

the decision marks a profound change for germany , where compulsory service was re-introduced 50 years ago . senior officials in germany 's coalition government have agreed to suspend military conscription as of july 1 , 2011 .
defense minister karl theodor zu guttenberg 's proposal was accepted during closed-door talks in berlin on thursday evening .
the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- of chancellor angela merkel and its bavarian sister party the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- have both in principle approved abolishing the draft at party conferences in the past six weeks .
their other coalition partner , the pro-business free democrats , had included stopping conscription in their manifesto during last year 's general election .
sources taking part in the meeting said the next step would be for merkel 's cabinet to approve a draft bill that could be put to parliament ; this is expected to happen on december 15 .
troop reduction bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : defense minister guttenberg says the change will save money guttenberg 's plan would also see troop numbers reduced the current level of 250,000 soldiers to 185,000 .
of these , 170,000 would be professional soldiers , with volunteers making up the remainder .
with his reform , guttenberg hopes to save up to 8.3 billion euros .
however , the suspension of conscription could create some new problems ; for instance , the alternative community service offered to those who refuse military service would also be dropped .
social and welfare institutions fear that this could lead to a lack of personnel , as in the past they have relied heavily on youngsters who want to avoid military service .
the suspension also means that student numbers are likely to climb , posing problems for universities .
compulsory military service in germany lasts for six months and only applies to young men .
women are allowed to join the german army , the bundeswehr , either as professionals or volunteers , but are not obliged to do so .

standing alongside serb prime minister mirko cvetkovic , he said that the eu " regrets the decision of serbia not to attend " the ceremony and added that serbia was " expected to embrace euro values and coordinate " with partners .
his words had a deep impact : while the foreign minister of serbia had originally defended the country 's decision not to attend the ceremony , serbia decided to send its ombudsman for human rights , sasa jankovic , to oslo .
serbia was the only eu candidate that originally decided to stay away from the ceremony honoring chinese human rights activist liu xiaobo .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the chinese government refused to let liu xiaobo attend the ceremony : his seat remained empty after the announcement of this year 's laureate , china had protested against the nobel committee 's decision and had urged other countries to boycott the ceremony .
serbia followed china 's call , as it relies on chinese government support for serbia 's opposition to an independent kosovo .
caught between a rock and a hard place but serbia is caught in a clash of interests , because it wants to join the 27-nation bloc of the european union .
fuele and other eu representatives clarified that serbia needed to comply with the joint decision of eu member states to send representatives to oslo in order not to lessen its chances of becoming a member state .
pedrag simic , political scientist at the university of belgrad says that despite serbia 's goal to join the european union , the country would still rely on four pillars of international politics - brussels , washington , moscow , and peking .
" a small country can only follow one superpower , " he said .
simic added that serbia 's attempts to be loyal to both china and the european union had to result in a dilemma such as the current one at some point .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 10.12.2010 hanover hit new high with win over struggling stuttgart großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : goal hero ya konan can now boast nine for the season hanover continued to surpass expectations , rising to second in the standings with a 2-1 win over beleaguered stuttgart .
now , just third from bottom , stuttgart has decided to dump its coach , jens keller . ivorian didier ya konan scored twice to give hanover a 2-1 win over stuttgart on friday , taking his team to second place in the bundesliga ahead of the weekend 's main soccer action .
the loss was also the final straw for stuttgart 's management , which announced on saturday that it had fired coach jens keller .
after a cautious start by both sides , ya konan had the first major chance of the match in the 20th minute , with a shot that was stopped by stuttgart keeper sven ulreich .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while stuttgart battled back , they were unable to gain a much-needed point the breakthrough came on 35 minutes , after stuttgart left back arthur boka got a defensive foot to a ball from hanover 's lars stindl - only to divert it to ya konan .
the striker took advantage and passed the ball through ulreich 's legs to take his tally for the season to eight .
stuttgart responded positively , pressing throughout the game , and - with just a quarter of an hour to go - managed to equalize as georg niedermeier jumped to head a timo gebhart free kick into the far corner .
the comeback was short-lived .
after another attempt on the hanover goal , this time from philip degen , hanover swiftly counter-attacked .
ya konan latched onto a high ball from christian schulz to score through ulreich 's legs for a second time .
' an exceptional start ' the win means that hanover have already recorded one more victory than in the whole of last season .
" it is exceptional what we have achieved in the first half of the season , " said hanover technical director joerg schmadtke .
stuttgart is now without a win in its last five games and is third from the bottom with only 12 points from 16 games .
this dreary realization was enough for the team to pull the plug on jen keller 's 59-day rein as head coach .
the hottest prospect to replace him is bruno labaddia , who coached hamburg until the end of april .
in saturday 's football , bayern host st. pauli , hamburg entertain bayer leverkusen and cologne are at home to eintracht frankfurt .

other than the nobel peace prize , which was awarded this year to liu xiaobo , numerous prizes for human rights activists are awarded on this day all over the world .
58-year-old lawyer asma jahangir , recipient of unesco / bilbao prize for 2010 , is the current president of the supreme court bar association and a founding member of the human rights commission of pakistan , the country 's leading independent human rights body .
' it increases one 's responsibilities ' she is a brilliant speaker and a relentless champion of people 's rights .
and yet , there are moments when even asma jahangir seems tired : when she talks about how much still remains to be done in pakistan despite some improvements .
asma jahangir laughs heartily and admits that she too is a normal human being with strengths and weaknesses .
she is happy about the international recognition that comes with the unesco / bilbao prize .
" it is indeed a matter of happiness and pride , but at the same time it increases one 's responsibility .
people expect more from you .
one has to strategize more , keeping in mind one 's integrity .
it draws a ' red line ' for you . "
the journey asma jahangir was born in a rich family in lahore .
when the pakistani government suppressed the independence movement in the late sixties in east pakistan , today 's bangladesh , asma 's father protested and was repeatedly jailed or put under house arrest .
asma jahangir believes this experience has truly formed her .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : asma jahangir has been campaigning for human rights for several decades " what i have learnt is that you are no longer materialistic after that .
the way my father worked altruistically , and the manner in which he used to go behind bars and come back home smilingly was inspirational .
he passed away when he was only 61 .
he had cancer , and we knew he would leave us soon .
i remember my sister and i were sitting at his deathbed , and he looked at us and said , ' i am not going to die , i will live through you ' , " reminisces jahangir .
asma jahangir followed his words .
with her inheritance she founded a women 's forum in 1980 together with her sister , hina jilani , a lawyer herself .
in her numerous jobs , for example as chairperson of the human rights commission of pakistan , or as united nations special rapporteur on freedom of religion or belief , she has raised her voice against the discrimination of religious minorities , against " honor " killings , or the treatment of minors in pakistani jails .
it has not been easy for her .
" women face difficulties at all levels .
they face hardship in society and at the workplace .
women also have to struggle within their households .
therefore , if any woman asserts herself , people find it difficult to accept .
they can also be very cruel towards that woman , " opines jahangir . she remembers that her own in-laws also found it difficult to accept that their son had married a woman who was not a typical pakistani wife .
but with time , both her family and society have accepted her achievements .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a demonstration for minority rights in pakistan dreams for a better pakistan for pakistan , asma jahangir has many dreams .
" firstly , i want to see economic prosperity in pakistan .
the indignity of poverty makes me despair .
pakistanis are a very dignified people .
they have suffered a great deal .
they have resisted oppression .
and yet , the image of pakistan projected in the world is mostly negative .
the positive side of pakistan is not shown .
i think pakistan has wasted its human capital . "
she has learnt to suppress her anger , even when she is being accused of blasphemy or treason .
but asma jahangir emphasizes that a life in anger is not worth living .

but the west seems unmoved . despite changes in afghan law and a constitution designed to protect women 's rights , violence and abuse of women continue to be a serious problem in the country , and the government is not doing enough to prevent it .
that is the conclusion of a new report published by the united nations assistance mission in afghanistan -lrb- unama -rrb- .
the most common forms of abuse include forced and child marriage , honor killings and giving away girls to settle disputes under the tradition of baad .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the report says violence against afghan women is still widespread " the report describes the prevalence of these practices , " georgette gagnon , unama 's director of human rights , said at a press conference .
" it looks at the consequences these practices have on the lives of afghan women and girls and the community as a whole and it also looks at the efforts of the afghan government to address violence against women . "
one of these efforts , the 2009 law of elimination of violence against women -lrb- evaw -rrb- , came under particular scrutiny .
the law , which gagnon described as " a huge gain of legal protection of women 's rights , " criminalizes buying and selling women for marriage , forcing a woman to marry without her consent , forcing girls to marry when they are underage , and forcing girls and women to commit self-immolation - when they set themselves on fire .
ignorance and lack of enforcement but according to the report , the new law is not being enforced in many parts of the country , and is often not even known .
bele grau , program manager for afghanistan at the women 's rights organisation medica mondiale agreed with this assessment .
" on the theoretical and legal level the situation is getting better – but in practice it is often not implemented , " she told deutsche welle .
" this law has been in force for a year , but a lot of judges do n't even know it , and if they do , they do n't enforce it . "
the un women 's organization unifem says that around 87 percent of afghan women suffer from domestic violence , and that half of all girls are married under the age of 15 .
on top of this , grau says that many of the rights that women have won are repealed by new laws .
she cites one recent regulation that bans women who have run away from an abusive home from seeking refuge with strangers .
this in practice leaves many women only the unrealistic option of going to relatives .
many women are also still imprisoned for running away , in contravention of the evaw law .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : westerwelle suggested democracy can not be imposed on afghanistan the report found that much of the abuse is founded in afghan tradition .
" one very harmful practice that we heard a lot about is baad , which is the giving away of girls to settle disputes , " said gagnon .
" many of the women told us that instead of a murderer being punished , an innocent girl is punished and she has to spend all her life in slavery and is subjected to cruel violence .
sometimes she is forced to sleep with the animals in the barn . "
western indifference the report sets out a number of recommendations for the afghan government to deal with the problem , but grau says that the west has an obligation to apply pressure in order to protect women 's rights – not least because this is often used to add legitimacy to the war in afghanistan .
" we 've noticed this in most of the western governments , " she said .
" for the past year , all the talk is about withdrawal of troops , and negotiations with the taliban etc . , and that afghans have to work out for themselves how much democracy or women 's rights they want .
these are now all internal afghan issues that are n't discussed or even noticed anymore .
the german government is no exception to this . "
she believes that pressure could be exhorted through the financial aid the west gives to the afghan government .
" the western governments still give afghanistan a lot of development money , " she said .
" and when they make conditions for giving this money , we think they should make them for human rights and women 's rights , not just for taking over security duties . "
" the issue of women 's rights was also one of the justifications for the war itself , but that is suddenly disappearing from the agenda , " she added .
" earlier this year , -lrb- german foreign minister guido -rrb- westerwelle said , ' well , afghanistan is not switzerland , ' and with that everything is swept from the table . "

" there is a spirit that is uniting us all , " the german chancellor told reporters during a break in the talks .
" if the euro fails , the european union fails , too . "
president sarkozy , meanwhile , pledged that germany and france " will defend the euro , because the euro is europe . "
sarkozy also backed germany 's opposition to creating unified european sovereign bonds .
the idea of harmonizing some eurozone debt , as suggested by several members of the currency union , has met with strong opposition from germany and france , whose balance sheets are relatively healthy .
" french and german citizens would not be happy if we were to bundle the debts together , " the french president said .
he argued that the concept might be worth considering in the future , but only after the bloc 's members ramp up their economic and political cooperation .
" we should not put the cart before the horse , " sarkozy told reporters .
european leaders , or bullies ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france and germany are unwilling to unify european debts earlier in the week , merkel and germany had come under fire over this issue from luxembourg 's prime minister jean-claude juncker , who also heads the eurozone .
juncker said that creating taboo subjects without even considering the ideas of others was " a very un-european way of dealing with european issues . " as the two largest eu members , france and germany both have a sizeable share of the voting power within the bloc , and need relatively little support from other countries in order to secure a majority .
" without agreement from france and germany - the historic motors of european integration and two economies that make up half of the eurozone 's gross domestic product - nothing very important is possible , " professor henrik uterwedde from the franco-german institute in ludwigsburg told deutsche welle .
" so on the one hand , they must reach agreements , and help the union move forward , but at the same time , they do n't always do enough to treat the other members as equal partners and involve them in the decision-making processes . "
friday 's meeting was in preparation for the eu summit in brussels on december 16 and 17 , at which the bloc 's economic difficulties such as unemployment and national debt are bound to top the agenda .
troop deployment symbolic of closer cooperation while sarkozy and merkel discussed the harmonization of economic policies like labor and taxation laws , saying this would improve the eurozone 's coherence as an economic bloc , military leaders just across the border were preparing a more visible symbol of franco-german cooperation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the last german battalions in france had a very different mission the first german battalion to be stationed on french soil since the nazi occupation in world war ii officially took up their post near the border-city of strasbourg on friday .
german defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg and his french counterpart alain juppe attended a ceremony to mark the event .
" german soldiers are today welcome in france , " merkel said across the border in freiburg .
" for me , that has great symbolism , after all that germany was guilty of during the nazi era . "
the battalion , which will eventually consist of 600 soldiers , is part of the joint franco-german brigade .
" i was always surprised that the franco-german brigade only consisted of french soldiers in germany , " sarkozy said .
" we are two sovereign nations , two countries at peace , two countries that founded europe . "
franco-german genesis of eu sarkozy was referring to the forerunner of the modern-day european union , the european coal and steel community .
this trade-oriented union was established in 1953 as part of post-war efforts to negate the possibility of future conflict between france and germany by making them economically interdependent .
between 1870 and 1945 , the two neighbors fought three devastating wars .
" above all else , i think putting these german troops in france is a symbolic exercise , " franco-german expert , professor henrik uterwedde said .
" but sometimes symbolism is important . "
" that famous photo of -lsb- former german chancellor -rsb- helmut kohl and -lsb- then french president -rsb- francois mitterand standing hand-in-hand at the world war one commemorations in verdun in 1984 was pure symbolism , too - but it was a hugely significant image . "
bildunterschrift : sometimes symbolism can move mountains the alsace region where the german battalion us now stationed spans the franco-german border , and has changed hands several times over the centuries .

now , just third from bottom , stuttgart has decided to dump its coach , jens keller . ivorian didier ya konan scored twice to give hanover a 2-1 win over stuttgart on friday , taking his team to second place in the bundesliga ahead of the weekend 's main soccer action .
the loss was also the final straw for stuttgart 's management , which announced on saturday that it had fired coach jens keller .
after a cautious start by both sides , ya konan had the first major chance of the match in the 20th minute , with a shot that was stopped by stuttgart keeper sven ulreich .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while stuttgart battled back , they were unable to gain a much-needed point the breakthrough came on 35 minutes , after stuttgart left back arthur boka got a defensive foot to a ball from hanover 's lars stindl - only to divert it to ya konan .
the striker took advantage and passed the ball through ulreich 's legs to take his tally for the season to eight .
stuttgart responded positively , pressing throughout the game , and - with just a quarter of an hour to go - managed to equalize as georg niedermeier jumped to head a timo gebhart free kick into the far corner .
the comeback was short-lived .
after another attempt on the hanover goal , this time from philip degen , hanover swiftly counter-attacked .
ya konan latched onto a high ball from christian schulz to score through ulreich 's legs for a second time .
' an exceptional start ' the win means that hanover have already recorded one more victory than in the whole of last season .
" it is exceptional what we have achieved in the first half of the season , " said hanover technical director joerg schmadtke .
stuttgart is now without a win in its last five games and is third from the bottom with only 12 points from 16 games .
this dreary realization was enough for the team to pull the plug on jen keller 's 59-day rein as head coach .
the hottest prospect to replace him is bruno labaddia , who coached hamburg until the end of april .

" if the euro fails , the european union fails , too . "
president sarkozy , meanwhile , pledged that germany and france " will defend the euro , because the euro is europe . "
sarkozy also backed germany 's opposition to creating unified european sovereign bonds .
the idea of harmonizing some eurozone debt , as suggested by several members of the currency union , has met with strong opposition from germany and france , whose balance sheets are relatively healthy .
" french and german citizens would not be happy if we were to bundle the debts together , " the french president said .
he argued that the concept might be worth considering in the future , but only after the bloc 's members ramp up their economic and political cooperation .
" we should not put the cart before the horse , " sarkozy told reporters .
european leaders , or bullies ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france and germany are unwilling to unify european debts earlier in the week , merkel and germany had come under fire over this issue from luxembourg 's prime minister jean-claude juncker , who also heads the eurozone .
juncker said that creating taboo subjects without even considering the ideas of others was " a very un-european way of dealing with european issues . " as the two largest eu members , france and germany both have a sizeable share of the voting power within the bloc , and need relatively little support from other countries in order to secure a majority .
" without agreement from france and germany - the historic motors of european integration and two economies that make up half of the eurozone 's gross domestic product - nothing very important is possible , " professor henrik uterwedde from the franco-german institute in ludwigsburg told deutsche welle .
" so on the one hand , they must reach agreements , and help the union move forward , but at the same time , they do n't always do enough to treat the other members as equal partners and involve them in the decision-making processes . "
friday 's meeting was in preparation for the eu summit in brussels on december 16 and 17 , at which the bloc 's economic difficulties such as unemployment and national debt are bound to top the agenda .
troop deployment symbolic of closer cooperation while sarkozy and merkel discussed the harmonization of economic policies like labor and taxation laws , saying this would improve the eurozone 's coherence as an economic bloc , military leaders just across the border were preparing a more visible symbol of franco-german cooperation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the last german battalions in france had a very different mission the first german battalion to be stationed on french soil since the nazi occupation in world war ii officially took up their post near the border-city of strasbourg on friday .
german defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg and his french counterpart alain juppe attended a ceremony to mark the event .
" german soldiers are today welcome in france , " merkel said across the border in freiburg .
" for me , that has great symbolism , after all that germany was guilty of during the nazi era . "
the battalion , which will eventually consist of 600 soldiers , is part of the joint franco-german brigade .
" i was always surprised that the franco-german brigade only consisted of french soldiers in germany , " sarkozy said .
" we are two sovereign nations , two countries at peace , two countries that founded europe . "
franco-german genesis of eu sarkozy was referring to the forerunner of the modern-day european union , the european coal and steel community .
this trade-oriented union was established in 1953 as part of post-war efforts to negate the possibility of future conflict between france and germany by making them economically interdependent .
between 1870 and 1945 , the two neighbors fought three devastating wars .
" above all else , i think putting these german troops in france is a symbolic exercise , " franco-german expert , professor henrik uterwedde said .
" but sometimes symbolism is important . "
" that famous photo of -lsb- former german chancellor -rsb- helmut kohl and -lsb- then french president -rsb- francois mitterand standing hand-in-hand at the world war one commemorations in verdun in 1984 was pure symbolism , too - but it was a hugely significant image . "
bildunterschrift : sometimes symbolism can move mountains the alsace region where the german battalion us now stationed spans the franco-german border , and has changed hands several times over the centuries .

that doesn ’ t hold true for some other countries . the charge that us foreign policy is hypocritical is all but new , but the wikileaks data release has added some additional fuel to it .
just a few days ago , libya 's leader muammar gaddafi lauded the organization for exposing us " hypocrisy " through its diplomacy conducted behind closed doors , in comments published via the state news agency jana .
according to gaddafi , the leaked cables " proved that america is not what it has led allies and friends to believe it to be " and that " us relations with its allies are hypocritical . "
while there is certainly an expected discrepancy in the tone and style of these confidential reports and the language us diplomats use in public , the cables actually reveal that the us has been largely consistent with the overall messages and themes it conveys to its international partners in private and in public , argue scholars interviewed by deutsche welle . " there 's nothing in these cables that is different from what we actually know about us foreign policy without these cables , " says thomas risse , director of the center for transnational relations , foreign and security policy at the free university of berlin .
" the whole approach by these people from wikileaks seems to be that there is a public side to us foreign policy and then there is this secret side and that there is some sort conspiracy involved in all this , " he says .
" and i do n't see a huge mismatch actually between what the us says in public and what it does . "
clear goals one of the dominant topics in these cables are us security interests and the fact that washington considers transnational terrorism a major threat , adds risse : " that is exactly what barack obama and hillary clinton would say every day . "
the same is true for other top issues such as the iranian nuclear program , the spread of nuclear and ballistic missiles and the stabilization of afghanistan , says dan reiter , a professor of international relations at emory university in atlanta : " at the broadest level i think the cables reveal that the goals the us is engaging in private are essentially similar to the goals that it is espousing in public . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : saudi king abdullah urged the president barack obama to take action against iran asked whether the insights gained from reading the frank assessments of diplomats engaged in shaping and carrying out us foreign policy will alter their view of the us role or status in the world , risse and reiter both answer with a resounding no . " the us is not an empire , there are very clear limits to us influence in the world , " says risse .
" of course the us is a superpower .
it has interests in all corners of the world , it does try to influence other governments , but that 's ok .
there 's nothing that would get me worked up about this at all . "
no puppet master the cables are " not terribly surprising , " notes reiter .
" one does n't get an image of the united states as this all-powerful puppet master trying to pull the strings of various governments around the world to serve its corporate interests .
that 's an image which does not emerge . "
instead , the cables paint a picture of the us acting as one would expect a major power to do so , adds reiter .
" i do n't think that anything we see is terribly different from the way most states have conducted their foreign policy in the modern era . "
what 's more surprising to the analysts is the behavior of arab countries that becomes evident in the cables .
while the opposition of arab states to iran 's nuclear program has been known in foreign policy circles for some time , the contrast between confidential assessments made in private and public statements is particularly stark . double talk " the level of hypocrisy that comes out of these cables is much higher for instance in the middle east , " says risse .
" it 's very clear from these cables that most arab states feel really threatened by iranian nuclear power , however they would never say that in public .
in fact , they say the opposite in public . "
according to the cables , king abdullah of saudi arabia and king hamed ibn isa khalifa of bahrain are among arab leaders who pressed the us to attack iran .
king abdullah repeatedly exhorted the united states to " cut off the head of the snake " and take military action against tehran 's nuclear facilities .
open questions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : to evaluate the cables properly , scholars need more information about the documents in contrast to that , conclude the experts , the general outlines of us foreign policy are pretty much in sync with what the wikileaks documents have revealed so far and they have n't unearthed anything entirely unexpected .
nevertheless , argues risse , the document dump still poses a serious problem : " if you look at these cables from the perspective of an academic or historian , the real big question is what is the sample , ? " says risse . " is this a random selection , is this a selection that is representative of the whole or what exactly is it .
we have absolutely no way to judge this . "
risse notes , that even if all 250,000 cables are published in the end , it is still not clear how large a sample this is , how relevant the cables are or were in the decision-making processes for us officials and what the criteria were to publish them .

standing alongside serb prime minister mirko cvetkovic , he said that the eu " regrets the decision of serbia not to attend " the ceremony and added that serbia was " expected to embrace euro values and coordinate " with partners .
his words had a deep impact : while the foreign minister of serbia had originally defended the country 's decision not to attend the ceremony , serbia decided to send its ombudsman for human rights , sasa jankovic , to oslo .
serbia was the only eu candidate that originally decided to stay away from the ceremony honoring chinese human rights activist liu xiaobo .

serbia followed china 's call , as it relies on chinese government support for serbia 's opposition to an independent kosovo .
caught between a rock and a hard place but serbia is caught in a clash of interests , because it wants to join the 27-nation bloc of the european union .
fuele and other eu representatives clarified that serbia needed to comply with the joint decision of eu member states to send representatives to oslo in order not to lessen its chances of becoming a member state .
pedrag simic , political scientist at the university of belgrad says that despite serbia 's goal to join the european union , the country would still rely on four pillars of international politics - brussels , washington , moscow , and peking .
" a small country can only follow one superpower , " he said .
simic added that serbia 's attempts to be loyal to both china and the european union had to result in a dilemma such as the current one at some point .

serbia followed china 's call , as it relies on chinese government support for serbia 's opposition to an independent kosovo .
caught between a rock and a hard place but serbia is caught in a clash of interests , because it wants to join the 27-nation bloc of the european union .
fuele and other eu representatives clarified that serbia needed to comply with the joint decision of eu member states to send representatives to oslo in order not to lessen its chances of becoming a member state .
pedrag simic , political scientist at the university of belgrad says that despite serbia 's goal to join the european union , the country would still rely on four pillars of international politics - brussels , washington , moscow , and peking .
" a small country can only follow one superpower , " he said .
simic added that serbia 's attempts to be loyal to both china and the european union had to result in a dilemma such as the current one at some point .

" there is a spirit that is uniting us all , " the german chancellor told reporters during a break in the talks .
" if the euro fails , the european union fails , too . "
president sarkozy , meanwhile , pledged that germany and france " will defend the euro , because the euro is europe . "
sarkozy also backed germany 's opposition to creating unified european sovereign bonds .
the idea of harmonizing some eurozone debt , as suggested by several members of the currency union , has met with strong opposition from germany and france , whose balance sheets are relatively healthy .
" french and german citizens would not be happy if we were to bundle the debts together , " the french president said .
he argued that the concept might be worth considering in the future , but only after the bloc 's members ramp up their economic and political cooperation .
" we should not put the cart before the horse , " sarkozy told reporters .
european leaders , or bullies ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france and germany are unwilling to unify european debts earlier in the week , merkel and germany had come under fire over this issue from luxembourg 's prime minister jean-claude juncker , who also heads the eurozone .
juncker said that creating taboo subjects without even considering the ideas of others was " a very un-european way of dealing with european issues . " as the two largest eu members , france and germany both have a sizeable share of the voting power within the bloc , and need relatively little support from other countries in order to secure a majority .
" without agreement from france and germany - the historic motors of european integration and two economies that make up half of the eurozone 's gross domestic product - nothing very important is possible , " professor henrik uterwedde from the franco-german institute in ludwigsburg told deutsche welle .
" so on the one hand , they must reach agreements , and help the union move forward , but at the same time , they do n't always do enough to treat the other members as equal partners and involve them in the decision-making processes . "
friday 's meeting was in preparation for the eu summit in brussels on december 16 and 17 , at which the bloc 's economic difficulties such as unemployment and national debt are bound to top the agenda .
troop deployment symbolic of closer cooperation while sarkozy and merkel discussed the harmonization of economic policies like labor and taxation laws , saying this would improve the eurozone 's coherence as an economic bloc , military leaders just across the border were preparing a more visible symbol of franco-german cooperation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the last german battalions in france had a very different mission the first german battalion to be stationed on french soil since the nazi occupation in world war ii officially took up their post near the border-city of strasbourg on friday .
german defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg and his french counterpart alain juppe attended a ceremony to mark the event .
" german soldiers are today welcome in france , " merkel said across the border in freiburg .
" for me , that has great symbolism , after all that germany was guilty of during the nazi era . "
the battalion , which will eventually consist of 600 soldiers , is part of the joint franco-german brigade .
" i was always surprised that the franco-german brigade only consisted of french soldiers in germany , " sarkozy said .
" we are two sovereign nations , two countries at peace , two countries that founded europe . "
franco-german genesis of eu sarkozy was referring to the forerunner of the modern-day european union , the european coal and steel community .
this trade-oriented union was established in 1953 as part of post-war efforts to negate the possibility of future conflict between france and germany by making them economically interdependent .
between 1870 and 1945 , the two neighbors fought three devastating wars .
" above all else , i think putting these german troops in france is a symbolic exercise , " franco-german expert , professor henrik uterwedde said .
" but sometimes symbolism is important . "
" that famous photo of -lsb- former german chancellor -rsb- helmut kohl and -lsb- then french president -rsb- francois mitterand standing hand-in-hand at the world war one commemorations in verdun in 1984 was pure symbolism , too - but it was a hugely significant image . "
bildunterschrift : sometimes symbolism can move mountains the alsace region where the german battalion us now stationed spans the franco-german border , and has changed hands several times over the centuries .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de retail -pipe- 10.12.2010 toys r ' scarce in german stores großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lego hopes to fufill every child 's wish this christmas toy makers and retailers in germany could n't be happier : christmas shoppers appear to have a near insatiable appetite for toys .
products from traditional european toymakers like lego and playmobil are in high demand . german parents typically spend oodles on their kids for christmas .
but with the buoyant economy this season , they 're spending even more .
so much more , in fact , that retailers are scrambling to stock hot products , like playmobil 's " robo-gangster " toy car with figures or lego 's " stars wars " spaceship .
some manufacturers now warn they may no longer be able to fulfill everyone 's christmas wish .
" we know that from now until christmas demand will be growing daily -lrb- so -rrb- we ca n't guarantee 100 percent that every product will be available right up to december 24 , " said dirk engehausen , the lego deutschland managing director , in an interview with the german news station n-tv .
other german and european manufacturers have a similar holiday message to convey : they have n't run out of any products yet , but supplies are depleting fast and finding the one or other popular product a few days before christmas could prove to be a real treasure hunt .
hurry while the supply lasts " none of our products have completely sold out in germany but some stores have run out of select products , " playmobil spokeswoman judith schweinitz told deutsche welle .
" if you 're really determined to find these , you will but you might have to look around . "
while manufacturers had projected stronger holiday sales , few if any thought they would so strong .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : children in germany can expect plenty of gifts this year " we anticipated more demand this christmas but we 're surprised nevertheless by how huge the demand has been , " said heinrich huentelsmann , a ravensburger spokesperson .
" our tiptoi product , for instance , is still available but is becoming hard to find . "
that toy is one of the few that the german maker of games , puzzle and toys manufacturers in china .
more than 85 percent of its products are made in europe .
" we can react very quickly to demand in europe because most of our production is here , " huentelsmann told deutsche welle .
" we do n't have long logistics paths . "
ravensburger expects it will be able to deliver all products right up to christmas , he said .
but the company is n't making any guarantees .
anticipating greater demand this year , lego delivered 10 percent more products to retailers in advance of the holiday shopping season , according to company spokeswoman helena seppelfricke .
but with some products , like the company 's classic fire department set and " technik " series , in huge demand , she admits the company could easily have delivered more .
" same procedure " most european traditional toymakers including lego , which is based in denmark with additional production sites in hungary , the czech republic and mexico , show their new products at trade events early in the year and begin talks with its buyer at the same time .
however , their ability to boost production to meet unexpected christmas demand generally decreases the closer the holiday shopping season approaches .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : playmobil toys are as popular as ever " it 's pretty much the same procedure every year , " said steffen kahnt , deputy director of germany 's federal association of toy retailer -lrb- bvs -rrb- .
" retailers need to decide how many products to order and manufacturers how many to make .
but no one really knows what the demand will be , especially for new products .
so you hope you make the right call . "
stockpiling products is n't a viable option in the competitive toy sector , according to kahnt .
both manufacturers and retailers , he says , strive to have only as much stock as they see necessary to better control their operating costs .
that said , the industry may want to up production for the 2011 gift season , if the past 24 months are any indication .
record-breaking sales " more products were actually sold last year than the year before , " kahnt said .
" that surprised us .
but no one really thought that sales this year would be so good . "
the german toy industry association -lrb- dvsi -rrb- expects sales to increase six percent this to 2.52 billion euros , compared to 2.38 billion euros the year .
if that mark is reached , the holiday sales will be a huge factor .
retailers generate more than 40 percent of their annual revenue during the holiday shopping season .
for sure , numbers like these will make manufacturers and retailers happy .
their big challenge now is to deliver enough toys to make kids – and their parents – just as happy .

each december in oslo , the arguments about whether the right recipient was chosen can be just as fierce as the threats these winners often face because of their work .
individuals who take a stand for peace and reconciliation in difficult conflict situations tend to have more enemies than friends .
by awarding the detained chinese professor of literature and democracy activist , liu xiabo , this year 's peace prize in oslo on october 8 , the nobel committee made an apt comment on the changing global balance of power .
this is how its decision should be interpreted .
a rising power like china needs to respect human and civil rights for the benefit of all mankind - that was the message from oslo .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : adrienne woltersdorf , the head of deutsche welle 's chinese service , is in oslo it is a slap in the chinese authorities ' face .
they have reacted accordingly and suppressed any domestic discourse about the so eagerly awaited - and now so despised - first chinese nobel laureate in history .
in addition , many activists , including liu 's wife liu xia , were preemptively intimidated or simply put under house arrest .
the regime 's harsh reactions show that the norwegian jury really touched a nerve in beijing .
but it is ridiculous that those loyal to the regime allege that the nobel committee intended to provocatively and maliciously challenge china 's rise .
the truth , in fact , is the precise opposite .
for quite some time , even veteran cadres of the mao era have been calling for more freedom of thought in china .
just recently , a group of influential former cadres reiterated this demand in a letter to the new party leadership .
a rapidly changing society , they argued , needs freedom of debate and opportunity for criticism in order to make wise decisions for the future .
such voices will be encouraged by the nobel peace prize , and only the chinese can decide how china should develop .
in this sense , the peace prize for liu xiaobo is also a unique chance for the badly divided and marginalized chinese democracy movement .
oslo could thus become the starting point for a new movement .
but before this happens , democracy activists inside and outside of china will have to prove that they can restrain their somtimes excessive egos , and dedicate themselves to the collective cause .
the powers-that-be in beijing will do everything they can to continue to marginalize the proponents of democracy .
they have given sufficient proof during the past weeks that they are perfectly capable of doing this .
but the chinese civil rights activists now have an internationally recognized leader .
they have a prudent manifesto - liu xiaobo 's " charter ' 08 " document - they have a sympathetic international audience , and they have the internet ; all that they 're missing is a single movement to unite them .

now , the project has four other eu member states on baord . on wednesday and thursday , the first meeting of the electric solar wind sail -lrb- esail -rrb- – newly sponsored by the european union - was held at the finnish metereological institute in helsinki .
earlier this year , the european union gave its blessing with 1.7 million euro -lrb- 2.25 million dollars -rrb- to construct laboratory prototypes of the esail project , whose ultimate goal is to launch the sail into space on a one kilogram estonian nanosatellite by the end of 2012 .
esail is now a joint operation with representatives from finland , estonia , germany , italy and sweden .
solar wind is a constant stream of charged particles that emanate from the sun .
a solar sail , which has been used previously , is made of a material that blocks those particles and then propel a spacecraft forward - in the same way a seafaring vessel uses wind to fill its sails .
however , this new finnish design , which was invented in 2006 by pekka janhunen , a researcher at the finnish meteorological institute , creates a " virtual " sail by forming an electric field with a radius of 100 meters from a small wire .
" the field forms an obstacle and so the solar wind particles are scattered in different directions , " he told deutsche welle .
" it 's more like an electric parachute than a sail .
it creates an enhanced friction between the solar wind flow and the wire . "
moving 50 kilometers per second if successful , janhunen added , then anything that this small wire was attached to , could theoretically travel approximately 50 kilometers per second , or " a factor of four or five faster than anything else ever constructed . "
using solar wind as a propulsion system in this way can only really be used between planets , so this type of design would be best for earth-mars , or other types of longer distance missions .
other astronomers are also excited about the prospect of this technology .
" in the other solar sail projects the energy comes from solar photons , the weightless ' light-particles ' .
this project gets the energy from the ions in the solar wind , " explained timo laitinen , an astronomy lecturer at the university of turku in finland , in an interview with deutsche welle .
" the technology is completely different , and to my understanding more feasible than the ' traditional ' solar sail technology . "

each december in oslo , the arguments about whether the right recipient was chosen can be just as fierce as the threats these winners often face because of their work .
individuals who take a stand for peace and reconciliation in difficult conflict situations tend to have more enemies than friends .
by awarding the detained chinese professor of literature and democracy activist , liu xiabo , this year 's peace prize in oslo on october 8 , the nobel committee made an apt comment on the changing global balance of power .
this is how its decision should be interpreted .
a rising power like china needs to respect human and civil rights for the benefit of all mankind - that was the message from oslo .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : adrienne woltersdorf , the head of deutsche welle 's chinese service , is in oslo it is a slap in the chinese authorities ' face .
they have reacted accordingly and suppressed any domestic discourse about the so eagerly awaited - and now so despised - first chinese nobel laureate in history .
in addition , many activists , including liu 's wife liu xia , were preemptively intimidated or simply put under house arrest .
the regime 's harsh reactions show that the norwegian jury really touched a nerve in beijing .
but it is ridiculous that those loyal to the regime allege that the nobel committee intended to provocatively and maliciously challenge china 's rise .
the truth , in fact , is the precise opposite .
for quite some time , even veteran cadres of the mao era have been calling for more freedom of thought in china .
just recently , a group of influential former cadres reiterated this demand in a letter to the new party leadership .
a rapidly changing society , they argued , needs freedom of debate and opportunity for criticism in order to make wise decisions for the future .
such voices will be encouraged by the nobel peace prize , and only the chinese can decide how china should develop .
in this sense , the peace prize for liu xiaobo is also a unique chance for the badly divided and marginalized chinese democracy movement .
oslo could thus become the starting point for a new movement .
but before this happens , democracy activists inside and outside of china will have to prove that they can restrain their somtimes excessive egos , and dedicate themselves to the collective cause .
the powers-that-be in beijing will do everything they can to continue to marginalize the proponents of democracy .
they have given sufficient proof during the past weeks that they are perfectly capable of doing this .
but the chinese civil rights activists now have an internationally recognized leader .
they have a prudent manifesto - liu xiaobo 's " charter ' 08 " document - they have a sympathetic international audience , and they have the internet ; all that they 're missing is a single movement to unite them .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de space -pipe- 10.12.2010 solar wind sail could be the fastest object ever built großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the esail project expects to launch before 2013 the european union is investing nearly two million euros in the esail project , which was initially conceived of by a finnish researcher .
now , the project has four other eu member states on baord . on wednesday and thursday , the first meeting of the electric solar wind sail -lrb- esail -rrb- – newly sponsored by the european union - was held at the finnish metereological institute in helsinki .
earlier this year , the european union gave its blessing with 1.7 million euro -lrb- 2.25 million dollars -rrb- to construct laboratory prototypes of the esail project , whose ultimate goal is to launch the sail into space on a one kilogram estonian nanosatellite by the end of 2012 .
esail is now a joint operation with representatives from finland , estonia , germany , italy and sweden .
solar wind is a constant stream of charged particles that emanate from the sun .
a solar sail , which has been used previously , is made of a material that blocks those particles and then propel a spacecraft forward - in the same way a seafaring vessel uses wind to fill its sails .
however , this new finnish design , which was invented in 2006 by pekka janhunen , a researcher at the finnish meteorological institute , creates a " virtual " sail by forming an electric field with a radius of 100 meters from a small wire .
" the field forms an obstacle and so the solar wind particles are scattered in different directions , " he told deutsche welle .
" it 's more like an electric parachute than a sail .
it creates an enhanced friction between the solar wind flow and the wire . "
moving 50 kilometers per second if successful , janhunen added , then anything that this small wire was attached to , could theoretically travel approximately 50 kilometers per second , or " a factor of four or five faster than anything else ever constructed . "
using solar wind as a propulsion system in this way can only really be used between planets , so this type of design would be best for earth-mars , or other types of longer distance missions .
other astronomers are also excited about the prospect of this technology .
" in the other solar sail projects the energy comes from solar photons , the weightless ' light-particles ' .
this project gets the energy from the ions in the solar wind , " explained timo laitinen , an astronomy lecturer at the university of turku in finland , in an interview with deutsche welle .
" the technology is completely different , and to my understanding more feasible than the ' traditional ' solar sail technology . "

but guests gathered around an empty chair to congratulate the laureate , who was not represented at the ceremony . the nobel peace prize committee has concluded its award ceremony in oslo with the prizewinner and guest of honor , imprisoned chinese dissident liu xiaobo , absent .
the prize was meant to " point out the relationship between human rights , democracy and peace " , nobel peace prize committee chairman thorbjoern jagland said in his opening comments .
he called liu a symbol of the " non-violent struggle for such -lsb- human -rsb- rights in china " , and compared him with nelson mandela .
he went on to say that liu had done nothing but exercise his civil rights , and called on china to release him .
in his absence , norwegian actress liv ullmann read a final statement titled " i have no enemies " released by liu 's supporters after his sentencing a year ago .
in it , liu said " there is no force that can put an end to the human quest for freedom , and china will in the end become a nation ruled by law , where human rights reign supreme . "
he also spoke of his wife , liu xia , who is now under house arrest in beijing , saying her love " is the sunlight that leaps over high walls and penetrates the iron bars of my prison window . "
international solidarity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : liu xiaobo is considered a criminal by the chinese authorities throughout friday , western governments paid tribute to liu 's contribution to democracy and human rights , calling on china to release the dissident from prison .
in berlin , german human rights commissioner markus loening praised liu 's courageous stand for human rights .
" the participation of germany as well as all eu partners represented in oslo and many other countries in the ceremony in oslo is therefore a simple sign of respect for liu xiaobo and for all who work to promote human rights and democracy without resorting to violence , " a statement from loening on the german foreign ministry website said .
united states president barack obama meanwhile hailed liu as a beacon of freedom : " the values he espouses are universal , his struggle is peaceful , and he should be released as soon as possible , " obama said .
event overshadowed the event in the norwegian capital was overshadowed not only by liu 's absence , but also by china 's wider anger at his selection .
several nations decided to boycott the ceremony at beijing 's request after the chinese government condemned the decision to award the prize to the democracy activist .
almost a third of the 50 countries invited to the event stayed away , including russia , pakistan and saudi arabia .
many of those not attending are thought to have bowed to chinese pressure .
serbia , which was heavily criticized by the european union for its initial decision not to attend , decided at the last minute to send an ombudsman after all .
chinese media condemn choice bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an empty chair represented liu at the ceremony official chinese media have slammed the choice of liu as nobel peace prize laureate , calling it an attempt to impose foreign values on china .
liu has been a critic of the chinese government since the tiananmen square massacre of 1989 .
liu took a prominent part in the protests there and was sentenced to two years in prison .
he was jailed last december for 11 years on subversion charges after he co-authored a document called charter 08 , which calls for political reform in china .
authorities have also cracked down on activists in the run-up to the ceremony and have prevented liu 's family and friends from attending .
empty chair the nobel committee chose to represent liu with an empty chair during the ceremony , calling this a symbol of the chinese policy to isolate and repress dissidents .
in a moving gesture , jagland placed the nobel diploma on the vacant seat .
it is the first time that a laureate under detention has not been formally represented since 1935 , when nazi germany stopped the pacifist carl von ossietzky from attending .
it is also the first time since then that the prize money of 1.13 million euros -lrb- $ 1.5 million -rrb- will not be handed out .

according a report published thursday in the british medical journal -lrb- bmj -rrb- , the tiny pencils have proved very useful when marking bones during surgery .
the authors of the report , karen eley from the nuffield department of surgical sciences at the university of oxford , and stephen watt-smith from the department of maxillofacial surgery at the john radcliffe hospital in oxford , say they were surprised when they were handed an ikea pencil in the middle of an operation .
" as popular as these little pencils are , we were still surprised to be handed one halfway through a surgical case , " they wrote in the report .
" the use of a pencil to mark osteotomy cuts in craniofacial and maxillofacial surgery is well established , proving superior to methylene .

we just thought it was funny that we were in the middle of surgery and asked for a pencil and were handed an ikea one . "
" it 's just like when a carpenter uses a pencil to mark a piece of wood to saw , " she added .

unfortunately , repeated sterilization means that some of the pencils split but even this problem has apparently been overcome by wrapping silicon cuffs around the pencil .

what is remarkable about this latest report is how clearly its authors , most of whom are economists , advocate stronger government engagement in social policies - even in the low-income countries of sub-saharan africa .
basic social protection schemes , the authors suggest , could contribute to growth and poverty reduction , and assist developing countries in reaching the millennium development goals .
the report draws on recent research that highlights the importance of social protection to the economic and political development of countries .
people without access to a social safety net risk falling -lrb- even deeper -rrb- into poverty when faced with a shock like illness or a bad harvest .
they may then have to turn to savings , sell livestock or other assets or send their children to work rather than school in order to finance their daily needs .
in this way , they lose means of livelihoods that might otherwise help them to establish at least a modest existence on their own .
more seriously , households without social protection tend to shy away from investing savings at the outset , instead hoarding income to stay liquid and to prepare for a possible loss of future income or unexpected expenditures .
empirical studies suggest that families , and especially those who work in the informal sector , are more likely to invest when they have access to basic social protection schemes . such investment promotes economic growth precisely where it is most likely to help reduce poverty .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : where families have no safety net , they may be forced to sell income-producing assets like cattle in hard times finally , social protection schemes contribute to political stability .
by reducing poverty and economic insecurity , they lower the chances that a people will resort to violence to achieve political aims .
above all , though , such schemes show citizens that the state feels responsible and cares for them .
many studies point out that , where public social protection schemes exist , citizens identify more closely with the state and show a willingness to fulfill their obligations to the community .
so basic social protection helps not only to reduce poverty but also acts as insurance for business activities and the material basis of a social contract accepted by every citizen .
many will ask how low-income countries can be expected to finance social protection schemes - and rightly so .
it is rarely the case that the majority of a population is covered by social protection systems that the members themselves finance through contributions - social and private insurance schemes and community-based mutual insurance associations , for instance .
this is because , in low-income countries especially , contributions to such schemes are too high for many people .
at the same time , the idea of social transfer schemes financed by the state from tax revenues is often rejected on the grounds that governments in low-income countries do not enjoy wide enough budget margins to be able to fund such schemes .
yet this year 's european report on development -lrb- erd -rrb- reflects a turning point in the academic debate .
even low-income countries that can not afford comprehensive social protection for all their citizens can find satisfactory solutions for particularly vulnerable groups .
for example lesotho , among other african countries , has created a tax-financed system that grants a modest flat pension to everybody over a certain age .
although lesotho is a poor country , the program costs less than two percent of gross national income , and in many households it benefits not only the elderly but also their student grandchildren who want to lay better foundations for their later working lives .
similarly , ethiopia has developed a program that provides poor families jobs in rural infrastructure construction .
the international labor organization estimates that the total cost of establishing both of these programs as well as an unconditional cash transfer program for orphans would not exceed six percent of national income in any sub-saharan african country .
unfortunately , the 2010 erd does not explain how and by whom social protection is to be organized where the state is unwilling or unable to do so .
in such cases , social protection can be provided only by non-governmental actors through , for example , micro-insurance schemes .
the erd restricts the definition of social protection to action conducted by the state , and so does not consider this course of action .
where efficient government does not exist , self-help in the shape of , say , mutual insurance continues to be the only way out .
this is now true of a quarter to a half of all countries in sub-saharan africa , as noted in last year 's erd .

dutch police have arrested a teenager accused of taking part in the attacks . dutch authorities on friday said police in the netherlands arrested a 16-year-old who has admitted to attacking websites belonging to wikileaks opponents .
a spokesman for the national prosecutor 's office said the teenager had " admitted launching attacks on visa and mastercard sites . "
a statement said he was probably " part of a larger group of hackers . "
hackers unite hackers from around the world have stepped up cyber attacks following the arrest of wikileaks boss julian assange .
assange is wanted by sweden in connection with sexual misconduct charges the online attacks have mainly targeted companies that have deprived wikileaks of their services , including the websites of the online payment service paypal , and the credit card giants visa and mastercard , which had stopped processing donations for wikileaks .
also targeted were amazon.com , which had banished wikileaks from using its rented servers , a swiss bank and the website of the swedish prosecutor who had issued an arrest warrant for assange on charges of sexual misconduct .
the group of hackers , which calls itself " anonymous , " says it wants to keep the internet open and free .
wikileaks has distanced itself from the cyber attacks , but said they reflected public opinion .
in a statement , the organization said it had no contact with anonymous and had not received prior notice of any of the group 's actions .
assange : " charges fabricated " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : julian assange says he is innocent of the charges assange is currently in a british jail after handing himself in to police on tuesday . police have moved the wikileaks ' chief from the main part of wandsworth prison to an isolation unit , his lawyer said friday . " the prison authorities are doing it for his own safety , presumably , " jennifer robinson , one of assange 's legal team told the afp news agency . assange has been refused the use of his own laptop but will be given a prison computer with limited internet access , the guardian newspaper reported friday .
assange says the swedish sexual misconduct charges are a fabrication intended to stop his organization from continuing to publish confidential documents .
wikileaks is facing international condemnation for its publication of confidential material , often concerning diplomatic relations between countries .
some of the documents have caused embarrassment to the nations concerned .
assange is due to appear in a london court for a second time on tuesday , when prosecutors want to question him about allegations of rape and sexual molestation made by two women .

in its one-hundred-year history , this is the first time that the prize is awarded to a chinese citizen .
yet , the laureate , his family members , and even close friends are incarcerated in their own country .
no one can come to receive the award . the scottish pen has produced a " liu xiaobo chair " , which has been sent over to oslo .
now it stands in the city hall .
this empty chair is a reminder that its owner , who should enjoy the highest international honor today , is absent from the ceremony , banquet and concert , which are devoted to him . the host country 's king , the queen , european royal families , foreign ambassadors and representatives , as well as guests from overseas gather in the bright hall decorated with flowers and make a toast to xiaobo .
but many of us are still melancholy , and we ask , where is liu xiaobo and his beloved liu xia ?
let us travel through time and space and visit liu xia first . we are in haidian district , beijing , yuyuantan south road number 9 .
from a distance one can see the white building where the lius live .
the police cars are parked in front of the house ; several policemen parade around .
journalists from far and near are cordoned off some hundred meters away .
no one is allowed to get into the forbidden zone . thin , with a shaven head -lrb- or short-cropped hair -rrb- , liu xia is sitting alone in the empty home .
rinse the ashtray the coffee table wiped take the glass cups boil two cups of longjing or oolong aside the table you sit looking at the cup in front of the empty seat stare at the cup , listen is there the move of key in the hole ...
the cup in the hand , you take a sip lifted the cup to the sun cup and your fingers penetrated by the sun palm was stained by the transparent green delicate a hint of panic is there too the cup on the opposite site you know will be empty for a long time it takes long till the man opens your door -lrb- from liu ’ s poem " sunshine and cups - to my little finger , who drinks tea every day " -rrb- liu xia may wait for a long time , maybe another ten years .
now we visit xiaobo in jinzhou prison in the small chinese town nanshan in liaoning province .
entering the gate , we see several scattered buildings .
surprisingly , we see a huge office wall on which is written boldly ' 1984 ' .
a few months ago , liu xia , accompanied by the stainless steel mouse liu di , wang jinbo , mo zhixu and wang zhongxia , came here for a visit .
they were amazed at orwell ’ s rebirth in a chinese prison . snickering , they took pictures in front of the " 1984 wall " .
several officers rushed to them and took them into custody .
separately , they were interrogated for hours . we enter xiaobo ’ s cell now .
he shares with five other prisoners a 3 by 4 meter space .
his head is bald , shaved like an ordinary criminal .
his body is swollen by the padded jacket and trousers .
scarf , hat and gloves are a must in the cell because the concrete floor of the prison is cold .
the small window beneath the high ceiling is always open .
in winter , the indoor temperature is higher than outdoors ; it is a few degrees above zero .
the odor of the open toilet bucket in the corner is neutralized by the cold air , but one can not ignore the stench of the daily waste of several men .
the smell not only fills the room , it penetrates through clothes , and into the pores of the skin . this is the first winter that xiaobo spends in a prison in northern china .
he will have to adjust himself to the circumstances .
he does not know whether he will have frostbite .
to sit and lie on the concrete floors all year round may cause neck and spine pain and lead to kidney problems .
his stomach disease has given him a hard time since his imprisonment .
xiaobo has exited his cell today , but he does not want to show it to others otherwise his cell-mates might become cynical and angry .
sitting there , his thoughts fly to oslo .
he has had constant dreams about it .
who will be there at the ceremony ?
who will receive the prize for me ?
it could not be liu xia .
she has not sent any sign of life for a while .
my acceptance speech is long written in my head , but who can read it out aloud for me ?
does the king wear a majestic tuxedo , and the queen her crown at the banquet ?
will the distinguished guests think of the dead in tiananmen square and the tiananmen mothers and make a toast ?
sitting in the dungeon , xiaobo does not know that the announcement of his award induced a tsunami in zhongnanhai , and the rulers had a mild concussion , followed by delusions : they believe that their enemies are all over the world , so the grip on the naughty writers and the guy who held the crab dinner party must be tightened .
they must not go outside the country , otherwise they could endanger national security .
liu xiaobo ’ s dinner on december 10 , 2010 may look like this : boiled vegetables with sand , and a few pieces of fat meat as a special treat .
he might have an extra piece of steamed bread , and his rice bowl could also be refilled today .
in short , it is a privileged meal that will long be remembered , because it is a meal that will leave the stomach truly filled .
after all , he is the first chinese to win the nobel peace prize .

the capital is also easily the arty-fartiest place in the country .
coincidence ?
dw 's ben knight does n't think so . most of my friends are losers .
i mean that in a good way , obviously .
they are all talented and creative and sometimes even a bit inspired , but they are also , each and every last one of them , work-shy fops .
obviously i am as well : it takes one to know one , as we used to say in primary school .
there 's a great sequence in the movie " trainspotting " where junkie hero renton explains the complex art of staying on the dole .
it entails reverse-psychology tricks like going to a job interview and appearing psychotically eager to work in a leisure center .
the film shows that such efforts require invention , nerve , subtlety , selfishness , discipline and some drugs - the exact elements of a successful artistic career .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an artist at work there is probably no clearer illustration of one of the deeper truths of life in a western european social democracy : the attributes of an artist are exactly the same as the ones you need to successfully maintain your unemployment .
this is heightened in berlin , where it takes the sacrifice of an artist to truly perfect the art of not earning your living .
creative industries there are , they say , some broad similarities between my hometown , manchester , and berlin .
both were throbbing industrial powerhouses in the 19th century , lost their luster and declined in the late 20th century , only to become trendy pop cultural centers in the last 20 years - manchester not so much anymore , but you get the general idea .
both cities have also become famous for hanging their new economic hopes on the " creative industries . "
this very spongy term refers to anything from actor to fashion designer , to independent shopkeeper , to web designer , and includes all the attendant skill sets , cameramen , lighting technicians , office managers etc .
the point is you do n't make anything - you delight , you entertain , you disseminate knowledge and information , or you sing cabaret songs naked in a disused warehouse in front of an audience of twelve .
by capitalizing on the cache and the large student population , the two cities deliberately encouraged a whole class of freelance migrants engaged in some kind of creative endeavor in an attempt to re-invent the city 's economy .
but the similarity with manchester ends when it comes to the social security system .
in berlin , many creative types live - at least partially - on the standard long-term unemployment benefit called hartz iv .
it does n't help the job statistics , but it does mean that the city 's economy is run , to a certain extent , by the welfare state .
social security for the middle class bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unemployment center : the lifeblood of a creative economy when it comes to dealing with the job center to claim your benefits , being an artist is a double-edged sword .
most artists do not earn enough to live from their art , so they are understandably unwilling to mention the meager side earnings their talents bring .
they live double lives : naked dadaist performance artists at night , out-of-work it specialists by day .
but others have a little more nerve , and tell their case manager they are " professional " artists .
if they have a degree as well -lrb- a degree puts you in a different , more exclusive waiting room -rrb- they get special dispensation from the endless round of pointless job applications and interviews that most hartz iv recipients are forced to take .
instead , professional unemployed artists are allowed to count applications for grants and scholarships as their applications , and can get the state to pay for acting lessons .
so there 's a tip , if the hard times are getting to you .
ben knight does n't really think his friends are losers .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de afghanistan -pipe- 10.12.2010 afghan women still oppressed and abused , un report says großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : afghan girls are often given away to settle disputes a new report published by the united nations assistance mission in afghanistan -lrb- unama -rrb- has found that the lives of afghan women have improved little since the fall of the taliban .
but the west seems unmoved . despite changes in afghan law and a constitution designed to protect women 's rights , violence and abuse of women continue to be a serious problem in the country , and the government is not doing enough to prevent it .
that is the conclusion of a new report published by the united nations assistance mission in afghanistan -lrb- unama -rrb- .
the most common forms of abuse include forced and child marriage , honor killings and giving away girls to settle disputes under the tradition of baad .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the report says violence against afghan women is still widespread " the report describes the prevalence of these practices , " georgette gagnon , unama 's director of human rights , said at a press conference .
" it looks at the consequences these practices have on the lives of afghan women and girls and the community as a whole and it also looks at the efforts of the afghan government to address violence against women . "
one of these efforts , the 2009 law of elimination of violence against women -lrb- evaw -rrb- , came under particular scrutiny .
the law , which gagnon described as " a huge gain of legal protection of women 's rights , " criminalizes buying and selling women for marriage , forcing a woman to marry without her consent , forcing girls to marry when they are underage , and forcing girls and women to commit self-immolation - when they set themselves on fire .
ignorance and lack of enforcement but according to the report , the new law is not being enforced in many parts of the country , and is often not even known .
bele grau , program manager for afghanistan at the women 's rights organisation medica mondiale agreed with this assessment .
" on the theoretical and legal level the situation is getting better – but in practice it is often not implemented , " she told deutsche welle .
" this law has been in force for a year , but a lot of judges do n't even know it , and if they do , they do n't enforce it . "
the un women 's organization unifem says that around 87 percent of afghan women suffer from domestic violence , and that half of all girls are married under the age of 15 .
on top of this , grau says that many of the rights that women have won are repealed by new laws .
she cites one recent regulation that bans women who have run away from an abusive home from seeking refuge with strangers .
this in practice leaves many women only the unrealistic option of going to relatives .
many women are also still imprisoned for running away , in contravention of the evaw law .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : westerwelle suggested democracy can not be imposed on afghanistan the report found that much of the abuse is founded in afghan tradition .
" one very harmful practice that we heard a lot about is baad , which is the giving away of girls to settle disputes , " said gagnon .
" many of the women told us that instead of a murderer being punished , an innocent girl is punished and she has to spend all her life in slavery and is subjected to cruel violence .
sometimes she is forced to sleep with the animals in the barn . "
western indifference the report sets out a number of recommendations for the afghan government to deal with the problem , but grau says that the west has an obligation to apply pressure in order to protect women 's rights – not least because this is often used to add legitimacy to the war in afghanistan .
" we 've noticed this in most of the western governments , " she said .
" for the past year , all the talk is about withdrawal of troops , and negotiations with the taliban etc . , and that afghans have to work out for themselves how much democracy or women 's rights they want .
these are now all internal afghan issues that are n't discussed or even noticed anymore .
the german government is no exception to this . "
she believes that pressure could be exhorted through the financial aid the west gives to the afghan government .
" the western governments still give afghanistan a lot of development money , " she said .
" and when they make conditions for giving this money , we think they should make them for human rights and women 's rights , not just for taking over security duties . "
" the issue of women 's rights was also one of the justifications for the war itself , but that is suddenly disappearing from the agenda , " she added .
" earlier this year , -lrb- german foreign minister guido -rrb- westerwelle said , ' well , afghanistan is not switzerland , ' and with that everything is swept from the table . "

the decision marks a profound change for germany , where compulsory service was re-introduced 50 years ago . senior officials in germany 's coalition government have agreed to suspend military conscription as of july 1 , 2011 .
defense minister karl theodor zu guttenberg 's proposal was accepted during closed-door talks in berlin on thursday evening .
the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- of chancellor angela merkel and its bavarian sister party the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- have both in principle approved abolishing the draft at party conferences in the past six weeks .
their other coalition partner , the pro-business free democrats , had included stopping conscription in their manifesto during last year 's general election .
sources taking part in the meeting said the next step would be for merkel 's cabinet to approve a draft bill that could be put to parliament ; this is expected to happen on december 15 .
troop reduction bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : defense minister guttenberg says the change will save money guttenberg 's plan would also see troop numbers reduced the current level of 250,000 soldiers to 185,000 .
of these , 170,000 would be professional soldiers , with volunteers making up the remainder .
with his reform , guttenberg hopes to save up to 8.3 billion euros .
however , the suspension of conscription could create some new problems ; for instance , the alternative community service offered to those who refuse military service would also be dropped .
social and welfare institutions fear that this could lead to a lack of personnel , as in the past they have relied heavily on youngsters who want to avoid military service .
the suspension also means that student numbers are likely to climb , posing problems for universities .
compulsory military service in germany lasts for six months and only applies to young men .
women are allowed to join the german army , the bundeswehr , either as professionals or volunteers , but are not obliged to do so .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de afghanistan -pipe- 10.12.2010 afghan women still oppressed and abused , un report says großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : afghan girls are often given away to settle disputes a new report published by the united nations assistance mission in afghanistan -lrb- unama -rrb- has found that the lives of afghan women have improved little since the fall of the taliban .
but the west seems unmoved . despite changes in afghan law and a constitution designed to protect women 's rights , violence and abuse of women continue to be a serious problem in the country , and the government is not doing enough to prevent it .
that is the conclusion of a new report published by the united nations assistance mission in afghanistan -lrb- unama -rrb- .
the most common forms of abuse include forced and child marriage , honor killings and giving away girls to settle disputes under the tradition of baad .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the report says violence against afghan women is still widespread " the report describes the prevalence of these practices , " georgette gagnon , unama 's director of human rights , said at a press conference .
" it looks at the consequences these practices have on the lives of afghan women and girls and the community as a whole and it also looks at the efforts of the afghan government to address violence against women . "
one of these efforts , the 2009 law of elimination of violence against women -lrb- evaw -rrb- , came under particular scrutiny .
the law , which gagnon described as " a huge gain of legal protection of women 's rights , " criminalizes buying and selling women for marriage , forcing a woman to marry without her consent , forcing girls to marry when they are underage , and forcing girls and women to commit self-immolation - when they set themselves on fire .
ignorance and lack of enforcement but according to the report , the new law is not being enforced in many parts of the country , and is often not even known .
bele grau , program manager for afghanistan at the women 's rights organisation medica mondiale agreed with this assessment .
" on the theoretical and legal level the situation is getting better – but in practice it is often not implemented , " she told deutsche welle .
" this law has been in force for a year , but a lot of judges do n't even know it , and if they do , they do n't enforce it . "
the un women 's organization unifem says that around 87 percent of afghan women suffer from domestic violence , and that half of all girls are married under the age of 15 .
on top of this , grau says that many of the rights that women have won are repealed by new laws .
she cites one recent regulation that bans women who have run away from an abusive home from seeking refuge with strangers .
this in practice leaves many women only the unrealistic option of going to relatives .
many women are also still imprisoned for running away , in contravention of the evaw law .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : westerwelle suggested democracy can not be imposed on afghanistan the report found that much of the abuse is founded in afghan tradition .
" one very harmful practice that we heard a lot about is baad , which is the giving away of girls to settle disputes , " said gagnon .
" many of the women told us that instead of a murderer being punished , an innocent girl is punished and she has to spend all her life in slavery and is subjected to cruel violence .
sometimes she is forced to sleep with the animals in the barn . "
western indifference the report sets out a number of recommendations for the afghan government to deal with the problem , but grau says that the west has an obligation to apply pressure in order to protect women 's rights – not least because this is often used to add legitimacy to the war in afghanistan .
" we 've noticed this in most of the western governments , " she said .
" for the past year , all the talk is about withdrawal of troops , and negotiations with the taliban etc . , and that afghans have to work out for themselves how much democracy or women 's rights they want .
these are now all internal afghan issues that are n't discussed or even noticed anymore .
the german government is no exception to this . "
she believes that pressure could be exhorted through the financial aid the west gives to the afghan government .
" the western governments still give afghanistan a lot of development money , " she said .
" and when they make conditions for giving this money , we think they should make them for human rights and women 's rights , not just for taking over security duties . "
" the issue of women 's rights was also one of the justifications for the war itself , but that is suddenly disappearing from the agenda , " she added .
" earlier this year , -lrb- german foreign minister guido -rrb- westerwelle said , ' well , afghanistan is not switzerland , ' and with that everything is swept from the table . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de climate -pipe- 10.12.2010 shadow of kyoto looms over final day of climate talks großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : limiting global temperature increases to 2 degrees is a key point at the talks a new treaty to combat climate change is not going to emerge in cancun , but the conference could see breakthroughs on forestry and finance , provided a dispute over kyoto does n't derail the last day of talks . accusations of " brinkmanship " are dominating climate talks as they enter their final day in cancun , mexico .
although no over-arching treaty to tackle climate change is up for grabs this year , struggles over principles risk progress on smaller achievements in the final hours of negotiations . japan 's hard line on the kyoto protocol remains the main concern for parties trying to bridge differences on a range of issues , including forestry protection , climate finance and accounting methodologies .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the japanese delegation has come in for criticism japan has refused to climb down from its refusal to consider extending kyoto when its first commitment period expires in 2012 , despite openings for compromises throughout the talks .
" we know that european union countries insist on a second commitment period , but we think this is n't a fair way of dealing with emissions globally , " said japanese negotiator akira yamada on thursday evening , describing this dispute as " ongoing " and " difficult . "
kyoto binds 37 wealthy nations to cut their greenhouse gas emissions , but japan does not want to be part of an agreement that does n't include binding rules for the world ’ s top two emitters , china and the us .
developing countries see kyoto as crucial for holding the industrialized world to account for a problem that is mostly of its making .
it seemed that a crisis over kyoto might be avoided earlier in the conference , following conciliatory language from china and india , but by the end of the week environmental groups were naming japan as the " worst " participant at the talks .
" they should show more flexibility and not pick a fight where it is not necessary , " said david turnbull , executive director of the climate action network , an umbrella group of environmental organizations .
anger at brazil yet harsh criticism has also been leveled at certain developing countries , among them brazil , amid fears that even lesser gains may slip through negotiators ' fingers in cancun .
brazil has been widely applauded for how it is tackling the destruction of the amazon .
indeed , last week it announced that its rate of deforestation dropped 14 percent over a 12-month period in 2010 , to reach its lowest level on record .
yet environmental groups accused brazil on thursday of rolling back gains in discussions on forestry protection measures because of its resistance to a system with international checks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : global deforestation rates have slowed over the last 10 years don lehr , a spokesperson for the eco-systems climate alliance , described talks on forestry on thursday as deadlocked .
" if we are not going to break down the sovereignty issues , we ’ ll never deal with climate change , " said rosalind reeve of global witness , an organisation that tracks resource exploitation , in reference to brazil 's position .

although no over-arching treaty to tackle climate change is up for grabs this year , struggles over principles risk progress on smaller achievements in the final hours of negotiations . japan 's hard line on the kyoto protocol remains the main concern for parties trying to bridge differences on a range of issues , including forestry protection , climate finance and accounting methodologies .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the japanese delegation has come in for criticism japan has refused to climb down from its refusal to consider extending kyoto when its first commitment period expires in 2012 , despite openings for compromises throughout the talks .
" we know that european union countries insist on a second commitment period , but we think this is n't a fair way of dealing with emissions globally , " said japanese negotiator akira yamada on thursday evening , describing this dispute as " ongoing " and " difficult . "
kyoto binds 37 wealthy nations to cut their greenhouse gas emissions , but japan does not want to be part of an agreement that does n't include binding rules for the world ’ s top two emitters , china and the us .
developing countries see kyoto as crucial for holding the industrialized world to account for a problem that is mostly of its making .
it seemed that a crisis over kyoto might be avoided earlier in the conference , following conciliatory language from china and india , but by the end of the week environmental groups were naming japan as the " worst " participant at the talks .
" they should show more flexibility and not pick a fight where it is not necessary , " said david turnbull , executive director of the climate action network , an umbrella group of environmental organizations .
anger at brazil yet harsh criticism has also been leveled at certain developing countries , among them brazil , amid fears that even lesser gains may slip through negotiators ' fingers in cancun .
brazil has been widely applauded for how it is tackling the destruction of the amazon .
indeed , last week it announced that its rate of deforestation dropped 14 percent over a 12-month period in 2010 , to reach its lowest level on record .
yet environmental groups accused brazil on thursday of rolling back gains in discussions on forestry protection measures because of its resistance to a system with international checks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : global deforestation rates have slowed over the last 10 years don lehr , a spokesperson for the eco-systems climate alliance , described talks on forestry on thursday as deadlocked .
" if we are not going to break down the sovereignty issues , we ’ ll never deal with climate change , " said rosalind reeve of global witness , an organisation that tracks resource exploitation , in reference to brazil 's position .
" you need a monitoring system that works nationally and internationally to build integrity .
there ’ s two sides to this equation ; there ’ s carbon and there ’ s safeguards . "
brazil has long been wary of efforts to secure international monitoring commitments in a global system to curb deforestation which would reward conservation in poor countries . despite the concerns of countries like brazil and papua new guinea , many have hoped to see cancun at least achieve an agreement on the scheme known as redd - reducing emissions from deforestation and degradation .

now , just third from bottom , stuttgart has decided to dump its coach , jens keller . ivorian didier ya konan scored twice to give hanover a 2-1 win over stuttgart on friday , taking his team to second place in the bundesliga ahead of the weekend 's main soccer action .
the loss was also the final straw for stuttgart 's management , which announced on saturday that it had fired coach jens keller .
after a cautious start by both sides , ya konan had the first major chance of the match in the 20th minute , with a shot that was stopped by stuttgart keeper sven ulreich .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while stuttgart battled back , they were unable to gain a much-needed point the breakthrough came on 35 minutes , after stuttgart left back arthur boka got a defensive foot to a ball from hanover 's lars stindl - only to divert it to ya konan .
the striker took advantage and passed the ball through ulreich 's legs to take his tally for the season to eight .
stuttgart responded positively , pressing throughout the game , and - with just a quarter of an hour to go - managed to equalize as georg niedermeier jumped to head a timo gebhart free kick into the far corner .
the comeback was short-lived .
after another attempt on the hanover goal , this time from philip degen , hanover swiftly counter-attacked .
ya konan latched onto a high ball from christian schulz to score through ulreich 's legs for a second time .
' an exceptional start ' the win means that hanover have already recorded one more victory than in the whole of last season .
" it is exceptional what we have achieved in the first half of the season , " said hanover technical director joerg schmadtke .
stuttgart is now without a win in its last five games and is third from the bottom with only 12 points from 16 games .
this dreary realization was enough for the team to pull the plug on jen keller 's 59-day rein as head coach .
the hottest prospect to replace him is bruno labaddia , who coached hamburg until the end of april .

meanwhile , russia 's prime minister accuses the us of hypocrisy over the affair . the un commissioner for human rights navi pillay expressed dismay over the withdrawal of financial and internet services to the controversial wikileaks website .
pillay said that measures taken by companies - which wikileaks ' supporters claim are due to pressure from foreign governments - could represent an infringement of the right to freedom of expression . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pillay said courts should decide on the balance between security and freedom " i 'm concerned about reports of pressure exerted on private companies , including banks , credit card companies , and internet service providers to close down credit lines for donations to wikileaks as well as to stop hosting the website or its mother sites , " navi pillay told a news conference on thursday .
" they could be interpreted as an attempt to censor the publication of information , thus potentially violating wikileaks ' right to freedom of expression . "
payments suspended , account closed wikileaks angered the us and other governments with the release in november of 250,000 confidential diplomatic cables , with washington saying the information could put american lives in danger .
credit card firms mastercard and visa later suspended payments made to wikileaks , while the swiss post office shut down a bank account opened by wikileaks founder julian assange .
pillay said the case " raises complex human rights questions about balancing freedom of information and the need to protect national security or public order . "
" if wikileaks has committed any recognizable illegal acts then this should be handled through the legal system and not through pressure and intimidation including on third parties , " said pillay a former un war crimes judge .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : assange was arrested in london , and awaits a hearing pillay noted that such questions were not related to charges against assange for crimes including rape in sweden .
supporters of assange claim that the charges against him have been manufactured as part of a bid to halt the website 's activities , along with the pressure on firms to cut wikileaks ' income stream .
' pot calls kettle black , ' putin russian prime minister vladimir putin said that assange 's arrest in britain , for extradition , was " undemocratic " and accused the us of " hypocrisy " for attacking russia 's record on democracy .
" if we are talking about democracy , it should be complete .

is that democracy ?

" i want to send the ball back to our american colleagues . "
assange is currently in custody in britain awaiting a hearing over his extradition after a warrant was issued by sweden .
meanwhile , wikileaks supporters on thursday vowed to step up cyber-attacks on companies that have taken action against wikileaks .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de finance -pipe- 10.12.2010 cancun divided over how to pay for consequences of climate change großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how can cancun help poorer nations face climate change ?
the goal of a legally binding treaty to reduce pollution has fallen by the wayside , so efforts in cancun have been focusing on a fund to help channel hundreds of billions of dollars in aid towards poor countries . enshrined in the copenhagen accord was the pledge to raise billions of dollars of climate aid .
the headline figures were impressive : 100 billion dollars -lrb- 76 billion euro -rrb- a year as of 2020 , and at least seven billion euros from the eu over the next few years to get the ball rolling .
yet the nitty gritty details of how that money should be managed and distributed were left for cancun . but negotiations on the fund are being stalled because the us want to tie the creation of the fund to other issues , in particular they want big developing emitting countries , particularly china to be more transparent about the action they are taking to mitigate the effects of climate change . " that essentially puts a handbrake on how far we can go in creating a fund , " steve herz , a climate policy advisor at greenpeace told deutsche welle .
" it risks a watered down decision , " he added . a new draft proposal has spelled out the technicalities for setting up a global climate fund .
it will help poor nations create a mechanism to share clean technologies , protect tropical forests and help the poor adapt to impacts ranging from storms to rising sea levels . in a revision , the text explicitly calls for a role for women in the fight against climate change . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : environmentalists want the money to help poor nations adapt to climate change " at last women , who are among the most affected by climate change , are not being ignored , " said executive director of oxfam jeremy hobbs at a press conference . but some environmentalists criticized the draft for removing a reference to ensuring that 50 percent of assistance goes toward helping people adapt to climate change . " the current draft sees too many important decisions pushed down the road , " hobbs said . the omission would allow wealthy nations to meet pledges through other means , such as offering technical know-how to help curb emissions of greenhouse gases blamed for global warming . role of the world bank negotiators said they saw steady progress in setting up the architecture of a future climate fund .
a remaining sticking point is whether to include a role for international bodies , such as the world bank , in administering aid . donor countries want to have guarantees that the money is actually spent on global climate protection .
the developing countries receiving the funds want freedom of choice on their national measures and no preconditions , for example , on policy priorities . " there 's a tug of war going on right now .
the dispute is about the trustee role , " said steve herz . donor countries want the world bank to play a role as trustee , which - according to herz - " could mean that they just cut cheques , but it could also mean a broader role in implementing and conceiving projects " . negotiators are currently trying to agree on the scope of the trustee role . as the globe 's largest poverty-fighting institution , with 65 years of experience in development finance , the world bank says it can play a helpful role . " our specialty is essentially delivering results at scale .
the world has lots of pilots and lots of wonderful experiments going on a small scale and those are really good .
but what the world really needs now is scale .
i think we can play a helpful role in bringing together the overall packages , " andrew steer , special envoy for climate change at the world bank , told deutsche welle . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : loans to create solar energy plants could generate income , according to the world bank but there are some delegations that are very skeptical about the world bank administering the funds .
in particular , developing countries oppose a climate fund managed by the bank and instead want the unfccc to be the fund 's manager . the un ambassadors of bolivia , pablo solon , summed up their reservations : " to have the world bank as the entity that is going to manage this is something that we do not support , " solon told deutsche welle . " why ?
because as you know , there has been a crisis , an international crisis and part of the reason for this crisis is the imf and the world bank , which have imposed a policy that has provoked this crisis " . the world bank has also been criticized for not acting progressively enough on climate related issues . " it continues to promote as its central paradigm fossil fuel based energy production , " said steve herz a report by oil change international and sierra club said the world bank increased its lending for fossil fuels from 1.5 billion dollars in 2006 to 6.2 billion dollars in 2010 . carbon markets on the sidelines of the conference , the world bank launched a new multi-million dollar fund to help emerging market countries set up their own carbon markets carbon markets create a profit-generating system whereby a cap is put on the total amount of carbon emissions and companies can trade in surplus rights to emit carbon dioxide into the atmosphere .
the idea is to create a market based system that incentivizes companies to reduce carbon emissions . the world bank thinks this system can play a bigger role .
" today only two percent of clean development mechanism money goes to africa and we have found that in our own portfolio of carbon markets , we have more than 20 percent going to africa and it works fine .
in other words , we believe that it is possible to extend the reach of carbon markets and offsets to those low income countries , " steer said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : carbon markets have allowed china 's wind energy sector to expand rapidly friends of the earth , an environmental advocacy group is strongly critical of carbon markets . " carbon markets are an irreparably flawed means of addressing climate change , " said karen orenstein of friends of the earth us .
" they further entrench the economic arrangements that facilitate the north 's over-consumption and have landed us in this climate crisis in the first place . " nnimmo bassey , executive director of environmental rights action in nigeria and chair of friends of the earth international , thinks that the negotiations are missing the real issues by concentrating too much on market issues . " all the negotiators talk about is how to use the market to soften global warming – carbon offsetting by planting a tree somewhere in africa while you keep polluting in europe , " he told deutsche welle .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de finance -pipe- 10.12.2010 cancun divided over how to pay for consequences of climate change großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how can cancun help poorer nations face climate change ?
the goal of a legally binding treaty to reduce pollution has fallen by the wayside , so efforts in cancun have been focusing on a fund to help channel hundreds of billions of dollars in aid towards poor countries . enshrined in the copenhagen accord was the pledge to raise billions of dollars of climate aid .
the headline figures were impressive : 100 billion dollars -lrb- 76 billion euro -rrb- a year as of 2020 , and at least seven billion euros from the eu over the next few years to get the ball rolling .
yet the nitty gritty details of how that money should be managed and distributed were left for cancun . but negotiations on the fund are being stalled because the us want to tie the creation of the fund to other issues , in particular they want big developing emitting countries , particularly china to be more transparent about the action they are taking to mitigate the effects of climate change . " that essentially puts a handbrake on how far we can go in creating a fund , " steve herz , a climate policy advisor at greenpeace told deutsche welle .
" it risks a watered down decision , " he added . a new draft proposal has spelled out the technicalities for setting up a global climate fund .
it will help poor nations create a mechanism to share clean technologies , protect tropical forests and help the poor adapt to impacts ranging from storms to rising sea levels . in a revision , the text explicitly calls for a role for women in the fight against climate change . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : environmentalists want the money to help poor nations adapt to climate change " at last women , who are among the most affected by climate change , are not being ignored , " said executive director of oxfam jeremy hobbs at a press conference . but some environmentalists criticized the draft for removing a reference to ensuring that 50 percent of assistance goes toward helping people adapt to climate change . " the current draft sees too many important decisions pushed down the road , " hobbs said . the omission would allow wealthy nations to meet pledges through other means , such as offering technical know-how to help curb emissions of greenhouse gases blamed for global warming . role of the world bank negotiators said they saw steady progress in setting up the architecture of a future climate fund .
a remaining sticking point is whether to include a role for international bodies , such as the world bank , in administering aid . donor countries want to have guarantees that the money is actually spent on global climate protection .
the developing countries receiving the funds want freedom of choice on their national measures and no preconditions , for example , on policy priorities . " there 's a tug of war going on right now .
the dispute is about the trustee role , " said steve herz . donor countries want the world bank to play a role as trustee , which - according to herz - " could mean that they just cut cheques , but it could also mean a broader role in implementing and conceiving projects " . negotiators are currently trying to agree on the scope of the trustee role . as the globe 's largest poverty-fighting institution , with 65 years of experience in development finance , the world bank says it can play a helpful role . " our specialty is essentially delivering results at scale .
the world has lots of pilots and lots of wonderful experiments going on a small scale and those are really good .
but what the world really needs now is scale .
i think we can play a helpful role in bringing together the overall packages , " andrew steer , special envoy for climate change at the world bank , told deutsche welle . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : loans to create solar energy plants could generate income , according to the world bank but there are some delegations that are very skeptical about the world bank administering the funds .
in particular , developing countries oppose a climate fund managed by the bank and instead want the unfccc to be the fund 's manager . the un ambassadors of bolivia , pablo solon , summed up their reservations : " to have the world bank as the entity that is going to manage this is something that we do not support , " solon told deutsche welle . " why ?
because as you know , there has been a crisis , an international crisis and part of the reason for this crisis is the imf and the world bank , which have imposed a policy that has provoked this crisis " . the world bank has also been criticized for not acting progressively enough on climate related issues . " it continues to promote as its central paradigm fossil fuel based energy production , " said steve herz a report by oil change international and sierra club said the world bank increased its lending for fossil fuels from 1.5 billion dollars in 2006 to 6.2 billion dollars in 2010 . carbon markets on the sidelines of the conference , the world bank launched a new multi-million dollar fund to help emerging market countries set up their own carbon markets carbon markets create a profit-generating system whereby a cap is put on the total amount of carbon emissions and companies can trade in surplus rights to emit carbon dioxide into the atmosphere .
the idea is to create a market based system that incentivizes companies to reduce carbon emissions . the world bank thinks this system can play a bigger role .
" today only two percent of clean development mechanism money goes to africa and we have found that in our own portfolio of carbon markets , we have more than 20 percent going to africa and it works fine .
in other words , we believe that it is possible to extend the reach of carbon markets and offsets to those low income countries , " steer said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : carbon markets have allowed china 's wind energy sector to expand rapidly friends of the earth , an environmental advocacy group is strongly critical of carbon markets . " carbon markets are an irreparably flawed means of addressing climate change , " said karen orenstein of friends of the earth us .
" they further entrench the economic arrangements that facilitate the north 's over-consumption and have landed us in this climate crisis in the first place . " nnimmo bassey , executive director of environmental rights action in nigeria and chair of friends of the earth international , thinks that the negotiations are missing the real issues by concentrating too much on market issues . " all the negotiators talk about is how to use the market to soften global warming – carbon offsetting by planting a tree somewhere in africa while you keep polluting in europe , " he told deutsche welle . " this is not a solution , because pollution emissions have to stop at the source .
and they are not talking about lifestyle changes ; they are not talking about less consumption and less of production . " with talks due to end on friday , many negotiators believed they could come to agreement in three key areas : the architecture of a global climate fund , aid to discourage deforestation , and verification of countries ' climate pledges . author : natalia dannenberg -lrb- afp , dpa -rrb- editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de film -pipe- 10.12.2010 director von donnersmarck makes hollywood debut with ' the tourist ' großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german names have been behind some of hollywood 's major hits - and flops big stars , big budgets and big expectations : that 's what awaits filmmakers who make the switch to hollywood .
florian henckel von donnersmarck is the most recent german director to switch to hollywood with " the tourist . " angelina jolie 's new film " the tourist " sees the actress purring , posing and prodding men from paris to venice - a bit like how the film itself got its start .
dissatisfied with the original script , jolie called up german director florian henckel von donnersmarck and convinced him .
if you 'll rewrite the script and direct , she said , i 'm in .
the movie is the director 's second , following his 2006 oscar-winning debut film , " the lives of others . "
von donnersmarck made his way across the pond for his big-budget hollywood premiere , but the capital of show business is a bit different than the director had imagined .
" i had thought that everything would be a bit more lascivious , adventurous and sexually decadent - that everybody would sleep with everybody , " he told dpa news agency .
" but really it 's just hardworking people that do n't go to bed too late because they have to get up at six for an appointment with their personal trainers . "
the first result of von donnersmarck 's venture to hollywood opens on december 10 in the us and makes its german debut on december 16 .
poor reviews ahead of the us premiere do n't bode well for the film , however , with variety calling it " a euro-chic trifle " .
the hollywood reporter website said the film was " served under a label promising first-class champagne " but tasted like " last night 's prosecco . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a door opened for director von donnersmarck after his 2007 oscar win never far from home the 37-year-old director moved to tinseltown just six months after his 2007 oscar win , as calls from agents and other industry insiders began to pour in .
but a change of location is nothing new for the cologne-born director , who spent stints of his childhood in brussels , berlin and new york and studied in st. petersburg and oxford .
on the other hand , the director insists his home country has n't left his thoughts or his work .
" in my mind , i have n't left germany , " said von donnersmarck in an interview with the weekly frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung .
" i would lose much too much by not being able to keep making german films and taking up german topics and themes . "
that may set him apart from some of his german colleagues , who have made the switch from making films at home to creating hollywood blockbusters .
hollywood superstars , german roots von donnersmarck 's story sounds a bit like that of wolfgang petersen , director of 1981 's " das boot " -lrb- " the boat " -rrb- , which garnered a host of oscar nominations -lrb- although no wins -rrb- and catapulted its director to international fame .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " das boot " -lrb- 1981 -rrb- is a dramatic war film following the fate of a world war ii submarine petersen made the move from hamburg to hollywood , where he went on to direct major hits , including " in the line of fire " -lrb- 1993 -rrb- , " air force one " -lrb- 1997 -rrb- and " troy " -lrb- 2004 -rrb- .
although petersen now enjoys being one of the few directors with the privilege of making the " final cut " on his films , it had n't always been smooth sailing .
his 2006 " poseidon " was a flop in comparison with its massive $ 160-million budget .
petersen is n't the only german-born director to have churned out international blockbusters in the last two decades .
he 's joined by roland emmerich , director of thrillers heavy on special effects like " independence day " -lrb- 1996 -rrb- , " the patriot " -lrb- 2000 -rrb- and " the day after tomorrow " -lrb- 2004 -rrb- .
the director got his foot in the door in hollywood with 1994 's " stargate . "
emmerich had begun his career in his home country with a series of lesser-known films , first in german and then in english .
the move to hollywood filmmaking was a shock in at least one way for the self-described penny-pincher from southern germany .
" i have the nature of a very thrifty person , " emmerich said in 1994 .
" so it 's really strange to suddenly be on top of a project with more than a 50 million dollar budget . "
like von donnersmarck , emmerich still draws inspiration from germany and returned to potsdam to direct his most recent film , " anonymous , " set for release in 2011 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hirschbiegel 's " downfall " -lrb- 2004 -rrb- follows hitler in his final days no guarantees but even oscar nominations and star-studded casts have n't been enough to save some of von donnersmarck 's germany-to-hollywood colleagues from box office defeat .
oliver hirschbiegel 's 2004 drama " downfall " garnered an oscar nomination for best foreign language film and paved the way for the director 's la debut with 2007 's " the invasion . "
but despite a cast including nicole kidman and daniel craig , the movie was a flop and fell millions of dollars short of its budget .
german-born director mennan yapo , who has turkish roots , suffered a similar fate after his direction in 2004 's " lautlos " -lrb- " soundless " -rrb- drew international acclaim .
he followed up with " the premonition , " starring sandra bullock , about a housewife with a chilling suspicion , but critics generally panned the effort .
it remains to be seen whether " the tourist " will live up to its hollywood-sized expectations , despite initial negative reviews in the us .
but if not , von donnersmarck can reassure himself with the fact that he 's already an oscar-winner , unlike some of his predecessors .
if the film turns out to be a success after all , he may just become another in a long line of german-speaking directors to go down in hollywood 's movie-making history , from fritz lang to billy wilder .

after pressure from china , 20 nations have said they wo n't be attending the ceremony . a total of 65 countries have embassies in the norwegian capital of oslo and recently they 've all received the same two pieces of mail . an invitation from the nobel prize committee to attend the award ceremony for the 2011 nobel winners and a letter from the chinese embassy requesting they steer clear of the event . " we have noticed that the chinese are very engaged this year , " said geir lundestad , director of the nobel institute .
" they want as few nations as possible to accept the invitation .
now we 'll see who does not come for political reasons and who have other reasons . " the nobel committee has said 44 nations will be sending envoys to the ceremony , including eu member states , the united states , japan , india , south korea , south africa , indonesia and brazil . political , social motives bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at the ceremony , 20 countries will have empty chairs but another 20 countries have said they will not be in attendance .
serbia cited its interest in maintaining good relations with china for its absence , but other countries , including russia , are offering other reasons .
moscow has said scheduling difficulties - not political considerations - were keeping it away . but the scheduling conflicts veil russia 's political motive not to attend , according to sergei lukashevsky , the head of moscow 's sakharov museum . " that russia is not participating in the nobel peace prize 's award ceremony once again makes it clear that human rights do not play a prominent role in our foreign policy , " he said . " russia and china are members of the shanghai organization for cooperation and one of its goals is the fight against so-called extremism , " lukashevsky added .
" what that really means is that the countries support each other when it comes to fighting uncomfortable political situations . several countries in the middle east as well as afghanistan , pakistan and the philippines are also avoiding the ceremony because for economic and political reasons , according to rainer sollich , head of deutsche welle 's arabic department . " they are all states that have problems concerning human rights and operate under the understanding that they would n't want china at a ceremony honoring someone they view as an opponent of their regime . " china 's confucius prize china 's policy regarding the award ceremony and the still-imprisoned dissident liu has been clear .
referring to the nobel committee , chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman jiang yu said , " we will not change because of interference by a few clowns . " beijing awarded its own version of the nobel peace prize on thursday by giving the " confucius peace prize " to former taiwan vice-president lien chan .
like with liu 's nobel , chan was not in attendance to claim the award and his office said he was unaware of the prize . china has blocked access to the website of norwegian broadcaster nrk , the station said on thursday .
access to the bbc and cnn has also been affected ahead of friday 's ceremony , according to nrk . conspicuous absence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more protests in support of liu are scheduled for thursday friday will mark only the second time in the more than 100-year history of the prize that neither the laureate nor a representative will be able to come accept the award .
german journalist and pacifist carl von ossietzky , who was locked up in a nazi concentration camp , could not travel to oslo for his prize ceremony in 1936 . in addition to liu and ossietzky , myanmar 's aung san suu kyi was also barred from receiving her nobel peace prize in 1991 . liu has long been an outspoken opponent of chinese leadership in beijing and was at the forefront of the 1989 tiananmen square protests .
he was jailed in december 2009 for 11 years on subversion charges after co-authoring " charter 08 , " a manifesto that called for political reform in china . nobel officials said an empty chair would be used to represent liu 's absence . the 20 nations which will not attend the nobel ceremony are : afghanistan , china , colombia , cuba , egypt , iran , iraq , kazakhstan , morocco , pakistan , the philippines , russia , saudi arabia , serbia , sri lanka , sudan , tunisia , ukraine , venezuela and vietnam . authors : matthias von hein , jegor winogradow / sms -lrb- afp -rrb- editor : jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

journalists from far and near are cordoned off some hundred meters away .
no one is allowed to get into the forbidden zone . thin , with a shaven head -lrb- or short-cropped hair -rrb- , liu xia is sitting alone in the empty home .
rinse the ashtray the coffee table wiped take the glass cups boil two cups of longjing or oolong aside the table you sit looking at the cup in front of the empty seat stare at the cup , listen is there the move of key in the hole ...
the cup in the hand , you take a sip lifted the cup to the sun cup and your fingers penetrated by the sun palm was stained by the transparent green delicate a hint of panic is there too the cup on the opposite site you know will be empty for a long time it takes long till the man opens your door -lrb- from liu ’ s poem " sunshine and cups - to my little finger , who drinks tea every day " -rrb- liu xia may wait for a long time , maybe another ten years .
now we visit xiaobo in jinzhou prison in the small chinese town nanshan in liaoning province .
entering the gate , we see several scattered buildings .
surprisingly , we see a huge office wall on which is written boldly ' 1984 ' .
a few months ago , liu xia , accompanied by the stainless steel mouse liu di , wang jinbo , mo zhixu and wang zhongxia , came here for a visit .
they were amazed at orwell ’ s rebirth in a chinese prison . snickering , they took pictures in front of the " 1984 wall " .
several officers rushed to them and took them into custody .
separately , they were interrogated for hours . we enter xiaobo ’ s cell now .
he shares with five other prisoners a 3 by 4 meter space .
his head is bald , shaved like an ordinary criminal .
his body is swollen by the padded jacket and trousers .
scarf , hat and gloves are a must in the cell because the concrete floor of the prison is cold .
the small window beneath the high ceiling is always open .
in winter , the indoor temperature is higher than outdoors ; it is a few degrees above zero .
the odor of the open toilet bucket in the corner is neutralized by the cold air , but one can not ignore the stench of the daily waste of several men .
the smell not only fills the room , it penetrates through clothes , and into the pores of the skin . this is the first winter that xiaobo spends in a prison in northern china .
he will have to adjust himself to the circumstances .
he does not know whether he will have frostbite .
to sit and lie on the concrete floors all year round may cause neck and spine pain and lead to kidney problems .
his stomach disease has given him a hard time since his imprisonment .
xiaobo has exited his cell today , but he does not want to show it to others otherwise his cell-mates might become cynical and angry .
sitting there , his thoughts fly to oslo .
he has had constant dreams about it .
who will be there at the ceremony ?
who will receive the prize for me ?
it could not be liu xia .
she has not sent any sign of life for a while .
my acceptance speech is long written in my head , but who can read it out aloud for me ?
does the king wear a majestic tuxedo , and the queen her crown at the banquet ?
will the distinguished guests think of the dead in tiananmen square and the tiananmen mothers and make a toast ?
sitting in the dungeon , xiaobo does not know that the announcement of his award induced a tsunami in zhongnanhai , and the rulers had a mild concussion , followed by delusions : they believe that their enemies are all over the world , so the grip on the naughty writers and the guy who held the crab dinner party must be tightened .
they must not go outside the country , otherwise they could endanger national security .
liu xiaobo ’ s dinner on december 10 , 2010 may look like this : boiled vegetables with sand , and a few pieces of fat meat as a special treat .
he might have an extra piece of steamed bread , and his rice bowl could also be refilled today .
in short , it is a privileged meal that will long be remembered , because it is a meal that will leave the stomach truly filled .
after all , he is the first chinese to win the nobel peace prize .

yet that honor comes at a price : providing security , logistics and organization for around 15,000 delegates takes a toll on resources .
there is no question as to whether the conference has been worth the effort , says gustavo ampugnani of greenpeace mexico .
" as a mexican i am of course proud that it 's my country that 's hosting this conference - after all , it 's about saving the global climate , " he told deutsche welle .
from a global perspective he said mexico did a good job in taking a leading role in the struggle against climate change .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some 15,000 delegates from around the world came to attend the cancun talks he added that , crucially , the summit also served to heighten awareness within mexico itself about the impact of climate change .
" for us at greenpeace , what matters is of course not only staging this conferece , but also the concrete actions back home here in mexico , " ampugnani said , pointing out out the dependency on fossil fuels like oil and coal .
" we have to reduce our own emissions - and in that field , i 'd say , mexico still has a lot to do before the country can actually be proud of its climate policy . "
building bridges mexico has stepped up its climate protection efforts .
with the conference in cancun well underway , the government passed a law introducing emission targets , and taxes on emissions in the mexico city area .
the 20 million living there make up around 25 percent of the country 's total population .
during the climate talks themselves , mexico 's efforts were exemplary .
" i think the conference here is very well organized - with dedication and professionalism .
mexico is indeed trying to build bridges , " german environment minister norbert roettgen said in cancun .
president calderon 's declared goal is achieving progress on the so-called green fund , set up to channel aid to countries suffering from the consequences of climate change .
calderon wants every country to contribute to the fund .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : around 25 percent of the country 's population live in the capital mexico city the amount that each country would have to contribute would be linked to both the extent to which it contributes to climate change and to its economic wealth .
a total of $ 100 billion -lrb- 76 billion euros -rrb- is to go into the fund each year , starting in 2020 .
that , at least , is the plan according to the agreement reached at last year 's climate change summit in copenhagen .
but the climate fund has turned out to be a thorny issue .
negotiators at cancun were supposed to work out the details , but it 's precisely those details that are proving difficult , and mexico is having a hard time trying get the delegates to agree to a compromise .
" africa for instance contributes only two percent to the global co2 emissions - but at the same time it 's africa that 's the part of the world worst affected by the consequences of climate change , " german environment minister roettgen said .
" and the job is to get all of the 194 attending countries to agree on something so we can have a concrete result at the end of the day .
this proves to be extremely complex and difficult .
but i get a sense that mexico is doing a good job - or at least as good a job as possible . "
will cancun deliver ?
whether mexico 's presidency of this year 's summit will in the end bring success is far from guaranteed .
the summit officially wraps up on friday and there have been few results so far .
often it is only in the last hours that marathon negotiations such as this one bear fruit .
last year in copenhagen , the talks went all through the night and into the early hours of the next day - although no deal even remotely close to what many had hoped for was ever reached .
a similar failure in cancun would be a serious blow to the un 's climate policy , undermining international trust in its ability to bring about real change .

liu , a 54-year-old literary critic and democracy advocate , is serving an 11-year prison sentence for subversion , handed down last year after he co-authored a bold appeal for human rights and political reform .

china 's pressure tactics had continued unabated on friday .
amnesty international 's oslo representatives said that members of norway 's chinese community were being pressured by chinese diplomats to join anti-nobel protests planned for saturday .
the nobel committee chairman emphasized that the committee ’ s intention had been to make a statement about the relationship between human rights , democracy and peace .
the rights democracies around the world enjoyed today were fought for and won by people who took great risks .
" they did so for others .
that is why liu xiaobo deserves our support , " jagland said .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chinese citizens clash with troops near tiananmen square in beijing in 1989 moreover , the pressure felt in oslo even hours before the ceremony , seemed to be galvanizing the west , reminding citizens of democracies of the values the nobel peace prize stands for .
china 's pressure tactics had continued unabated on friday .
amnesty international 's oslo representatives said that members of norway 's chinese community were being pressured by chinese diplomats to join anti-nobel protests planned for saturday .
the nobel committee chairman emphasized that the committee ’ s intention had been to make a statement about the relationship between human rights , democracy and peace .
the rights democracies around the world enjoyed today were fought for and won by people who took great risks .
" they did so for others .
that is why liu xiaobo deserves our support , " jagland said .

meanwhile , russia 's prime minister accuses the us of hypocrisy over the affair . the un commissioner for human rights navi pillay expressed dismay over the withdrawal of financial and internet services to the controversial wikileaks website .
pillay said that measures taken by companies - which wikileaks ' supporters claim are due to pressure from foreign governments - could represent an infringement of the right to freedom of expression . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pillay said courts should decide on the balance between security and freedom " i 'm concerned about reports of pressure exerted on private companies , including banks , credit card companies , and internet service providers to close down credit lines for donations to wikileaks as well as to stop hosting the website or its mother sites , " navi pillay told a news conference on thursday .
" they could be interpreted as an attempt to censor the publication of information , thus potentially violating wikileaks ' right to freedom of expression . "
payments suspended , account closed wikileaks angered the us and other governments with the release in november of 250,000 confidential diplomatic cables , with washington saying the information could put american lives in danger .
credit card firms mastercard and visa later suspended payments made to wikileaks , while the swiss post office shut down a bank account opened by wikileaks founder julian assange .
pillay said the case " raises complex human rights questions about balancing freedom of information and the need to protect national security or public order . "
" if wikileaks has committed any recognizable illegal acts then this should be handled through the legal system and not through pressure and intimidation including on third parties , " said pillay a former un war crimes judge .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : assange was arrested in london , and awaits a hearing pillay noted that such questions were not related to charges against assange for crimes including rape in sweden .
supporters of assange claim that the charges against him have been manufactured as part of a bid to halt the website 's activities , along with the pressure on firms to cut wikileaks ' income stream .
' pot calls kettle black , ' putin russian prime minister vladimir putin said that assange 's arrest in britain , for extradition , was " undemocratic " and accused the us of " hypocrisy " for attacking russia 's record on democracy .
" if we are talking about democracy , it should be complete .
why was mr. assange hidden in jail ?
is that democracy ?
as we say in the village , the pot is calling the kettle black , " putin told reporters .
" i want to send the ball back to our american colleagues . "
assange is currently in custody in britain awaiting a hearing over his extradition after a warrant was issued by sweden .
meanwhile , wikileaks supporters on thursday vowed to step up cyber-attacks on companies that have taken action against wikileaks .
a group calling itself " anonymous " has claimed credit for temporarily bringing down the websites of visa and mastercard .

but the west seems unmoved . despite changes in afghan law and a constitution designed to protect women 's rights , violence and abuse of women continue to be a serious problem in the country , and the government is not doing enough to prevent it .
that is the conclusion of a new report published by the united nations assistance mission in afghanistan -lrb- unama -rrb- .
the most common forms of abuse include forced and child marriage , honor killings and giving away girls to settle disputes under the tradition of baad .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the report says violence against afghan women is still widespread " the report describes the prevalence of these practices , " georgette gagnon , unama 's director of human rights , said at a press conference .
" it looks at the consequences these practices have on the lives of afghan women and girls and the community as a whole and it also looks at the efforts of the afghan government to address violence against women . "
one of these efforts , the 2009 law of elimination of violence against women -lrb- evaw -rrb- , came under particular scrutiny .
the law , which gagnon described as " a huge gain of legal protection of women 's rights , " criminalizes buying and selling women for marriage , forcing a woman to marry without her consent , forcing girls to marry when they are underage , and forcing girls and women to commit self-immolation - when they set themselves on fire .
ignorance and lack of enforcement but according to the report , the new law is not being enforced in many parts of the country , and is often not even known .
bele grau , program manager for afghanistan at the women 's rights organisation medica mondiale agreed with this assessment .
" on the theoretical and legal level the situation is getting better – but in practice it is often not implemented , " she told deutsche welle .
" this law has been in force for a year , but a lot of judges do n't even know it , and if they do , they do n't enforce it . "
the un women 's organization unifem says that around 87 percent of afghan women suffer from domestic violence , and that half of all girls are married under the age of 15 .
on top of this , grau says that many of the rights that women have won are repealed by new laws .
she cites one recent regulation that bans women who have run away from an abusive home from seeking refuge with strangers .
this in practice leaves many women only the unrealistic option of going to relatives .
many women are also still imprisoned for running away , in contravention of the evaw law .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : westerwelle suggested democracy can not be imposed on afghanistan the report found that much of the abuse is founded in afghan tradition .
" one very harmful practice that we heard a lot about is baad , which is the giving away of girls to settle disputes , " said gagnon .
" many of the women told us that instead of a murderer being punished , an innocent girl is punished and she has to spend all her life in slavery and is subjected to cruel violence .
sometimes she is forced to sleep with the animals in the barn . "
western indifference the report sets out a number of recommendations for the afghan government to deal with the problem , but grau says that the west has an obligation to apply pressure in order to protect women 's rights – not least because this is often used to add legitimacy to the war in afghanistan .
" we 've noticed this in most of the western governments , " she said .
" for the past year , all the talk is about withdrawal of troops , and negotiations with the taliban etc . , and that afghans have to work out for themselves how much democracy or women 's rights they want .
these are now all internal afghan issues that are n't discussed or even noticed anymore .
the german government is no exception to this . "
she believes that pressure could be exhorted through the financial aid the west gives to the afghan government .
" the western governments still give afghanistan a lot of development money , " she said .
" and when they make conditions for giving this money , we think they should make them for human rights and women 's rights , not just for taking over security duties . "
" the issue of women 's rights was also one of the justifications for the war itself , but that is suddenly disappearing from the agenda , " she added .
" earlier this year , -lrb- german foreign minister guido -rrb- westerwelle said , ' well , afghanistan is not switzerland , ' and with that everything is swept from the table . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de film -pipe- 10.12.2010 director von donnersmarck makes hollywood debut with ' the tourist ' großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german names have been behind some of hollywood 's major hits - and flops big stars , big budgets and big expectations : that 's what awaits filmmakers who make the switch to hollywood .
florian henckel von donnersmarck is the most recent german director to switch to hollywood with " the tourist . " angelina jolie 's new film " the tourist " sees the actress purring , posing and prodding men from paris to venice - a bit like how the film itself got its start .
dissatisfied with the original script , jolie called up german director florian henckel von donnersmarck and convinced him .
if you 'll rewrite the script and direct , she said , i 'm in .
the movie is the director 's second , following his 2006 oscar-winning debut film , " the lives of others . "
von donnersmarck made his way across the pond for his big-budget hollywood premiere , but the capital of show business is a bit different than the director had imagined .
" i had thought that everything would be a bit more lascivious , adventurous and sexually decadent - that everybody would sleep with everybody , " he told dpa news agency .
" but really it 's just hardworking people that do n't go to bed too late because they have to get up at six for an appointment with their personal trainers . "
the first result of von donnersmarck 's venture to hollywood opens on december 10 in the us and makes its german debut on december 16 .
poor reviews ahead of the us premiere do n't bode well for the film , however , with variety calling it " a euro-chic trifle " .
the hollywood reporter website said the film was " served under a label promising first-class champagne " but tasted like " last night 's prosecco . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a door opened for director von donnersmarck after his 2007 oscar win never far from home the 37-year-old director moved to tinseltown just six months after his 2007 oscar win , as calls from agents and other industry insiders began to pour in .
but a change of location is nothing new for the cologne-born director , who spent stints of his childhood in brussels , berlin and new york and studied in st. petersburg and oxford .
on the other hand , the director insists his home country has n't left his thoughts or his work .
" in my mind , i have n't left germany , " said von donnersmarck in an interview with the weekly frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung .
" i would lose much too much by not being able to keep making german films and taking up german topics and themes . "
that may set him apart from some of his german colleagues , who have made the switch from making films at home to creating hollywood blockbusters .
hollywood superstars , german roots von donnersmarck 's story sounds a bit like that of wolfgang petersen , director of 1981 's " das boot " -lrb- " the boat " -rrb- , which garnered a host of oscar nominations -lrb- although no wins -rrb- and catapulted its director to international fame .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " das boot " -lrb- 1981 -rrb- is a dramatic war film following the fate of a world war ii submarine petersen made the move from hamburg to hollywood , where he went on to direct major hits , including " in the line of fire " -lrb- 1993 -rrb- , " air force one " -lrb- 1997 -rrb- and " troy " -lrb- 2004 -rrb- .
although petersen now enjoys being one of the few directors with the privilege of making the " final cut " on his films , it had n't always been smooth sailing .
his 2006 " poseidon " was a flop in comparison with its massive $ 160-million budget .
petersen is n't the only german-born director to have churned out international blockbusters in the last two decades .
he 's joined by roland emmerich , director of thrillers heavy on special effects like " independence day " -lrb- 1996 -rrb- , " the patriot " -lrb- 2000 -rrb- and " the day after tomorrow " -lrb- 2004 -rrb- .
the director got his foot in the door in hollywood with 1994 's " stargate . "
emmerich had begun his career in his home country with a series of lesser-known films , first in german and then in english .
the move to hollywood filmmaking was a shock in at least one way for the self-described penny-pincher from southern germany .
" i have the nature of a very thrifty person , " emmerich said in 1994 .
" so it 's really strange to suddenly be on top of a project with more than a 50 million dollar budget . "
like von donnersmarck , emmerich still draws inspiration from germany and returned to potsdam to direct his most recent film , " anonymous , " set for release in 2011 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hirschbiegel 's " downfall " -lrb- 2004 -rrb- follows hitler in his final days no guarantees but even oscar nominations and star-studded casts have n't been enough to save some of von donnersmarck 's germany-to-hollywood colleagues from box office defeat .
oliver hirschbiegel 's 2004 drama " downfall " garnered an oscar nomination for best foreign language film and paved the way for the director 's la debut with 2007 's " the invasion . "
but despite a cast including nicole kidman and daniel craig , the movie was a flop and fell millions of dollars short of its budget .
german-born director mennan yapo , who has turkish roots , suffered a similar fate after his direction in 2004 's " lautlos " -lrb- " soundless " -rrb- drew international acclaim .
he followed up with " the premonition , " starring sandra bullock , about a housewife with a chilling suspicion , but critics generally panned the effort .
it remains to be seen whether " the tourist " will live up to its hollywood-sized expectations , despite initial negative reviews in the us .
but if not , von donnersmarck can reassure himself with the fact that he 's already an oscar-winner , unlike some of his predecessors .
if the film turns out to be a success after all , he may just become another in a long line of german-speaking directors to go down in hollywood 's movie-making history , from fritz lang to billy wilder .

but the west seems unmoved . despite changes in afghan law and a constitution designed to protect women 's rights , violence and abuse of women continue to be a serious problem in the country , and the government is not doing enough to prevent it .
that is the conclusion of a new report published by the united nations assistance mission in afghanistan -lrb- unama -rrb- .
the most common forms of abuse include forced and child marriage , honor killings and giving away girls to settle disputes under the tradition of baad .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the report says violence against afghan women is still widespread " the report describes the prevalence of these practices , " georgette gagnon , unama 's director of human rights , said at a press conference .
" it looks at the consequences these practices have on the lives of afghan women and girls and the community as a whole and it also looks at the efforts of the afghan government to address violence against women . "
one of these efforts , the 2009 law of elimination of violence against women -lrb- evaw -rrb- , came under particular scrutiny .
the law , which gagnon described as " a huge gain of legal protection of women 's rights , " criminalizes buying and selling women for marriage , forcing a woman to marry without her consent , forcing girls to marry when they are underage , and forcing girls and women to commit self-immolation - when they set themselves on fire .
ignorance and lack of enforcement but according to the report , the new law is not being enforced in many parts of the country , and is often not even known .
bele grau , program manager for afghanistan at the women 's rights organisation medica mondiale agreed with this assessment .
" on the theoretical and legal level the situation is getting better – but in practice it is often not implemented , " she told deutsche welle .
" this law has been in force for a year , but a lot of judges do n't even know it , and if they do , they do n't enforce it . "
the un women 's organization unifem says that around 87 percent of afghan women suffer from domestic violence , and that half of all girls are married under the age of 15 .
on top of this , grau says that many of the rights that women have won are repealed by new laws .
she cites one recent regulation that bans women who have run away from an abusive home from seeking refuge with strangers .
this in practice leaves many women only the unrealistic option of going to relatives .
many women are also still imprisoned for running away , in contravention of the evaw law .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : westerwelle suggested democracy can not be imposed on afghanistan the report found that much of the abuse is founded in afghan tradition .
" one very harmful practice that we heard a lot about is baad , which is the giving away of girls to settle disputes , " said gagnon .
" many of the women told us that instead of a murderer being punished , an innocent girl is punished and she has to spend all her life in slavery and is subjected to cruel violence .
sometimes she is forced to sleep with the animals in the barn . "
western indifference the report sets out a number of recommendations for the afghan government to deal with the problem , but grau says that the west has an obligation to apply pressure in order to protect women 's rights – not least because this is often used to add legitimacy to the war in afghanistan .

" there is a spirit that is uniting us all , " the german chancellor told reporters during a break in the talks .
" if the euro fails , the european union fails , too . "
president sarkozy , meanwhile , pledged that germany and france " will defend the euro , because the euro is europe . "
sarkozy also backed germany 's opposition to creating unified european sovereign bonds .
the idea of harmonizing some eurozone debt , as suggested by several members of the currency union , has met with strong opposition from germany and france , whose balance sheets are relatively healthy .
" french and german citizens would not be happy if we were to bundle the debts together , " the french president said .
he argued that the concept might be worth considering in the future , but only after the bloc 's members ramp up their economic and political cooperation .
" we should not put the cart before the horse , " sarkozy told reporters .
european leaders , or bullies ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france and germany are unwilling to unify european debts earlier in the week , merkel and germany had come under fire over this issue from luxembourg 's prime minister jean-claude juncker , who also heads the eurozone .
juncker said that creating taboo subjects without even considering the ideas of others was " a very un-european way of dealing with european issues . " as the two largest eu members , france and germany both have a sizeable share of the voting power within the bloc , and need relatively little support from other countries in order to secure a majority .
" without agreement from france and germany - the historic motors of european integration and two economies that make up half of the eurozone 's gross domestic product - nothing very important is possible , " professor henrik uterwedde from the franco-german institute in ludwigsburg told deutsche welle .
" so on the one hand , they must reach agreements , and help the union move forward , but at the same time , they do n't always do enough to treat the other members as equal partners and involve them in the decision-making processes . "
friday 's meeting was in preparation for the eu summit in brussels on december 16 and 17 , at which the bloc 's economic difficulties such as unemployment and national debt are bound to top the agenda .
troop deployment symbolic of closer cooperation while sarkozy and merkel discussed the harmonization of economic policies like labor and taxation laws , saying this would improve the eurozone 's coherence as an economic bloc , military leaders just across the border were preparing a more visible symbol of franco-german cooperation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the last german battalions in france had a very different mission the first german battalion to be stationed on french soil since the nazi occupation in world war ii officially took up their post near the border-city of strasbourg on friday .
german defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg and his french counterpart alain juppe attended a ceremony to mark the event .
" german soldiers are today welcome in france , " merkel said across the border in freiburg .
" for me , that has great symbolism , after all that germany was guilty of during the nazi era . "
the battalion , which will eventually consist of 600 soldiers , is part of the joint franco-german brigade .
" i was always surprised that the franco-german brigade only consisted of french soldiers in germany , " sarkozy said .
" we are two sovereign nations , two countries at peace , two countries that founded europe . "
franco-german genesis of eu sarkozy was referring to the forerunner of the modern-day european union , the european coal and steel community .
this trade-oriented union was established in 1953 as part of post-war efforts to negate the possibility of future conflict between france and germany by making them economically interdependent .
between 1870 and 1945 , the two neighbors fought three devastating wars .
" above all else , i think putting these german troops in france is a symbolic exercise , " franco-german expert , professor henrik uterwedde said .
" but sometimes symbolism is important . "
" that famous photo of -lsb- former german chancellor -rsb- helmut kohl and -lsb- then french president -rsb- francois mitterand standing hand-in-hand at the world war one commemorations in verdun in 1984 was pure symbolism , too - but it was a hugely significant image . "
bildunterschrift : sometimes symbolism can move mountains the alsace region where the german battalion us now stationed spans the franco-german border , and has changed hands several times over the centuries .

you have to pay a one-euro entrance fee , and while the mulled wine , roasted almonds and arts-and-craft knick-knacks are much the same as in any other christmas market , you are treated to a live ballet show , based on a russian fairytale , to go with your sense of exclusivity .
you also see more security guards .
some , like the ones taking your entry ticket , are dressed as toy soldiers in keeping with the winter fairytale theme .
others wear army boots and the thick , riot-police-style boiler suits emblazoned with the large reflective " security " badge on the back . recent threats of " mumbai style attacks " have boosted the private security business in the past few weeks .
thomas ostmann , berlin manager of german security company agsus , noticed a rise in demand immediately . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : recent terrorist threats in berlin have heightened demand for security firms " yes , we 've definitely noticed that , " he told deutsche welle .
" ahead of the christmas markets , we felt a rise in anxiety among the stand owners .
it is going down a little now , but there is significantly more manpower and security on the markets . "
security boom the added holiday season demand has come on top of a general expansion in the security industry over the past decade .
germany currently has 4,000 security companies , up 1,000 over a decade ago .
the number of people employed in the industry has doubled and sales , too , with revenue this year expected to reach 4.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 5.9 billion -rrb- . sven hallscheidt , spokesman for the german chambers of industry and commerce -lrb- dihk -rrb- , attributes the growing demand for security services by individuals and companies to a deep social change .
" it 's a development in society , " he said .
" on the one hand , it is influenced by reports in the media – we all know the reports about possible terrorist attacks – but also reports of attacks in public generally . " the security business is not only expanding but also becoming more complex .
company security is taking on an evermore important role , requiring a new breed of skilled workers – from guards and logistics planners to engineers – to create security systems . essential as the police and that role is extending beyond guarding buildings , cash logistics and the likes into areas such as critical infrastructure , making the private security industry as essential as the police . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the police no longer have the resources to protect essential infrastructure bodo pfalzgraf , chairman of the berlin police union , says the police force in germany simply does n't have the capacity to meet the country 's security requirements .
" first of all , we have in germany about as many police employees as there are employees in the private security industry , it 's 50 – 50 , " he told deutsche welle .
" in my opinion , the infrastructure of german security is inconceivable without private security personnel .
they guard nuclear power stations – they 're not just skin-headed , tattooed bouncers . " the growing importance of the private security sector , however , is also raising questions over jurisdiction , with some politicians warning against the dangers of over-privatizing security – particularly in airports . no special privileges but security manager ostmann says that even in places like christmas markets where private companies protect public spaces , the rules about what guards can and ca n't do are clear .
" the police always have the final say , " he said .
" we have the same rights as any other citizen , but we have no special powers .
and there are no difficulties over areas of competence .
i 'd say it is a very good partnership . " official agreements , like contracts , are organized on a state government level between the police and private security firms but there are still ambiguities , according to pfalzgraf . " a danger exists if there is no clear delineation between the two , and the government is not providing one at the moment , " he said .
" today , anyone can start a private security firm – they have to fulfil very few conditions .
and as of may 1 , 2011 , there 's going to be another opening of the market in europe – in other words , eastern european companies from poland , czech republic and lithuania will be able to start security services here .
that i think is a problem . " pfalzgraf believes it 's high time the state creates more rigorous industry standards to cope with the rising need for private security firms .

" official agreements , like contracts , are organized on a state government level between the police and private security firms but there are still ambiguities , according to pfalzgraf . " a danger exists if there is no clear delineation between the two , and the government is not providing one at the moment , " he said .
" today , anyone can start a private security firm – they have to fulfil very few conditions .
and as of may 1 , 2011 , there 's going to be another opening of the market in europe – in other words , eastern european companies from poland , czech republic and lithuania will be able to start security services here .
that i think is a problem . " pfalzgraf believes it 's high time the state creates more rigorous industry standards to cope with the rising need for private security firms .

meanwhile , russia 's prime minister accuses the us of hypocrisy over the affair . the un commissioner for human rights navi pillay expressed dismay over the withdrawal of financial and internet services to the controversial wikileaks website .
pillay said that measures taken by companies - which wikileaks ' supporters claim are due to pressure from foreign governments - could represent an infringement of the right to freedom of expression . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pillay said courts should decide on the balance between security and freedom " i 'm concerned about reports of pressure exerted on private companies , including banks , credit card companies , and internet service providers to close down credit lines for donations to wikileaks as well as to stop hosting the website or its mother sites , " navi pillay told a news conference on thursday .
" they could be interpreted as an attempt to censor the publication of information , thus potentially violating wikileaks ' right to freedom of expression . "
payments suspended , account closed wikileaks angered the us and other governments with the release in november of 250,000 confidential diplomatic cables , with washington saying the information could put american lives in danger .
credit card firms mastercard and visa later suspended payments made to wikileaks , while the swiss post office shut down a bank account opened by wikileaks founder julian assange .
pillay said the case " raises complex human rights questions about balancing freedom of information and the need to protect national security or public order . "
" if wikileaks has committed any recognizable illegal acts then this should be handled through the legal system and not through pressure and intimidation including on third parties , " said pillay a former un war crimes judge .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : assange was arrested in london , and awaits a hearing pillay noted that such questions were not related to charges against assange for crimes including rape in sweden .
supporters of assange claim that the charges against him have been manufactured as part of a bid to halt the website 's activities , along with the pressure on firms to cut wikileaks ' income stream .
' pot calls kettle black , ' putin russian prime minister vladimir putin said that assange 's arrest in britain , for extradition , was " undemocratic " and accused the us of " hypocrisy " for attacking russia 's record on democracy .
" if we are talking about democracy , it should be complete .
why was mr. assange hidden in jail ?
is that democracy ?
as we say in the village , the pot is calling the kettle black , " putin told reporters .
" i want to send the ball back to our american colleagues . "
assange is currently in custody in britain awaiting a hearing over his extradition after a warrant was issued by sweden .
meanwhile , wikileaks supporters on thursday vowed to step up cyber-attacks on companies that have taken action against wikileaks .
a group calling itself " anonymous " has claimed credit for temporarily bringing down the websites of visa and mastercard .

" there is a spirit that is uniting us all , " the german chancellor told reporters during a break in the talks .
" if the euro fails , the european union fails , too . "
president sarkozy , meanwhile , pledged that germany and france " will defend the euro , because the euro is europe . "
sarkozy also backed germany 's opposition to creating unified european sovereign bonds .
the idea of harmonizing some eurozone debt , as suggested by several members of the currency union , has met with strong opposition from germany and france , whose balance sheets are relatively healthy .
" french and german citizens would not be happy if we were to bundle the debts together , " the french president said .
he argued that the concept might be worth considering in the future , but only after the bloc 's members ramp up their economic and political cooperation .
" we should not put the cart before the horse , " sarkozy told reporters .
european leaders , or bullies ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france and germany are unwilling to unify european debts earlier in the week , merkel and germany had come under fire over this issue from luxembourg 's prime minister jean-claude juncker , who also heads the eurozone .
juncker said that creating taboo subjects without even considering the ideas of others was " a very un-european way of dealing with european issues . " as the two largest eu members , france and germany both have a sizeable share of the voting power within the bloc , and need relatively little support from other countries in order to secure a majority .
" without agreement from france and germany - the historic motors of european integration and two economies that make up half of the eurozone 's gross domestic product - nothing very important is possible , " professor henrik uterwedde from the franco-german institute in ludwigsburg told deutsche welle .
" so on the one hand , they must reach agreements , and help the union move forward , but at the same time , they do n't always do enough to treat the other members as equal partners and involve them in the decision-making processes . "
friday 's meeting was in preparation for the eu summit in brussels on december 16 and 17 , at which the bloc 's economic difficulties such as unemployment and national debt are bound to top the agenda .
troop deployment symbolic of closer cooperation while sarkozy and merkel discussed the harmonization of economic policies like labor and taxation laws , saying this would improve the eurozone 's coherence as an economic bloc , military leaders just across the border were preparing a more visible symbol of franco-german cooperation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the last german battalions in france had a very different mission the first german battalion to be stationed on french soil since the nazi occupation in world war ii officially took up their post near the border-city of strasbourg on friday .
german defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg and his french counterpart alain juppe attended a ceremony to mark the event .
" german soldiers are today welcome in france , " merkel said across the border in freiburg .
" for me , that has great symbolism , after all that germany was guilty of during the nazi era . "
the battalion , which will eventually consist of 600 soldiers , is part of the joint franco-german brigade .
" i was always surprised that the franco-german brigade only consisted of french soldiers in germany , " sarkozy said .
" we are two sovereign nations , two countries at peace , two countries that founded europe . "
franco-german genesis of eu sarkozy was referring to the forerunner of the modern-day european union , the european coal and steel community .
this trade-oriented union was established in 1953 as part of post-war efforts to negate the possibility of future conflict between france and germany by making them economically interdependent .
between 1870 and 1945 , the two neighbors fought three devastating wars .
" above all else , i think putting these german troops in france is a symbolic exercise , " franco-german expert , professor henrik uterwedde said .
" but sometimes symbolism is important . "
" that famous photo of -lsb- former german chancellor -rsb- helmut kohl and -lsb- then french president -rsb- francois mitterand standing hand-in-hand at the world war one commemorations in verdun in 1984 was pure symbolism , too - but it was a hugely significant image . "
bildunterschrift : sometimes symbolism can move mountains the alsace region where the german battalion us now stationed spans the franco-german border , and has changed hands several times over the centuries .

the decision marks a profound change for germany , where compulsory service was re-introduced 50 years ago . senior officials in germany 's coalition government have agreed to suspend military conscription as of july 1 , 2011 .
defense minister karl theodor zu guttenberg 's proposal was accepted during closed-door talks in berlin on thursday evening .
the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- of chancellor angela merkel and its bavarian sister party the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- have both in principle approved abolishing the draft at party conferences in the past six weeks .
their other coalition partner , the pro-business free democrats , had included stopping conscription in their manifesto during last year 's general election .
sources taking part in the meeting said the next step would be for merkel 's cabinet to approve a draft bill that could be put to parliament ; this is expected to happen on december 15 .
troop reduction bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : defense minister guttenberg says the change will save money guttenberg 's plan would also see troop numbers reduced the current level of 250,000 soldiers to 185,000 .
of these , 170,000 would be professional soldiers , with volunteers making up the remainder .
with his reform , guttenberg hopes to save up to 8.3 billion euros .
however , the suspension of conscription could create some new problems ; for instance , the alternative community service offered to those who refuse military service would also be dropped .
social and welfare institutions fear that this could lead to a lack of personnel , as in the past they have relied heavily on youngsters who want to avoid military service .
the suspension also means that student numbers are likely to climb , posing problems for universities .
compulsory military service in germany lasts for six months and only applies to young men .
women are allowed to join the german army , the bundeswehr , either as professionals or volunteers , but are not obliged to do so .

the capital is also easily the arty-fartiest place in the country .
coincidence ?
dw 's ben knight does n't think so . most of my friends are losers .
i mean that in a good way , obviously .
they are all talented and creative and sometimes even a bit inspired , but they are also , each and every last one of them , work-shy fops .
obviously i am as well : it takes one to know one , as we used to say in primary school .
there 's a great sequence in the movie " trainspotting " where junkie hero renton explains the complex art of staying on the dole .
it entails reverse-psychology tricks like going to a job interview and appearing psychotically eager to work in a leisure center .
the film shows that such efforts require invention , nerve , subtlety , selfishness , discipline and some drugs - the exact elements of a successful artistic career .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an artist at work there is probably no clearer illustration of one of the deeper truths of life in a western european social democracy : the attributes of an artist are exactly the same as the ones you need to successfully maintain your unemployment .
this is heightened in berlin , where it takes the sacrifice of an artist to truly perfect the art of not earning your living .
creative industries there are , they say , some broad similarities between my hometown , manchester , and berlin .
both were throbbing industrial powerhouses in the 19th century , lost their luster and declined in the late 20th century , only to become trendy pop cultural centers in the last 20 years - manchester not so much anymore , but you get the general idea .
both cities have also become famous for hanging their new economic hopes on the " creative industries . "
this very spongy term refers to anything from actor to fashion designer , to independent shopkeeper , to web designer , and includes all the attendant skill sets , cameramen , lighting technicians , office managers etc .
the point is you do n't make anything - you delight , you entertain , you disseminate knowledge and information , or you sing cabaret songs naked in a disused warehouse in front of an audience of twelve .
by capitalizing on the cache and the large student population , the two cities deliberately encouraged a whole class of freelance migrants engaged in some kind of creative endeavor in an attempt to re-invent the city 's economy .
but the similarity with manchester ends when it comes to the social security system .
in berlin , many creative types live - at least partially - on the standard long-term unemployment benefit called hartz iv .
it does n't help the job statistics , but it does mean that the city 's economy is run , to a certain extent , by the welfare state .
social security for the middle class bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unemployment center : the lifeblood of a creative economy when it comes to dealing with the job center to claim your benefits , being an artist is a double-edged sword .
most artists do not earn enough to live from their art , so they are understandably unwilling to mention the meager side earnings their talents bring .
they live double lives : naked dadaist performance artists at night , out-of-work it specialists by day .
but others have a little more nerve , and tell their case manager they are " professional " artists .
if they have a degree as well -lrb- a degree puts you in a different , more exclusive waiting room -rrb- they get special dispensation from the endless round of pointless job applications and interviews that most hartz iv recipients are forced to take .
instead , professional unemployed artists are allowed to count applications for grants and scholarships as their applications , and can get the state to pay for acting lessons .
so there 's a tip , if the hard times are getting to you .
ben knight does n't really think his friends are losers .

now , just third from bottom , stuttgart has decided to dump its coach , jens keller . ivorian didier ya konan scored twice to give hanover a 2-1 win over stuttgart on friday , taking his team to second place in the bundesliga ahead of the weekend 's main soccer action .
the loss was also the final straw for stuttgart 's management , which announced on saturday that it had fired coach jens keller .
after a cautious start by both sides , ya konan had the first major chance of the match in the 20th minute , with a shot that was stopped by stuttgart keeper sven ulreich .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while stuttgart battled back , they were unable to gain a much-needed point the breakthrough came on 35 minutes , after stuttgart left back arthur boka got a defensive foot to a ball from hanover 's lars stindl - only to divert it to ya konan .
the striker took advantage and passed the ball through ulreich 's legs to take his tally for the season to eight .
stuttgart responded positively , pressing throughout the game , and - with just a quarter of an hour to go - managed to equalize as georg niedermeier jumped to head a timo gebhart free kick into the far corner .
the comeback was short-lived .
after another attempt on the hanover goal , this time from philip degen , hanover swiftly counter-attacked .
ya konan latched onto a high ball from christian schulz to score through ulreich 's legs for a second time .
' an exceptional start ' the win means that hanover have already recorded one more victory than in the whole of last season .
" it is exceptional what we have achieved in the first half of the season , " said hanover technical director joerg schmadtke .
stuttgart is now without a win in its last five games and is third from the bottom with only 12 points from 16 games .
this dreary realization was enough for the team to pull the plug on jen keller 's 59-day rein as head coach .

standing alongside serb prime minister mirko cvetkovic , he said that the eu " regrets the decision of serbia not to attend " the ceremony and added that serbia was " expected to embrace euro values and coordinate " with partners .
his words had a deep impact : while the foreign minister of serbia had originally defended the country 's decision not to attend the ceremony , serbia decided to send its ombudsman for human rights , sasa jankovic , to oslo .
serbia was the only eu candidate that originally decided to stay away from the ceremony honoring chinese human rights activist liu xiaobo .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the chinese government refused to let liu xiaobo attend the ceremony : his seat remained empty after the announcement of this year 's laureate , china had protested against the nobel committee 's decision and had urged other countries to boycott the ceremony .
serbia followed china 's call , as it relies on chinese government support for serbia 's opposition to an independent kosovo .
caught between a rock and a hard place but serbia is caught in a clash of interests , because it wants to join the 27-nation bloc of the european union .
fuele and other eu representatives clarified that serbia needed to comply with the joint decision of eu member states to send representatives to oslo in order not to lessen its chances of becoming a member state .
pedrag simic , political scientist at the university of belgrad says that despite serbia 's goal to join the european union , the country would still rely on four pillars of international politics - brussels , washington , moscow , and peking .
" a small country can only follow one superpower , " he said .
simic added that serbia 's attempts to be loyal to both china and the european union had to result in a dilemma such as the current one at some point .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : focus : china and the west - cooperation , competition and confrontation china flexed its muscles in 2010 us has fallen in esteem of many chinese predictions of america 's demise as superpower are greatly exaggerated does beijing have a grip on germany 's sinologists ? human rights -pipe- 10.12.2010 " on the day when liu xiaobo is absent at the nobel prize ceremony " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tienchi martin-liao tienchi martin-liao , president of the independent chinese pen center , a position that liu xiaobo has also held , has her own thoughts . today is the day when liu xiaobo receives the nobel peace prize .
in its one-hundred-year history , this is the first time that the prize is awarded to a chinese citizen .
yet , the laureate , his family members , and even close friends are incarcerated in their own country .
no one can come to receive the award . the scottish pen has produced a " liu xiaobo chair " , which has been sent over to oslo .
now it stands in the city hall .
this empty chair is a reminder that its owner , who should enjoy the highest international honor today , is absent from the ceremony , banquet and concert , which are devoted to him . the host country 's king , the queen , european royal families , foreign ambassadors and representatives , as well as guests from overseas gather in the bright hall decorated with flowers and make a toast to xiaobo .
but many of us are still melancholy , and we ask , where is liu xiaobo and his beloved liu xia ?
let us travel through time and space and visit liu xia first . we are in haidian district , beijing , yuyuantan south road number 9 .
from a distance one can see the white building where the lius live .
the police cars are parked in front of the house ; several policemen parade around .
journalists from far and near are cordoned off some hundred meters away .
no one is allowed to get into the forbidden zone . thin , with a shaven head -lrb- or short-cropped hair -rrb- , liu xia is sitting alone in the empty home .
rinse the ashtray the coffee table wiped take the glass cups boil two cups of longjing or oolong aside the table you sit looking at the cup in front of the empty seat stare at the cup , listen is there the move of key in the hole ...
the cup in the hand , you take a sip lifted the cup to the sun cup and your fingers penetrated by the sun palm was stained by the transparent green delicate a hint of panic is there too the cup on the opposite site you know will be empty for a long time it takes long till the man opens your door -lrb- from liu ’ s poem " sunshine and cups - to my little finger , who drinks tea every day " -rrb- liu xia may wait for a long time , maybe another ten years .
now we visit xiaobo in jinzhou prison in the small chinese town nanshan in liaoning province .
entering the gate , we see several scattered buildings .
surprisingly , we see a huge office wall on which is written boldly ' 1984 ' .
a few months ago , liu xia , accompanied by the stainless steel mouse liu di , wang jinbo , mo zhixu and wang zhongxia , came here for a visit .
they were amazed at orwell ’ s rebirth in a chinese prison . snickering , they took pictures in front of the " 1984 wall " .
several officers rushed to them and took them into custody .
separately , they were interrogated for hours . we enter xiaobo ’ s cell now .
he shares with five other prisoners a 3 by 4 meter space .
his head is bald , shaved like an ordinary criminal .
his body is swollen by the padded jacket and trousers .
scarf , hat and gloves are a must in the cell because the concrete floor of the prison is cold .
the small window beneath the high ceiling is always open .
in winter , the indoor temperature is higher than outdoors ; it is a few degrees above zero .
the odor of the open toilet bucket in the corner is neutralized by the cold air , but one can not ignore the stench of the daily waste of several men .
the smell not only fills the room , it penetrates through clothes , and into the pores of the skin . this is the first winter that xiaobo spends in a prison in northern china .
he will have to adjust himself to the circumstances .
he does not know whether he will have frostbite .
to sit and lie on the concrete floors all year round may cause neck and spine pain and lead to kidney problems .
his stomach disease has given him a hard time since his imprisonment .
xiaobo has exited his cell today , but he does not want to show it to others otherwise his cell-mates might become cynical and angry .
sitting there , his thoughts fly to oslo .
he has had constant dreams about it .
who will be there at the ceremony ?
who will receive the prize for me ?
it could not be liu xia .
she has not sent any sign of life for a while .
my acceptance speech is long written in my head , but who can read it out aloud for me ?
does the king wear a majestic tuxedo , and the queen her crown at the banquet ?
will the distinguished guests think of the dead in tiananmen square and the tiananmen mothers and make a toast ?
sitting in the dungeon , xiaobo does not know that the announcement of his award induced a tsunami in zhongnanhai , and the rulers had a mild concussion , followed by delusions : they believe that their enemies are all over the world , so the grip on the naughty writers and the guy who held the crab dinner party must be tightened .
they must not go outside the country , otherwise they could endanger national security .
liu xiaobo ’ s dinner on december 10 , 2010 may look like this : boiled vegetables with sand , and a few pieces of fat meat as a special treat .
he might have an extra piece of steamed bread , and his rice bowl could also be refilled today .
in short , it is a privileged meal that will long be remembered , because it is a meal that will leave the stomach truly filled .
after all , he is the first chinese to win the nobel peace prize .

after pressure from china , 20 nations have said they wo n't be attending the ceremony . a total of 65 countries have embassies in the norwegian capital of oslo and recently they 've all received the same two pieces of mail . an invitation from the nobel prize committee to attend the award ceremony for the 2011 nobel winners and a letter from the chinese embassy requesting they steer clear of the event . " we have noticed that the chinese are very engaged this year , " said geir lundestad , director of the nobel institute .
" they want as few nations as possible to accept the invitation .
now we 'll see who does not come for political reasons and who have other reasons . " the nobel committee has said 44 nations will be sending envoys to the ceremony , including eu member states , the united states , japan , india , south korea , south africa , indonesia and brazil . political , social motives bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at the ceremony , 20 countries will have empty chairs but another 20 countries have said they will not be in attendance .
serbia cited its interest in maintaining good relations with china for its absence , but other countries , including russia , are offering other reasons .
moscow has said scheduling difficulties - not political considerations - were keeping it away . but the scheduling conflicts veil russia 's political motive not to attend , according to sergei lukashevsky , the head of moscow 's sakharov museum . " that russia is not participating in the nobel peace prize 's award ceremony once again makes it clear that human rights do not play a prominent role in our foreign policy , " he said . " russia and china are members of the shanghai organization for cooperation and one of its goals is the fight against so-called extremism , " lukashevsky added .
" what that really means is that the countries support each other when it comes to fighting uncomfortable political situations . several countries in the middle east as well as afghanistan , pakistan and the philippines are also avoiding the ceremony because for economic and political reasons , according to rainer sollich , head of deutsche welle 's arabic department . " they are all states that have problems concerning human rights and operate under the understanding that they would n't want china at a ceremony honoring someone they view as an opponent of their regime . " china 's confucius prize china 's policy regarding the award ceremony and the still-imprisoned dissident liu has been clear .
referring to the nobel committee , chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman jiang yu said , " we will not change because of interference by a few clowns . " beijing awarded its own version of the nobel peace prize on thursday by giving the " confucius peace prize " to former taiwan vice-president lien chan .
like with liu 's nobel , chan was not in attendance to claim the award and his office said he was unaware of the prize . china has blocked access to the website of norwegian broadcaster nrk , the station said on thursday .
access to the bbc and cnn has also been affected ahead of friday 's ceremony , according to nrk . conspicuous absence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more protests in support of liu are scheduled for thursday friday will mark only the second time in the more than 100-year history of the prize that neither the laureate nor a representative will be able to come accept the award .
german journalist and pacifist carl von ossietzky , who was locked up in a nazi concentration camp , could not travel to oslo for his prize ceremony in 1936 . in addition to liu and ossietzky , myanmar 's aung san suu kyi was also barred from receiving her nobel peace prize in 1991 . liu has long been an outspoken opponent of chinese leadership in beijing and was at the forefront of the 1989 tiananmen square protests .
he was jailed in december 2009 for 11 years on subversion charges after co-authoring " charter 08 , " a manifesto that called for political reform in china . nobel officials said an empty chair would be used to represent liu 's absence . the 20 nations which will not attend the nobel ceremony are : afghanistan , china , colombia , cuba , egypt , iran , iraq , kazakhstan , morocco , pakistan , the philippines , russia , saudi arabia , serbia , sri lanka , sudan , tunisia , ukraine , venezuela and vietnam . authors : matthias von hein , jegor winogradow / sms -lrb- afp -rrb- editor : jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

meanwhile , chinese pressure seems to have galvanized western democracies . it will forever remain the symbol of this year 's nobel peace prize ceremony in oslo .
as dignitaries from around the world stood and applauded , norwegian nobel committee chairman thorbjoern jagland placed the blue clad nobel diploma on the empty chair , where liu xiaobo would have sat .
liu , a 54-year-old literary critic and democracy advocate , is serving an 11-year prison sentence for subversion , handed down last year after he co-authored a bold appeal for human rights and political reform .
a sign of china 's weakness in his speech at the ceremony , jagland noted liu 's imprisonment and regretted that he was not present to receive the award .
" this fact alone shows that the award was necessary and appropriate , " jagland said . he added that despite all of china 's economic strength , its weakness was manifested " in the need to imprison a man for 11 years merely for expressing his opinions on how his country should be governed . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a flower is placed near a picture of liu xiaobo in hong kong on friday liu xiaobo had told his wife that he would like this year ’ s peace prize to be dedicated to " the lost souls from june 4 " .
he was referring to the many activists who died during the firing by government troops on the tiananmen square in beijing .
the nobel committee has accepted his wish .
jagland also said that , although none of the committee ’ s members had ever met liu , " we feel that we know him .
we have studied him closely over a long period of time " .
chinese pressure backfires while china had successfully pressured more than a dozen countries not to attend the ceremony to honor liu xiaobo , it seemed in oslo that its efforts also backfired in a way . after all , it was the chinese government 's pressure which transformed liu into a cause celebre among global rights activists .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chinese citizens clash with troops near tiananmen square in beijing in 1989 moreover , the pressure felt in oslo even hours before the ceremony , seemed to be galvanizing the west , reminding citizens of democracies of the values the nobel peace prize stands for .
china 's pressure tactics had continued unabated on friday .
amnesty international 's oslo representatives said that members of norway 's chinese community were being pressured by chinese diplomats to join anti-nobel protests planned for saturday .
the nobel committee chairman emphasized that the committee ’ s intention had been to make a statement about the relationship between human rights , democracy and peace .
the rights democracies around the world enjoyed today were fought for and won by people who took great risks .
" they did so for others .
that is why liu xiaobo deserves our support , " jagland said .

that doesn ’ t hold true for some other countries . the charge that us foreign policy is hypocritical is all but new , but the wikileaks data release has added some additional fuel to it .
just a few days ago , libya 's leader muammar gaddafi lauded the organization for exposing us " hypocrisy " through its diplomacy conducted behind closed doors , in comments published via the state news agency jana .
according to gaddafi , the leaked cables " proved that america is not what it has led allies and friends to believe it to be " and that " us relations with its allies are hypocritical . "
while there is certainly an expected discrepancy in the tone and style of these confidential reports and the language us diplomats use in public , the cables actually reveal that the us has been largely consistent with the overall messages and themes it conveys to its international partners in private and in public , argue scholars interviewed by deutsche welle . " there 's nothing in these cables that is different from what we actually know about us foreign policy without these cables , " says thomas risse , director of the center for transnational relations , foreign and security policy at the free university of berlin .
" the whole approach by these people from wikileaks seems to be that there is a public side to us foreign policy and then there is this secret side and that there is some sort conspiracy involved in all this , " he says .
" and i do n't see a huge mismatch actually between what the us says in public and what it does . "
clear goals one of the dominant topics in these cables are us security interests and the fact that washington considers transnational terrorism a major threat , adds risse : " that is exactly what barack obama and hillary clinton would say every day . "
the same is true for other top issues such as the iranian nuclear program , the spread of nuclear and ballistic missiles and the stabilization of afghanistan , says dan reiter , a professor of international relations at emory university in atlanta : " at the broadest level i think the cables reveal that the goals the us is engaging in private are essentially similar to the goals that it is espousing in public . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : saudi king abdullah urged the president barack obama to take action against iran asked whether the insights gained from reading the frank assessments of diplomats engaged in shaping and carrying out us foreign policy will alter their view of the us role or status in the world , risse and reiter both answer with a resounding no . " the us is not an empire , there are very clear limits to us influence in the world , " says risse .
" of course the us is a superpower .
it has interests in all corners of the world , it does try to influence other governments , but that 's ok .
there 's nothing that would get me worked up about this at all . "
no puppet master the cables are " not terribly surprising , " notes reiter .
" one does n't get an image of the united states as this all-powerful puppet master trying to pull the strings of various governments around the world to serve its corporate interests .
that 's an image which does not emerge . "
instead , the cables paint a picture of the us acting as one would expect a major power to do so , adds reiter .
" i do n't think that anything we see is terribly different from the way most states have conducted their foreign policy in the modern era . "
what 's more surprising to the analysts is the behavior of arab countries that becomes evident in the cables .
while the opposition of arab states to iran 's nuclear program has been known in foreign policy circles for some time , the contrast between confidential assessments made in private and public statements is particularly stark . double talk " the level of hypocrisy that comes out of these cables is much higher for instance in the middle east , " says risse .
" it 's very clear from these cables that most arab states feel really threatened by iranian nuclear power , however they would never say that in public .
in fact , they say the opposite in public . "
according to the cables , king abdullah of saudi arabia and king hamed ibn isa khalifa of bahrain are among arab leaders who pressed the us to attack iran .
king abdullah repeatedly exhorted the united states to " cut off the head of the snake " and take military action against tehran 's nuclear facilities .
open questions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : to evaluate the cables properly , scholars need more information about the documents in contrast to that , conclude the experts , the general outlines of us foreign policy are pretty much in sync with what the wikileaks documents have revealed so far and they have n't unearthed anything entirely unexpected .
nevertheless , argues risse , the document dump still poses a serious problem : " if you look at these cables from the perspective of an academic or historian , the real big question is what is the sample , ? " says risse . " is this a random selection , is this a selection that is representative of the whole or what exactly is it .
we have absolutely no way to judge this . "
risse notes , that even if all 250,000 cables are published in the end , it is still not clear how large a sample this is , how relevant the cables are or were in the decision-making processes for us officials and what the criteria were to publish them .
without those answers , many of which could be provided by wikileaks , a thorough assessment of the cables and its content wo n't be possible . author : michael knigge editor : rob mudge send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

now , just third from bottom , stuttgart has decided to dump its coach , jens keller . ivorian didier ya konan scored twice to give hanover a 2-1 win over stuttgart on friday , taking his team to second place in the bundesliga ahead of the weekend 's main soccer action .
the loss was also the final straw for stuttgart 's management , which announced on saturday that it had fired coach jens keller .
after a cautious start by both sides , ya konan had the first major chance of the match in the 20th minute , with a shot that was stopped by stuttgart keeper sven ulreich .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while stuttgart battled back , they were unable to gain a much-needed point the breakthrough came on 35 minutes , after stuttgart left back arthur boka got a defensive foot to a ball from hanover 's lars stindl - only to divert it to ya konan .
the striker took advantage and passed the ball through ulreich 's legs to take his tally for the season to eight .
stuttgart responded positively , pressing throughout the game , and - with just a quarter of an hour to go - managed to equalize as georg niedermeier jumped to head a timo gebhart free kick into the far corner .
the comeback was short-lived .
after another attempt on the hanover goal , this time from philip degen , hanover swiftly counter-attacked .
ya konan latched onto a high ball from christian schulz to score through ulreich 's legs for a second time .
' an exceptional start ' the win means that hanover have already recorded one more victory than in the whole of last season .
" it is exceptional what we have achieved in the first half of the season , " said hanover technical director joerg schmadtke .
stuttgart is now without a win in its last five games and is third from the bottom with only 12 points from 16 games .
this dreary realization was enough for the team to pull the plug on jen keller 's 59-day rein as head coach .
the hottest prospect to replace him is bruno labaddia , who coached hamburg until the end of april .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : focus : wikileaks disclosures wikileaks exposes shell 's infiltration of nigeria 's government wikileaks release could lead to shift from transparency to secrecy opinion : wikileaks is a test of us commitment to free press opinion : wikileaks ' latest release is a diplomatic waterloo international relations -pipe- 10.12.2010 wikileaks cables show consistent us foreign policy , say experts großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there 's no huge clash between public and private goals of the us state department contrary to oft-stated claims , the wikileaks cables show no huge credibility gap between official us policies and what diplomats write in confidential cables , say experts .
that doesn ’ t hold true for some other countries . the charge that us foreign policy is hypocritical is all but new , but the wikileaks data release has added some additional fuel to it .
just a few days ago , libya 's leader muammar gaddafi lauded the organization for exposing us " hypocrisy " through its diplomacy conducted behind closed doors , in comments published via the state news agency jana .
according to gaddafi , the leaked cables " proved that america is not what it has led allies and friends to believe it to be " and that " us relations with its allies are hypocritical . "
while there is certainly an expected discrepancy in the tone and style of these confidential reports and the language us diplomats use in public , the cables actually reveal that the us has been largely consistent with the overall messages and themes it conveys to its international partners in private and in public , argue scholars interviewed by deutsche welle . " there 's nothing in these cables that is different from what we actually know about us foreign policy without these cables , " says thomas risse , director of the center for transnational relations , foreign and security policy at the free university of berlin .
" the whole approach by these people from wikileaks seems to be that there is a public side to us foreign policy and then there is this secret side and that there is some sort conspiracy involved in all this , " he says .
" and i do n't see a huge mismatch actually between what the us says in public and what it does . "
clear goals one of the dominant topics in these cables are us security interests and the fact that washington considers transnational terrorism a major threat , adds risse : " that is exactly what barack obama and hillary clinton would say every day . "
the same is true for other top issues such as the iranian nuclear program , the spread of nuclear and ballistic missiles and the stabilization of afghanistan , says dan reiter , a professor of international relations at emory university in atlanta : " at the broadest level i think the cables reveal that the goals the us is engaging in private are essentially similar to the goals that it is espousing in public . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : saudi king abdullah urged the president barack obama to take action against iran asked whether the insights gained from reading the frank assessments of diplomats engaged in shaping and carrying out us foreign policy will alter their view of the us role or status in the world , risse and reiter both answer with a resounding no . " the us is not an empire , there are very clear limits to us influence in the world , " says risse .
" of course the us is a superpower .
it has interests in all corners of the world , it does try to influence other governments , but that 's ok .
there 's nothing that would get me worked up about this at all . "
no puppet master the cables are " not terribly surprising , " notes reiter .
" one does n't get an image of the united states as this all-powerful puppet master trying to pull the strings of various governments around the world to serve its corporate interests .
that 's an image which does not emerge . "
instead , the cables paint a picture of the us acting as one would expect a major power to do so , adds reiter .
" i do n't think that anything we see is terribly different from the way most states have conducted their foreign policy in the modern era . "
what 's more surprising to the analysts is the behavior of arab countries that becomes evident in the cables .
while the opposition of arab states to iran 's nuclear program has been known in foreign policy circles for some time , the contrast between confidential assessments made in private and public statements is particularly stark . double talk " the level of hypocrisy that comes out of these cables is much higher for instance in the middle east , " says risse .
" it 's very clear from these cables that most arab states feel really threatened by iranian nuclear power , however they would never say that in public .
in fact , they say the opposite in public . "
according to the cables , king abdullah of saudi arabia and king hamed ibn isa khalifa of bahrain are among arab leaders who pressed the us to attack iran .
king abdullah repeatedly exhorted the united states to " cut off the head of the snake " and take military action against tehran 's nuclear facilities .
open questions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : to evaluate the cables properly , scholars need more information about the documents in contrast to that , conclude the experts , the general outlines of us foreign policy are pretty much in sync with what the wikileaks documents have revealed so far and they have n't unearthed anything entirely unexpected .
nevertheless , argues risse , the document dump still poses a serious problem : " if you look at these cables from the perspective of an academic or historian , the real big question is what is the sample , ? " says risse . " is this a random selection , is this a selection that is representative of the whole or what exactly is it .
we have absolutely no way to judge this . "
risse notes , that even if all 250,000 cables are published in the end , it is still not clear how large a sample this is , how relevant the cables are or were in the decision-making processes for us officials and what the criteria were to publish them .
without those answers , many of which could be provided by wikileaks , a thorough assessment of the cables and its content wo n't be possible . author : michael knigge editor : rob mudge send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the us has sprung a " leaki " in its " weaki " and does n't like it one " bitty . "

it 's a witch hunt to divert blame from the people who should be overseeing us security .

whose fault is it that thousands of secret documents were released ? - wayne , us definitely not .

no extradition of julian assange .

they think an insult to us is immoral , and that they are somehow better than the rest of us .
they are just greedy , self-important and power-obsessed .
everything they touch is tarnished .
they are so last century .
bring on the rise of china and india !
how dare they think they can " spy " on other countries in the un ! - brian , ireland if any european country extradites julian assange to the united states , it will be for a political " crime . "
is europe the running dog of the us , or a group of sovereign nations dedicated to freedom of the press , freedom of the individual and people having the right to know what is going on ?
kevin rudd claims that the core problem is the failure by the us to protect its diplomatic communications .
i think the core problem is the behavior of the us .
the reason that wikileaks has not released the diplomatic communications of other countries -lrb- eg : germany , australia -rrb- is that they are better behaved and do not goose-step on the world stage , trying to take over the world . - charles , australia i believe that having all that " secret " info available for everybody to learn was not the " status quo " however it was disclosed and it is done .
the fellow in jail in the united kingdom is actually a journalist devoted to inform the public .
if he ever is extradited to the us he can claim " freedom of expression . "
now , in terms of those " ladies " claiming sex crimes , that is a bit doubtful .
they have waited until now , come on !
i believe that it was a politically manipulated act to get him behind bars .
and if those allegedly " crimes " were committed in sweden , should n't he then be extradited to that country ? - elena , us no .
he 's a hero who has struck a powerful blow for freedom !
he should be given the medal of freedom award ! - michael , us no , he should not be extradited to the us ; he has not been charged with any us crime .
whatever one thinks about wikileaks , mr. assange is taking a principled stand against the establishment for personal convictions and at great risk to himself .
if the political solution is to restrict freedom of the internet it will amplify assange 's stance : that many elected politicians are duplicitous control freaks who need their over-used and abused powers curtailed .
he deserves respect , support and applause for his courage . - a. , japan i believe that assange is being targeted for what he did .
if he 's found guilty of real sexual misconduct , i believe he should be punished , but as far as the internet crap , i believe he 'll prevail .
he 'll probably either wimp out for future stuff , or he 'll feel more emboldened .
i 'd like to see the hackers messing with mastercard put to be punished though .
it causes too many undeserving people a lot of pain . - joe , us i am completely baffled by the case .
mr. assange has been arrested in a country -lrb- uk -rrb- which belongs to the interpol group of countries so , according to the rules , he might be obviously extradited to sweden - country which relies on " the rules " within the interpol group .
at the same time , mr. assange has been accused of allegedly having broken the law of another country -lrb- usa -rrb- which is also in the interpol group .
in addition , his own country -lrb- australia -rrb- has now given a hint of standing up for him by offering him legal help , not ruling out his extradition to australia -lrb- being also the interpol member . -rrb-
in addition , there is the international court of justice in the hague -lrb- operating within the uno . -rrb-

products from traditional european toymakers like lego and playmobil are in high demand . german parents typically spend oodles on their kids for christmas .
but with the buoyant economy this season , they 're spending even more .
so much more , in fact , that retailers are scrambling to stock hot products , like playmobil 's " robo-gangster " toy car with figures or lego 's " stars wars " spaceship .
some manufacturers now warn they may no longer be able to fulfill everyone 's christmas wish .
" we know that from now until christmas demand will be growing daily -lrb- so -rrb- we ca n't guarantee 100 percent that every product will be available right up to december 24 , " said dirk engehausen , the lego deutschland managing director , in an interview with the german news station n-tv .
other german and european manufacturers have a similar holiday message to convey : they have n't run out of any products yet , but supplies are depleting fast and finding the one or other popular product a few days before christmas could prove to be a real treasure hunt .
hurry while the supply lasts " none of our products have completely sold out in germany but some stores have run out of select products , " playmobil spokeswoman judith schweinitz told deutsche welle .
" if you 're really determined to find these , you will but you might have to look around . "
while manufacturers had projected stronger holiday sales , few if any thought they would so strong .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : children in germany can expect plenty of gifts this year " we anticipated more demand this christmas but we 're surprised nevertheless by how huge the demand has been , " said heinrich huentelsmann , a ravensburger spokesperson .
" our tiptoi product , for instance , is still available but is becoming hard to find . "
that toy is one of the few that the german maker of games , puzzle and toys manufacturers in china .
more than 85 percent of its products are made in europe .
" we can react very quickly to demand in europe because most of our production is here , " huentelsmann told deutsche welle .
" we do n't have long logistics paths . "
ravensburger expects it will be able to deliver all products right up to christmas , he said .
but the company is n't making any guarantees .
anticipating greater demand this year , lego delivered 10 percent more products to retailers in advance of the holiday shopping season , according to company spokeswoman helena seppelfricke .
but with some products , like the company 's classic fire department set and " technik " series , in huge demand , she admits the company could easily have delivered more .
" same procedure " most european traditional toymakers including lego , which is based in denmark with additional production sites in hungary , the czech republic and mexico , show their new products at trade events early in the year and begin talks with its buyer at the same time .
however , their ability to boost production to meet unexpected christmas demand generally decreases the closer the holiday shopping season approaches .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : playmobil toys are as popular as ever " it 's pretty much the same procedure every year , " said steffen kahnt , deputy director of germany 's federal association of toy retailer -lrb- bvs -rrb- .
" retailers need to decide how many products to order and manufacturers how many to make .
but no one really knows what the demand will be , especially for new products .
so you hope you make the right call . "
stockpiling products is n't a viable option in the competitive toy sector , according to kahnt .
both manufacturers and retailers , he says , strive to have only as much stock as they see necessary to better control their operating costs .
that said , the industry may want to up production for the 2011 gift season , if the past 24 months are any indication .
record-breaking sales " more products were actually sold last year than the year before , " kahnt said .
" that surprised us .
but no one really thought that sales this year would be so good . "
the german toy industry association -lrb- dvsi -rrb- expects sales to increase six percent this to 2.52 billion euros , compared to 2.38 billion euros the year .
if that mark is reached , the holiday sales will be a huge factor .
retailers generate more than 40 percent of their annual revenue during the holiday shopping season .
for sure , numbers like these will make manufacturers and retailers happy .
their big challenge now is to deliver enough toys to make kids – and their parents – just as happy .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de development policy -pipe- 10.12.2010 opinion : poor countries can afford social protection großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sub-saharan nation of lesotho has established a pension system that costs less than two percent of gni a recent report suggests that even poor countries can afford basic social protection schemes - and these schemes pay off in terms of economic development , argues commentator dr markus loewe . the recommendations made in this week 's european report on development , drafted by the florence-based european university institute in florence and funded by the european commission and some european union member states , will surprise few experts .
what is remarkable about this latest report is how clearly its authors , most of whom are economists , advocate stronger government engagement in social policies - even in the low-income countries of sub-saharan africa .
basic social protection schemes , the authors suggest , could contribute to growth and poverty reduction , and assist developing countries in reaching the millennium development goals .
the report draws on recent research that highlights the importance of social protection to the economic and political development of countries .
people without access to a social safety net risk falling -lrb- even deeper -rrb- into poverty when faced with a shock like illness or a bad harvest .
they may then have to turn to savings , sell livestock or other assets or send their children to work rather than school in order to finance their daily needs .
in this way , they lose means of livelihoods that might otherwise help them to establish at least a modest existence on their own .
more seriously , households without social protection tend to shy away from investing savings at the outset , instead hoarding income to stay liquid and to prepare for a possible loss of future income or unexpected expenditures .
empirical studies suggest that families , and especially those who work in the informal sector , are more likely to invest when they have access to basic social protection schemes . such investment promotes economic growth precisely where it is most likely to help reduce poverty .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : where families have no safety net , they may be forced to sell income-producing assets like cattle in hard times finally , social protection schemes contribute to political stability .
by reducing poverty and economic insecurity , they lower the chances that a people will resort to violence to achieve political aims .
above all , though , such schemes show citizens that the state feels responsible and cares for them .
many studies point out that , where public social protection schemes exist , citizens identify more closely with the state and show a willingness to fulfill their obligations to the community .
so basic social protection helps not only to reduce poverty but also acts as insurance for business activities and the material basis of a social contract accepted by every citizen .
many will ask how low-income countries can be expected to finance social protection schemes - and rightly so .
it is rarely the case that the majority of a population is covered by social protection systems that the members themselves finance through contributions - social and private insurance schemes and community-based mutual insurance associations , for instance .
this is because , in low-income countries especially , contributions to such schemes are too high for many people .
at the same time , the idea of social transfer schemes financed by the state from tax revenues is often rejected on the grounds that governments in low-income countries do not enjoy wide enough budget margins to be able to fund such schemes .
yet this year 's european report on development -lrb- erd -rrb- reflects a turning point in the academic debate .
even low-income countries that can not afford comprehensive social protection for all their citizens can find satisfactory solutions for particularly vulnerable groups .
for example lesotho , among other african countries , has created a tax-financed system that grants a modest flat pension to everybody over a certain age .
although lesotho is a poor country , the program costs less than two percent of gross national income , and in many households it benefits not only the elderly but also their student grandchildren who want to lay better foundations for their later working lives .
similarly , ethiopia has developed a program that provides poor families jobs in rural infrastructure construction .
the international labor organization estimates that the total cost of establishing both of these programs as well as an unconditional cash transfer program for orphans would not exceed six percent of national income in any sub-saharan african country .
unfortunately , the 2010 erd does not explain how and by whom social protection is to be organized where the state is unwilling or unable to do so .
in such cases , social protection can be provided only by non-governmental actors through , for example , micro-insurance schemes .
the erd restricts the definition of social protection to action conducted by the state , and so does not consider this course of action .
where efficient government does not exist , self-help in the shape of , say , mutual insurance continues to be the only way out .
this is now true of a quarter to a half of all countries in sub-saharan africa , as noted in last year 's erd .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de development policy -pipe- 10.12.2010 opinion : poor countries can afford social protection großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sub-saharan nation of lesotho has established a pension system that costs less than two percent of gni a recent report suggests that even poor countries can afford basic social protection schemes - and these schemes pay off in terms of economic development , argues commentator dr markus loewe . the recommendations made in this week 's european report on development , drafted by the florence-based european university institute in florence and funded by the european commission and some european union member states , will surprise few experts .
what is remarkable about this latest report is how clearly its authors , most of whom are economists , advocate stronger government engagement in social policies - even in the low-income countries of sub-saharan africa .
basic social protection schemes , the authors suggest , could contribute to growth and poverty reduction , and assist developing countries in reaching the millennium development goals .
the report draws on recent research that highlights the importance of social protection to the economic and political development of countries .
people without access to a social safety net risk falling -lrb- even deeper -rrb- into poverty when faced with a shock like illness or a bad harvest .
they may then have to turn to savings , sell livestock or other assets or send their children to work rather than school in order to finance their daily needs .
in this way , they lose means of livelihoods that might otherwise help them to establish at least a modest existence on their own .
more seriously , households without social protection tend to shy away from investing savings at the outset , instead hoarding income to stay liquid and to prepare for a possible loss of future income or unexpected expenditures .
empirical studies suggest that families , and especially those who work in the informal sector , are more likely to invest when they have access to basic social protection schemes . such investment promotes economic growth precisely where it is most likely to help reduce poverty .

not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content .
australia offers support to wikileaks founder , operation payback begins should assange be extradited to the united states ?
why ?
he did not spy , he did not steal all the data that was passed along to him - nor is he a us citizen .
the us has been caught with the pants way down and of course , does n't like it one bit .
the us has sprung a " leaki " in its " weaki " and does n't like it one " bitty . "
as the saying goes … those who live in glass houses should not be throwing stones . - vera , germany i believe asange did bring out the true colors of individuals , opinion makers and governments in the present context of world politics .
everyone should admire his forthright exposure , however bitter it may be ; more so the americans who expect democracies and freedom to speech to flourish around the globe .
extradition and implicating him will only show the us in bad light . - mohan , india no , he should n't be extradited .
it 's a witch hunt to divert blame from the people who should be overseeing us security .
we 've paid good money for homeland security .
whose fault is it that thousands of secret documents were released ? - wayne , us definitely not .
supporting corruption and lack of common sense has been the m.o. for too long .
someone needs to wake up the people over here , wikileaks is a good start . - gene , us the us has only itself to blame for the leaks ... its a schoolyard bully that 's now having a tantrum and calling on its buddies to help it in a scrap because it knows it ca n't nuke everyone that does n't agree with it .
in australia the us is seen as a gutless mongrel that will do anything to get its own way especially concerning energy drilling . - tom , australia julian assange is a xxi century hero , in the sixties the fight against the empire was with " guerrillas , " today the fight is with internet .
and he 's going to win . - crstina , spain the us is paranoid about wikileaks .
a typical response of killing the messenger .
no extradition of julian assange .
the eu should promote transparency and be more open about foreign policies and clarity of diplomatic mores in language . - j. , the netherlands no way jose !
who cares about america ?
not me anyway : -rrb- i 'm so happy about wikileaks and anything that harms america .
they think an insult to us is immoral , and that they are somehow better than the rest of us .
they are just greedy , self-important and power-obsessed .
everything they touch is tarnished .
they are so last century .
bring on the rise of china and india !
how dare they think they can " spy " on other countries in the un ! - brian , ireland if any european country extradites julian assange to the united states , it will be for a political " crime . "
is europe the running dog of the us , or a group of sovereign nations dedicated to freedom of the press , freedom of the individual and people having the right to know what is going on ?
kevin rudd claims that the core problem is the failure by the us to protect its diplomatic communications .
i think the core problem is the behavior of the us .
the reason that wikileaks has not released the diplomatic communications of other countries -lrb- eg : germany , australia -rrb- is that they are better behaved and do not goose-step on the world stage , trying to take over the world . - charles , australia i believe that having all that " secret " info available for everybody to learn was not the " status quo " however it was disclosed and it is done .
the fellow in jail in the united kingdom is actually a journalist devoted to inform the public .
if he ever is extradited to the us he can claim " freedom of expression . "
now , in terms of those " ladies " claiming sex crimes , that is a bit doubtful .
they have waited until now , come on !
i believe that it was a politically manipulated act to get him behind bars .
and if those allegedly " crimes " were committed in sweden , should n't he then be extradited to that country ? - elena , us no .
he 's a hero who has struck a powerful blow for freedom !
he should be given the medal of freedom award ! - michael , us no , he should not be extradited to the us ; he has not been charged with any us crime .
whatever one thinks about wikileaks , mr. assange is taking a principled stand against the establishment for personal convictions and at great risk to himself .
if the political solution is to restrict freedom of the internet it will amplify assange 's stance : that many elected politicians are duplicitous control freaks who need their over-used and abused powers curtailed .
he deserves respect , support and applause for his courage . - a. , japan i believe that assange is being targeted for what he did .
if he 's found guilty of real sexual misconduct , i believe he should be punished , but as far as the internet crap , i believe he 'll prevail .
he 'll probably either wimp out for future stuff , or he 'll feel more emboldened .
i 'd like to see the hackers messing with mastercard put to be punished though .
it causes too many undeserving people a lot of pain . - joe , us i am completely baffled by the case .
mr. assange has been arrested in a country -lrb- uk -rrb- which belongs to the interpol group of countries so , according to the rules , he might be obviously extradited to sweden - country which relies on " the rules " within the interpol group .
at the same time , mr. assange has been accused of allegedly having broken the law of another country -lrb- usa -rrb- which is also in the interpol group .
in addition , his own country -lrb- australia -rrb- has now given a hint of standing up for him by offering him legal help , not ruling out his extradition to australia -lrb- being also the interpol member . -rrb-
in addition , there is the international court of justice in the hague -lrb- operating within the uno . -rrb-
so international law , respective rules of law of the countries mentioned , international organizations -lrb- interpol , uno , eu -rrb- are all to be bundled in this case which is too much intricate to the ' untrained eye ' in this " legal maze .

in its one-hundred-year history , this is the first time that the prize is awarded to a chinese citizen .
yet , the laureate , his family members , and even close friends are incarcerated in their own country .
no one can come to receive the award . the scottish pen has produced a " liu xiaobo chair " , which has been sent over to oslo .
now it stands in the city hall .
this empty chair is a reminder that its owner , who should enjoy the highest international honor today , is absent from the ceremony , banquet and concert , which are devoted to him . the host country 's king , the queen , european royal families , foreign ambassadors and representatives , as well as guests from overseas gather in the bright hall decorated with flowers and make a toast to xiaobo .
but many of us are still melancholy , and we ask , where is liu xiaobo and his beloved liu xia ?
let us travel through time and space and visit liu xia first . we are in haidian district , beijing , yuyuantan south road number 9 .
from a distance one can see the white building where the lius live .
the police cars are parked in front of the house ; several policemen parade around .
journalists from far and near are cordoned off some hundred meters away .
no one is allowed to get into the forbidden zone . thin , with a shaven head -lrb- or short-cropped hair -rrb- , liu xia is sitting alone in the empty home .
rinse the ashtray the coffee table wiped take the glass cups boil two cups of longjing or oolong aside the table you sit looking at the cup in front of the empty seat stare at the cup , listen is there the move of key in the hole ...
the cup in the hand , you take a sip lifted the cup to the sun cup and your fingers penetrated by the sun palm was stained by the transparent green delicate a hint of panic is there too the cup on the opposite site you know will be empty for a long time it takes long till the man opens your door -lrb- from liu ’ s poem " sunshine and cups - to my little finger , who drinks tea every day " -rrb- liu xia may wait for a long time , maybe another ten years .
now we visit xiaobo in jinzhou prison in the small chinese town nanshan in liaoning province .
entering the gate , we see several scattered buildings .
surprisingly , we see a huge office wall on which is written boldly ' 1984 ' .
a few months ago , liu xia , accompanied by the stainless steel mouse liu di , wang jinbo , mo zhixu and wang zhongxia , came here for a visit .
they were amazed at orwell ’ s rebirth in a chinese prison . snickering , they took pictures in front of the " 1984 wall " .
several officers rushed to them and took them into custody .
separately , they were interrogated for hours . we enter xiaobo ’ s cell now .
he shares with five other prisoners a 3 by 4 meter space .
his head is bald , shaved like an ordinary criminal .
his body is swollen by the padded jacket and trousers .
scarf , hat and gloves are a must in the cell because the concrete floor of the prison is cold .
the small window beneath the high ceiling is always open .
in winter , the indoor temperature is higher than outdoors ; it is a few degrees above zero .
the odor of the open toilet bucket in the corner is neutralized by the cold air , but one can not ignore the stench of the daily waste of several men .
the smell not only fills the room , it penetrates through clothes , and into the pores of the skin . this is the first winter that xiaobo spends in a prison in northern china .
he will have to adjust himself to the circumstances .
he does not know whether he will have frostbite .
to sit and lie on the concrete floors all year round may cause neck and spine pain and lead to kidney problems .
his stomach disease has given him a hard time since his imprisonment .
xiaobo has exited his cell today , but he does not want to show it to others otherwise his cell-mates might become cynical and angry .
sitting there , his thoughts fly to oslo .
he has had constant dreams about it .
who will be there at the ceremony ?
who will receive the prize for me ?
it could not be liu xia .
she has not sent any sign of life for a while .
my acceptance speech is long written in my head , but who can read it out aloud for me ?
does the king wear a majestic tuxedo , and the queen her crown at the banquet ?
will the distinguished guests think of the dead in tiananmen square and the tiananmen mothers and make a toast ?
sitting in the dungeon , xiaobo does not know that the announcement of his award induced a tsunami in zhongnanhai , and the rulers had a mild concussion , followed by delusions : they believe that their enemies are all over the world , so the grip on the naughty writers and the guy who held the crab dinner party must be tightened .
they must not go outside the country , otherwise they could endanger national security .
liu xiaobo ’ s dinner on december 10 , 2010 may look like this : boiled vegetables with sand , and a few pieces of fat meat as a special treat .
he might have an extra piece of steamed bread , and his rice bowl could also be refilled today .
in short , it is a privileged meal that will long be remembered , because it is a meal that will leave the stomach truly filled .
after all , he is the first chinese to win the nobel peace prize .

now , the project has four other eu member states on baord . on wednesday and thursday , the first meeting of the electric solar wind sail -lrb- esail -rrb- – newly sponsored by the european union - was held at the finnish metereological institute in helsinki .
earlier this year , the european union gave its blessing with 1.7 million euro -lrb- 2.25 million dollars -rrb- to construct laboratory prototypes of the esail project , whose ultimate goal is to launch the sail into space on a one kilogram estonian nanosatellite by the end of 2012 .
esail is now a joint operation with representatives from finland , estonia , germany , italy and sweden .
solar wind is a constant stream of charged particles that emanate from the sun .
a solar sail , which has been used previously , is made of a material that blocks those particles and then propel a spacecraft forward - in the same way a seafaring vessel uses wind to fill its sails .
however , this new finnish design , which was invented in 2006 by pekka janhunen , a researcher at the finnish meteorological institute , creates a " virtual " sail by forming an electric field with a radius of 100 meters from a small wire .
" the field forms an obstacle and so the solar wind particles are scattered in different directions , " he told deutsche welle .
" it 's more like an electric parachute than a sail .
it creates an enhanced friction between the solar wind flow and the wire . "
moving 50 kilometers per second if successful , janhunen added , then anything that this small wire was attached to , could theoretically travel approximately 50 kilometers per second , or " a factor of four or five faster than anything else ever constructed . "
using solar wind as a propulsion system in this way can only really be used between planets , so this type of design would be best for earth-mars , or other types of longer distance missions .
other astronomers are also excited about the prospect of this technology .
" in the other solar sail projects the energy comes from solar photons , the weightless ' light-particles ' .
this project gets the energy from the ions in the solar wind , " explained timo laitinen , an astronomy lecturer at the university of turku in finland , in an interview with deutsche welle .
" the technology is completely different , and to my understanding more feasible than the ' traditional ' solar sail technology . "

that doesn ’ t hold true for some other countries . the charge that us foreign policy is hypocritical is all but new , but the wikileaks data release has added some additional fuel to it .
just a few days ago , libya 's leader muammar gaddafi lauded the organization for exposing us " hypocrisy " through its diplomacy conducted behind closed doors , in comments published via the state news agency jana .
according to gaddafi , the leaked cables " proved that america is not what it has led allies and friends to believe it to be " and that " us relations with its allies are hypocritical . "
while there is certainly an expected discrepancy in the tone and style of these confidential reports and the language us diplomats use in public , the cables actually reveal that the us has been largely consistent with the overall messages and themes it conveys to its international partners in private and in public , argue scholars interviewed by deutsche welle . " there 's nothing in these cables that is different from what we actually know about us foreign policy without these cables , " says thomas risse , director of the center for transnational relations , foreign and security policy at the free university of berlin .
" the whole approach by these people from wikileaks seems to be that there is a public side to us foreign policy and then there is this secret side and that there is some sort conspiracy involved in all this , " he says .
" and i do n't see a huge mismatch actually between what the us says in public and what it does . "
clear goals one of the dominant topics in these cables are us security interests and the fact that washington considers transnational terrorism a major threat , adds risse : " that is exactly what barack obama and hillary clinton would say every day . "
the same is true for other top issues such as the iranian nuclear program , the spread of nuclear and ballistic missiles and the stabilization of afghanistan , says dan reiter , a professor of international relations at emory university in atlanta : " at the broadest level i think the cables reveal that the goals the us is engaging in private are essentially similar to the goals that it is espousing in public . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : saudi king abdullah urged the president barack obama to take action against iran asked whether the insights gained from reading the frank assessments of diplomats engaged in shaping and carrying out us foreign policy will alter their view of the us role or status in the world , risse and reiter both answer with a resounding no . " the us is not an empire , there are very clear limits to us influence in the world , " says risse .
" of course the us is a superpower .
it has interests in all corners of the world , it does try to influence other governments , but that 's ok .
there 's nothing that would get me worked up about this at all . "
no puppet master the cables are " not terribly surprising , " notes reiter .
" one does n't get an image of the united states as this all-powerful puppet master trying to pull the strings of various governments around the world to serve its corporate interests .
that 's an image which does not emerge . "
instead , the cables paint a picture of the us acting as one would expect a major power to do so , adds reiter .
" i do n't think that anything we see is terribly different from the way most states have conducted their foreign policy in the modern era . "
what 's more surprising to the analysts is the behavior of arab countries that becomes evident in the cables .
while the opposition of arab states to iran 's nuclear program has been known in foreign policy circles for some time , the contrast between confidential assessments made in private and public statements is particularly stark . double talk " the level of hypocrisy that comes out of these cables is much higher for instance in the middle east , " says risse .
" it 's very clear from these cables that most arab states feel really threatened by iranian nuclear power , however they would never say that in public .
in fact , they say the opposite in public . "
according to the cables , king abdullah of saudi arabia and king hamed ibn isa khalifa of bahrain are among arab leaders who pressed the us to attack iran .
king abdullah repeatedly exhorted the united states to " cut off the head of the snake " and take military action against tehran 's nuclear facilities .
open questions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : to evaluate the cables properly , scholars need more information about the documents in contrast to that , conclude the experts , the general outlines of us foreign policy are pretty much in sync with what the wikileaks documents have revealed so far and they have n't unearthed anything entirely unexpected .
nevertheless , argues risse , the document dump still poses a serious problem : " if you look at these cables from the perspective of an academic or historian , the real big question is what is the sample , ? " says risse . " is this a random selection , is this a selection that is representative of the whole or what exactly is it .
we have absolutely no way to judge this . "
risse notes , that even if all 250,000 cables are published in the end , it is still not clear how large a sample this is , how relevant the cables are or were in the decision-making processes for us officials and what the criteria were to publish them .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de medicine -pipe- 10.12.2010 british surgeons discover new surgical tool - the ikea pencil großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pencils have more uses than you might think british surgeons have apparently found that the ikea pencil are better at marking out cuts in the bone for facial and head surgery than traditional felt tipped pens , according to a report in the british medical journal . while the popularity of the ikea pencil is widely known - there is even a facebook page called " ikea pencil stealing appreciation " - the idea of sourcing pencils from the swedish furniture store chain for surgery has not been widely disseminated before .
according a report published thursday in the british medical journal -lrb- bmj -rrb- , the tiny pencils have proved very useful when marking bones during surgery .
the authors of the report , karen eley from the nuffield department of surgical sciences at the university of oxford , and stephen watt-smith from the department of maxillofacial surgery at the john radcliffe hospital in oxford , say they were surprised when they were handed an ikea pencil in the middle of an operation .
" as popular as these little pencils are , we were still surprised to be handed one halfway through a surgical case , " they wrote in the report .
" the use of a pencil to mark osteotomy cuts in craniofacial and maxillofacial surgery is well established , proving superior to methylene .
bonney 's blue and felt tipped skin markers struggle to transfer an ink mark to bone , or are washed away by irrigation or tissue fluids . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sometimes it 's just like woodwork a pencil is a pencil but despite the report , surgeons are apparently not brand-loyal . " it 's no different to any other pencil , " eley told deutsche welle , clearing up any misunderstandings .
" the bmj just made it sound like that .
we just thought it was funny that we were in the middle of surgery and asked for a pencil and were handed an ikea one . "
" it 's just like when a carpenter uses a pencil to mark a piece of wood to saw , " she added .
" except bone is a bit harder than wood . "

according a report published thursday in the british medical journal -lrb- bmj -rrb- , the tiny pencils have proved very useful when marking bones during surgery .
the authors of the report , karen eley from the nuffield department of surgical sciences at the university of oxford , and stephen watt-smith from the department of maxillofacial surgery at the john radcliffe hospital in oxford , say they were surprised when they were handed an ikea pencil in the middle of an operation .
" as popular as these little pencils are , we were still surprised to be handed one halfway through a surgical case , " they wrote in the report .
" the use of a pencil to mark osteotomy cuts in craniofacial and maxillofacial surgery is well established , proving superior to methylene .
bonney 's blue and felt tipped skin markers struggle to transfer an ink mark to bone , or are washed away by irrigation or tissue fluids . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sometimes it 's just like woodwork a pencil is a pencil but despite the report , surgeons are apparently not brand-loyal . " it 's no different to any other pencil , " eley told deutsche welle , clearing up any misunderstandings .
" the bmj just made it sound like that .
we just thought it was funny that we were in the middle of surgery and asked for a pencil and were handed an ikea one . "
" it 's just like when a carpenter uses a pencil to mark a piece of wood to saw , " she added .
" except bone is a bit harder than wood . "
unfortunately , repeated sterilization means that some of the pencils split but even this problem has apparently been overcome by wrapping silicon cuffs around the pencil .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de finance -pipe- 10.12.2010 cancun divided over how to pay for consequences of climate change großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how can cancun help poorer nations face climate change ?
the goal of a legally binding treaty to reduce pollution has fallen by the wayside , so efforts in cancun have been focusing on a fund to help channel hundreds of billions of dollars in aid towards poor countries . enshrined in the copenhagen accord was the pledge to raise billions of dollars of climate aid .
the headline figures were impressive : 100 billion dollars -lrb- 76 billion euro -rrb- a year as of 2020 , and at least seven billion euros from the eu over the next few years to get the ball rolling .
yet the nitty gritty details of how that money should be managed and distributed were left for cancun . but negotiations on the fund are being stalled because the us want to tie the creation of the fund to other issues , in particular they want big developing emitting countries , particularly china to be more transparent about the action they are taking to mitigate the effects of climate change . " that essentially puts a handbrake on how far we can go in creating a fund , " steve herz , a climate policy advisor at greenpeace told deutsche welle .
" it risks a watered down decision , " he added . a new draft proposal has spelled out the technicalities for setting up a global climate fund .
it will help poor nations create a mechanism to share clean technologies , protect tropical forests and help the poor adapt to impacts ranging from storms to rising sea levels . in a revision , the text explicitly calls for a role for women in the fight against climate change . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : environmentalists want the money to help poor nations adapt to climate change " at last women , who are among the most affected by climate change , are not being ignored , " said executive director of oxfam jeremy hobbs at a press conference . but some environmentalists criticized the draft for removing a reference to ensuring that 50 percent of assistance goes toward helping people adapt to climate change . " the current draft sees too many important decisions pushed down the road , " hobbs said . the omission would allow wealthy nations to meet pledges through other means , such as offering technical know-how to help curb emissions of greenhouse gases blamed for global warming . role of the world bank negotiators said they saw steady progress in setting up the architecture of a future climate fund .
a remaining sticking point is whether to include a role for international bodies , such as the world bank , in administering aid . donor countries want to have guarantees that the money is actually spent on global climate protection .
the developing countries receiving the funds want freedom of choice on their national measures and no preconditions , for example , on policy priorities . " there 's a tug of war going on right now .
the dispute is about the trustee role , " said steve herz . donor countries want the world bank to play a role as trustee , which - according to herz - " could mean that they just cut cheques , but it could also mean a broader role in implementing and conceiving projects " . negotiators are currently trying to agree on the scope of the trustee role . as the globe 's largest poverty-fighting institution , with 65 years of experience in development finance , the world bank says it can play a helpful role . " our specialty is essentially delivering results at scale .
the world has lots of pilots and lots of wonderful experiments going on a small scale and those are really good .
but what the world really needs now is scale .
i think we can play a helpful role in bringing together the overall packages , " andrew steer , special envoy for climate change at the world bank , told deutsche welle . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : loans to create solar energy plants could generate income , according to the world bank but there are some delegations that are very skeptical about the world bank administering the funds .
in particular , developing countries oppose a climate fund managed by the bank and instead want the unfccc to be the fund 's manager . the un ambassadors of bolivia , pablo solon , summed up their reservations : " to have the world bank as the entity that is going to manage this is something that we do not support , " solon told deutsche welle . " why ?
because as you know , there has been a crisis , an international crisis and part of the reason for this crisis is the imf and the world bank , which have imposed a policy that has provoked this crisis " . the world bank has also been criticized for not acting progressively enough on climate related issues . " it continues to promote as its central paradigm fossil fuel based energy production , " said steve herz a report by oil change international and sierra club said the world bank increased its lending for fossil fuels from 1.5 billion dollars in 2006 to 6.2 billion dollars in 2010 . carbon markets on the sidelines of the conference , the world bank launched a new multi-million dollar fund to help emerging market countries set up their own carbon markets carbon markets create a profit-generating system whereby a cap is put on the total amount of carbon emissions and companies can trade in surplus rights to emit carbon dioxide into the atmosphere .
the idea is to create a market based system that incentivizes companies to reduce carbon emissions . the world bank thinks this system can play a bigger role .
" today only two percent of clean development mechanism money goes to africa and we have found that in our own portfolio of carbon markets , we have more than 20 percent going to africa and it works fine .
in other words , we believe that it is possible to extend the reach of carbon markets and offsets to those low income countries , " steer said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : carbon markets have allowed china 's wind energy sector to expand rapidly friends of the earth , an environmental advocacy group is strongly critical of carbon markets . " carbon markets are an irreparably flawed means of addressing climate change , " said karen orenstein of friends of the earth us .
" they further entrench the economic arrangements that facilitate the north 's over-consumption and have landed us in this climate crisis in the first place . " nnimmo bassey , executive director of environmental rights action in nigeria and chair of friends of the earth international , thinks that the negotiations are missing the real issues by concentrating too much on market issues . " all the negotiators talk about is how to use the market to soften global warming – carbon offsetting by planting a tree somewhere in africa while you keep polluting in europe , " he told deutsche welle . " this is not a solution , because pollution emissions have to stop at the source .
and they are not talking about lifestyle changes ; they are not talking about less consumption and less of production . " with talks due to end on friday , many negotiators believed they could come to agreement in three key areas : the architecture of a global climate fund , aid to discourage deforestation , and verification of countries ' climate pledges . author : natalia dannenberg -lrb- afp , dpa -rrb- editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

meanwhile , russia 's prime minister accuses the us of hypocrisy over the affair . the un commissioner for human rights navi pillay expressed dismay over the withdrawal of financial and internet services to the controversial wikileaks website .
pillay said that measures taken by companies - which wikileaks ' supporters claim are due to pressure from foreign governments - could represent an infringement of the right to freedom of expression . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pillay said courts should decide on the balance between security and freedom " i 'm concerned about reports of pressure exerted on private companies , including banks , credit card companies , and internet service providers to close down credit lines for donations to wikileaks as well as to stop hosting the website or its mother sites , " navi pillay told a news conference on thursday .
" they could be interpreted as an attempt to censor the publication of information , thus potentially violating wikileaks ' right to freedom of expression . "
payments suspended , account closed wikileaks angered the us and other governments with the release in november of 250,000 confidential diplomatic cables , with washington saying the information could put american lives in danger .
credit card firms mastercard and visa later suspended payments made to wikileaks , while the swiss post office shut down a bank account opened by wikileaks founder julian assange .
pillay said the case " raises complex human rights questions about balancing freedom of information and the need to protect national security or public order . "
" if wikileaks has committed any recognizable illegal acts then this should be handled through the legal system and not through pressure and intimidation including on third parties , " said pillay a former un war crimes judge .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : assange was arrested in london , and awaits a hearing pillay noted that such questions were not related to charges against assange for crimes including rape in sweden .
supporters of assange claim that the charges against him have been manufactured as part of a bid to halt the website 's activities , along with the pressure on firms to cut wikileaks ' income stream .
' pot calls kettle black , ' putin russian prime minister vladimir putin said that assange 's arrest in britain , for extradition , was " undemocratic " and accused the us of " hypocrisy " for attacking russia 's record on democracy .
" if we are talking about democracy , it should be complete .
why was mr. assange hidden in jail ?
is that democracy ?
as we say in the village , the pot is calling the kettle black , " putin told reporters .
" i want to send the ball back to our american colleagues . "
assange is currently in custody in britain awaiting a hearing over his extradition after a warrant was issued by sweden .
meanwhile , wikileaks supporters on thursday vowed to step up cyber-attacks on companies that have taken action against wikileaks .
a group calling itself " anonymous " has claimed credit for temporarily bringing down the websites of visa and mastercard .

although no over-arching treaty to tackle climate change is up for grabs this year , struggles over principles risk progress on smaller achievements in the final hours of negotiations . japan 's hard line on the kyoto protocol remains the main concern for parties trying to bridge differences on a range of issues , including forestry protection , climate finance and accounting methodologies .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the japanese delegation has come in for criticism japan has refused to climb down from its refusal to consider extending kyoto when its first commitment period expires in 2012 , despite openings for compromises throughout the talks .
" we know that european union countries insist on a second commitment period , but we think this is n't a fair way of dealing with emissions globally , " said japanese negotiator akira yamada on thursday evening , describing this dispute as " ongoing " and " difficult . "
kyoto binds 37 wealthy nations to cut their greenhouse gas emissions , but japan does not want to be part of an agreement that does n't include binding rules for the world ’ s top two emitters , china and the us .
developing countries see kyoto as crucial for holding the industrialized world to account for a problem that is mostly of its making .
it seemed that a crisis over kyoto might be avoided earlier in the conference , following conciliatory language from china and india , but by the end of the week environmental groups were naming japan as the " worst " participant at the talks .
" they should show more flexibility and not pick a fight where it is not necessary , " said david turnbull , executive director of the climate action network , an umbrella group of environmental organizations .
anger at brazil yet harsh criticism has also been leveled at certain developing countries , among them brazil , amid fears that even lesser gains may slip through negotiators ' fingers in cancun .
brazil has been widely applauded for how it is tackling the destruction of the amazon .
indeed , last week it announced that its rate of deforestation dropped 14 percent over a 12-month period in 2010 , to reach its lowest level on record .
yet environmental groups accused brazil on thursday of rolling back gains in discussions on forestry protection measures because of its resistance to a system with international checks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : global deforestation rates have slowed over the last 10 years don lehr , a spokesperson for the eco-systems climate alliance , described talks on forestry on thursday as deadlocked .
" if we are not going to break down the sovereignty issues , we ’ ll never deal with climate change , " said rosalind reeve of global witness , an organisation that tracks resource exploitation , in reference to brazil 's position .
" you need a monitoring system that works nationally and internationally to build integrity .
there ’ s two sides to this equation ; there ’ s carbon and there ’ s safeguards . "
brazil has long been wary of efforts to secure international monitoring commitments in a global system to curb deforestation which would reward conservation in poor countries . despite the concerns of countries like brazil and papua new guinea , many have hoped to see cancun at least achieve an agreement on the scheme known as redd - reducing emissions from deforestation and degradation .
that is looking difficult on friday .
" we are not in favour of monitoring in an international process , " said a senior brazilian negotiator , suggesting that it would simply add excessive layers of bureaucracy that would " overcharge " domestic measures .
money matters though the situation could change in the final hours of talks , efforts to agree on a fund to help poor countries pay for their response to climate change also appear stalled . " saying , as has been said , ' well we won ’ t talk about a climate fund until we are clear about the rules ' then other people say ' well we won ’ t talk about the rules until a climate fund can exist ' - that kind of thing is just going to delay things too much and get us into silly posturing , " said jeremy hobbs , executive director of oxfam , which campaigns against poverty . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : progess at the talks has been painfully slow rich countries pledged in copenhagen last year to raise $ 30 billion -lrb- 22 billion euros -rrb- over the next few years to help developing countries already begin to meet the costs of climate change .
developing countries have expressed dismay that much of that pledged money appears to have been watered down through technical measures .
the fast start finance is supposed to help build trust in rich countries ’ pledges to deliver $ 100 billion dollars annually as of 2020 for a so-called green fund for developing countries , which in turn might make poorer countries amenable to adopting their own binding emissions cuts .
details of the fund - such as who will have control of it , where the money will come from and the conditions of its use - were supposed to be ironed out in cancun .
but these , too , appear to remain points of contest as the conference draws to a close .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de internet -pipe- 10.12.2010 dutch police arrest hacker over alleged cyber attacks großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hackers mostly remain undiscovered hackers have been waging cyber war on the websites of opponents of wikileaks , saying they 're fighting for a " free and open " internet .
dutch police have arrested a teenager accused of taking part in the attacks . dutch authorities on friday said police in the netherlands arrested a 16-year-old who has admitted to attacking websites belonging to wikileaks opponents .
a spokesman for the national prosecutor 's office said the teenager had " admitted launching attacks on visa and mastercard sites . "
a statement said he was probably " part of a larger group of hackers . "
hackers unite hackers from around the world have stepped up cyber attacks following the arrest of wikileaks boss julian assange .
assange is wanted by sweden in connection with sexual misconduct charges the online attacks have mainly targeted companies that have deprived wikileaks of their services , including the websites of the online payment service paypal , and the credit card giants visa and mastercard , which had stopped processing donations for wikileaks .
also targeted were amazon.com , which had banished wikileaks from using its rented servers , a swiss bank and the website of the swedish prosecutor who had issued an arrest warrant for assange on charges of sexual misconduct .
the group of hackers , which calls itself " anonymous , " says it wants to keep the internet open and free .
wikileaks has distanced itself from the cyber attacks , but said they reflected public opinion .
in a statement , the organization said it had no contact with anonymous and had not received prior notice of any of the group 's actions .
assange : " charges fabricated " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : julian assange says he is innocent of the charges assange is currently in a british jail after handing himself in to police on tuesday . police have moved the wikileaks ' chief from the main part of wandsworth prison to an isolation unit , his lawyer said friday . " the prison authorities are doing it for his own safety , presumably , " jennifer robinson , one of assange 's legal team told the afp news agency . assange has been refused the use of his own laptop but will be given a prison computer with limited internet access , the guardian newspaper reported friday .
assange says the swedish sexual misconduct charges are a fabrication intended to stop his organization from continuing to publish confidential documents .
wikileaks is facing international condemnation for its publication of confidential material , often concerning diplomatic relations between countries .
some of the documents have caused embarrassment to the nations concerned .
assange is due to appear in a london court for a second time on tuesday , when prosecutors want to question him about allegations of rape and sexual molestation made by two women .

" there is a spirit that is uniting us all , " the german chancellor told reporters during a break in the talks .
" if the euro fails , the european union fails , too . "
president sarkozy , meanwhile , pledged that germany and france " will defend the euro , because the euro is europe . "
sarkozy also backed germany 's opposition to creating unified european sovereign bonds .
the idea of harmonizing some eurozone debt , as suggested by several members of the currency union , has met with strong opposition from germany and france , whose balance sheets are relatively healthy .
" french and german citizens would not be happy if we were to bundle the debts together , " the french president said .
he argued that the concept might be worth considering in the future , but only after the bloc 's members ramp up their economic and political cooperation .
" we should not put the cart before the horse , " sarkozy told reporters .
european leaders , or bullies ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france and germany are unwilling to unify european debts earlier in the week , merkel and germany had come under fire over this issue from luxembourg 's prime minister jean-claude juncker , who also heads the eurozone .
juncker said that creating taboo subjects without even considering the ideas of others was " a very un-european way of dealing with european issues . " as the two largest eu members , france and germany both have a sizeable share of the voting power within the bloc , and need relatively little support from other countries in order to secure a majority .
" without agreement from france and germany - the historic motors of european integration and two economies that make up half of the eurozone 's gross domestic product - nothing very important is possible , " professor henrik uterwedde from the franco-german institute in ludwigsburg told deutsche welle .
" so on the one hand , they must reach agreements , and help the union move forward , but at the same time , they do n't always do enough to treat the other members as equal partners and involve them in the decision-making processes . "
friday 's meeting was in preparation for the eu summit in brussels on december 16 and 17 , at which the bloc 's economic difficulties such as unemployment and national debt are bound to top the agenda .
troop deployment symbolic of closer cooperation while sarkozy and merkel discussed the harmonization of economic policies like labor and taxation laws , saying this would improve the eurozone 's coherence as an economic bloc , military leaders just across the border were preparing a more visible symbol of franco-german cooperation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the last german battalions in france had a very different mission the first german battalion to be stationed on french soil since the nazi occupation in world war ii officially took up their post near the border-city of strasbourg on friday .
german defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg and his french counterpart alain juppe attended a ceremony to mark the event .
" german soldiers are today welcome in france , " merkel said across the border in freiburg .
" for me , that has great symbolism , after all that germany was guilty of during the nazi era . "
the battalion , which will eventually consist of 600 soldiers , is part of the joint franco-german brigade .
" i was always surprised that the franco-german brigade only consisted of french soldiers in germany , " sarkozy said .
" we are two sovereign nations , two countries at peace , two countries that founded europe . "
franco-german genesis of eu sarkozy was referring to the forerunner of the modern-day european union , the european coal and steel community .
this trade-oriented union was established in 1953 as part of post-war efforts to negate the possibility of future conflict between france and germany by making them economically interdependent .
between 1870 and 1945 , the two neighbors fought three devastating wars .
" above all else , i think putting these german troops in france is a symbolic exercise , " franco-german expert , professor henrik uterwedde said .
" but sometimes symbolism is important . "
" that famous photo of -lsb- former german chancellor -rsb- helmut kohl and -lsb- then french president -rsb- francois mitterand standing hand-in-hand at the world war one commemorations in verdun in 1984 was pure symbolism , too - but it was a hugely significant image . "
bildunterschrift : sometimes symbolism can move mountains the alsace region where the german battalion us now stationed spans the franco-german border , and has changed hands several times over the centuries .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de space -pipe- 10.12.2010 solar wind sail could be the fastest object ever built großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the esail project expects to launch before 2013 the european union is investing nearly two million euros in the esail project , which was initially conceived of by a finnish researcher .
now , the project has four other eu member states on baord . on wednesday and thursday , the first meeting of the electric solar wind sail -lrb- esail -rrb- – newly sponsored by the european union - was held at the finnish metereological institute in helsinki .
earlier this year , the european union gave its blessing with 1.7 million euro -lrb- 2.25 million dollars -rrb- to construct laboratory prototypes of the esail project , whose ultimate goal is to launch the sail into space on a one kilogram estonian nanosatellite by the end of 2012 .
esail is now a joint operation with representatives from finland , estonia , germany , italy and sweden .
solar wind is a constant stream of charged particles that emanate from the sun .
a solar sail , which has been used previously , is made of a material that blocks those particles and then propel a spacecraft forward - in the same way a seafaring vessel uses wind to fill its sails .
however , this new finnish design , which was invented in 2006 by pekka janhunen , a researcher at the finnish meteorological institute , creates a " virtual " sail by forming an electric field with a radius of 100 meters from a small wire .
" the field forms an obstacle and so the solar wind particles are scattered in different directions , " he told deutsche welle .
" it 's more like an electric parachute than a sail .
it creates an enhanced friction between the solar wind flow and the wire . "
moving 50 kilometers per second if successful , janhunen added , then anything that this small wire was attached to , could theoretically travel approximately 50 kilometers per second , or " a factor of four or five faster than anything else ever constructed . "
using solar wind as a propulsion system in this way can only really be used between planets , so this type of design would be best for earth-mars , or other types of longer distance missions .
other astronomers are also excited about the prospect of this technology .
" in the other solar sail projects the energy comes from solar photons , the weightless ' light-particles ' .
this project gets the energy from the ions in the solar wind , " explained timo laitinen , an astronomy lecturer at the university of turku in finland , in an interview with deutsche welle .
" the technology is completely different , and to my understanding more feasible than the ' traditional ' solar sail technology . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de afghanistan -pipe- 10.12.2010 afghan women still oppressed and abused , un report says großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : afghan girls are often given away to settle disputes a new report published by the united nations assistance mission in afghanistan -lrb- unama -rrb- has found that the lives of afghan women have improved little since the fall of the taliban .
but the west seems unmoved . despite changes in afghan law and a constitution designed to protect women 's rights , violence and abuse of women continue to be a serious problem in the country , and the government is not doing enough to prevent it .
that is the conclusion of a new report published by the united nations assistance mission in afghanistan -lrb- unama -rrb- .
the most common forms of abuse include forced and child marriage , honor killings and giving away girls to settle disputes under the tradition of baad .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the report says violence against afghan women is still widespread " the report describes the prevalence of these practices , " georgette gagnon , unama 's director of human rights , said at a press conference .
" it looks at the consequences these practices have on the lives of afghan women and girls and the community as a whole and it also looks at the efforts of the afghan government to address violence against women . "
one of these efforts , the 2009 law of elimination of violence against women -lrb- evaw -rrb- , came under particular scrutiny .
the law , which gagnon described as " a huge gain of legal protection of women 's rights , " criminalizes buying and selling women for marriage , forcing a woman to marry without her consent , forcing girls to marry when they are underage , and forcing girls and women to commit self-immolation - when they set themselves on fire .
ignorance and lack of enforcement but according to the report , the new law is not being enforced in many parts of the country , and is often not even known .
bele grau , program manager for afghanistan at the women 's rights organisation medica mondiale agreed with this assessment .
" on the theoretical and legal level the situation is getting better – but in practice it is often not implemented , " she told deutsche welle .
" this law has been in force for a year , but a lot of judges do n't even know it , and if they do , they do n't enforce it . "
the un women 's organization unifem says that around 87 percent of afghan women suffer from domestic violence , and that half of all girls are married under the age of 15 .
on top of this , grau says that many of the rights that women have won are repealed by new laws .
she cites one recent regulation that bans women who have run away from an abusive home from seeking refuge with strangers .
this in practice leaves many women only the unrealistic option of going to relatives .
many women are also still imprisoned for running away , in contravention of the evaw law .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : westerwelle suggested democracy can not be imposed on afghanistan the report found that much of the abuse is founded in afghan tradition .
" one very harmful practice that we heard a lot about is baad , which is the giving away of girls to settle disputes , " said gagnon .
" many of the women told us that instead of a murderer being punished , an innocent girl is punished and she has to spend all her life in slavery and is subjected to cruel violence .
sometimes she is forced to sleep with the animals in the barn . "
western indifference the report sets out a number of recommendations for the afghan government to deal with the problem , but grau says that the west has an obligation to apply pressure in order to protect women 's rights – not least because this is often used to add legitimacy to the war in afghanistan .
" we 've noticed this in most of the western governments , " she said .
" for the past year , all the talk is about withdrawal of troops , and negotiations with the taliban etc . , and that afghans have to work out for themselves how much democracy or women 's rights they want .
these are now all internal afghan issues that are n't discussed or even noticed anymore .
the german government is no exception to this . "
she believes that pressure could be exhorted through the financial aid the west gives to the afghan government .
" the western governments still give afghanistan a lot of development money , " she said .
" and when they make conditions for giving this money , we think they should make them for human rights and women 's rights , not just for taking over security duties . "
" the issue of women 's rights was also one of the justifications for the war itself , but that is suddenly disappearing from the agenda , " she added .
" earlier this year , -lrb- german foreign minister guido -rrb- westerwelle said , ' well , afghanistan is not switzerland , ' and with that everything is swept from the table . "

other than the nobel peace prize , which was awarded this year to liu xiaobo , numerous prizes for human rights activists are awarded on this day all over the world .
58-year-old lawyer asma jahangir , recipient of unesco / bilbao prize for 2010 , is the current president of the supreme court bar association and a founding member of the human rights commission of pakistan , the country 's leading independent human rights body .
' it increases one 's responsibilities ' she is a brilliant speaker and a relentless champion of people 's rights .
and yet , there are moments when even asma jahangir seems tired : when she talks about how much still remains to be done in pakistan despite some improvements .
asma jahangir laughs heartily and admits that she too is a normal human being with strengths and weaknesses .
she is happy about the international recognition that comes with the unesco / bilbao prize .
" it is indeed a matter of happiness and pride , but at the same time it increases one 's responsibility .
people expect more from you .
one has to strategize more , keeping in mind one 's integrity .
it draws a ' red line ' for you . "
the journey asma jahangir was born in a rich family in lahore .
when the pakistani government suppressed the independence movement in the late sixties in east pakistan , today 's bangladesh , asma 's father protested and was repeatedly jailed or put under house arrest .
asma jahangir believes this experience has truly formed her .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : asma jahangir has been campaigning for human rights for several decades " what i have learnt is that you are no longer materialistic after that .
the way my father worked altruistically , and the manner in which he used to go behind bars and come back home smilingly was inspirational .
he passed away when he was only 61 .
he had cancer , and we knew he would leave us soon .
i remember my sister and i were sitting at his deathbed , and he looked at us and said , ' i am not going to die , i will live through you ' , " reminisces jahangir .
asma jahangir followed his words .
with her inheritance she founded a women 's forum in 1980 together with her sister , hina jilani , a lawyer herself .
in her numerous jobs , for example as chairperson of the human rights commission of pakistan , or as united nations special rapporteur on freedom of religion or belief , she has raised her voice against the discrimination of religious minorities , against " honor " killings , or the treatment of minors in pakistani jails .
it has not been easy for her .
" women face difficulties at all levels .
they face hardship in society and at the workplace .
women also have to struggle within their households .
therefore , if any woman asserts herself , people find it difficult to accept .
they can also be very cruel towards that woman , " opines jahangir . she remembers that her own in-laws also found it difficult to accept that their son had married a woman who was not a typical pakistani wife .
but with time , both her family and society have accepted her achievements .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a demonstration for minority rights in pakistan dreams for a better pakistan for pakistan , asma jahangir has many dreams .
" firstly , i want to see economic prosperity in pakistan .
the indignity of poverty makes me despair .
pakistanis are a very dignified people .
they have suffered a great deal .
they have resisted oppression .
and yet , the image of pakistan projected in the world is mostly negative .
the positive side of pakistan is not shown .
i think pakistan has wasted its human capital . "
she has learnt to suppress her anger , even when she is being accused of blasphemy or treason .
but asma jahangir emphasizes that a life in anger is not worth living .

in its one-hundred-year history , this is the first time that the prize is awarded to a chinese citizen .
yet , the laureate , his family members , and even close friends are incarcerated in their own country .
no one can come to receive the award . the scottish pen has produced a " liu xiaobo chair " , which has been sent over to oslo .
now it stands in the city hall .
this empty chair is a reminder that its owner , who should enjoy the highest international honor today , is absent from the ceremony , banquet and concert , which are devoted to him . the host country 's king , the queen , european royal families , foreign ambassadors and representatives , as well as guests from overseas gather in the bright hall decorated with flowers and make a toast to xiaobo .
but many of us are still melancholy , and we ask , where is liu xiaobo and his beloved liu xia ?
let us travel through time and space and visit liu xia first . we are in haidian district , beijing , yuyuantan south road number 9 .
from a distance one can see the white building where the lius live .
the police cars are parked in front of the house ; several policemen parade around .
journalists from far and near are cordoned off some hundred meters away .
no one is allowed to get into the forbidden zone . thin , with a shaven head -lrb- or short-cropped hair -rrb- , liu xia is sitting alone in the empty home .

the cup in the hand , you take a sip lifted the cup to the sun cup and your fingers penetrated by the sun palm was stained by the transparent green delicate a hint of panic is there too the cup on the opposite site you know will be empty for a long time it takes long till the man opens your door -lrb- from liu ’ s poem " sunshine and cups - to my little finger , who drinks tea every day " -rrb- liu xia may wait for a long time , maybe another ten years .
now we visit xiaobo in jinzhou prison in the small chinese town nanshan in liaoning province .
entering the gate , we see several scattered buildings .
surprisingly , we see a huge office wall on which is written boldly ' 1984 ' .
a few months ago , liu xia , accompanied by the stainless steel mouse liu di , wang jinbo , mo zhixu and wang zhongxia , came here for a visit .
they were amazed at orwell ’ s rebirth in a chinese prison . snickering , they took pictures in front of the " 1984 wall " .
several officers rushed to them and took them into custody .
separately , they were interrogated for hours . we enter xiaobo ’ s cell now .
he shares with five other prisoners a 3 by 4 meter space .
his head is bald , shaved like an ordinary criminal .
his body is swollen by the padded jacket and trousers .
scarf , hat and gloves are a must in the cell because the concrete floor of the prison is cold .
the small window beneath the high ceiling is always open .
in winter , the indoor temperature is higher than outdoors ; it is a few degrees above zero .
the odor of the open toilet bucket in the corner is neutralized by the cold air , but one can not ignore the stench of the daily waste of several men .
the smell not only fills the room , it penetrates through clothes , and into the pores of the skin . this is the first winter that xiaobo spends in a prison in northern china .
he will have to adjust himself to the circumstances .
he does not know whether he will have frostbite .
to sit and lie on the concrete floors all year round may cause neck and spine pain and lead to kidney problems .
his stomach disease has given him a hard time since his imprisonment .
xiaobo has exited his cell today , but he does not want to show it to others otherwise his cell-mates might become cynical and angry .
sitting there , his thoughts fly to oslo .
he has had constant dreams about it .
who will be there at the ceremony ?
who will receive the prize for me ?
it could not be liu xia .
she has not sent any sign of life for a while .
my acceptance speech is long written in my head , but who can read it out aloud for me ?
does the king wear a majestic tuxedo , and the queen her crown at the banquet ?
will the distinguished guests think of the dead in tiananmen square and the tiananmen mothers and make a toast ?
sitting in the dungeon , xiaobo does not know that the announcement of his award induced a tsunami in zhongnanhai , and the rulers had a mild concussion , followed by delusions : they believe that their enemies are all over the world , so the grip on the naughty writers and the guy who held the crab dinner party must be tightened .
they must not go outside the country , otherwise they could endanger national security .
liu xiaobo ’ s dinner on december 10 , 2010 may look like this : boiled vegetables with sand , and a few pieces of fat meat as a special treat .
he might have an extra piece of steamed bread , and his rice bowl could also be refilled today .
in short , it is a privileged meal that will long be remembered , because it is a meal that will leave the stomach truly filled .
after all , he is the first chinese to win the nobel peace prize .

after pressure from china , 20 nations have said they wo n't be attending the ceremony . a total of 65 countries have embassies in the norwegian capital of oslo and recently they 've all received the same two pieces of mail . an invitation from the nobel prize committee to attend the award ceremony for the 2011 nobel winners and a letter from the chinese embassy requesting they steer clear of the event . " we have noticed that the chinese are very engaged this year , " said geir lundestad , director of the nobel institute .
" they want as few nations as possible to accept the invitation .
now we 'll see who does not come for political reasons and who have other reasons . " the nobel committee has said 44 nations will be sending envoys to the ceremony , including eu member states , the united states , japan , india , south korea , south africa , indonesia and brazil . political , social motives bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at the ceremony , 20 countries will have empty chairs but another 20 countries have said they will not be in attendance .
serbia cited its interest in maintaining good relations with china for its absence , but other countries , including russia , are offering other reasons .
moscow has said scheduling difficulties - not political considerations - were keeping it away . but the scheduling conflicts veil russia 's political motive not to attend , according to sergei lukashevsky , the head of moscow 's sakharov museum . " that russia is not participating in the nobel peace prize 's award ceremony once again makes it clear that human rights do not play a prominent role in our foreign policy , " he said . " russia and china are members of the shanghai organization for cooperation and one of its goals is the fight against so-called extremism , " lukashevsky added .
" what that really means is that the countries support each other when it comes to fighting uncomfortable political situations . several countries in the middle east as well as afghanistan , pakistan and the philippines are also avoiding the ceremony because for economic and political reasons , according to rainer sollich , head of deutsche welle 's arabic department . " they are all states that have problems concerning human rights and operate under the understanding that they would n't want china at a ceremony honoring someone they view as an opponent of their regime . " china 's confucius prize china 's policy regarding the award ceremony and the still-imprisoned dissident liu has been clear .
referring to the nobel committee , chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman jiang yu said , " we will not change because of interference by a few clowns . " beijing awarded its own version of the nobel peace prize on thursday by giving the " confucius peace prize " to former taiwan vice-president lien chan .
like with liu 's nobel , chan was not in attendance to claim the award and his office said he was unaware of the prize . china has blocked access to the website of norwegian broadcaster nrk , the station said on thursday .
access to the bbc and cnn has also been affected ahead of friday 's ceremony , according to nrk . conspicuous absence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more protests in support of liu are scheduled for thursday friday will mark only the second time in the more than 100-year history of the prize that neither the laureate nor a representative will be able to come accept the award .
german journalist and pacifist carl von ossietzky , who was locked up in a nazi concentration camp , could not travel to oslo for his prize ceremony in 1936 . in addition to liu and ossietzky , myanmar 's aung san suu kyi was also barred from receiving her nobel peace prize in 1991 . liu has long been an outspoken opponent of chinese leadership in beijing and was at the forefront of the 1989 tiananmen square protests .
he was jailed in december 2009 for 11 years on subversion charges after co-authoring " charter 08 , " a manifesto that called for political reform in china . nobel officials said an empty chair would be used to represent liu 's absence . the 20 nations which will not attend the nobel ceremony are : afghanistan , china , colombia , cuba , egypt , iran , iraq , kazakhstan , morocco , pakistan , the philippines , russia , saudi arabia , serbia , sri lanka , sudan , tunisia , ukraine , venezuela and vietnam . authors : matthias von hein , jegor winogradow / sms -lrb- afp -rrb- editor : jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 10.12.2010 hanover hit new high with win over struggling stuttgart großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : goal hero ya konan can now boast nine for the season hanover continued to surpass expectations , rising to second in the standings with a 2-1 win over beleaguered stuttgart .
now , just third from bottom , stuttgart has decided to dump its coach , jens keller . ivorian didier ya konan scored twice to give hanover a 2-1 win over stuttgart on friday , taking his team to second place in the bundesliga ahead of the weekend 's main soccer action .
the loss was also the final straw for stuttgart 's management , which announced on saturday that it had fired coach jens keller .
after a cautious start by both sides , ya konan had the first major chance of the match in the 20th minute , with a shot that was stopped by stuttgart keeper sven ulreich .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while stuttgart battled back , they were unable to gain a much-needed point the breakthrough came on 35 minutes , after stuttgart left back arthur boka got a defensive foot to a ball from hanover 's lars stindl - only to divert it to ya konan .
the striker took advantage and passed the ball through ulreich 's legs to take his tally for the season to eight .
stuttgart responded positively , pressing throughout the game , and - with just a quarter of an hour to go - managed to equalize as georg niedermeier jumped to head a timo gebhart free kick into the far corner .
the comeback was short-lived .
after another attempt on the hanover goal , this time from philip degen , hanover swiftly counter-attacked .
ya konan latched onto a high ball from christian schulz to score through ulreich 's legs for a second time .
' an exceptional start ' the win means that hanover have already recorded one more victory than in the whole of last season .
" it is exceptional what we have achieved in the first half of the season , " said hanover technical director joerg schmadtke .
stuttgart is now without a win in its last five games and is third from the bottom with only 12 points from 16 games .
this dreary realization was enough for the team to pull the plug on jen keller 's 59-day rein as head coach .
the hottest prospect to replace him is bruno labaddia , who coached hamburg until the end of april .
in saturday 's football , bayern host st. pauli , hamburg entertain bayer leverkusen and cologne are at home to eintracht frankfurt .
nuremberg travel to hoffenheim , wolfsburg visit kaiserslautern and bremen will be hoping for an away win against leaders borussia dortmund .

you have to pay a one-euro entrance fee , and while the mulled wine , roasted almonds and arts-and-craft knick-knacks are much the same as in any other christmas market , you are treated to a live ballet show , based on a russian fairytale , to go with your sense of exclusivity .
you also see more security guards .
some , like the ones taking your entry ticket , are dressed as toy soldiers in keeping with the winter fairytale theme .
others wear army boots and the thick , riot-police-style boiler suits emblazoned with the large reflective " security " badge on the back . recent threats of " mumbai style attacks " have boosted the private security business in the past few weeks .
thomas ostmann , berlin manager of german security company agsus , noticed a rise in demand immediately . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : recent terrorist threats in berlin have heightened demand for security firms " yes , we 've definitely noticed that , " he told deutsche welle .
" ahead of the christmas markets , we felt a rise in anxiety among the stand owners .
it is going down a little now , but there is significantly more manpower and security on the markets . "
security boom the added holiday season demand has come on top of a general expansion in the security industry over the past decade .
germany currently has 4,000 security companies , up 1,000 over a decade ago .
the number of people employed in the industry has doubled and sales , too , with revenue this year expected to reach 4.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 5.9 billion -rrb- . sven hallscheidt , spokesman for the german chambers of industry and commerce -lrb- dihk -rrb- , attributes the growing demand for security services by individuals and companies to a deep social change .
" it 's a development in society , " he said .
" on the one hand , it is influenced by reports in the media – we all know the reports about possible terrorist attacks – but also reports of attacks in public generally . " the security business is not only expanding but also becoming more complex .
company security is taking on an evermore important role , requiring a new breed of skilled workers – from guards and logistics planners to engineers – to create security systems . essential as the police and that role is extending beyond guarding buildings , cash logistics and the likes into areas such as critical infrastructure , making the private security industry as essential as the police . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the police no longer have the resources to protect essential infrastructure bodo pfalzgraf , chairman of the berlin police union , says the police force in germany simply does n't have the capacity to meet the country 's security requirements .
" first of all , we have in germany about as many police employees as there are employees in the private security industry , it 's 50 – 50 , " he told deutsche welle .
" in my opinion , the infrastructure of german security is inconceivable without private security personnel .
they guard nuclear power stations – they 're not just skin-headed , tattooed bouncers . " the growing importance of the private security sector , however , is also raising questions over jurisdiction , with some politicians warning against the dangers of over-privatizing security – particularly in airports . no special privileges but security manager ostmann says that even in places like christmas markets where private companies protect public spaces , the rules about what guards can and ca n't do are clear .
" the police always have the final say , " he said .
" we have the same rights as any other citizen , but we have no special powers .
and there are no difficulties over areas of competence .
i 'd say it is a very good partnership . " official agreements , like contracts , are organized on a state government level between the police and private security firms but there are still ambiguities , according to pfalzgraf . " a danger exists if there is no clear delineation between the two , and the government is not providing one at the moment , " he said .
" today , anyone can start a private security firm – they have to fulfil very few conditions .
and as of may 1 , 2011 , there 's going to be another opening of the market in europe – in other words , eastern european companies from poland , czech republic and lithuania will be able to start security services here .
that i think is a problem . " pfalzgraf believes it 's high time the state creates more rigorous industry standards to cope with the rising need for private security firms .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de finance -pipe- 10.12.2010 cancun divided over how to pay for consequences of climate change großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how can cancun help poorer nations face climate change ?
the goal of a legally binding treaty to reduce pollution has fallen by the wayside , so efforts in cancun have been focusing on a fund to help channel hundreds of billions of dollars in aid towards poor countries . enshrined in the copenhagen accord was the pledge to raise billions of dollars of climate aid .
the headline figures were impressive : 100 billion dollars -lrb- 76 billion euro -rrb- a year as of 2020 , and at least seven billion euros from the eu over the next few years to get the ball rolling .
yet the nitty gritty details of how that money should be managed and distributed were left for cancun . but negotiations on the fund are being stalled because the us want to tie the creation of the fund to other issues , in particular they want big developing emitting countries , particularly china to be more transparent about the action they are taking to mitigate the effects of climate change . " that essentially puts a handbrake on how far we can go in creating a fund , " steve herz , a climate policy advisor at greenpeace told deutsche welle .
" it risks a watered down decision , " he added . a new draft proposal has spelled out the technicalities for setting up a global climate fund .
it will help poor nations create a mechanism to share clean technologies , protect tropical forests and help the poor adapt to impacts ranging from storms to rising sea levels . in a revision , the text explicitly calls for a role for women in the fight against climate change . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : environmentalists want the money to help poor nations adapt to climate change " at last women , who are among the most affected by climate change , are not being ignored , " said executive director of oxfam jeremy hobbs at a press conference . but some environmentalists criticized the draft for removing a reference to ensuring that 50 percent of assistance goes toward helping people adapt to climate change . " the current draft sees too many important decisions pushed down the road , " hobbs said . the omission would allow wealthy nations to meet pledges through other means , such as offering technical know-how to help curb emissions of greenhouse gases blamed for global warming . role of the world bank negotiators said they saw steady progress in setting up the architecture of a future climate fund .
a remaining sticking point is whether to include a role for international bodies , such as the world bank , in administering aid . donor countries want to have guarantees that the money is actually spent on global climate protection .
the developing countries receiving the funds want freedom of choice on their national measures and no preconditions , for example , on policy priorities . " there 's a tug of war going on right now .
the dispute is about the trustee role , " said steve herz . donor countries want the world bank to play a role as trustee , which - according to herz - " could mean that they just cut cheques , but it could also mean a broader role in implementing and conceiving projects " . negotiators are currently trying to agree on the scope of the trustee role . as the globe 's largest poverty-fighting institution , with 65 years of experience in development finance , the world bank says it can play a helpful role . " our specialty is essentially delivering results at scale .
the world has lots of pilots and lots of wonderful experiments going on a small scale and those are really good .
but what the world really needs now is scale .
i think we can play a helpful role in bringing together the overall packages , " andrew steer , special envoy for climate change at the world bank , told deutsche welle . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : loans to create solar energy plants could generate income , according to the world bank but there are some delegations that are very skeptical about the world bank administering the funds .
in particular , developing countries oppose a climate fund managed by the bank and instead want the unfccc to be the fund 's manager . the un ambassadors of bolivia , pablo solon , summed up their reservations : " to have the world bank as the entity that is going to manage this is something that we do not support , " solon told deutsche welle . " why ?
because as you know , there has been a crisis , an international crisis and part of the reason for this crisis is the imf and the world bank , which have imposed a policy that has provoked this crisis " . the world bank has also been criticized for not acting progressively enough on climate related issues . " it continues to promote as its central paradigm fossil fuel based energy production , " said steve herz a report by oil change international and sierra club said the world bank increased its lending for fossil fuels from 1.5 billion dollars in 2006 to 6.2 billion dollars in 2010 . carbon markets on the sidelines of the conference , the world bank launched a new multi-million dollar fund to help emerging market countries set up their own carbon markets carbon markets create a profit-generating system whereby a cap is put on the total amount of carbon emissions and companies can trade in surplus rights to emit carbon dioxide into the atmosphere .
the idea is to create a market based system that incentivizes companies to reduce carbon emissions . the world bank thinks this system can play a bigger role .
" today only two percent of clean development mechanism money goes to africa and we have found that in our own portfolio of carbon markets , we have more than 20 percent going to africa and it works fine .
in other words , we believe that it is possible to extend the reach of carbon markets and offsets to those low income countries , " steer said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : carbon markets have allowed china 's wind energy sector to expand rapidly friends of the earth , an environmental advocacy group is strongly critical of carbon markets . " carbon markets are an irreparably flawed means of addressing climate change , " said karen orenstein of friends of the earth us .
" they further entrench the economic arrangements that facilitate the north 's over-consumption and have landed us in this climate crisis in the first place . " nnimmo bassey , executive director of environmental rights action in nigeria and chair of friends of the earth international , thinks that the negotiations are missing the real issues by concentrating too much on market issues . " all the negotiators talk about is how to use the market to soften global warming – carbon offsetting by planting a tree somewhere in africa while you keep polluting in europe , " he told deutsche welle . " this is not a solution , because pollution emissions have to stop at the source .
and they are not talking about lifestyle changes ; they are not talking about less consumption and less of production . " with talks due to end on friday , many negotiators believed they could come to agreement in three key areas : the architecture of a global climate fund , aid to discourage deforestation , and verification of countries ' climate pledges . author : natalia dannenberg -lrb- afp , dpa -rrb- editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

although no over-arching treaty to tackle climate change is up for grabs this year , struggles over principles risk progress on smaller achievements in the final hours of negotiations . japan 's hard line on the kyoto protocol remains the main concern for parties trying to bridge differences on a range of issues , including forestry protection , climate finance and accounting methodologies .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the japanese delegation has come in for criticism japan has refused to climb down from its refusal to consider extending kyoto when its first commitment period expires in 2012 , despite openings for compromises throughout the talks .
" we know that european union countries insist on a second commitment period , but we think this is n't a fair way of dealing with emissions globally , " said japanese negotiator akira yamada on thursday evening , describing this dispute as " ongoing " and " difficult . "
kyoto binds 37 wealthy nations to cut their greenhouse gas emissions , but japan does not want to be part of an agreement that does n't include binding rules for the world ’ s top two emitters , china and the us .
developing countries see kyoto as crucial for holding the industrialized world to account for a problem that is mostly of its making .
it seemed that a crisis over kyoto might be avoided earlier in the conference , following conciliatory language from china and india , but by the end of the week environmental groups were naming japan as the " worst " participant at the talks .
" they should show more flexibility and not pick a fight where it is not necessary , " said david turnbull , executive director of the climate action network , an umbrella group of environmental organizations .
anger at brazil yet harsh criticism has also been leveled at certain developing countries , among them brazil , amid fears that even lesser gains may slip through negotiators ' fingers in cancun .
brazil has been widely applauded for how it is tackling the destruction of the amazon .
indeed , last week it announced that its rate of deforestation dropped 14 percent over a 12-month period in 2010 , to reach its lowest level on record .
yet environmental groups accused brazil on thursday of rolling back gains in discussions on forestry protection measures because of its resistance to a system with international checks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : global deforestation rates have slowed over the last 10 years don lehr , a spokesperson for the eco-systems climate alliance , described talks on forestry on thursday as deadlocked .
" if we are not going to break down the sovereignty issues , we ’ ll never deal with climate change , " said rosalind reeve of global witness , an organisation that tracks resource exploitation , in reference to brazil 's position .
" you need a monitoring system that works nationally and internationally to build integrity .
there ’ s two sides to this equation ; there ’ s carbon and there ’ s safeguards . "
brazil has long been wary of efforts to secure international monitoring commitments in a global system to curb deforestation which would reward conservation in poor countries . despite the concerns of countries like brazil and papua new guinea , many have hoped to see cancun at least achieve an agreement on the scheme known as redd - reducing emissions from deforestation and degradation .
that is looking difficult on friday .
" we are not in favour of monitoring in an international process , " said a senior brazilian negotiator , suggesting that it would simply add excessive layers of bureaucracy that would " overcharge " domestic measures .
money matters though the situation could change in the final hours of talks , efforts to agree on a fund to help poor countries pay for their response to climate change also appear stalled . " saying , as has been said , ' well we won ’ t talk about a climate fund until we are clear about the rules ' then other people say ' well we won ’ t talk about the rules until a climate fund can exist ' - that kind of thing is just going to delay things too much and get us into silly posturing , " said jeremy hobbs , executive director of oxfam , which campaigns against poverty . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : progess at the talks has been painfully slow rich countries pledged in copenhagen last year to raise $ 30 billion -lrb- 22 billion euros -rrb- over the next few years to help developing countries already begin to meet the costs of climate change .
developing countries have expressed dismay that much of that pledged money appears to have been watered down through technical measures .
the fast start finance is supposed to help build trust in rich countries ’ pledges to deliver $ 100 billion dollars annually as of 2020 for a so-called green fund for developing countries , which in turn might make poorer countries amenable to adopting their own binding emissions cuts .
details of the fund - such as who will have control of it , where the money will come from and the conditions of its use - were supposed to be ironed out in cancun .
but these , too , appear to remain points of contest as the conference draws to a close .

the decision marks a profound change for germany , where compulsory service was re-introduced 50 years ago . senior officials in germany 's coalition government have agreed to suspend military conscription as of july 1 , 2011 .
defense minister karl theodor zu guttenberg 's proposal was accepted during closed-door talks in berlin on thursday evening .
the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- of chancellor angela merkel and its bavarian sister party the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- have both in principle approved abolishing the draft at party conferences in the past six weeks .
their other coalition partner , the pro-business free democrats , had included stopping conscription in their manifesto during last year 's general election .
sources taking part in the meeting said the next step would be for merkel 's cabinet to approve a draft bill that could be put to parliament ; this is expected to happen on december 15 .
troop reduction bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : defense minister guttenberg says the change will save money guttenberg 's plan would also see troop numbers reduced the current level of 250,000 soldiers to 185,000 .
of these , 170,000 would be professional soldiers , with volunteers making up the remainder .
with his reform , guttenberg hopes to save up to 8.3 billion euros .
however , the suspension of conscription could create some new problems ; for instance , the alternative community service offered to those who refuse military service would also be dropped .
social and welfare institutions fear that this could lead to a lack of personnel , as in the past they have relied heavily on youngsters who want to avoid military service .
the suspension also means that student numbers are likely to climb , posing problems for universities .
compulsory military service in germany lasts for six months and only applies to young men .
women are allowed to join the german army , the bundeswehr , either as professionals or volunteers , but are not obliged to do so .

the capital is also easily the arty-fartiest place in the country .
coincidence ?
dw 's ben knight does n't think so . most of my friends are losers .
i mean that in a good way , obviously .
they are all talented and creative and sometimes even a bit inspired , but they are also , each and every last one of them , work-shy fops .
obviously i am as well : it takes one to know one , as we used to say in primary school .
there 's a great sequence in the movie " trainspotting " where junkie hero renton explains the complex art of staying on the dole .
it entails reverse-psychology tricks like going to a job interview and appearing psychotically eager to work in a leisure center .
the film shows that such efforts require invention , nerve , subtlety , selfishness , discipline and some drugs - the exact elements of a successful artistic career .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an artist at work there is probably no clearer illustration of one of the deeper truths of life in a western european social democracy : the attributes of an artist are exactly the same as the ones you need to successfully maintain your unemployment .
this is heightened in berlin , where it takes the sacrifice of an artist to truly perfect the art of not earning your living .
creative industries there are , they say , some broad similarities between my hometown , manchester , and berlin .
both were throbbing industrial powerhouses in the 19th century , lost their luster and declined in the late 20th century , only to become trendy pop cultural centers in the last 20 years - manchester not so much anymore , but you get the general idea .
both cities have also become famous for hanging their new economic hopes on the " creative industries . "
this very spongy term refers to anything from actor to fashion designer , to independent shopkeeper , to web designer , and includes all the attendant skill sets , cameramen , lighting technicians , office managers etc .
the point is you do n't make anything - you delight , you entertain , you disseminate knowledge and information , or you sing cabaret songs naked in a disused warehouse in front of an audience of twelve .
by capitalizing on the cache and the large student population , the two cities deliberately encouraged a whole class of freelance migrants engaged in some kind of creative endeavor in an attempt to re-invent the city 's economy .
but the similarity with manchester ends when it comes to the social security system .
in berlin , many creative types live - at least partially - on the standard long-term unemployment benefit called hartz iv .
it does n't help the job statistics , but it does mean that the city 's economy is run , to a certain extent , by the welfare state .
social security for the middle class bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unemployment center : the lifeblood of a creative economy when it comes to dealing with the job center to claim your benefits , being an artist is a double-edged sword .
most artists do not earn enough to live from their art , so they are understandably unwilling to mention the meager side earnings their talents bring .
they live double lives : naked dadaist performance artists at night , out-of-work it specialists by day .
but others have a little more nerve , and tell their case manager they are " professional " artists .
if they have a degree as well -lrb- a degree puts you in a different , more exclusive waiting room -rrb- they get special dispensation from the endless round of pointless job applications and interviews that most hartz iv recipients are forced to take .
instead , professional unemployed artists are allowed to count applications for grants and scholarships as their applications , and can get the state to pay for acting lessons .
so there 's a tip , if the hard times are getting to you .
ben knight does n't really think his friends are losers .

dutch police have arrested a teenager accused of taking part in the attacks . dutch authorities on friday said police in the netherlands arrested a 16-year-old who has admitted to attacking websites belonging to wikileaks opponents .
a spokesman for the national prosecutor 's office said the teenager had " admitted launching attacks on visa and mastercard sites . "
a statement said he was probably " part of a larger group of hackers . "
hackers unite hackers from around the world have stepped up cyber attacks following the arrest of wikileaks boss julian assange .
assange is wanted by sweden in connection with sexual misconduct charges the online attacks have mainly targeted companies that have deprived wikileaks of their services , including the websites of the online payment service paypal , and the credit card giants visa and mastercard , which had stopped processing donations for wikileaks .
also targeted were amazon.com , which had banished wikileaks from using its rented servers , a swiss bank and the website of the swedish prosecutor who had issued an arrest warrant for assange on charges of sexual misconduct .
the group of hackers , which calls itself " anonymous , " says it wants to keep the internet open and free .
wikileaks has distanced itself from the cyber attacks , but said they reflected public opinion .
in a statement , the organization said it had no contact with anonymous and had not received prior notice of any of the group 's actions .
assange : " charges fabricated " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : julian assange says he is innocent of the charges assange is currently in a british jail after handing himself in to police on tuesday . police have moved the wikileaks ' chief from the main part of wandsworth prison to an isolation unit , his lawyer said friday . " the prison authorities are doing it for his own safety , presumably , " jennifer robinson , one of assange 's legal team told the afp news agency . assange has been refused the use of his own laptop but will be given a prison computer with limited internet access , the guardian newspaper reported friday .
assange says the swedish sexual misconduct charges are a fabrication intended to stop his organization from continuing to publish confidential documents .
wikileaks is facing international condemnation for its publication of confidential material , often concerning diplomatic relations between countries .
some of the documents have caused embarrassment to the nations concerned .
assange is due to appear in a london court for a second time on tuesday , when prosecutors want to question him about allegations of rape and sexual molestation made by two women .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de development policy -pipe- 10.12.2010 opinion : poor countries can afford social protection großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sub-saharan nation of lesotho has established a pension system that costs less than two percent of gni a recent report suggests that even poor countries can afford basic social protection schemes - and these schemes pay off in terms of economic development , argues commentator dr markus loewe . the recommendations made in this week 's european report on development , drafted by the florence-based european university institute in florence and funded by the european commission and some european union member states , will surprise few experts .
what is remarkable about this latest report is how clearly its authors , most of whom are economists , advocate stronger government engagement in social policies - even in the low-income countries of sub-saharan africa .
basic social protection schemes , the authors suggest , could contribute to growth and poverty reduction , and assist developing countries in reaching the millennium development goals .
the report draws on recent research that highlights the importance of social protection to the economic and political development of countries .
people without access to a social safety net risk falling -lrb- even deeper -rrb- into poverty when faced with a shock like illness or a bad harvest .
they may then have to turn to savings , sell livestock or other assets or send their children to work rather than school in order to finance their daily needs .
in this way , they lose means of livelihoods that might otherwise help them to establish at least a modest existence on their own .
more seriously , households without social protection tend to shy away from investing savings at the outset , instead hoarding income to stay liquid and to prepare for a possible loss of future income or unexpected expenditures .
empirical studies suggest that families , and especially those who work in the informal sector , are more likely to invest when they have access to basic social protection schemes . such investment promotes economic growth precisely where it is most likely to help reduce poverty .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : where families have no safety net , they may be forced to sell income-producing assets like cattle in hard times finally , social protection schemes contribute to political stability .
by reducing poverty and economic insecurity , they lower the chances that a people will resort to violence to achieve political aims .
above all , though , such schemes show citizens that the state feels responsible and cares for them .
many studies point out that , where public social protection schemes exist , citizens identify more closely with the state and show a willingness to fulfill their obligations to the community .
so basic social protection helps not only to reduce poverty but also acts as insurance for business activities and the material basis of a social contract accepted by every citizen .
many will ask how low-income countries can be expected to finance social protection schemes - and rightly so .
it is rarely the case that the majority of a population is covered by social protection systems that the members themselves finance through contributions - social and private insurance schemes and community-based mutual insurance associations , for instance .
this is because , in low-income countries especially , contributions to such schemes are too high for many people .
at the same time , the idea of social transfer schemes financed by the state from tax revenues is often rejected on the grounds that governments in low-income countries do not enjoy wide enough budget margins to be able to fund such schemes .
yet this year 's european report on development -lrb- erd -rrb- reflects a turning point in the academic debate .
even low-income countries that can not afford comprehensive social protection for all their citizens can find satisfactory solutions for particularly vulnerable groups .
for example lesotho , among other african countries , has created a tax-financed system that grants a modest flat pension to everybody over a certain age .
although lesotho is a poor country , the program costs less than two percent of gross national income , and in many households it benefits not only the elderly but also their student grandchildren who want to lay better foundations for their later working lives .
similarly , ethiopia has developed a program that provides poor families jobs in rural infrastructure construction .
the international labor organization estimates that the total cost of establishing both of these programs as well as an unconditional cash transfer program for orphans would not exceed six percent of national income in any sub-saharan african country .
unfortunately , the 2010 erd does not explain how and by whom social protection is to be organized where the state is unwilling or unable to do so .
in such cases , social protection can be provided only by non-governmental actors through , for example , micro-insurance schemes .
the erd restricts the definition of social protection to action conducted by the state , and so does not consider this course of action .
where efficient government does not exist , self-help in the shape of , say , mutual insurance continues to be the only way out .
this is now true of a quarter to a half of all countries in sub-saharan africa , as noted in last year 's erd .

according a report published thursday in the british medical journal -lrb- bmj -rrb- , the tiny pencils have proved very useful when marking bones during surgery .
the authors of the report , karen eley from the nuffield department of surgical sciences at the university of oxford , and stephen watt-smith from the department of maxillofacial surgery at the john radcliffe hospital in oxford , say they were surprised when they were handed an ikea pencil in the middle of an operation .
" as popular as these little pencils are , we were still surprised to be handed one halfway through a surgical case , " they wrote in the report .
" the use of a pencil to mark osteotomy cuts in craniofacial and maxillofacial surgery is well established , proving superior to methylene .
bonney 's blue and felt tipped skin markers struggle to transfer an ink mark to bone , or are washed away by irrigation or tissue fluids . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sometimes it 's just like woodwork a pencil is a pencil but despite the report , surgeons are apparently not brand-loyal . " it 's no different to any other pencil , " eley told deutsche welle , clearing up any misunderstandings .
" the bmj just made it sound like that .
we just thought it was funny that we were in the middle of surgery and asked for a pencil and were handed an ikea one . "
" it 's just like when a carpenter uses a pencil to mark a piece of wood to saw , " she added .
" except bone is a bit harder than wood . "
unfortunately , repeated sterilization means that some of the pencils split but even this problem has apparently been overcome by wrapping silicon cuffs around the pencil .

but guests gathered around an empty chair to congratulate the laureate , who was not represented at the ceremony . the nobel peace prize committee has concluded its award ceremony in oslo with the prizewinner and guest of honor , imprisoned chinese dissident liu xiaobo , absent .
the prize was meant to " point out the relationship between human rights , democracy and peace " , nobel peace prize committee chairman thorbjoern jagland said in his opening comments .
he called liu a symbol of the " non-violent struggle for such -lsb- human -rsb- rights in china " , and compared him with nelson mandela .
he went on to say that liu had done nothing but exercise his civil rights , and called on china to release him .
in his absence , norwegian actress liv ullmann read a final statement titled " i have no enemies " released by liu 's supporters after his sentencing a year ago .
in it , liu said " there is no force that can put an end to the human quest for freedom , and china will in the end become a nation ruled by law , where human rights reign supreme . "
he also spoke of his wife , liu xia , who is now under house arrest in beijing , saying her love " is the sunlight that leaps over high walls and penetrates the iron bars of my prison window . "
international solidarity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : liu xiaobo is considered a criminal by the chinese authorities throughout friday , western governments paid tribute to liu 's contribution to democracy and human rights , calling on china to release the dissident from prison .
in berlin , german human rights commissioner markus loening praised liu 's courageous stand for human rights .
" the participation of germany as well as all eu partners represented in oslo and many other countries in the ceremony in oslo is therefore a simple sign of respect for liu xiaobo and for all who work to promote human rights and democracy without resorting to violence , " a statement from loening on the german foreign ministry website said .
united states president barack obama meanwhile hailed liu as a beacon of freedom : " the values he espouses are universal , his struggle is peaceful , and he should be released as soon as possible , " obama said .
event overshadowed the event in the norwegian capital was overshadowed not only by liu 's absence , but also by china 's wider anger at his selection .
several nations decided to boycott the ceremony at beijing 's request after the chinese government condemned the decision to award the prize to the democracy activist .
almost a third of the 50 countries invited to the event stayed away , including russia , pakistan and saudi arabia .
many of those not attending are thought to have bowed to chinese pressure .
serbia , which was heavily criticized by the european union for its initial decision not to attend , decided at the last minute to send an ombudsman after all .
chinese media condemn choice bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an empty chair represented liu at the ceremony official chinese media have slammed the choice of liu as nobel peace prize laureate , calling it an attempt to impose foreign values on china .
liu has been a critic of the chinese government since the tiananmen square massacre of 1989 .
liu took a prominent part in the protests there and was sentenced to two years in prison .
he was jailed last december for 11 years on subversion charges after he co-authored a document called charter 08 , which calls for political reform in china .
authorities have also cracked down on activists in the run-up to the ceremony and have prevented liu 's family and friends from attending .
empty chair the nobel committee chose to represent liu with an empty chair during the ceremony , calling this a symbol of the chinese policy to isolate and repress dissidents .
in a moving gesture , jagland placed the nobel diploma on the vacant seat .
it is the first time that a laureate under detention has not been formally represented since 1935 , when nazi germany stopped the pacifist carl von ossietzky from attending .
it is also the first time since then that the prize money of 1.13 million euros -lrb- $ 1.5 million -rrb- will not be handed out .

not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content .
australia offers support to wikileaks founder , operation payback begins should assange be extradited to the united states ?
why ?
he did not spy , he did not steal all the data that was passed along to him - nor is he a us citizen .
the us has been caught with the pants way down and of course , does n't like it one bit .
the us has sprung a " leaki " in its " weaki " and does n't like it one " bitty . "
as the saying goes … those who live in glass houses should not be throwing stones . - vera , germany i believe asange did bring out the true colors of individuals , opinion makers and governments in the present context of world politics .
everyone should admire his forthright exposure , however bitter it may be ; more so the americans who expect democracies and freedom to speech to flourish around the globe .
extradition and implicating him will only show the us in bad light . - mohan , india no , he should n't be extradited .
it 's a witch hunt to divert blame from the people who should be overseeing us security .
we 've paid good money for homeland security .
whose fault is it that thousands of secret documents were released ? - wayne , us definitely not .
supporting corruption and lack of common sense has been the m.o. for too long .
someone needs to wake up the people over here , wikileaks is a good start . - gene , us the us has only itself to blame for the leaks ... its a schoolyard bully that 's now having a tantrum and calling on its buddies to help it in a scrap because it knows it ca n't nuke everyone that does n't agree with it .
in australia the us is seen as a gutless mongrel that will do anything to get its own way especially concerning energy drilling . - tom , australia julian assange is a xxi century hero , in the sixties the fight against the empire was with " guerrillas , " today the fight is with internet .
and he 's going to win . - crstina , spain the us is paranoid about wikileaks .
a typical response of killing the messenger .
no extradition of julian assange .
the eu should promote transparency and be more open about foreign policies and clarity of diplomatic mores in language . - j. , the netherlands no way jose !
who cares about america ?
not me anyway : -rrb- i 'm so happy about wikileaks and anything that harms america .
they think an insult to us is immoral , and that they are somehow better than the rest of us .
they are just greedy , self-important and power-obsessed .
everything they touch is tarnished .
they are so last century .
bring on the rise of china and india !
how dare they think they can " spy " on other countries in the un ! - brian , ireland if any european country extradites julian assange to the united states , it will be for a political " crime . "
is europe the running dog of the us , or a group of sovereign nations dedicated to freedom of the press , freedom of the individual and people having the right to know what is going on ?
kevin rudd claims that the core problem is the failure by the us to protect its diplomatic communications .
i think the core problem is the behavior of the us .
the reason that wikileaks has not released the diplomatic communications of other countries -lrb- eg : germany , australia -rrb- is that they are better behaved and do not goose-step on the world stage , trying to take over the world . - charles , australia i believe that having all that " secret " info available for everybody to learn was not the " status quo " however it was disclosed and it is done .
the fellow in jail in the united kingdom is actually a journalist devoted to inform the public .
if he ever is extradited to the us he can claim " freedom of expression . "
now , in terms of those " ladies " claiming sex crimes , that is a bit doubtful .
they have waited until now , come on !
i believe that it was a politically manipulated act to get him behind bars .
and if those allegedly " crimes " were committed in sweden , should n't he then be extradited to that country ? - elena , us no .
he 's a hero who has struck a powerful blow for freedom !
he should be given the medal of freedom award ! - michael , us no , he should not be extradited to the us ; he has not been charged with any us crime .
whatever one thinks about wikileaks , mr. assange is taking a principled stand against the establishment for personal convictions and at great risk to himself .
if the political solution is to restrict freedom of the internet it will amplify assange 's stance : that many elected politicians are duplicitous control freaks who need their over-used and abused powers curtailed .
he deserves respect , support and applause for his courage . - a. , japan i believe that assange is being targeted for what he did .
if he 's found guilty of real sexual misconduct , i believe he should be punished , but as far as the internet crap , i believe he 'll prevail .
he 'll probably either wimp out for future stuff , or he 'll feel more emboldened .
i 'd like to see the hackers messing with mastercard put to be punished though .
it causes too many undeserving people a lot of pain . - joe , us i am completely baffled by the case .
mr. assange has been arrested in a country -lrb- uk -rrb- which belongs to the interpol group of countries so , according to the rules , he might be obviously extradited to sweden - country which relies on " the rules " within the interpol group .
at the same time , mr. assange has been accused of allegedly having broken the law of another country -lrb- usa -rrb- which is also in the interpol group .
in addition , his own country -lrb- australia -rrb- has now given a hint of standing up for him by offering him legal help , not ruling out his extradition to australia -lrb- being also the interpol member . -rrb-
in addition , there is the international court of justice in the hague -lrb- operating within the uno . -rrb-
so international law , respective rules of law of the countries mentioned , international organizations -lrb- interpol , uno , eu -rrb- are all to be bundled in this case which is too much intricate to the ' untrained eye ' in this " legal maze .

each december in oslo , the arguments about whether the right recipient was chosen can be just as fierce as the threats these winners often face because of their work .
individuals who take a stand for peace and reconciliation in difficult conflict situations tend to have more enemies than friends .
by awarding the detained chinese professor of literature and democracy activist , liu xiabo , this year 's peace prize in oslo on october 8 , the nobel committee made an apt comment on the changing global balance of power .
this is how its decision should be interpreted .
a rising power like china needs to respect human and civil rights for the benefit of all mankind - that was the message from oslo .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : adrienne woltersdorf , the head of deutsche welle 's chinese service , is in oslo it is a slap in the chinese authorities ' face .
they have reacted accordingly and suppressed any domestic discourse about the so eagerly awaited - and now so despised - first chinese nobel laureate in history .
in addition , many activists , including liu 's wife liu xia , were preemptively intimidated or simply put under house arrest .
the regime 's harsh reactions show that the norwegian jury really touched a nerve in beijing .
but it is ridiculous that those loyal to the regime allege that the nobel committee intended to provocatively and maliciously challenge china 's rise .
the truth , in fact , is the precise opposite .
for quite some time , even veteran cadres of the mao era have been calling for more freedom of thought in china .
just recently , a group of influential former cadres reiterated this demand in a letter to the new party leadership .
a rapidly changing society , they argued , needs freedom of debate and opportunity for criticism in order to make wise decisions for the future .
such voices will be encouraged by the nobel peace prize , and only the chinese can decide how china should develop .
in this sense , the peace prize for liu xiaobo is also a unique chance for the badly divided and marginalized chinese democracy movement .
oslo could thus become the starting point for a new movement .
but before this happens , democracy activists inside and outside of china will have to prove that they can restrain their somtimes excessive egos , and dedicate themselves to the collective cause .
the powers-that-be in beijing will do everything they can to continue to marginalize the proponents of democracy .
they have given sufficient proof during the past weeks that they are perfectly capable of doing this .
but the chinese civil rights activists now have an internationally recognized leader .
they have a prudent manifesto - liu xiaobo 's " charter ' 08 " document - they have a sympathetic international audience , and they have the internet ; all that they 're missing is a single movement to unite them .

standing alongside serb prime minister mirko cvetkovic , he said that the eu " regrets the decision of serbia not to attend " the ceremony and added that serbia was " expected to embrace euro values and coordinate " with partners .
his words had a deep impact : while the foreign minister of serbia had originally defended the country 's decision not to attend the ceremony , serbia decided to send its ombudsman for human rights , sasa jankovic , to oslo .
serbia was the only eu candidate that originally decided to stay away from the ceremony honoring chinese human rights activist liu xiaobo .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the chinese government refused to let liu xiaobo attend the ceremony : his seat remained empty after the announcement of this year 's laureate , china had protested against the nobel committee 's decision and had urged other countries to boycott the ceremony .
serbia followed china 's call , as it relies on chinese government support for serbia 's opposition to an independent kosovo .
caught between a rock and a hard place but serbia is caught in a clash of interests , because it wants to join the 27-nation bloc of the european union .
fuele and other eu representatives clarified that serbia needed to comply with the joint decision of eu member states to send representatives to oslo in order not to lessen its chances of becoming a member state .
pedrag simic , political scientist at the university of belgrad says that despite serbia 's goal to join the european union , the country would still rely on four pillars of international politics - brussels , washington , moscow , and peking .
" a small country can only follow one superpower , " he said .
simic added that serbia 's attempts to be loyal to both china and the european union had to result in a dilemma such as the current one at some point .

that doesn ’ t hold true for some other countries . the charge that us foreign policy is hypocritical is all but new , but the wikileaks data release has added some additional fuel to it .
just a few days ago , libya 's leader muammar gaddafi lauded the organization for exposing us " hypocrisy " through its diplomacy conducted behind closed doors , in comments published via the state news agency jana .
according to gaddafi , the leaked cables " proved that america is not what it has led allies and friends to believe it to be " and that " us relations with its allies are hypocritical . "
while there is certainly an expected discrepancy in the tone and style of these confidential reports and the language us diplomats use in public , the cables actually reveal that the us has been largely consistent with the overall messages and themes it conveys to its international partners in private and in public , argue scholars interviewed by deutsche welle . " there 's nothing in these cables that is different from what we actually know about us foreign policy without these cables , " says thomas risse , director of the center for transnational relations , foreign and security policy at the free university of berlin .
" the whole approach by these people from wikileaks seems to be that there is a public side to us foreign policy and then there is this secret side and that there is some sort conspiracy involved in all this , " he says .
" and i do n't see a huge mismatch actually between what the us says in public and what it does . "
clear goals one of the dominant topics in these cables are us security interests and the fact that washington considers transnational terrorism a major threat , adds risse : " that is exactly what barack obama and hillary clinton would say every day . "
the same is true for other top issues such as the iranian nuclear program , the spread of nuclear and ballistic missiles and the stabilization of afghanistan , says dan reiter , a professor of international relations at emory university in atlanta : " at the broadest level i think the cables reveal that the goals the us is engaging in private are essentially similar to the goals that it is espousing in public . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : saudi king abdullah urged the president barack obama to take action against iran asked whether the insights gained from reading the frank assessments of diplomats engaged in shaping and carrying out us foreign policy will alter their view of the us role or status in the world , risse and reiter both answer with a resounding no . " the us is not an empire , there are very clear limits to us influence in the world , " says risse .
" of course the us is a superpower .
it has interests in all corners of the world , it does try to influence other governments , but that 's ok .
there 's nothing that would get me worked up about this at all . "
no puppet master the cables are " not terribly surprising , " notes reiter .
" one does n't get an image of the united states as this all-powerful puppet master trying to pull the strings of various governments around the world to serve its corporate interests .
that 's an image which does not emerge . "
instead , the cables paint a picture of the us acting as one would expect a major power to do so , adds reiter .
" i do n't think that anything we see is terribly different from the way most states have conducted their foreign policy in the modern era . "
what 's more surprising to the analysts is the behavior of arab countries that becomes evident in the cables .
while the opposition of arab states to iran 's nuclear program has been known in foreign policy circles for some time , the contrast between confidential assessments made in private and public statements is particularly stark . double talk " the level of hypocrisy that comes out of these cables is much higher for instance in the middle east , " says risse .
" it 's very clear from these cables that most arab states feel really threatened by iranian nuclear power , however they would never say that in public .
in fact , they say the opposite in public . "
according to the cables , king abdullah of saudi arabia and king hamed ibn isa khalifa of bahrain are among arab leaders who pressed the us to attack iran .
king abdullah repeatedly exhorted the united states to " cut off the head of the snake " and take military action against tehran 's nuclear facilities .
open questions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : to evaluate the cables properly , scholars need more information about the documents in contrast to that , conclude the experts , the general outlines of us foreign policy are pretty much in sync with what the wikileaks documents have revealed so far and they have n't unearthed anything entirely unexpected .
nevertheless , argues risse , the document dump still poses a serious problem : " if you look at these cables from the perspective of an academic or historian , the real big question is what is the sample , ? " says risse . " is this a random selection , is this a selection that is representative of the whole or what exactly is it .
we have absolutely no way to judge this . "
risse notes , that even if all 250,000 cables are published in the end , it is still not clear how large a sample this is , how relevant the cables are or were in the decision-making processes for us officials and what the criteria were to publish them .
without those answers , many of which could be provided by wikileaks , a thorough assessment of the cables and its content wo n't be possible . author : michael knigge editor : rob mudge send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de climate -pipe- 10.12.2010 post-summit , mexico sees itself as global player on climate change großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : calderon wants mexico to be at the forefront of climate action as host to this year 's un climate talks , mexico also holds the conference presidency – and the country is positioning itself as a key negotiator , one that can bridge the gap between rich and poor nations . for mexican president felipe calderon it 's an honor to host the un climate conference .
yet that honor comes at a price : providing security , logistics and organization for around 15,000 delegates takes a toll on resources .
there is no question as to whether the conference has been worth the effort , says gustavo ampugnani of greenpeace mexico .
" as a mexican i am of course proud that it 's my country that 's hosting this conference - after all , it 's about saving the global climate , " he told deutsche welle .
from a global perspective he said mexico did a good job in taking a leading role in the struggle against climate change .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some 15,000 delegates from around the world came to attend the cancun talks he added that , crucially , the summit also served to heighten awareness within mexico itself about the impact of climate change .
" for us at greenpeace , what matters is of course not only staging this conferece , but also the concrete actions back home here in mexico , " ampugnani said , pointing out out the dependency on fossil fuels like oil and coal .
" we have to reduce our own emissions - and in that field , i 'd say , mexico still has a lot to do before the country can actually be proud of its climate policy . "
building bridges mexico has stepped up its climate protection efforts .
with the conference in cancun well underway , the government passed a law introducing emission targets , and taxes on emissions in the mexico city area .
the 20 million living there make up around 25 percent of the country 's total population .
during the climate talks themselves , mexico 's efforts were exemplary .
" i think the conference here is very well organized - with dedication and professionalism .
mexico is indeed trying to build bridges , " german environment minister norbert roettgen said in cancun .
president calderon 's declared goal is achieving progress on the so-called green fund , set up to channel aid to countries suffering from the consequences of climate change .
calderon wants every country to contribute to the fund .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : around 25 percent of the country 's population live in the capital mexico city the amount that each country would have to contribute would be linked to both the extent to which it contributes to climate change and to its economic wealth .
a total of $ 100 billion -lrb- 76 billion euros -rrb- is to go into the fund each year , starting in 2020 .
that , at least , is the plan according to the agreement reached at last year 's climate change summit in copenhagen .
but the climate fund has turned out to be a thorny issue .
negotiators at cancun were supposed to work out the details , but it 's precisely those details that are proving difficult , and mexico is having a hard time trying get the delegates to agree to a compromise .
" africa for instance contributes only two percent to the global co2 emissions - but at the same time it 's africa that 's the part of the world worst affected by the consequences of climate change , " german environment minister roettgen said .
" and the job is to get all of the 194 attending countries to agree on something so we can have a concrete result at the end of the day .
this proves to be extremely complex and difficult .
but i get a sense that mexico is doing a good job - or at least as good a job as possible . "
will cancun deliver ?
whether mexico 's presidency of this year 's summit will in the end bring success is far from guaranteed .
the summit officially wraps up on friday and there have been few results so far .
often it is only in the last hours that marathon negotiations such as this one bear fruit .
last year in copenhagen , the talks went all through the night and into the early hours of the next day - although no deal even remotely close to what many had hoped for was ever reached .
a similar failure in cancun would be a serious blow to the un 's climate policy , undermining international trust in its ability to bring about real change .

meanwhile , chinese pressure seems to have galvanized western democracies . it will forever remain the symbol of this year 's nobel peace prize ceremony in oslo .
as dignitaries from around the world stood and applauded , norwegian nobel committee chairman thorbjoern jagland placed the blue clad nobel diploma on the empty chair , where liu xiaobo would have sat .
liu , a 54-year-old literary critic and democracy advocate , is serving an 11-year prison sentence for subversion , handed down last year after he co-authored a bold appeal for human rights and political reform .
a sign of china 's weakness in his speech at the ceremony , jagland noted liu 's imprisonment and regretted that he was not present to receive the award .
" this fact alone shows that the award was necessary and appropriate , " jagland said . he added that despite all of china 's economic strength , its weakness was manifested " in the need to imprison a man for 11 years merely for expressing his opinions on how his country should be governed . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a flower is placed near a picture of liu xiaobo in hong kong on friday liu xiaobo had told his wife that he would like this year ’ s peace prize to be dedicated to " the lost souls from june 4 " .
he was referring to the many activists who died during the firing by government troops on the tiananmen square in beijing .
the nobel committee has accepted his wish .
jagland also said that , although none of the committee ’ s members had ever met liu , " we feel that we know him .
we have studied him closely over a long period of time " .
chinese pressure backfires while china had successfully pressured more than a dozen countries not to attend the ceremony to honor liu xiaobo , it seemed in oslo that its efforts also backfired in a way . after all , it was the chinese government 's pressure which transformed liu into a cause celebre among global rights activists .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chinese citizens clash with troops near tiananmen square in beijing in 1989 moreover , the pressure felt in oslo even hours before the ceremony , seemed to be galvanizing the west , reminding citizens of democracies of the values the nobel peace prize stands for .
china 's pressure tactics had continued unabated on friday .
amnesty international 's oslo representatives said that members of norway 's chinese community were being pressured by chinese diplomats to join anti-nobel protests planned for saturday .
the nobel committee chairman emphasized that the committee ’ s intention had been to make a statement about the relationship between human rights , democracy and peace .
the rights democracies around the world enjoyed today were fought for and won by people who took great risks .
" they did so for others .
that is why liu xiaobo deserves our support , " jagland said .

in its one-hundred-year history , this is the first time that the prize is awarded to a chinese citizen .
yet , the laureate , his family members , and even close friends are incarcerated in their own country .
no one can come to receive the award . the scottish pen has produced a " liu xiaobo chair " , which has been sent over to oslo .
now it stands in the city hall .
this empty chair is a reminder that its owner , who should enjoy the highest international honor today , is absent from the ceremony , banquet and concert , which are devoted to him . the host country 's king , the queen , european royal families , foreign ambassadors and representatives , as well as guests from overseas gather in the bright hall decorated with flowers and make a toast to xiaobo .
but many of us are still melancholy , and we ask , where is liu xiaobo and his beloved liu xia ?
let us travel through time and space and visit liu xia first . we are in haidian district , beijing , yuyuantan south road number 9 .
from a distance one can see the white building where the lius live .
the police cars are parked in front of the house ; several policemen parade around .
journalists from far and near are cordoned off some hundred meters away .
no one is allowed to get into the forbidden zone . thin , with a shaven head -lrb- or short-cropped hair -rrb- , liu xia is sitting alone in the empty home .
rinse the ashtray the coffee table wiped take the glass cups boil two cups of longjing or oolong aside the table you sit looking at the cup in front of the empty seat stare at the cup , listen is there the move of key in the hole ...
the cup in the hand , you take a sip lifted the cup to the sun cup and your fingers penetrated by the sun palm was stained by the transparent green delicate a hint of panic is there too the cup on the opposite site you know will be empty for a long time it takes long till the man opens your door -lrb- from liu ’ s poem " sunshine and cups - to my little finger , who drinks tea every day " -rrb- liu xia may wait for a long time , maybe another ten years .
now we visit xiaobo in jinzhou prison in the small chinese town nanshan in liaoning province .
entering the gate , we see several scattered buildings .
surprisingly , we see a huge office wall on which is written boldly ' 1984 ' .
a few months ago , liu xia , accompanied by the stainless steel mouse liu di , wang jinbo , mo zhixu and wang zhongxia , came here for a visit .
they were amazed at orwell ’ s rebirth in a chinese prison . snickering , they took pictures in front of the " 1984 wall " .
several officers rushed to them and took them into custody .
separately , they were interrogated for hours . we enter xiaobo ’ s cell now .
he shares with five other prisoners a 3 by 4 meter space .
his head is bald , shaved like an ordinary criminal .
his body is swollen by the padded jacket and trousers .
scarf , hat and gloves are a must in the cell because the concrete floor of the prison is cold .
the small window beneath the high ceiling is always open .
in winter , the indoor temperature is higher than outdoors ; it is a few degrees above zero .
the odor of the open toilet bucket in the corner is neutralized by the cold air , but one can not ignore the stench of the daily waste of several men .
the smell not only fills the room , it penetrates through clothes , and into the pores of the skin . this is the first winter that xiaobo spends in a prison in northern china .
he will have to adjust himself to the circumstances .
he does not know whether he will have frostbite .
to sit and lie on the concrete floors all year round may cause neck and spine pain and lead to kidney problems .
his stomach disease has given him a hard time since his imprisonment .
xiaobo has exited his cell today , but he does not want to show it to others otherwise his cell-mates might become cynical and angry .
sitting there , his thoughts fly to oslo .
he has had constant dreams about it .
who will be there at the ceremony ?
who will receive the prize for me ?
it could not be liu xia .
she has not sent any sign of life for a while .
my acceptance speech is long written in my head , but who can read it out aloud for me ?
does the king wear a majestic tuxedo , and the queen her crown at the banquet ?
will the distinguished guests think of the dead in tiananmen square and the tiananmen mothers and make a toast ?
sitting in the dungeon , xiaobo does not know that the announcement of his award induced a tsunami in zhongnanhai , and the rulers had a mild concussion , followed by delusions : they believe that their enemies are all over the world , so the grip on the naughty writers and the guy who held the crab dinner party must be tightened .
they must not go outside the country , otherwise they could endanger national security .
liu xiaobo ’ s dinner on december 10 , 2010 may look like this : boiled vegetables with sand , and a few pieces of fat meat as a special treat .
he might have an extra piece of steamed bread , and his rice bowl could also be refilled today .
in short , it is a privileged meal that will long be remembered , because it is a meal that will leave the stomach truly filled .
after all , he is the first chinese to win the nobel peace prize .

in its one-hundred-year history , this is the first time that the prize is awarded to a chinese citizen .
yet , the laureate , his family members , and even close friends are incarcerated in their own country .
no one can come to receive the award . the scottish pen has produced a " liu xiaobo chair " , which has been sent over to oslo .
now it stands in the city hall .
this empty chair is a reminder that its owner , who should enjoy the highest international honor today , is absent from the ceremony , banquet and concert , which are devoted to him . the host country 's king , the queen , european royal families , foreign ambassadors and representatives , as well as guests from overseas gather in the bright hall decorated with flowers and make a toast to xiaobo .
but many of us are still melancholy , and we ask , where is liu xiaobo and his beloved liu xia ?
let us travel through time and space and visit liu xia first . we are in haidian district , beijing , yuyuantan south road number 9 .
from a distance one can see the white building where the lius live .
the police cars are parked in front of the house ; several policemen parade around .
journalists from far and near are cordoned off some hundred meters away .
no one is allowed to get into the forbidden zone . thin , with a shaven head -lrb- or short-cropped hair -rrb- , liu xia is sitting alone in the empty home .
rinse the ashtray the coffee table wiped take the glass cups boil two cups of longjing or oolong aside the table you sit looking at the cup in front of the empty seat stare at the cup , listen is there the move of key in the hole ...
the cup in the hand , you take a sip lifted the cup to the sun cup and your fingers penetrated by the sun palm was stained by the transparent green delicate a hint of panic is there too the cup on the opposite site you know will be empty for a long time it takes long till the man opens your door -lrb- from liu ’ s poem " sunshine and cups - to my little finger , who drinks tea every day " -rrb- liu xia may wait for a long time , maybe another ten years .
now we visit xiaobo in jinzhou prison in the small chinese town nanshan in liaoning province .
entering the gate , we see several scattered buildings .
surprisingly , we see a huge office wall on which is written boldly ' 1984 ' .
a few months ago , liu xia , accompanied by the stainless steel mouse liu di , wang jinbo , mo zhixu and wang zhongxia , came here for a visit .
they were amazed at orwell ’ s rebirth in a chinese prison . snickering , they took pictures in front of the " 1984 wall " .
several officers rushed to them and took them into custody .
separately , they were interrogated for hours . we enter xiaobo ’ s cell now .
he shares with five other prisoners a 3 by 4 meter space .
his head is bald , shaved like an ordinary criminal .
his body is swollen by the padded jacket and trousers .
scarf , hat and gloves are a must in the cell because the concrete floor of the prison is cold .
the small window beneath the high ceiling is always open .
in winter , the indoor temperature is higher than outdoors ; it is a few degrees above zero .
the odor of the open toilet bucket in the corner is neutralized by the cold air , but one can not ignore the stench of the daily waste of several men .
the smell not only fills the room , it penetrates through clothes , and into the pores of the skin . this is the first winter that xiaobo spends in a prison in northern china .
he will have to adjust himself to the circumstances .
he does not know whether he will have frostbite .
to sit and lie on the concrete floors all year round may cause neck and spine pain and lead to kidney problems .
his stomach disease has given him a hard time since his imprisonment .
xiaobo has exited his cell today , but he does not want to show it to others otherwise his cell-mates might become cynical and angry .
sitting there , his thoughts fly to oslo .
he has had constant dreams about it .
who will be there at the ceremony ?
who will receive the prize for me ?
it could not be liu xia .
she has not sent any sign of life for a while .
my acceptance speech is long written in my head , but who can read it out aloud for me ?
does the king wear a majestic tuxedo , and the queen her crown at the banquet ?
will the distinguished guests think of the dead in tiananmen square and the tiananmen mothers and make a toast ?
sitting in the dungeon , xiaobo does not know that the announcement of his award induced a tsunami in zhongnanhai , and the rulers had a mild concussion , followed by delusions : they believe that their enemies are all over the world , so the grip on the naughty writers and the guy who held the crab dinner party must be tightened .
they must not go outside the country , otherwise they could endanger national security .
liu xiaobo ’ s dinner on december 10 , 2010 may look like this : boiled vegetables with sand , and a few pieces of fat meat as a special treat .
he might have an extra piece of steamed bread , and his rice bowl could also be refilled today .
in short , it is a privileged meal that will long be remembered , because it is a meal that will leave the stomach truly filled .
after all , he is the first chinese to win the nobel peace prize .

" we have noticed that the chinese are very engaged this year , " said geir lundestad , director of the nobel institute .
" they want as few nations as possible to accept the invitation .
now we 'll see who does not come for political reasons and who have other reasons . " the nobel committee has said 44 nations will be sending envoys to the ceremony , including eu member states , the united states , japan , india , south korea , south africa , indonesia and brazil . political , social motives bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at the ceremony , 20 countries will have empty chairs but another 20 countries have said they will not be in attendance .
serbia cited its interest in maintaining good relations with china for its absence , but other countries , including russia , are offering other reasons .
moscow has said scheduling difficulties - not political considerations - were keeping it away . but the scheduling conflicts veil russia 's political motive not to attend , according to sergei lukashevsky , the head of moscow 's sakharov museum . " that russia is not participating in the nobel peace prize 's award ceremony once again makes it clear that human rights do not play a prominent role in our foreign policy , " he said . " russia and china are members of the shanghai organization for cooperation and one of its goals is the fight against so-called extremism , " lukashevsky added .
" what that really means is that the countries support each other when it comes to fighting uncomfortable political situations . several countries in the middle east as well as afghanistan , pakistan and the philippines are also avoiding the ceremony because for economic and political reasons , according to rainer sollich , head of deutsche welle 's arabic department . " they are all states that have problems concerning human rights and operate under the understanding that they would n't want china at a ceremony honoring someone they view as an opponent of their regime . " china 's confucius prize china 's policy regarding the award ceremony and the still-imprisoned dissident liu has been clear .
referring to the nobel committee , chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman jiang yu said , " we will not change because of interference by a few clowns . " beijing awarded its own version of the nobel peace prize on thursday by giving the " confucius peace prize " to former taiwan vice-president lien chan .
like with liu 's nobel , chan was not in attendance to claim the award and his office said he was unaware of the prize . china has blocked access to the website of norwegian broadcaster nrk , the station said on thursday .
access to the bbc and cnn has also been affected ahead of friday 's ceremony , according to nrk . conspicuous absence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more protests in support of liu are scheduled for thursday friday will mark only the second time in the more than 100-year history of the prize that neither the laureate nor a representative will be able to come accept the award .
german journalist and pacifist carl von ossietzky , who was locked up in a nazi concentration camp , could not travel to oslo for his prize ceremony in 1936 . in addition to liu and ossietzky , myanmar 's aung san suu kyi was also barred from receiving her nobel peace prize in 1991 . liu has long been an outspoken opponent of chinese leadership in beijing and was at the forefront of the 1989 tiananmen square protests .
he was jailed in december 2009 for 11 years on subversion charges after co-authoring " charter 08 , " a manifesto that called for political reform in china . nobel officials said an empty chair would be used to represent liu 's absence . the 20 nations which will not attend the nobel ceremony are : afghanistan , china , colombia , cuba , egypt , iran , iraq , kazakhstan , morocco , pakistan , the philippines , russia , saudi arabia , serbia , sri lanka , sudan , tunisia , ukraine , venezuela and vietnam . authors : matthias von hein , jegor winogradow / sms -lrb- afp -rrb- editor : jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

what is remarkable about this latest report is how clearly its authors , most of whom are economists , advocate stronger government engagement in social policies - even in the low-income countries of sub-saharan africa .
basic social protection schemes , the authors suggest , could contribute to growth and poverty reduction , and assist developing countries in reaching the millennium development goals .
the report draws on recent research that highlights the importance of social protection to the economic and political development of countries .
people without access to a social safety net risk falling -lrb- even deeper -rrb- into poverty when faced with a shock like illness or a bad harvest .
they may then have to turn to savings , sell livestock or other assets or send their children to work rather than school in order to finance their daily needs .
in this way , they lose means of livelihoods that might otherwise help them to establish at least a modest existence on their own .
more seriously , households without social protection tend to shy away from investing savings at the outset , instead hoarding income to stay liquid and to prepare for a possible loss of future income or unexpected expenditures .
empirical studies suggest that families , and especially those who work in the informal sector , are more likely to invest when they have access to basic social protection schemes . such investment promotes economic growth precisely where it is most likely to help reduce poverty .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : where families have no safety net , they may be forced to sell income-producing assets like cattle in hard times finally , social protection schemes contribute to political stability .
by reducing poverty and economic insecurity , they lower the chances that a people will resort to violence to achieve political aims .
above all , though , such schemes show citizens that the state feels responsible and cares for them .
many studies point out that , where public social protection schemes exist , citizens identify more closely with the state and show a willingness to fulfill their obligations to the community .
so basic social protection helps not only to reduce poverty but also acts as insurance for business activities and the material basis of a social contract accepted by every citizen .
many will ask how low-income countries can be expected to finance social protection schemes - and rightly so .
it is rarely the case that the majority of a population is covered by social protection systems that the members themselves finance through contributions - social and private insurance schemes and community-based mutual insurance associations , for instance .
this is because , in low-income countries especially , contributions to such schemes are too high for many people .
at the same time , the idea of social transfer schemes financed by the state from tax revenues is often rejected on the grounds that governments in low-income countries do not enjoy wide enough budget margins to be able to fund such schemes .
yet this year 's european report on development -lrb- erd -rrb- reflects a turning point in the academic debate .
even low-income countries that can not afford comprehensive social protection for all their citizens can find satisfactory solutions for particularly vulnerable groups .
for example lesotho , among other african countries , has created a tax-financed system that grants a modest flat pension to everybody over a certain age .
although lesotho is a poor country , the program costs less than two percent of gross national income , and in many households it benefits not only the elderly but also their student grandchildren who want to lay better foundations for their later working lives .
similarly , ethiopia has developed a program that provides poor families jobs in rural infrastructure construction .
the international labor organization estimates that the total cost of establishing both of these programs as well as an unconditional cash transfer program for orphans would not exceed six percent of national income in any sub-saharan african country .
unfortunately , the 2010 erd does not explain how and by whom social protection is to be organized where the state is unwilling or unable to do so .
in such cases , social protection can be provided only by non-governmental actors through , for example , micro-insurance schemes .
the erd restricts the definition of social protection to action conducted by the state , and so does not consider this course of action .
where efficient government does not exist , self-help in the shape of , say , mutual insurance continues to be the only way out .
this is now true of a quarter to a half of all countries in sub-saharan africa , as noted in last year 's erd .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 10.12.2010 hanover hit new high with win over struggling stuttgart großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : goal hero ya konan can now boast nine for the season hanover continued to surpass expectations , rising to second in the standings with a 2-1 win over beleaguered stuttgart .
now , just third from bottom , stuttgart has decided to dump its coach , jens keller . ivorian didier ya konan scored twice to give hanover a 2-1 win over stuttgart on friday , taking his team to second place in the bundesliga ahead of the weekend 's main soccer action .
the loss was also the final straw for stuttgart 's management , which announced on saturday that it had fired coach jens keller .
after a cautious start by both sides , ya konan had the first major chance of the match in the 20th minute , with a shot that was stopped by stuttgart keeper sven ulreich .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while stuttgart battled back , they were unable to gain a much-needed point the breakthrough came on 35 minutes , after stuttgart left back arthur boka got a defensive foot to a ball from hanover 's lars stindl - only to divert it to ya konan .
the striker took advantage and passed the ball through ulreich 's legs to take his tally for the season to eight .
stuttgart responded positively , pressing throughout the game , and - with just a quarter of an hour to go - managed to equalize as georg niedermeier jumped to head a timo gebhart free kick into the far corner .
the comeback was short-lived .
after another attempt on the hanover goal , this time from philip degen , hanover swiftly counter-attacked .
ya konan latched onto a high ball from christian schulz to score through ulreich 's legs for a second time .
' an exceptional start ' the win means that hanover have already recorded one more victory than in the whole of last season .
" it is exceptional what we have achieved in the first half of the season , " said hanover technical director joerg schmadtke .
stuttgart is now without a win in its last five games and is third from the bottom with only 12 points from 16 games .
this dreary realization was enough for the team to pull the plug on jen keller 's 59-day rein as head coach .
the hottest prospect to replace him is bruno labaddia , who coached hamburg until the end of april .
in saturday 's football , bayern host st. pauli , hamburg entertain bayer leverkusen and cologne are at home to eintracht frankfurt .
nuremberg travel to hoffenheim , wolfsburg visit kaiserslautern and bremen will be hoping for an away win against leaders borussia dortmund .

creative industries there are , they say , some broad similarities between my hometown , manchester , and berlin .
both were throbbing industrial powerhouses in the 19th century , lost their luster and declined in the late 20th century , only to become trendy pop cultural centers in the last 20 years - manchester not so much anymore , but you get the general idea .
both cities have also become famous for hanging their new economic hopes on the " creative industries . "
this very spongy term refers to anything from actor to fashion designer , to independent shopkeeper , to web designer , and includes all the attendant skill sets , cameramen , lighting technicians , office managers etc .
the point is you do n't make anything - you delight , you entertain , you disseminate knowledge and information , or you sing cabaret songs naked in a disused warehouse in front of an audience of twelve .
by capitalizing on the cache and the large student population , the two cities deliberately encouraged a whole class of freelance migrants engaged in some kind of creative endeavor in an attempt to re-invent the city 's economy .
but the similarity with manchester ends when it comes to the social security system .
in berlin , many creative types live - at least partially - on the standard long-term unemployment benefit called hartz iv .
it does n't help the job statistics , but it does mean that the city 's economy is run , to a certain extent , by the welfare state .
social security for the middle class bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unemployment center : the lifeblood of a creative economy when it comes to dealing with the job center to claim your benefits , being an artist is a double-edged sword .
most artists do not earn enough to live from their art , so they are understandably unwilling to mention the meager side earnings their talents bring .
they live double lives : naked dadaist performance artists at night , out-of-work it specialists by day .
but others have a little more nerve , and tell their case manager they are " professional " artists .
if they have a degree as well -lrb- a degree puts you in a different , more exclusive waiting room -rrb- they get special dispensation from the endless round of pointless job applications and interviews that most hartz iv recipients are forced to take .
instead , professional unemployed artists are allowed to count applications for grants and scholarships as their applications , and can get the state to pay for acting lessons .
so there 's a tip , if the hard times are getting to you .

but guests gathered around an empty chair to congratulate the laureate , who was not represented at the ceremony . the nobel peace prize committee has concluded its award ceremony in oslo with the prizewinner and guest of honor , imprisoned chinese dissident liu xiaobo , absent .
the prize was meant to " point out the relationship between human rights , democracy and peace " , nobel peace prize committee chairman thorbjoern jagland said in his opening comments .
he called liu a symbol of the " non-violent struggle for such -lsb- human -rsb- rights in china " , and compared him with nelson mandela .
he went on to say that liu had done nothing but exercise his civil rights , and called on china to release him .
in his absence , norwegian actress liv ullmann read a final statement titled " i have no enemies " released by liu 's supporters after his sentencing a year ago .
in it , liu said " there is no force that can put an end to the human quest for freedom , and china will in the end become a nation ruled by law , where human rights reign supreme . "
he also spoke of his wife , liu xia , who is now under house arrest in beijing , saying her love " is the sunlight that leaps over high walls and penetrates the iron bars of my prison window . "
international solidarity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : liu xiaobo is considered a criminal by the chinese authorities throughout friday , western governments paid tribute to liu 's contribution to democracy and human rights , calling on china to release the dissident from prison .
in berlin , german human rights commissioner markus loening praised liu 's courageous stand for human rights .
" the participation of germany as well as all eu partners represented in oslo and many other countries in the ceremony in oslo is therefore a simple sign of respect for liu xiaobo and for all who work to promote human rights and democracy without resorting to violence , " a statement from loening on the german foreign ministry website said .
united states president barack obama meanwhile hailed liu as a beacon of freedom : " the values he espouses are universal , his struggle is peaceful , and he should be released as soon as possible , " obama said .
event overshadowed the event in the norwegian capital was overshadowed not only by liu 's absence , but also by china 's wider anger at his selection .
several nations decided to boycott the ceremony at beijing 's request after the chinese government condemned the decision to award the prize to the democracy activist .
almost a third of the 50 countries invited to the event stayed away , including russia , pakistan and saudi arabia .
many of those not attending are thought to have bowed to chinese pressure .
serbia , which was heavily criticized by the european union for its initial decision not to attend , decided at the last minute to send an ombudsman after all .
chinese media condemn choice bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an empty chair represented liu at the ceremony official chinese media have slammed the choice of liu as nobel peace prize laureate , calling it an attempt to impose foreign values on china .
liu has been a critic of the chinese government since the tiananmen square massacre of 1989 .
liu took a prominent part in the protests there and was sentenced to two years in prison .
he was jailed last december for 11 years on subversion charges after he co-authored a document called charter 08 , which calls for political reform in china .
authorities have also cracked down on activists in the run-up to the ceremony and have prevented liu 's family and friends from attending .
empty chair the nobel committee chose to represent liu with an empty chair during the ceremony , calling this a symbol of the chinese policy to isolate and repress dissidents .
in a moving gesture , jagland placed the nobel diploma on the vacant seat .
it is the first time that a laureate under detention has not been formally represented since 1935 , when nazi germany stopped the pacifist carl von ossietzky from attending .
it is also the first time since then that the prize money of 1.13 million euros -lrb- $ 1.5 million -rrb- will not be handed out .

the decision marks a profound change for germany , where compulsory service was re-introduced 50 years ago . senior officials in germany 's coalition government have agreed to suspend military conscription as of july 1 , 2011 .
defense minister karl theodor zu guttenberg 's proposal was accepted during closed-door talks in berlin on thursday evening .
the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- of chancellor angela merkel and its bavarian sister party the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- have both in principle approved abolishing the draft at party conferences in the past six weeks .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : focus : wikileaks disclosures wikileaks exposes shell 's infiltration of nigeria 's government wikileaks release could lead to shift from transparency to secrecy opinion : wikileaks is a test of us commitment to free press opinion : wikileaks ' latest release is a diplomatic waterloo international relations -pipe- 10.12.2010 wikileaks cables show consistent us foreign policy , say experts großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there 's no huge clash between public and private goals of the us state department contrary to oft-stated claims , the wikileaks cables show no huge credibility gap between official us policies and what diplomats write in confidential cables , say experts .
that doesn ’ t hold true for some other countries . the charge that us foreign policy is hypocritical is all but new , but the wikileaks data release has added some additional fuel to it .
just a few days ago , libya 's leader muammar gaddafi lauded the organization for exposing us " hypocrisy " through its diplomacy conducted behind closed doors , in comments published via the state news agency jana .
according to gaddafi , the leaked cables " proved that america is not what it has led allies and friends to believe it to be " and that " us relations with its allies are hypocritical . "
while there is certainly an expected discrepancy in the tone and style of these confidential reports and the language us diplomats use in public , the cables actually reveal that the us has been largely consistent with the overall messages and themes it conveys to its international partners in private and in public , argue scholars interviewed by deutsche welle . " there 's nothing in these cables that is different from what we actually know about us foreign policy without these cables , " says thomas risse , director of the center for transnational relations , foreign and security policy at the free university of berlin .
" the whole approach by these people from wikileaks seems to be that there is a public side to us foreign policy and then there is this secret side and that there is some sort conspiracy involved in all this , " he says .
" and i do n't see a huge mismatch actually between what the us says in public and what it does . "
clear goals one of the dominant topics in these cables are us security interests and the fact that washington considers transnational terrorism a major threat , adds risse : " that is exactly what barack obama and hillary clinton would say every day . "
the same is true for other top issues such as the iranian nuclear program , the spread of nuclear and ballistic missiles and the stabilization of afghanistan , says dan reiter , a professor of international relations at emory university in atlanta : " at the broadest level i think the cables reveal that the goals the us is engaging in private are essentially similar to the goals that it is espousing in public . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : saudi king abdullah urged the president barack obama to take action against iran asked whether the insights gained from reading the frank assessments of diplomats engaged in shaping and carrying out us foreign policy will alter their view of the us role or status in the world , risse and reiter both answer with a resounding no . " the us is not an empire , there are very clear limits to us influence in the world , " says risse .
" of course the us is a superpower .
it has interests in all corners of the world , it does try to influence other governments , but that 's ok .
there 's nothing that would get me worked up about this at all . "
no puppet master the cables are " not terribly surprising , " notes reiter .
" one does n't get an image of the united states as this all-powerful puppet master trying to pull the strings of various governments around the world to serve its corporate interests .
that 's an image which does not emerge . "
instead , the cables paint a picture of the us acting as one would expect a major power to do so , adds reiter .
" i do n't think that anything we see is terribly different from the way most states have conducted their foreign policy in the modern era . "
what 's more surprising to the analysts is the behavior of arab countries that becomes evident in the cables .
while the opposition of arab states to iran 's nuclear program has been known in foreign policy circles for some time , the contrast between confidential assessments made in private and public statements is particularly stark . double talk " the level of hypocrisy that comes out of these cables is much higher for instance in the middle east , " says risse .
" it 's very clear from these cables that most arab states feel really threatened by iranian nuclear power , however they would never say that in public .
in fact , they say the opposite in public . "
according to the cables , king abdullah of saudi arabia and king hamed ibn isa khalifa of bahrain are among arab leaders who pressed the us to attack iran .
king abdullah repeatedly exhorted the united states to " cut off the head of the snake " and take military action against tehran 's nuclear facilities .
open questions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : to evaluate the cables properly , scholars need more information about the documents in contrast to that , conclude the experts , the general outlines of us foreign policy are pretty much in sync with what the wikileaks documents have revealed so far and they have n't unearthed anything entirely unexpected .
nevertheless , argues risse , the document dump still poses a serious problem : " if you look at these cables from the perspective of an academic or historian , the real big question is what is the sample , ? " says risse . " is this a random selection , is this a selection that is representative of the whole or what exactly is it .
we have absolutely no way to judge this . "
risse notes , that even if all 250,000 cables are published in the end , it is still not clear how large a sample this is , how relevant the cables are or were in the decision-making processes for us officials and what the criteria were to publish them .
without those answers , many of which could be provided by wikileaks , a thorough assessment of the cables and its content wo n't be possible . author : michael knigge editor : rob mudge send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de climate -pipe- 10.12.2010 shadow of kyoto looms over final day of climate talks großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : limiting global temperature increases to 2 degrees is a key point at the talks a new treaty to combat climate change is not going to emerge in cancun , but the conference could see breakthroughs on forestry and finance , provided a dispute over kyoto does n't derail the last day of talks . accusations of " brinkmanship " are dominating climate talks as they enter their final day in cancun , mexico .
although no over-arching treaty to tackle climate change is up for grabs this year , struggles over principles risk progress on smaller achievements in the final hours of negotiations . japan 's hard line on the kyoto protocol remains the main concern for parties trying to bridge differences on a range of issues , including forestry protection , climate finance and accounting methodologies .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the japanese delegation has come in for criticism japan has refused to climb down from its refusal to consider extending kyoto when its first commitment period expires in 2012 , despite openings for compromises throughout the talks .
" we know that european union countries insist on a second commitment period , but we think this is n't a fair way of dealing with emissions globally , " said japanese negotiator akira yamada on thursday evening , describing this dispute as " ongoing " and " difficult . "
kyoto binds 37 wealthy nations to cut their greenhouse gas emissions , but japan does not want to be part of an agreement that does n't include binding rules for the world ’ s top two emitters , china and the us .
developing countries see kyoto as crucial for holding the industrialized world to account for a problem that is mostly of its making .
it seemed that a crisis over kyoto might be avoided earlier in the conference , following conciliatory language from china and india , but by the end of the week environmental groups were naming japan as the " worst " participant at the talks .
" they should show more flexibility and not pick a fight where it is not necessary , " said david turnbull , executive director of the climate action network , an umbrella group of environmental organizations .
anger at brazil yet harsh criticism has also been leveled at certain developing countries , among them brazil , amid fears that even lesser gains may slip through negotiators ' fingers in cancun .
brazil has been widely applauded for how it is tackling the destruction of the amazon .
indeed , last week it announced that its rate of deforestation dropped 14 percent over a 12-month period in 2010 , to reach its lowest level on record .
yet environmental groups accused brazil on thursday of rolling back gains in discussions on forestry protection measures because of its resistance to a system with international checks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : global deforestation rates have slowed over the last 10 years don lehr , a spokesperson for the eco-systems climate alliance , described talks on forestry on thursday as deadlocked .
" if we are not going to break down the sovereignty issues , we ’ ll never deal with climate change , " said rosalind reeve of global witness , an organisation that tracks resource exploitation , in reference to brazil 's position .
" you need a monitoring system that works nationally and internationally to build integrity .
there ’ s two sides to this equation ; there ’ s carbon and there ’ s safeguards . "
brazil has long been wary of efforts to secure international monitoring commitments in a global system to curb deforestation which would reward conservation in poor countries . despite the concerns of countries like brazil and papua new guinea , many have hoped to see cancun at least achieve an agreement on the scheme known as redd - reducing emissions from deforestation and degradation .
that is looking difficult on friday .
" we are not in favour of monitoring in an international process , " said a senior brazilian negotiator , suggesting that it would simply add excessive layers of bureaucracy that would " overcharge " domestic measures .
money matters though the situation could change in the final hours of talks , efforts to agree on a fund to help poor countries pay for their response to climate change also appear stalled . " saying , as has been said , ' well we won ’ t talk about a climate fund until we are clear about the rules ' then other people say ' well we won ’ t talk about the rules until a climate fund can exist ' - that kind of thing is just going to delay things too much and get us into silly posturing , " said jeremy hobbs , executive director of oxfam , which campaigns against poverty . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : progess at the talks has been painfully slow rich countries pledged in copenhagen last year to raise $ 30 billion -lrb- 22 billion euros -rrb- over the next few years to help developing countries already begin to meet the costs of climate change .
developing countries have expressed dismay that much of that pledged money appears to have been watered down through technical measures .
the fast start finance is supposed to help build trust in rich countries ’ pledges to deliver $ 100 billion dollars annually as of 2020 for a so-called green fund for developing countries , which in turn might make poorer countries amenable to adopting their own binding emissions cuts .
details of the fund - such as who will have control of it , where the money will come from and the conditions of its use - were supposed to be ironed out in cancun .
but these , too , appear to remain points of contest as the conference draws to a close .

that doesn ’ t hold true for some other countries . the charge that us foreign policy is hypocritical is all but new , but the wikileaks data release has added some additional fuel to it .
just a few days ago , libya 's leader muammar gaddafi lauded the organization for exposing us " hypocrisy " through its diplomacy conducted behind closed doors , in comments published via the state news agency jana .
according to gaddafi , the leaked cables " proved that america is not what it has led allies and friends to believe it to be " and that " us relations with its allies are hypocritical . "
while there is certainly an expected discrepancy in the tone and style of these confidential reports and the language us diplomats use in public , the cables actually reveal that the us has been largely consistent with the overall messages and themes it conveys to its international partners in private and in public , argue scholars interviewed by deutsche welle . " there 's nothing in these cables that is different from what we actually know about us foreign policy without these cables , " says thomas risse , director of the center for transnational relations , foreign and security policy at the free university of berlin .
" the whole approach by these people from wikileaks seems to be that there is a public side to us foreign policy and then there is this secret side and that there is some sort conspiracy involved in all this , " he says .
" and i do n't see a huge mismatch actually between what the us says in public and what it does . "
clear goals one of the dominant topics in these cables are us security interests and the fact that washington considers transnational terrorism a major threat , adds risse : " that is exactly what barack obama and hillary clinton would say every day . "
the same is true for other top issues such as the iranian nuclear program , the spread of nuclear and ballistic missiles and the stabilization of afghanistan , says dan reiter , a professor of international relations at emory university in atlanta : " at the broadest level i think the cables reveal that the goals the us is engaging in private are essentially similar to the goals that it is espousing in public . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : saudi king abdullah urged the president barack obama to take action against iran asked whether the insights gained from reading the frank assessments of diplomats engaged in shaping and carrying out us foreign policy will alter their view of the us role or status in the world , risse and reiter both answer with a resounding no . " the us is not an empire , there are very clear limits to us influence in the world , " says risse .
" of course the us is a superpower .
it has interests in all corners of the world , it does try to influence other governments , but that 's ok .
there 's nothing that would get me worked up about this at all . "
no puppet master the cables are " not terribly surprising , " notes reiter .
" one does n't get an image of the united states as this all-powerful puppet master trying to pull the strings of various governments around the world to serve its corporate interests .
that 's an image which does not emerge . "
instead , the cables paint a picture of the us acting as one would expect a major power to do so , adds reiter .
" i do n't think that anything we see is terribly different from the way most states have conducted their foreign policy in the modern era . "
what 's more surprising to the analysts is the behavior of arab countries that becomes evident in the cables .
while the opposition of arab states to iran 's nuclear program has been known in foreign policy circles for some time , the contrast between confidential assessments made in private and public statements is particularly stark . double talk " the level of hypocrisy that comes out of these cables is much higher for instance in the middle east , " says risse .
" it 's very clear from these cables that most arab states feel really threatened by iranian nuclear power , however they would never say that in public .
in fact , they say the opposite in public . "
according to the cables , king abdullah of saudi arabia and king hamed ibn isa khalifa of bahrain are among arab leaders who pressed the us to attack iran .
king abdullah repeatedly exhorted the united states to " cut off the head of the snake " and take military action against tehran 's nuclear facilities .
open questions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : to evaluate the cables properly , scholars need more information about the documents in contrast to that , conclude the experts , the general outlines of us foreign policy are pretty much in sync with what the wikileaks documents have revealed so far and they have n't unearthed anything entirely unexpected .
nevertheless , argues risse , the document dump still poses a serious problem : " if you look at these cables from the perspective of an academic or historian , the real big question is what is the sample , ? " says risse . " is this a random selection , is this a selection that is representative of the whole or what exactly is it .
we have absolutely no way to judge this . "
risse notes , that even if all 250,000 cables are published in the end , it is still not clear how large a sample this is , how relevant the cables are or were in the decision-making processes for us officials and what the criteria were to publish them .
without those answers , many of which could be provided by wikileaks , a thorough assessment of the cables and its content wo n't be possible . author : michael knigge editor : rob mudge send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

just a few days ago , libya 's leader muammar gaddafi lauded the organization for exposing us " hypocrisy " through its diplomacy conducted behind closed doors , in comments published via the state news agency jana .
according to gaddafi , the leaked cables " proved that america is not what it has led allies and friends to believe it to be " and that " us relations with its allies are hypocritical . "
while there is certainly an expected discrepancy in the tone and style of these confidential reports and the language us diplomats use in public , the cables actually reveal that the us has been largely consistent with the overall messages and themes it conveys to its international partners in private and in public , argue scholars interviewed by deutsche welle . " there 's nothing in these cables that is different from what we actually know about us foreign policy without these cables , " says thomas risse , director of the center for transnational relations , foreign and security policy at the free university of berlin .
" the whole approach by these people from wikileaks seems to be that there is a public side to us foreign policy and then there is this secret side and that there is some sort conspiracy involved in all this , " he says .
" and i do n't see a huge mismatch actually between what the us says in public and what it does . "
clear goals one of the dominant topics in these cables are us security interests and the fact that washington considers transnational terrorism a major threat , adds risse : " that is exactly what barack obama and hillary clinton would say every day . "
the same is true for other top issues such as the iranian nuclear program , the spread of nuclear and ballistic missiles and the stabilization of afghanistan , says dan reiter , a professor of international relations at emory university in atlanta : " at the broadest level i think the cables reveal that the goals the us is engaging in private are essentially similar to the goals that it is espousing in public . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : saudi king abdullah urged the president barack obama to take action against iran asked whether the insights gained from reading the frank assessments of diplomats engaged in shaping and carrying out us foreign policy will alter their view of the us role or status in the world , risse and reiter both answer with a resounding no . " the us is not an empire , there are very clear limits to us influence in the world , " says risse .
" of course the us is a superpower .
it has interests in all corners of the world , it does try to influence other governments , but that 's ok .
there 's nothing that would get me worked up about this at all . "
no puppet master the cables are " not terribly surprising , " notes reiter .
" one does n't get an image of the united states as this all-powerful puppet master trying to pull the strings of various governments around the world to serve its corporate interests .
that 's an image which does not emerge . "
instead , the cables paint a picture of the us acting as one would expect a major power to do so , adds reiter .
" i do n't think that anything we see is terribly different from the way most states have conducted their foreign policy in the modern era . "
what 's more surprising to the analysts is the behavior of arab countries that becomes evident in the cables .
while the opposition of arab states to iran 's nuclear program has been known in foreign policy circles for some time , the contrast between confidential assessments made in private and public statements is particularly stark . double talk " the level of hypocrisy that comes out of these cables is much higher for instance in the middle east , " says risse .
" it 's very clear from these cables that most arab states feel really threatened by iranian nuclear power , however they would never say that in public .
in fact , they say the opposite in public . "
according to the cables , king abdullah of saudi arabia and king hamed ibn isa khalifa of bahrain are among arab leaders who pressed the us to attack iran .
king abdullah repeatedly exhorted the united states to " cut off the head of the snake " and take military action against tehran 's nuclear facilities .
open questions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : to evaluate the cables properly , scholars need more information about the documents in contrast to that , conclude the experts , the general outlines of us foreign policy are pretty much in sync with what the wikileaks documents have revealed so far and they have n't unearthed anything entirely unexpected .
nevertheless , argues risse , the document dump still poses a serious problem : " if you look at these cables from the perspective of an academic or historian , the real big question is what is the sample , ?

meanwhile , russia 's prime minister accuses the us of hypocrisy over the affair . the un commissioner for human rights navi pillay expressed dismay over the withdrawal of financial and internet services to the controversial wikileaks website .
pillay said that measures taken by companies - which wikileaks ' supporters claim are due to pressure from foreign governments - could represent an infringement of the right to freedom of expression . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pillay said courts should decide on the balance between security and freedom " i 'm concerned about reports of pressure exerted on private companies , including banks , credit card companies , and internet service providers to close down credit lines for donations to wikileaks as well as to stop hosting the website or its mother sites , " navi pillay told a news conference on thursday .
" they could be interpreted as an attempt to censor the publication of information , thus potentially violating wikileaks ' right to freedom of expression . "
payments suspended , account closed wikileaks angered the us and other governments with the release in november of 250,000 confidential diplomatic cables , with washington saying the information could put american lives in danger .
credit card firms mastercard and visa later suspended payments made to wikileaks , while the swiss post office shut down a bank account opened by wikileaks founder julian assange .
pillay said the case " raises complex human rights questions about balancing freedom of information and the need to protect national security or public order . "
" if wikileaks has committed any recognizable illegal acts then this should be handled through the legal system and not through pressure and intimidation including on third parties , " said pillay a former un war crimes judge .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : assange was arrested in london , and awaits a hearing pillay noted that such questions were not related to charges against assange for crimes including rape in sweden .
supporters of assange claim that the charges against him have been manufactured as part of a bid to halt the website 's activities , along with the pressure on firms to cut wikileaks ' income stream .
' pot calls kettle black , ' putin russian prime minister vladimir putin said that assange 's arrest in britain , for extradition , was " undemocratic " and accused the us of " hypocrisy " for attacking russia 's record on democracy .
" if we are talking about democracy , it should be complete .
why was mr. assange hidden in jail ?
is that democracy ?
as we say in the village , the pot is calling the kettle black , " putin told reporters .
" i want to send the ball back to our american colleagues . "
assange is currently in custody in britain awaiting a hearing over his extradition after a warrant was issued by sweden .
meanwhile , wikileaks supporters on thursday vowed to step up cyber-attacks on companies that have taken action against wikileaks .
a group calling itself " anonymous " has claimed credit for temporarily bringing down the websites of visa and mastercard .

the goal of a legally binding treaty to reduce pollution has fallen by the wayside , so efforts in cancun have been focusing on a fund to help channel hundreds of billions of dollars in aid towards poor countries . enshrined in the copenhagen accord was the pledge to raise billions of dollars of climate aid .
the headline figures were impressive : 100 billion dollars -lrb- 76 billion euro -rrb- a year as of 2020 , and at least seven billion euros from the eu over the next few years to get the ball rolling .
yet the nitty gritty details of how that money should be managed and distributed were left for cancun . but negotiations on the fund are being stalled because the us want to tie the creation of the fund to other issues , in particular they want big developing emitting countries , particularly china to be more transparent about the action they are taking to mitigate the effects of climate change . " that essentially puts a handbrake on how far we can go in creating a fund , " steve herz , a climate policy advisor at greenpeace told deutsche welle .
" it risks a watered down decision , " he added . a new draft proposal has spelled out the technicalities for setting up a global climate fund .
it will help poor nations create a mechanism to share clean technologies , protect tropical forests and help the poor adapt to impacts ranging from storms to rising sea levels . in a revision , the text explicitly calls for a role for women in the fight against climate change . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : environmentalists want the money to help poor nations adapt to climate change " at last women , who are among the most affected by climate change , are not being ignored , " said executive director of oxfam jeremy hobbs at a press conference . but some environmentalists criticized the draft for removing a reference to ensuring that 50 percent of assistance goes toward helping people adapt to climate change . " the current draft sees too many important decisions pushed down the road , " hobbs said . the omission would allow wealthy nations to meet pledges through other means , such as offering technical know-how to help curb emissions of greenhouse gases blamed for global warming . role of the world bank negotiators said they saw steady progress in setting up the architecture of a future climate fund .
a remaining sticking point is whether to include a role for international bodies , such as the world bank , in administering aid . donor countries want to have guarantees that the money is actually spent on global climate protection .
the developing countries receiving the funds want freedom of choice on their national measures and no preconditions , for example , on policy priorities . " there 's a tug of war going on right now .
the dispute is about the trustee role , " said steve herz . donor countries want the world bank to play a role as trustee , which - according to herz - " could mean that they just cut cheques , but it could also mean a broader role in implementing and conceiving projects " . negotiators are currently trying to agree on the scope of the trustee role . as the globe 's largest poverty-fighting institution , with 65 years of experience in development finance , the world bank says it can play a helpful role . " our specialty is essentially delivering results at scale .
the world has lots of pilots and lots of wonderful experiments going on a small scale and those are really good .
but what the world really needs now is scale .
i think we can play a helpful role in bringing together the overall packages , " andrew steer , special envoy for climate change at the world bank , told deutsche welle . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : loans to create solar energy plants could generate income , according to the world bank but there are some delegations that are very skeptical about the world bank administering the funds .
in particular , developing countries oppose a climate fund managed by the bank and instead want the unfccc to be the fund 's manager . the un ambassadors of bolivia , pablo solon , summed up their reservations : " to have the world bank as the entity that is going to manage this is something that we do not support , " solon told deutsche welle . " why ?
because as you know , there has been a crisis , an international crisis and part of the reason for this crisis is the imf and the world bank , which have imposed a policy that has provoked this crisis " . the world bank has also been criticized for not acting progressively enough on climate related issues . " it continues to promote as its central paradigm fossil fuel based energy production , " said steve herz a report by oil change international and sierra club said the world bank increased its lending for fossil fuels from 1.5 billion dollars in 2006 to 6.2 billion dollars in 2010 . carbon markets on the sidelines of the conference , the world bank launched a new multi-million dollar fund to help emerging market countries set up their own carbon markets carbon markets create a profit-generating system whereby a cap is put on the total amount of carbon emissions and companies can trade in surplus rights to emit carbon dioxide into the atmosphere .
the idea is to create a market based system that incentivizes companies to reduce carbon emissions . the world bank thinks this system can play a bigger role .
" today only two percent of clean development mechanism money goes to africa and we have found that in our own portfolio of carbon markets , we have more than 20 percent going to africa and it works fine .
in other words , we believe that it is possible to extend the reach of carbon markets and offsets to those low income countries , " steer said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : carbon markets have allowed china 's wind energy sector to expand rapidly friends of the earth , an environmental advocacy group is strongly critical of carbon markets . " carbon markets are an irreparably flawed means of addressing climate change , " said karen orenstein of friends of the earth us .
" they further entrench the economic arrangements that facilitate the north 's over-consumption and have landed us in this climate crisis in the first place . " nnimmo bassey , executive director of environmental rights action in nigeria and chair of friends of the earth international , thinks that the negotiations are missing the real issues by concentrating too much on market issues . " all the negotiators talk about is how to use the market to soften global warming – carbon offsetting by planting a tree somewhere in africa while you keep polluting in europe , " he told deutsche welle . " this is not a solution , because pollution emissions have to stop at the source .
and they are not talking about lifestyle changes ; they are not talking about less consumption and less of production . " with talks due to end on friday , many negotiators believed they could come to agreement in three key areas : the architecture of a global climate fund , aid to discourage deforestation , and verification of countries ' climate pledges . author : natalia dannenberg -lrb- afp , dpa -rrb- editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

others wear army boots and the thick , riot-police-style boiler suits emblazoned with the large reflective " security " badge on the back . recent threats of " mumbai style attacks " have boosted the private security business in the past few weeks .
thomas ostmann , berlin manager of german security company agsus , noticed a rise in demand immediately . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : recent terrorist threats in berlin have heightened demand for security firms " yes , we 've definitely noticed that , " he told deutsche welle .

you have to pay a one-euro entrance fee , and while the mulled wine , roasted almonds and arts-and-craft knick-knacks are much the same as in any other christmas market , you are treated to a live ballet show , based on a russian fairytale , to go with your sense of exclusivity .
you also see more security guards .
some , like the ones taking your entry ticket , are dressed as toy soldiers in keeping with the winter fairytale theme .
others wear army boots and the thick , riot-police-style boiler suits emblazoned with the large reflective " security " badge on the back . recent threats of " mumbai style attacks " have boosted the private security business in the past few weeks .
thomas ostmann , berlin manager of german security company agsus , noticed a rise in demand immediately . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : recent terrorist threats in berlin have heightened demand for security firms " yes , we 've definitely noticed that , " he told deutsche welle .

standing alongside serb prime minister mirko cvetkovic , he said that the eu " regrets the decision of serbia not to attend " the ceremony and added that serbia was " expected to embrace euro values and coordinate " with partners .
his words had a deep impact : while the foreign minister of serbia had originally defended the country 's decision not to attend the ceremony , serbia decided to send its ombudsman for human rights , sasa jankovic , to oslo .
serbia was the only eu candidate that originally decided to stay away from the ceremony honoring chinese human rights activist liu xiaobo .

serbia followed china 's call , as it relies on chinese government support for serbia 's opposition to an independent kosovo .
caught between a rock and a hard place but serbia is caught in a clash of interests , because it wants to join the 27-nation bloc of the european union .
fuele and other eu representatives clarified that serbia needed to comply with the joint decision of eu member states to send representatives to oslo in order not to lessen its chances of becoming a member state .
pedrag simic , political scientist at the university of belgrad says that despite serbia 's goal to join the european union , the country would still rely on four pillars of international politics - brussels , washington , moscow , and peking .
" a small country can only follow one superpower , " he said .
simic added that serbia 's attempts to be loyal to both china and the european union had to result in a dilemma such as the current one at some point .

pakistan , the environment and cheap drugs were at the heart of debate . european union leaders and indian diplomats struggled friday to smooth the creases in work to reach one of the world 's biggest trade pacts at a summit meeting in brussels .
nonetheless , eu president herman van rompuy tried to put a positive spin on the outcome of the talks .
" we have created momentum , " he said , " for an ambitious and balanced conclusion in the spring of 2011 " of " the biggest agreement concluded by the eu and one of the biggest bilateral agreements ever . "
however , clear differences remained between european and indian delegates over the fine print of the trade deal , which has been the subject of four years of stalled talks .
among the key sticking points were arguments by the indians that they should receive assurances that any new free trade agreement would n't jeopardize future supplies of cheap generic medicines from india , which notably have pushed the price of anti-hiv / aids drugs down 99 percent .
the two sides have also squabbled over eu efforts to bring any trade pact into line with european laws on child labor and the environment .
diplomats were also unable to see eye to eye on an eu plan to offer flood-ravaged pakistan two years ' worth of trade concessions as a form of relief .
india maintains that such concessions may not be the most effective way to help the country recover .
" we 're all for assistance to pakistan , but let these two issues -lsb- of trade and relief -rsb- not be mixed , " indian commerce and industry minister anand sharma said in a pre-summit interview .
" these are separate issues . "
anti-terror pledge bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the attacks in mumbai in 2008 shocked india to its core the friday meeting also produced pledges by both sides to step up anti-terror cooperation in a bid to deny terrorists safe havens in the wake of the mumbai hotel attacks in 2008 which ended in the deaths of 166 people .
prime minister manmohan singh and the eu leadership issued a joint declaration vowing to encourage all nations to dismantle " terror infrastructure on the territories under their control . "
van rompuy said : " the london , madrid and mumbai attacks show that terrorism knows no boundaries and that a common response is essential . "
the next eu-india summit meeting is scheduled to be held in india next year at an as yet unspecified date .

" there is a spirit that is uniting us all , " the german chancellor told reporters during a break in the talks .
" if the euro fails , the european union fails , too . "
president sarkozy , meanwhile , pledged that germany and france " will defend the euro , because the euro is europe . "
sarkozy also backed germany 's opposition to creating unified european sovereign bonds .
the idea of harmonizing some eurozone debt , as suggested by several members of the currency union , has met with strong opposition from germany and france , whose balance sheets are relatively healthy .
" french and german citizens would not be happy if we were to bundle the debts together , " the french president said .
he argued that the concept might be worth considering in the future , but only after the bloc 's members ramp up their economic and political cooperation .

juncker said that creating taboo subjects without even considering the ideas of others was " a very un-european way of dealing with european issues . " as the two largest eu members , france and germany both have a sizeable share of the voting power within the bloc , and need relatively little support from other countries in order to secure a majority .
" without agreement from france and germany - the historic motors of european integration and two economies that make up half of the eurozone 's gross domestic product - nothing very important is possible , " professor henrik uterwedde from the franco-german institute in ludwigsburg told deutsche welle .
" so on the one hand , they must reach agreements , and help the union move forward , but at the same time , they do n't always do enough to treat the other members as equal partners and involve them in the decision-making processes . "

" german soldiers are today welcome in france , " merkel said across the border in freiburg .
" for me , that has great symbolism , after all that germany was guilty of during the nazi era . "
the battalion , which will eventually consist of 600 soldiers , is part of the joint franco-german brigade .
" i was always surprised that the franco-german brigade only consisted of french soldiers in germany , " sarkozy said .

he did not spy , he did not steal all the data that was passed along to him - nor is he a us citizen .
the us has been caught with the pants way down and of course , does n't like it one bit .
the us has sprung a " leaki " in its " weaki " and does n't like it one " bitty . "
as the saying goes … those who live in glass houses should not be throwing stones . - vera , germany i believe asange did bring out the true colors of individuals , opinion makers and governments in the present context of world politics .
everyone should admire his forthright exposure , however bitter it may be ; more so the americans who expect democracies and freedom to speech to flourish around the globe .
extradition and implicating him will only show the us in bad light . - mohan , india no , he should n't be extradited .
it 's a witch hunt to divert blame from the people who should be overseeing us security .
we 've paid good money for homeland security .
whose fault is it that thousands of secret documents were released ? - wayne , us definitely not .
supporting corruption and lack of common sense has been the m.o. for too long .
someone needs to wake up the people over here , wikileaks is a good start . - gene , us the us has only itself to blame for the leaks ... its a schoolyard bully that 's now having a tantrum and calling on its buddies to help it in a scrap because it knows it ca n't nuke everyone that does n't agree with it .
in australia the us is seen as a gutless mongrel that will do anything to get its own way especially concerning energy drilling . - tom , australia julian assange is a xxi century hero , in the sixties the fight against the empire was with " guerrillas , " today the fight is with internet .
and he 's going to win . - crstina , spain the us is paranoid about wikileaks .
a typical response of killing the messenger .
no extradition of julian assange .
the eu should promote transparency and be more open about foreign policies and clarity of diplomatic mores in language . - j. , the netherlands no way jose !
who cares about america ?
not me anyway : -rrb- i 'm so happy about wikileaks and anything that harms america .
they think an insult to us is immoral , and that they are somehow better than the rest of us .
they are just greedy , self-important and power-obsessed .
everything they touch is tarnished .
they are so last century .
bring on the rise of china and india !
how dare they think they can " spy " on other countries in the un ! - brian , ireland if any european country extradites julian assange to the united states , it will be for a political " crime . "
is europe the running dog of the us , or a group of sovereign nations dedicated to freedom of the press , freedom of the individual and people having the right to know what is going on ?
kevin rudd claims that the core problem is the failure by the us to protect its diplomatic communications .
i think the core problem is the behavior of the us .
the reason that wikileaks has not released the diplomatic communications of other countries -lrb- eg : germany , australia -rrb- is that they are better behaved and do not goose-step on the world stage , trying to take over the world . - charles , australia i believe that having all that " secret " info available for everybody to learn was not the " status quo " however it was disclosed and it is done .
the fellow in jail in the united kingdom is actually a journalist devoted to inform the public .
if he ever is extradited to the us he can claim " freedom of expression . "
now , in terms of those " ladies " claiming sex crimes , that is a bit doubtful .
they have waited until now , come on !
i believe that it was a politically manipulated act to get him behind bars .
and if those allegedly " crimes " were committed in sweden , should n't he then be extradited to that country ? - elena , us no .
he 's a hero who has struck a powerful blow for freedom !
he should be given the medal of freedom award ! - michael , us no , he should not be extradited to the us ; he has not been charged with any us crime .
whatever one thinks about wikileaks , mr. assange is taking a principled stand against the establishment for personal convictions and at great risk to himself .
if the political solution is to restrict freedom of the internet it will amplify assange 's stance : that many elected politicians are duplicitous control freaks who need their over-used and abused powers curtailed .
he deserves respect , support and applause for his courage . - a. , japan i believe that assange is being targeted for what he did .
if he 's found guilty of real sexual misconduct , i believe he should be punished , but as far as the internet crap , i believe he 'll prevail .
he 'll probably either wimp out for future stuff , or he 'll feel more emboldened .
i 'd like to see the hackers messing with mastercard put to be punished though .
it causes too many undeserving people a lot of pain . - joe , us i am completely baffled by the case .
mr. assange has been arrested in a country -lrb- uk -rrb- which belongs to the interpol group of countries so , according to the rules , he might be obviously extradited to sweden - country which relies on " the rules " within the interpol group .
at the same time , mr. assange has been accused of allegedly having broken the law of another country -lrb- usa -rrb- which is also in the interpol group .
in addition , his own country -lrb- australia -rrb- has now given a hint of standing up for him by offering him legal help , not ruling out his extradition to australia -lrb- being also the interpol member . -rrb-
in addition , there is the international court of justice in the hague -lrb- operating within the uno . -rrb-
so international law , respective rules of law of the countries mentioned , international organizations -lrb- interpol , uno , eu -rrb- are all to be bundled in this case which is too much intricate to the ' untrained eye ' in this " legal maze .

now , the project has four other eu member states on baord . on wednesday and thursday , the first meeting of the electric solar wind sail -lrb- esail -rrb- – newly sponsored by the european union - was held at the finnish metereological institute in helsinki .
earlier this year , the european union gave its blessing with 1.7 million euro -lrb- 2.25 million dollars -rrb- to construct laboratory prototypes of the esail project , whose ultimate goal is to launch the sail into space on a one kilogram estonian nanosatellite by the end of 2012 .
esail is now a joint operation with representatives from finland , estonia , germany , italy and sweden .
solar wind is a constant stream of charged particles that emanate from the sun .
a solar sail , which has been used previously , is made of a material that blocks those particles and then propel a spacecraft forward - in the same way a seafaring vessel uses wind to fill its sails .
however , this new finnish design , which was invented in 2006 by pekka janhunen , a researcher at the finnish meteorological institute , creates a " virtual " sail by forming an electric field with a radius of 100 meters from a small wire .
" the field forms an obstacle and so the solar wind particles are scattered in different directions , " he told deutsche welle .
" it 's more like an electric parachute than a sail .
it creates an enhanced friction between the solar wind flow and the wire . "
moving 50 kilometers per second if successful , janhunen added , then anything that this small wire was attached to , could theoretically travel approximately 50 kilometers per second , or " a factor of four or five faster than anything else ever constructed . "
using solar wind as a propulsion system in this way can only really be used between planets , so this type of design would be best for earth-mars , or other types of longer distance missions .
other astronomers are also excited about the prospect of this technology .
" in the other solar sail projects the energy comes from solar photons , the weightless ' light-particles ' .
this project gets the energy from the ions in the solar wind , " explained timo laitinen , an astronomy lecturer at the university of turku in finland , in an interview with deutsche welle .
" the technology is completely different , and to my understanding more feasible than the ' traditional ' solar sail technology . "

but the west seems unmoved . despite changes in afghan law and a constitution designed to protect women 's rights , violence and abuse of women continue to be a serious problem in the country , and the government is not doing enough to prevent it .
that is the conclusion of a new report published by the united nations assistance mission in afghanistan -lrb- unama -rrb- .
the most common forms of abuse include forced and child marriage , honor killings and giving away girls to settle disputes under the tradition of baad .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the report says violence against afghan women is still widespread " the report describes the prevalence of these practices , " georgette gagnon , unama 's director of human rights , said at a press conference .
" it looks at the consequences these practices have on the lives of afghan women and girls and the community as a whole and it also looks at the efforts of the afghan government to address violence against women . "
one of these efforts , the 2009 law of elimination of violence against women -lrb- evaw -rrb- , came under particular scrutiny .
the law , which gagnon described as " a huge gain of legal protection of women 's rights , " criminalizes buying and selling women for marriage , forcing a woman to marry without her consent , forcing girls to marry when they are underage , and forcing girls and women to commit self-immolation - when they set themselves on fire .
ignorance and lack of enforcement but according to the report , the new law is not being enforced in many parts of the country , and is often not even known .
bele grau , program manager for afghanistan at the women 's rights organisation medica mondiale agreed with this assessment .
" on the theoretical and legal level the situation is getting better – but in practice it is often not implemented , " she told deutsche welle .
" this law has been in force for a year , but a lot of judges do n't even know it , and if they do , they do n't enforce it . "
the un women 's organization unifem says that around 87 percent of afghan women suffer from domestic violence , and that half of all girls are married under the age of 15 .
on top of this , grau says that many of the rights that women have won are repealed by new laws .
she cites one recent regulation that bans women who have run away from an abusive home from seeking refuge with strangers .
this in practice leaves many women only the unrealistic option of going to relatives .
many women are also still imprisoned for running away , in contravention of the evaw law .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : westerwelle suggested democracy can not be imposed on afghanistan the report found that much of the abuse is founded in afghan tradition .
" one very harmful practice that we heard a lot about is baad , which is the giving away of girls to settle disputes , " said gagnon .
" many of the women told us that instead of a murderer being punished , an innocent girl is punished and she has to spend all her life in slavery and is subjected to cruel violence .
sometimes she is forced to sleep with the animals in the barn . "
western indifference the report sets out a number of recommendations for the afghan government to deal with the problem , but grau says that the west has an obligation to apply pressure in order to protect women 's rights – not least because this is often used to add legitimacy to the war in afghanistan .
" we 've noticed this in most of the western governments , " she said .
" for the past year , all the talk is about withdrawal of troops , and negotiations with the taliban etc . , and that afghans have to work out for themselves how much democracy or women 's rights they want .
these are now all internal afghan issues that are n't discussed or even noticed anymore .
the german government is no exception to this . "
she believes that pressure could be exhorted through the financial aid the west gives to the afghan government .
" the western governments still give afghanistan a lot of development money , " she said .
" and when they make conditions for giving this money , we think they should make them for human rights and women 's rights , not just for taking over security duties . "
" the issue of women 's rights was also one of the justifications for the war itself , but that is suddenly disappearing from the agenda , " she added .
" earlier this year , -lrb- german foreign minister guido -rrb- westerwelle said , ' well , afghanistan is not switzerland , ' and with that everything is swept from the table . "

that is the conclusion of a new report published by the united nations assistance mission in afghanistan -lrb- unama -rrb- .

one of these efforts , the 2009 law of elimination of violence against women -lrb- evaw -rrb- , came under particular scrutiny .
the law , which gagnon described as " a huge gain of legal protection of women 's rights , " criminalizes buying and selling women for marriage , forcing a woman to marry without her consent , forcing girls to marry when they are underage , and forcing girls and women to commit self-immolation - when they set themselves on fire .

other than the nobel peace prize , which was awarded this year to liu xiaobo , numerous prizes for human rights activists are awarded on this day all over the world .
58-year-old lawyer asma jahangir , recipient of unesco / bilbao prize for 2010 , is the current president of the supreme court bar association and a founding member of the human rights commission of pakistan , the country 's leading independent human rights body .
' it increases one 's responsibilities ' she is a brilliant speaker and a relentless champion of people 's rights .
and yet , there are moments when even asma jahangir seems tired : when she talks about how much still remains to be done in pakistan despite some improvements .
asma jahangir laughs heartily and admits that she too is a normal human being with strengths and weaknesses .
she is happy about the international recognition that comes with the unesco / bilbao prize .
" it is indeed a matter of happiness and pride , but at the same time it increases one 's responsibility .
people expect more from you .
one has to strategize more , keeping in mind one 's integrity .
it draws a ' red line ' for you . "
the journey asma jahangir was born in a rich family in lahore .
when the pakistani government suppressed the independence movement in the late sixties in east pakistan , today 's bangladesh , asma 's father protested and was repeatedly jailed or put under house arrest .
asma jahangir believes this experience has truly formed her .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : asma jahangir has been campaigning for human rights for several decades " what i have learnt is that you are no longer materialistic after that .
the way my father worked altruistically , and the manner in which he used to go behind bars and come back home smilingly was inspirational .
he passed away when he was only 61 .
he had cancer , and we knew he would leave us soon .
i remember my sister and i were sitting at his deathbed , and he looked at us and said , ' i am not going to die , i will live through you ' , " reminisces jahangir .
asma jahangir followed his words .
with her inheritance she founded a women 's forum in 1980 together with her sister , hina jilani , a lawyer herself .
in her numerous jobs , for example as chairperson of the human rights commission of pakistan , or as united nations special rapporteur on freedom of religion or belief , she has raised her voice against the discrimination of religious minorities , against " honor " killings , or the treatment of minors in pakistani jails .
it has not been easy for her .
" women face difficulties at all levels .
they face hardship in society and at the workplace .
women also have to struggle within their households .
therefore , if any woman asserts herself , people find it difficult to accept .
they can also be very cruel towards that woman , " opines jahangir . she remembers that her own in-laws also found it difficult to accept that their son had married a woman who was not a typical pakistani wife .
but with time , both her family and society have accepted her achievements .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a demonstration for minority rights in pakistan dreams for a better pakistan for pakistan , asma jahangir has many dreams .
" firstly , i want to see economic prosperity in pakistan .
the indignity of poverty makes me despair .
pakistanis are a very dignified people .
they have suffered a great deal .
they have resisted oppression .
and yet , the image of pakistan projected in the world is mostly negative .
the positive side of pakistan is not shown .
i think pakistan has wasted its human capital . "
she has learnt to suppress her anger , even when she is being accused of blasphemy or treason .
but asma jahangir emphasizes that a life in anger is not worth living .

standing alongside serb prime minister mirko cvetkovic , he said that the eu " regrets the decision of serbia not to attend " the ceremony and added that serbia was " expected to embrace euro values and coordinate " with partners .
his words had a deep impact : while the foreign minister of serbia had originally defended the country 's decision not to attend the ceremony , serbia decided to send its ombudsman for human rights , sasa jankovic , to oslo .
serbia was the only eu candidate that originally decided to stay away from the ceremony honoring chinese human rights activist liu xiaobo .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the chinese government refused to let liu xiaobo attend the ceremony : his seat remained empty after the announcement of this year 's laureate , china had protested against the nobel committee 's decision and had urged other countries to boycott the ceremony .
serbia followed china 's call , as it relies on chinese government support for serbia 's opposition to an independent kosovo .
caught between a rock and a hard place but serbia is caught in a clash of interests , because it wants to join the 27-nation bloc of the european union .
fuele and other eu representatives clarified that serbia needed to comply with the joint decision of eu member states to send representatives to oslo in order not to lessen its chances of becoming a member state .
pedrag simic , political scientist at the university of belgrad says that despite serbia 's goal to join the european union , the country would still rely on four pillars of international politics - brussels , washington , moscow , and peking .
" a small country can only follow one superpower , " he said .
simic added that serbia 's attempts to be loyal to both china and the european union had to result in a dilemma such as the current one at some point .

the prize was meant to " point out the relationship between human rights , democracy and peace " , nobel peace prize committee chairman thorbjoern jagland said in his opening comments .
he called liu a symbol of the " non-violent struggle for such -lsb- human -rsb- rights in china " , and compared him with nelson mandela .
he went on to say that liu had done nothing but exercise his civil rights , and called on china to release him .
in his absence , norwegian actress liv ullmann read a final statement titled " i have no enemies " released by liu 's supporters after his sentencing a year ago .
in it , liu said " there is no force that can put an end to the human quest for freedom , and china will in the end become a nation ruled by law , where human rights reign supreme . "
he also spoke of his wife , liu xia , who is now under house arrest in beijing , saying her love " is the sunlight that leaps over high walls and penetrates the iron bars of my prison window . "
international solidarity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : liu xiaobo is considered a criminal by the chinese authorities throughout friday , western governments paid tribute to liu 's contribution to democracy and human rights , calling on china to release the dissident from prison .
in berlin , german human rights commissioner markus loening praised liu 's courageous stand for human rights .
" the participation of germany as well as all eu partners represented in oslo and many other countries in the ceremony in oslo is therefore a simple sign of respect for liu xiaobo and for all who work to promote human rights and democracy without resorting to violence , " a statement from loening on the german foreign ministry website said .
united states president barack obama meanwhile hailed liu as a beacon of freedom : " the values he espouses are universal , his struggle is peaceful , and he should be released as soon as possible , " obama said .
event overshadowed the event in the norwegian capital was overshadowed not only by liu 's absence , but also by china 's wider anger at his selection .
several nations decided to boycott the ceremony at beijing 's request after the chinese government condemned the decision to award the prize to the democracy activist .
almost a third of the 50 countries invited to the event stayed away , including russia , pakistan and saudi arabia .
many of those not attending are thought to have bowed to chinese pressure .
serbia , which was heavily criticized by the european union for its initial decision not to attend , decided at the last minute to send an ombudsman after all .
chinese media condemn choice bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an empty chair represented liu at the ceremony official chinese media have slammed the choice of liu as nobel peace prize laureate , calling it an attempt to impose foreign values on china .
liu has been a critic of the chinese government since the tiananmen square massacre of 1989 .
liu took a prominent part in the protests there and was sentenced to two years in prison .
he was jailed last december for 11 years on subversion charges after he co-authored a document called charter 08 , which calls for political reform in china .
authorities have also cracked down on activists in the run-up to the ceremony and have prevented liu 's family and friends from attending .
empty chair the nobel committee chose to represent liu with an empty chair during the ceremony , calling this a symbol of the chinese policy to isolate and repress dissidents .
in a moving gesture , jagland placed the nobel diploma on the vacant seat .

it is also the first time since then that the prize money of 1.13 million euros -lrb- $ 1.5 million -rrb- will not be handed out .

products from traditional european toymakers like lego and playmobil are in high demand . german parents typically spend oodles on their kids for christmas .
but with the buoyant economy this season , they 're spending even more .
so much more , in fact , that retailers are scrambling to stock hot products , like playmobil 's " robo-gangster " toy car with figures or lego 's " stars wars " spaceship .
some manufacturers now warn they may no longer be able to fulfill everyone 's christmas wish .
" we know that from now until christmas demand will be growing daily -lrb- so -rrb- we ca n't guarantee 100 percent that every product will be available right up to december 24 , " said dirk engehausen , the lego deutschland managing director , in an interview with the german news station n-tv .
other german and european manufacturers have a similar holiday message to convey : they have n't run out of any products yet , but supplies are depleting fast and finding the one or other popular product a few days before christmas could prove to be a real treasure hunt .
hurry while the supply lasts " none of our products have completely sold out in germany but some stores have run out of select products , " playmobil spokeswoman judith schweinitz told deutsche welle .
" if you 're really determined to find these , you will but you might have to look around . "
while manufacturers had projected stronger holiday sales , few if any thought they would so strong .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : children in germany can expect plenty of gifts this year " we anticipated more demand this christmas but we 're surprised nevertheless by how huge the demand has been , " said heinrich huentelsmann , a ravensburger spokesperson .
" our tiptoi product , for instance , is still available but is becoming hard to find . "
that toy is one of the few that the german maker of games , puzzle and toys manufacturers in china .
more than 85 percent of its products are made in europe .
" we can react very quickly to demand in europe because most of our production is here , " huentelsmann told deutsche welle .
" we do n't have long logistics paths . "
ravensburger expects it will be able to deliver all products right up to christmas , he said .
but the company is n't making any guarantees .
anticipating greater demand this year , lego delivered 10 percent more products to retailers in advance of the holiday shopping season , according to company spokeswoman helena seppelfricke .
but with some products , like the company 's classic fire department set and " technik " series , in huge demand , she admits the company could easily have delivered more .
" same procedure " most european traditional toymakers including lego , which is based in denmark with additional production sites in hungary , the czech republic and mexico , show their new products at trade events early in the year and begin talks with its buyer at the same time .
however , their ability to boost production to meet unexpected christmas demand generally decreases the closer the holiday shopping season approaches .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : playmobil toys are as popular as ever " it 's pretty much the same procedure every year , " said steffen kahnt , deputy director of germany 's federal association of toy retailer -lrb- bvs -rrb- .
" retailers need to decide how many products to order and manufacturers how many to make .
but no one really knows what the demand will be , especially for new products .
so you hope you make the right call . "
stockpiling products is n't a viable option in the competitive toy sector , according to kahnt .
both manufacturers and retailers , he says , strive to have only as much stock as they see necessary to better control their operating costs .
that said , the industry may want to up production for the 2011 gift season , if the past 24 months are any indication .
record-breaking sales " more products were actually sold last year than the year before , " kahnt said .
" that surprised us .
but no one really thought that sales this year would be so good . "
the german toy industry association -lrb- dvsi -rrb- expects sales to increase six percent this to 2.52 billion euros , compared to 2.38 billion euros the year .
if that mark is reached , the holiday sales will be a huge factor .
retailers generate more than 40 percent of their annual revenue during the holiday shopping season .
for sure , numbers like these will make manufacturers and retailers happy .
their big challenge now is to deliver enough toys to make kids – and their parents – just as happy .

dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content .
australia offers support to wikileaks founder , operation payback begins should assange be extradited to the united states ?
why ?
he did not spy , he did not steal all the data that was passed along to him - nor is he a us citizen .
the us has been caught with the pants way down and of course , does n't like it one bit .
the us has sprung a " leaki " in its " weaki " and does n't like it one " bitty . "
as the saying goes … those who live in glass houses should not be throwing stones . - vera , germany i believe asange did bring out the true colors of individuals , opinion makers and governments in the present context of world politics .
everyone should admire his forthright exposure , however bitter it may be ; more so the americans who expect democracies and freedom to speech to flourish around the globe .
extradition and implicating him will only show the us in bad light . - mohan , india no , he should n't be extradited .
it 's a witch hunt to divert blame from the people who should be overseeing us security .
we 've paid good money for homeland security .
whose fault is it that thousands of secret documents were released ? - wayne , us definitely not .
supporting corruption and lack of common sense has been the m.o. for too long .
someone needs to wake up the people over here , wikileaks is a good start . - gene , us the us has only itself to blame for the leaks ... its a schoolyard bully that 's now having a tantrum and calling on its buddies to help it in a scrap because it knows it ca n't nuke everyone that does n't agree with it .
in australia the us is seen as a gutless mongrel that will do anything to get its own way especially concerning energy drilling . - tom , australia julian assange is a xxi century hero , in the sixties the fight against the empire was with " guerrillas , " today the fight is with internet .
and he 's going to win . - crstina , spain the us is paranoid about wikileaks .
a typical response of killing the messenger .
no extradition of julian assange .
the eu should promote transparency and be more open about foreign policies and clarity of diplomatic mores in language . - j. , the netherlands no way jose !
who cares about america ?
not me anyway : -rrb- i 'm so happy about wikileaks and anything that harms america .
they think an insult to us is immoral , and that they are somehow better than the rest of us .
they are just greedy , self-important and power-obsessed .
everything they touch is tarnished .
they are so last century .
bring on the rise of china and india !
how dare they think they can " spy " on other countries in the un ! - brian , ireland if any european country extradites julian assange to the united states , it will be for a political " crime . "
is europe the running dog of the us , or a group of sovereign nations dedicated to freedom of the press , freedom of the individual and people having the right to know what is going on ?
kevin rudd claims that the core problem is the failure by the us to protect its diplomatic communications .
i think the core problem is the behavior of the us .
the reason that wikileaks has not released the diplomatic communications of other countries -lrb- eg : germany , australia -rrb- is that they are better behaved and do not goose-step on the world stage , trying to take over the world . - charles , australia i believe that having all that " secret " info available for everybody to learn was not the " status quo " however it was disclosed and it is done .
the fellow in jail in the united kingdom is actually a journalist devoted to inform the public .
if he ever is extradited to the us he can claim " freedom of expression . "
now , in terms of those " ladies " claiming sex crimes , that is a bit doubtful .
they have waited until now , come on !
i believe that it was a politically manipulated act to get him behind bars .
and if those allegedly " crimes " were committed in sweden , should n't he then be extradited to that country ? - elena , us no .
he 's a hero who has struck a powerful blow for freedom !
he should be given the medal of freedom award ! - michael , us no , he should not be extradited to the us ; he has not been charged with any us crime .
whatever one thinks about wikileaks , mr. assange is taking a principled stand against the establishment for personal convictions and at great risk to himself .
if the political solution is to restrict freedom of the internet it will amplify assange 's stance : that many elected politicians are duplicitous control freaks who need their over-used and abused powers curtailed .
he deserves respect , support and applause for his courage . - a. , japan i believe that assange is being targeted for what he did .
if he 's found guilty of real sexual misconduct , i believe he should be punished , but as far as the internet crap , i believe he 'll prevail .
he 'll probably either wimp out for future stuff , or he 'll feel more emboldened .
i 'd like to see the hackers messing with mastercard put to be punished though .
it causes too many undeserving people a lot of pain . - joe , us i am completely baffled by the case .
mr. assange has been arrested in a country -lrb- uk -rrb- which belongs to the interpol group of countries so , according to the rules , he might be obviously extradited to sweden - country which relies on " the rules " within the interpol group .
at the same time , mr. assange has been accused of allegedly having broken the law of another country -lrb- usa -rrb- which is also in the interpol group .
in addition , his own country -lrb- australia -rrb- has now given a hint of standing up for him by offering him legal help , not ruling out his extradition to australia -lrb- being also the interpol member . -rrb-
in addition , there is the international court of justice in the hague -lrb- operating within the uno . -rrb-
so international law , respective rules of law of the countries mentioned , international organizations -lrb- interpol , uno , eu -rrb- are all to be bundled in this case which is too much intricate to the ' untrained eye ' in this " legal maze .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de retail -pipe- 10.12.2010 toys r ' scarce in german stores großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lego hopes to fufill every child 's wish this christmas toy makers and retailers in germany could n't be happier : christmas shoppers appear to have a near insatiable appetite for toys .
products from traditional european toymakers like lego and playmobil are in high demand . german parents typically spend oodles on their kids for christmas .
but with the buoyant economy this season , they 're spending even more .
so much more , in fact , that retailers are scrambling to stock hot products , like playmobil 's " robo-gangster " toy car with figures or lego 's " stars wars " spaceship .
some manufacturers now warn they may no longer be able to fulfill everyone 's christmas wish .
" we know that from now until christmas demand will be growing daily -lrb- so -rrb- we ca n't guarantee 100 percent that every product will be available right up to december 24 , " said dirk engehausen , the lego deutschland managing director , in an interview with the german news station n-tv .
other german and european manufacturers have a similar holiday message to convey : they have n't run out of any products yet , but supplies are depleting fast and finding the one or other popular product a few days before christmas could prove to be a real treasure hunt .
hurry while the supply lasts " none of our products have completely sold out in germany but some stores have run out of select products , " playmobil spokeswoman judith schweinitz told deutsche welle .
" if you 're really determined to find these , you will but you might have to look around . "
while manufacturers had projected stronger holiday sales , few if any thought they would so strong .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : children in germany can expect plenty of gifts this year " we anticipated more demand this christmas but we 're surprised nevertheless by how huge the demand has been , " said heinrich huentelsmann , a ravensburger spokesperson .
" our tiptoi product , for instance , is still available but is becoming hard to find . "
that toy is one of the few that the german maker of games , puzzle and toys manufacturers in china .
more than 85 percent of its products are made in europe .
" we can react very quickly to demand in europe because most of our production is here , " huentelsmann told deutsche welle .
" we do n't have long logistics paths . "
ravensburger expects it will be able to deliver all products right up to christmas , he said .
but the company is n't making any guarantees .
anticipating greater demand this year , lego delivered 10 percent more products to retailers in advance of the holiday shopping season , according to company spokeswoman helena seppelfricke .
but with some products , like the company 's classic fire department set and " technik " series , in huge demand , she admits the company could easily have delivered more .
" same procedure " most european traditional toymakers including lego , which is based in denmark with additional production sites in hungary , the czech republic and mexico , show their new products at trade events early in the year and begin talks with its buyer at the same time .
however , their ability to boost production to meet unexpected christmas demand generally decreases the closer the holiday shopping season approaches .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : playmobil toys are as popular as ever " it 's pretty much the same procedure every year , " said steffen kahnt , deputy director of germany 's federal association of toy retailer -lrb- bvs -rrb- .
" retailers need to decide how many products to order and manufacturers how many to make .
but no one really knows what the demand will be , especially for new products .
so you hope you make the right call . "
stockpiling products is n't a viable option in the competitive toy sector , according to kahnt .
both manufacturers and retailers , he says , strive to have only as much stock as they see necessary to better control their operating costs .
that said , the industry may want to up production for the 2011 gift season , if the past 24 months are any indication .
record-breaking sales " more products were actually sold last year than the year before , " kahnt said .
" that surprised us .
but no one really thought that sales this year would be so good . "
the german toy industry association -lrb- dvsi -rrb- expects sales to increase six percent this to 2.52 billion euros , compared to 2.38 billion euros the year .
if that mark is reached , the holiday sales will be a huge factor .
retailers generate more than 40 percent of their annual revenue during the holiday shopping season .
for sure , numbers like these will make manufacturers and retailers happy .
their big challenge now is to deliver enough toys to make kids – and their parents – just as happy .

other than the nobel peace prize , which was awarded this year to liu xiaobo , numerous prizes for human rights activists are awarded on this day all over the world .
58-year-old lawyer asma jahangir , recipient of unesco / bilbao prize for 2010 , is the current president of the supreme court bar association and a founding member of the human rights commission of pakistan , the country 's leading independent human rights body .
' it increases one 's responsibilities ' she is a brilliant speaker and a relentless champion of people 's rights .
and yet , there are moments when even asma jahangir seems tired : when she talks about how much still remains to be done in pakistan despite some improvements .
asma jahangir laughs heartily and admits that she too is a normal human being with strengths and weaknesses .
she is happy about the international recognition that comes with the unesco / bilbao prize .
" it is indeed a matter of happiness and pride , but at the same time it increases one 's responsibility .
people expect more from you .
one has to strategize more , keeping in mind one 's integrity .
it draws a ' red line ' for you . "
the journey asma jahangir was born in a rich family in lahore .
when the pakistani government suppressed the independence movement in the late sixties in east pakistan , today 's bangladesh , asma 's father protested and was repeatedly jailed or put under house arrest .
asma jahangir believes this experience has truly formed her .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : asma jahangir has been campaigning for human rights for several decades " what i have learnt is that you are no longer materialistic after that .
the way my father worked altruistically , and the manner in which he used to go behind bars and come back home smilingly was inspirational .
he passed away when he was only 61 .
he had cancer , and we knew he would leave us soon .
i remember my sister and i were sitting at his deathbed , and he looked at us and said , ' i am not going to die , i will live through you ' , " reminisces jahangir .
asma jahangir followed his words .
with her inheritance she founded a women 's forum in 1980 together with her sister , hina jilani , a lawyer herself .
in her numerous jobs , for example as chairperson of the human rights commission of pakistan , or as united nations special rapporteur on freedom of religion or belief , she has raised her voice against the discrimination of religious minorities , against " honor " killings , or the treatment of minors in pakistani jails .
it has not been easy for her .
" women face difficulties at all levels .
they face hardship in society and at the workplace .
women also have to struggle within their households .
therefore , if any woman asserts herself , people find it difficult to accept .
they can also be very cruel towards that woman , " opines jahangir . she remembers that her own in-laws also found it difficult to accept that their son had married a woman who was not a typical pakistani wife .
but with time , both her family and society have accepted her achievements .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a demonstration for minority rights in pakistan dreams for a better pakistan for pakistan , asma jahangir has many dreams .
" firstly , i want to see economic prosperity in pakistan .
the indignity of poverty makes me despair .
pakistanis are a very dignified people .
they have suffered a great deal .
they have resisted oppression .
and yet , the image of pakistan projected in the world is mostly negative .
the positive side of pakistan is not shown .
i think pakistan has wasted its human capital . "
she has learnt to suppress her anger , even when she is being accused of blasphemy or treason .
but asma jahangir emphasizes that a life in anger is not worth living .

but guests gathered around an empty chair to congratulate the laureate , who was not represented at the ceremony . the nobel peace prize committee has concluded its award ceremony in oslo with the prizewinner and guest of honor , imprisoned chinese dissident liu xiaobo , absent .
the prize was meant to " point out the relationship between human rights , democracy and peace " , nobel peace prize committee chairman thorbjoern jagland said in his opening comments .
he called liu a symbol of the " non-violent struggle for such -lsb- human -rsb- rights in china " , and compared him with nelson mandela .
he went on to say that liu had done nothing but exercise his civil rights , and called on china to release him .
in his absence , norwegian actress liv ullmann read a final statement titled " i have no enemies " released by liu 's supporters after his sentencing a year ago .
in it , liu said " there is no force that can put an end to the human quest for freedom , and china will in the end become a nation ruled by law , where human rights reign supreme . "
he also spoke of his wife , liu xia , who is now under house arrest in beijing , saying her love " is the sunlight that leaps over high walls and penetrates the iron bars of my prison window . "
international solidarity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : liu xiaobo is considered a criminal by the chinese authorities throughout friday , western governments paid tribute to liu 's contribution to democracy and human rights , calling on china to release the dissident from prison .
in berlin , german human rights commissioner markus loening praised liu 's courageous stand for human rights .
" the participation of germany as well as all eu partners represented in oslo and many other countries in the ceremony in oslo is therefore a simple sign of respect for liu xiaobo and for all who work to promote human rights and democracy without resorting to violence , " a statement from loening on the german foreign ministry website said .
united states president barack obama meanwhile hailed liu as a beacon of freedom : " the values he espouses are universal , his struggle is peaceful , and he should be released as soon as possible , " obama said .
event overshadowed the event in the norwegian capital was overshadowed not only by liu 's absence , but also by china 's wider anger at his selection .
several nations decided to boycott the ceremony at beijing 's request after the chinese government condemned the decision to award the prize to the democracy activist .
almost a third of the 50 countries invited to the event stayed away , including russia , pakistan and saudi arabia .
many of those not attending are thought to have bowed to chinese pressure .
serbia , which was heavily criticized by the european union for its initial decision not to attend , decided at the last minute to send an ombudsman after all .
chinese media condemn choice bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an empty chair represented liu at the ceremony official chinese media have slammed the choice of liu as nobel peace prize laureate , calling it an attempt to impose foreign values on china .
liu has been a critic of the chinese government since the tiananmen square massacre of 1989 .
liu took a prominent part in the protests there and was sentenced to two years in prison .
he was jailed last december for 11 years on subversion charges after he co-authored a document called charter 08 , which calls for political reform in china .
authorities have also cracked down on activists in the run-up to the ceremony and have prevented liu 's family and friends from attending .
empty chair the nobel committee chose to represent liu with an empty chair during the ceremony , calling this a symbol of the chinese policy to isolate and repress dissidents .
in a moving gesture , jagland placed the nobel diploma on the vacant seat .
it is the first time that a laureate under detention has not been formally represented since 1935 , when nazi germany stopped the pacifist carl von ossietzky from attending .
it is also the first time since then that the prize money of 1.13 million euros -lrb- $ 1.5 million -rrb- will not be handed out .

products from traditional european toymakers like lego and playmobil are in high demand . german parents typically spend oodles on their kids for christmas .
but with the buoyant economy this season , they 're spending even more .
so much more , in fact , that retailers are scrambling to stock hot products , like playmobil 's " robo-gangster " toy car with figures or lego 's " stars wars " spaceship .
some manufacturers now warn they may no longer be able to fulfill everyone 's christmas wish .
" we know that from now until christmas demand will be growing daily -lrb- so -rrb- we ca n't guarantee 100 percent that every product will be available right up to december 24 , " said dirk engehausen , the lego deutschland managing director , in an interview with the german news station n-tv .
other german and european manufacturers have a similar holiday message to convey : they have n't run out of any products yet , but supplies are depleting fast and finding the one or other popular product a few days before christmas could prove to be a real treasure hunt .
hurry while the supply lasts " none of our products have completely sold out in germany but some stores have run out of select products , " playmobil spokeswoman judith schweinitz told deutsche welle .
" if you 're really determined to find these , you will but you might have to look around . "
while manufacturers had projected stronger holiday sales , few if any thought they would so strong .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : children in germany can expect plenty of gifts this year " we anticipated more demand this christmas but we 're surprised nevertheless by how huge the demand has been , " said heinrich huentelsmann , a ravensburger spokesperson .
" our tiptoi product , for instance , is still available but is becoming hard to find . "
that toy is one of the few that the german maker of games , puzzle and toys manufacturers in china .
more than 85 percent of its products are made in europe .
" we can react very quickly to demand in europe because most of our production is here , " huentelsmann told deutsche welle .
" we do n't have long logistics paths . "
ravensburger expects it will be able to deliver all products right up to christmas , he said .
but the company is n't making any guarantees .
anticipating greater demand this year , lego delivered 10 percent more products to retailers in advance of the holiday shopping season , according to company spokeswoman helena seppelfricke .
but with some products , like the company 's classic fire department set and " technik " series , in huge demand , she admits the company could easily have delivered more .
" same procedure " most european traditional toymakers including lego , which is based in denmark with additional production sites in hungary , the czech republic and mexico , show their new products at trade events early in the year and begin talks with its buyer at the same time .
however , their ability to boost production to meet unexpected christmas demand generally decreases the closer the holiday shopping season approaches .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : playmobil toys are as popular as ever " it 's pretty much the same procedure every year , " said steffen kahnt , deputy director of germany 's federal association of toy retailer -lrb- bvs -rrb- .
" retailers need to decide how many products to order and manufacturers how many to make .
but no one really knows what the demand will be , especially for new products .
so you hope you make the right call . "
stockpiling products is n't a viable option in the competitive toy sector , according to kahnt .
both manufacturers and retailers , he says , strive to have only as much stock as they see necessary to better control their operating costs .
that said , the industry may want to up production for the 2011 gift season , if the past 24 months are any indication .
record-breaking sales " more products were actually sold last year than the year before , " kahnt said .
" that surprised us .
but no one really thought that sales this year would be so good . "
the german toy industry association -lrb- dvsi -rrb- expects sales to increase six percent this to 2.52 billion euros , compared to 2.38 billion euros the year .
if that mark is reached , the holiday sales will be a huge factor .
retailers generate more than 40 percent of their annual revenue during the holiday shopping season .
for sure , numbers like these will make manufacturers and retailers happy .
their big challenge now is to deliver enough toys to make kids – and their parents – just as happy .

the prize was meant to " point out the relationship between human rights , democracy and peace " , nobel peace prize committee chairman thorbjoern jagland said in his opening comments .
he called liu a symbol of the " non-violent struggle for such -lsb- human -rsb- rights in china " , and compared him with nelson mandela .
he went on to say that liu had done nothing but exercise his civil rights , and called on china to release him .
in his absence , norwegian actress liv ullmann read a final statement titled " i have no enemies " released by liu 's supporters after his sentencing a year ago .
in it , liu said " there is no force that can put an end to the human quest for freedom , and china will in the end become a nation ruled by law , where human rights reign supreme . "
he also spoke of his wife , liu xia , who is now under house arrest in beijing , saying her love " is the sunlight that leaps over high walls and penetrates the iron bars of my prison window . "

in berlin , german human rights commissioner markus loening praised liu 's courageous stand for human rights .
" the participation of germany as well as all eu partners represented in oslo and many other countries in the ceremony in oslo is therefore a simple sign of respect for liu xiaobo and for all who work to promote human rights and democracy without resorting to violence , " a statement from loening on the german foreign ministry website said .
united states president barack obama meanwhile hailed liu as a beacon of freedom : " the values he espouses are universal , his struggle is peaceful , and he should be released as soon as possible , " obama said .
event overshadowed the event in the norwegian capital was overshadowed not only by liu 's absence , but also by china 's wider anger at his selection .
several nations decided to boycott the ceremony at beijing 's request after the chinese government condemned the decision to award the prize to the democracy activist .
almost a third of the 50 countries invited to the event stayed away , including russia , pakistan and saudi arabia .
many of those not attending are thought to have bowed to chinese pressure .
serbia , which was heavily criticized by the european union for its initial decision not to attend , decided at the last minute to send an ombudsman after all .
chinese media condemn choice bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an empty chair represented liu at the ceremony official chinese media have slammed the choice of liu as nobel peace prize laureate , calling it an attempt to impose foreign values on china .
liu has been a critic of the chinese government since the tiananmen square massacre of 1989 .
liu took a prominent part in the protests there and was sentenced to two years in prison .
he was jailed last december for 11 years on subversion charges after he co-authored a document called charter 08 , which calls for political reform in china .
authorities have also cracked down on activists in the run-up to the ceremony and have prevented liu 's family and friends from attending .
empty chair the nobel committee chose to represent liu with an empty chair during the ceremony , calling this a symbol of the chinese policy to isolate and repress dissidents .
in a moving gesture , jagland placed the nobel diploma on the vacant seat .
it is the first time that a laureate under detention has not been formally represented since 1935 , when nazi germany stopped the pacifist carl von ossietzky from attending .
it is also the first time since then that the prize money of 1.13 million euros -lrb- $ 1.5 million -rrb- will not be handed out .

but guests gathered around an empty chair to congratulate the laureate , who was not represented at the ceremony . the nobel peace prize committee has concluded its award ceremony in oslo with the prizewinner and guest of honor , imprisoned chinese dissident liu xiaobo , absent .
the prize was meant to " point out the relationship between human rights , democracy and peace " , nobel peace prize committee chairman thorbjoern jagland said in his opening comments .
he called liu a symbol of the " non-violent struggle for such -lsb- human -rsb- rights in china " , and compared him with nelson mandela .
he went on to say that liu had done nothing but exercise his civil rights , and called on china to release him .
in his absence , norwegian actress liv ullmann read a final statement titled " i have no enemies " released by liu 's supporters after his sentencing a year ago .
in it , liu said " there is no force that can put an end to the human quest for freedom , and china will in the end become a nation ruled by law , where human rights reign supreme . "
he also spoke of his wife , liu xia , who is now under house arrest in beijing , saying her love " is the sunlight that leaps over high walls and penetrates the iron bars of my prison window . "
international solidarity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : liu xiaobo is considered a criminal by the chinese authorities throughout friday , western governments paid tribute to liu 's contribution to democracy and human rights , calling on china to release the dissident from prison .
in berlin , german human rights commissioner markus loening praised liu 's courageous stand for human rights .
" the participation of germany as well as all eu partners represented in oslo and many other countries in the ceremony in oslo is therefore a simple sign of respect for liu xiaobo and for all who work to promote human rights and democracy without resorting to violence , " a statement from loening on the german foreign ministry website said .
united states president barack obama meanwhile hailed liu as a beacon of freedom : " the values he espouses are universal , his struggle is peaceful , and he should be released as soon as possible , " obama said .
event overshadowed the event in the norwegian capital was overshadowed not only by liu 's absence , but also by china 's wider anger at his selection .
several nations decided to boycott the ceremony at beijing 's request after the chinese government condemned the decision to award the prize to the democracy activist .
almost a third of the 50 countries invited to the event stayed away , including russia , pakistan and saudi arabia .
many of those not attending are thought to have bowed to chinese pressure .
serbia , which was heavily criticized by the european union for its initial decision not to attend , decided at the last minute to send an ombudsman after all .
chinese media condemn choice bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an empty chair represented liu at the ceremony official chinese media have slammed the choice of liu as nobel peace prize laureate , calling it an attempt to impose foreign values on china .
liu has been a critic of the chinese government since the tiananmen square massacre of 1989 .
liu took a prominent part in the protests there and was sentenced to two years in prison .
he was jailed last december for 11 years on subversion charges after he co-authored a document called charter 08 , which calls for political reform in china .
authorities have also cracked down on activists in the run-up to the ceremony and have prevented liu 's family and friends from attending .
empty chair the nobel committee chose to represent liu with an empty chair during the ceremony , calling this a symbol of the chinese policy to isolate and repress dissidents .
in a moving gesture , jagland placed the nobel diploma on the vacant seat .
it is the first time that a laureate under detention has not been formally represented since 1935 , when nazi germany stopped the pacifist carl von ossietzky from attending .
it is also the first time since then that the prize money of 1.13 million euros -lrb- $ 1.5 million -rrb- will not be handed out .

florian henckel von donnersmarck is the most recent german director to switch to hollywood with " the tourist . " angelina jolie 's new film " the tourist " sees the actress purring , posing and prodding men from paris to venice - a bit like how the film itself got its start .
dissatisfied with the original script , jolie called up german director florian henckel von donnersmarck and convinced him .
if you 'll rewrite the script and direct , she said , i 'm in .
the movie is the director 's second , following his 2006 oscar-winning debut film , " the lives of others . "
von donnersmarck made his way across the pond for his big-budget hollywood premiere , but the capital of show business is a bit different than the director had imagined .
" i had thought that everything would be a bit more lascivious , adventurous and sexually decadent - that everybody would sleep with everybody , " he told dpa news agency .
" but really it 's just hardworking people that do n't go to bed too late because they have to get up at six for an appointment with their personal trainers . "
the first result of von donnersmarck 's venture to hollywood opens on december 10 in the us and makes its german debut on december 16 .
poor reviews ahead of the us premiere do n't bode well for the film , however , with variety calling it " a euro-chic trifle " .
the hollywood reporter website said the film was " served under a label promising first-class champagne " but tasted like " last night 's prosecco . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a door opened for director von donnersmarck after his 2007 oscar win never far from home the 37-year-old director moved to tinseltown just six months after his 2007 oscar win , as calls from agents and other industry insiders began to pour in .
but a change of location is nothing new for the cologne-born director , who spent stints of his childhood in brussels , berlin and new york and studied in st. petersburg and oxford .
on the other hand , the director insists his home country has n't left his thoughts or his work .
" in my mind , i have n't left germany , " said von donnersmarck in an interview with the weekly frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung .
" i would lose much too much by not being able to keep making german films and taking up german topics and themes . "
that may set him apart from some of his german colleagues , who have made the switch from making films at home to creating hollywood blockbusters .
hollywood superstars , german roots von donnersmarck 's story sounds a bit like that of wolfgang petersen , director of 1981 's " das boot " -lrb- " the boat " -rrb- , which garnered a host of oscar nominations -lrb- although no wins -rrb- and catapulted its director to international fame .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " das boot " -lrb- 1981 -rrb- is a dramatic war film following the fate of a world war ii submarine petersen made the move from hamburg to hollywood , where he went on to direct major hits , including " in the line of fire " -lrb- 1993 -rrb- , " air force one " -lrb- 1997 -rrb- and " troy " -lrb- 2004 -rrb- .
although petersen now enjoys being one of the few directors with the privilege of making the " final cut " on his films , it had n't always been smooth sailing .
his 2006 " poseidon " was a flop in comparison with its massive $ 160-million budget .
petersen is n't the only german-born director to have churned out international blockbusters in the last two decades .
he 's joined by roland emmerich , director of thrillers heavy on special effects like " independence day " -lrb- 1996 -rrb- , " the patriot " -lrb- 2000 -rrb- and " the day after tomorrow " -lrb- 2004 -rrb- .
the director got his foot in the door in hollywood with 1994 's " stargate . "
emmerich had begun his career in his home country with a series of lesser-known films , first in german and then in english .
the move to hollywood filmmaking was a shock in at least one way for the self-described penny-pincher from southern germany .
" i have the nature of a very thrifty person , " emmerich said in 1994 .
" so it 's really strange to suddenly be on top of a project with more than a 50 million dollar budget . "
like von donnersmarck , emmerich still draws inspiration from germany and returned to potsdam to direct his most recent film , " anonymous , " set for release in 2011 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hirschbiegel 's " downfall " -lrb- 2004 -rrb- follows hitler in his final days no guarantees but even oscar nominations and star-studded casts have n't been enough to save some of von donnersmarck 's germany-to-hollywood colleagues from box office defeat .
oliver hirschbiegel 's 2004 drama " downfall " garnered an oscar nomination for best foreign language film and paved the way for the director 's la debut with 2007 's " the invasion . "
but despite a cast including nicole kidman and daniel craig , the movie was a flop and fell millions of dollars short of its budget .
german-born director mennan yapo , who has turkish roots , suffered a similar fate after his direction in 2004 's " lautlos " -lrb- " soundless " -rrb- drew international acclaim .
he followed up with " the premonition , " starring sandra bullock , about a housewife with a chilling suspicion , but critics generally panned the effort .
it remains to be seen whether " the tourist " will live up to its hollywood-sized expectations , despite initial negative reviews in the us .
but if not , von donnersmarck can reassure himself with the fact that he 's already an oscar-winner , unlike some of his predecessors .
if the film turns out to be a success after all , he may just become another in a long line of german-speaking directors to go down in hollywood 's movie-making history , from fritz lang to billy wilder .

the economic situation in their home countries is so dire , they 'll take any job they can get . russia is a land of hope , at least for the 12 million migrant workers who arrive each year from poor countries in central asia and eastern europe .
the nation has the second highest number of guest workers in the world .
a recent study by the world bank estimated the country had 12.3 million migrant workers , but the russian goverment puts the number closer to five million . the immigrant workers come mainly from uzbekistan , tajikistan , kyrgyzstan , moldova and ukraine .
since the collapse of the soviet union , the economies in these countries have struggled to take off .
tajikistan , for example , remains one of the poorest countries in the world , with a third of its large enterprises either out of date or dysfunctional .
each year , more than 700,000 tajiks leave for russia with hopes of earning money .
no other choice once in russia , the impoverished foreigners will take almost any job , often working in construction , sweeping streets , or gardening . it 's back-breaking physical labor , up to fourteen hours a day .

most foreigners from former soviet republics are in russia illegally .
in order to curb the influx of workers during the current economic crisis , the russian state only awards work permits to one million migrant workers a year .
nevertheless , each year up to twelve million migrants make their way to russia .
it 's pretty easy for workers to enter russia initially , but if they overstay the three month grace period without getting a visa , they become illegal and are often exploited by their employers .

each december in oslo , the arguments about whether the right recipient was chosen can be just as fierce as the threats these winners often face because of their work .
individuals who take a stand for peace and reconciliation in difficult conflict situations tend to have more enemies than friends .
by awarding the detained chinese professor of literature and democracy activist , liu xiabo , this year 's peace prize in oslo on october 8 , the nobel committee made an apt comment on the changing global balance of power .
this is how its decision should be interpreted .
a rising power like china needs to respect human and civil rights for the benefit of all mankind - that was the message from oslo .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : adrienne woltersdorf , the head of deutsche welle 's chinese service , is in oslo it is a slap in the chinese authorities ' face .
they have reacted accordingly and suppressed any domestic discourse about the so eagerly awaited - and now so despised - first chinese nobel laureate in history .
in addition , many activists , including liu 's wife liu xia , were preemptively intimidated or simply put under house arrest .
the regime 's harsh reactions show that the norwegian jury really touched a nerve in beijing .
but it is ridiculous that those loyal to the regime allege that the nobel committee intended to provocatively and maliciously challenge china 's rise .
the truth , in fact , is the precise opposite .
for quite some time , even veteran cadres of the mao era have been calling for more freedom of thought in china .
just recently , a group of influential former cadres reiterated this demand in a letter to the new party leadership .
a rapidly changing society , they argued , needs freedom of debate and opportunity for criticism in order to make wise decisions for the future .
such voices will be encouraged by the nobel peace prize , and only the chinese can decide how china should develop .
in this sense , the peace prize for liu xiaobo is also a unique chance for the badly divided and marginalized chinese democracy movement .
oslo could thus become the starting point for a new movement .
but before this happens , democracy activists inside and outside of china will have to prove that they can restrain their somtimes excessive egos , and dedicate themselves to the collective cause .
the powers-that-be in beijing will do everything they can to continue to marginalize the proponents of democracy .
they have given sufficient proof during the past weeks that they are perfectly capable of doing this .
but the chinese civil rights activists now have an internationally recognized leader .
they have a prudent manifesto - liu xiaobo 's " charter ' 08 " document - they have a sympathetic international audience , and they have the internet ; all that they 're missing is a single movement to unite them .

dutch police have arrested a teenager accused of taking part in the attacks . dutch authorities on friday said police in the netherlands arrested a 16-year-old who has admitted to attacking websites belonging to wikileaks opponents .
a spokesman for the national prosecutor 's office said the teenager had " admitted launching attacks on visa and mastercard sites . "
a statement said he was probably " part of a larger group of hackers . "
hackers unite hackers from around the world have stepped up cyber attacks following the arrest of wikileaks boss julian assange .
assange is wanted by sweden in connection with sexual misconduct charges the online attacks have mainly targeted companies that have deprived wikileaks of their services , including the websites of the online payment service paypal , and the credit card giants visa and mastercard , which had stopped processing donations for wikileaks .
also targeted were amazon.com , which had banished wikileaks from using its rented servers , a swiss bank and the website of the swedish prosecutor who had issued an arrest warrant for assange on charges of sexual misconduct .

dutch police have arrested a teenager accused of taking part in the attacks . dutch authorities on friday said police in the netherlands arrested a 16-year-old who has admitted to attacking websites belonging to wikileaks opponents .
a spokesman for the national prosecutor 's office said the teenager had " admitted launching attacks on visa and mastercard sites . "
a statement said he was probably " part of a larger group of hackers . "
hackers unite hackers from around the world have stepped up cyber attacks following the arrest of wikileaks boss julian assange .
assange is wanted by sweden in connection with sexual misconduct charges the online attacks have mainly targeted companies that have deprived wikileaks of their services , including the websites of the online payment service paypal , and the credit card giants visa and mastercard , which had stopped processing donations for wikileaks .
also targeted were amazon.com , which had banished wikileaks from using its rented servers , a swiss bank and the website of the swedish prosecutor who had issued an arrest warrant for assange on charges of sexual misconduct .
the group of hackers , which calls itself " anonymous , " says it wants to keep the internet open and free .
wikileaks has distanced itself from the cyber attacks , but said they reflected public opinion .
in a statement , the organization said it had no contact with anonymous and had not received prior notice of any of the group 's actions .

some of the documents have caused embarrassment to the nations concerned .
assange is due to appear in a london court for a second time on tuesday , when prosecutors want to question him about allegations of rape and sexual molestation made by two women .

dutch police have arrested a teenager accused of taking part in the attacks . dutch authorities on friday said police in the netherlands arrested a 16-year-old who has admitted to attacking websites belonging to wikileaks opponents .
a spokesman for the national prosecutor 's office said the teenager had " admitted launching attacks on visa and mastercard sites . "
a statement said he was probably " part of a larger group of hackers . "
hackers unite hackers from around the world have stepped up cyber attacks following the arrest of wikileaks boss julian assange .
assange is wanted by sweden in connection with sexual misconduct charges the online attacks have mainly targeted companies that have deprived wikileaks of their services , including the websites of the online payment service paypal , and the credit card giants visa and mastercard , which had stopped processing donations for wikileaks .
also targeted were amazon.com , which had banished wikileaks from using its rented servers , a swiss bank and the website of the swedish prosecutor who had issued an arrest warrant for assange on charges of sexual misconduct .
the group of hackers , which calls itself " anonymous , " says it wants to keep the internet open and free .
wikileaks has distanced itself from the cyber attacks , but said they reflected public opinion .
in a statement , the organization said it had no contact with anonymous and had not received prior notice of any of the group 's actions .
assange : " charges fabricated " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : julian assange says he is innocent of the charges assange is currently in a british jail after handing himself in to police on tuesday . police have moved the wikileaks ' chief from the main part of wandsworth prison to an isolation unit , his lawyer said friday . " the prison authorities are doing it for his own safety , presumably , " jennifer robinson , one of assange 's legal team told the afp news agency . assange has been refused the use of his own laptop but will be given a prison computer with limited internet access , the guardian newspaper reported friday .
assange says the swedish sexual misconduct charges are a fabrication intended to stop his organization from continuing to publish confidential documents .
wikileaks is facing international condemnation for its publication of confidential material , often concerning diplomatic relations between countries .
some of the documents have caused embarrassment to the nations concerned .
assange is due to appear in a london court for a second time on tuesday , when prosecutors want to question him about allegations of rape and sexual molestation made by two women .

the decision marks a profound change for germany , where compulsory service was re-introduced 50 years ago . senior officials in germany 's coalition government have agreed to suspend military conscription as of july 1 , 2011 .
defense minister karl theodor zu guttenberg 's proposal was accepted during closed-door talks in berlin on thursday evening .
the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- of chancellor angela merkel and its bavarian sister party the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- have both in principle approved abolishing the draft at party conferences in the past six weeks .
their other coalition partner , the pro-business free democrats , had included stopping conscription in their manifesto during last year 's general election .
sources taking part in the meeting said the next step would be for merkel 's cabinet to approve a draft bill that could be put to parliament ; this is expected to happen on december 15 .
troop reduction bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : defense minister guttenberg says the change will save money guttenberg 's plan would also see troop numbers reduced the current level of 250,000 soldiers to 185,000 .
of these , 170,000 would be professional soldiers , with volunteers making up the remainder .
with his reform , guttenberg hopes to save up to 8.3 billion euros .
however , the suspension of conscription could create some new problems ; for instance , the alternative community service offered to those who refuse military service would also be dropped .
social and welfare institutions fear that this could lead to a lack of personnel , as in the past they have relied heavily on youngsters who want to avoid military service .
the suspension also means that student numbers are likely to climb , posing problems for universities .
compulsory military service in germany lasts for six months and only applies to young men .
women are allowed to join the german army , the bundeswehr , either as professionals or volunteers , but are not obliged to do so .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de development policy -pipe- 10.12.2010 opinion : poor countries can afford social protection großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sub-saharan nation of lesotho has established a pension system that costs less than two percent of gni a recent report suggests that even poor countries can afford basic social protection schemes - and these schemes pay off in terms of economic development , argues commentator dr markus loewe . the recommendations made in this week 's european report on development , drafted by the florence-based european university institute in florence and funded by the european commission and some european union member states , will surprise few experts .
what is remarkable about this latest report is how clearly its authors , most of whom are economists , advocate stronger government engagement in social policies - even in the low-income countries of sub-saharan africa .
basic social protection schemes , the authors suggest , could contribute to growth and poverty reduction , and assist developing countries in reaching the millennium development goals .
the report draws on recent research that highlights the importance of social protection to the economic and political development of countries .
people without access to a social safety net risk falling -lrb- even deeper -rrb- into poverty when faced with a shock like illness or a bad harvest .
they may then have to turn to savings , sell livestock or other assets or send their children to work rather than school in order to finance their daily needs .
in this way , they lose means of livelihoods that might otherwise help them to establish at least a modest existence on their own .
more seriously , households without social protection tend to shy away from investing savings at the outset , instead hoarding income to stay liquid and to prepare for a possible loss of future income or unexpected expenditures .
empirical studies suggest that families , and especially those who work in the informal sector , are more likely to invest when they have access to basic social protection schemes . such investment promotes economic growth precisely where it is most likely to help reduce poverty .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : where families have no safety net , they may be forced to sell income-producing assets like cattle in hard times finally , social protection schemes contribute to political stability .
by reducing poverty and economic insecurity , they lower the chances that a people will resort to violence to achieve political aims .
above all , though , such schemes show citizens that the state feels responsible and cares for them .
many studies point out that , where public social protection schemes exist , citizens identify more closely with the state and show a willingness to fulfill their obligations to the community .
so basic social protection helps not only to reduce poverty but also acts as insurance for business activities and the material basis of a social contract accepted by every citizen .
many will ask how low-income countries can be expected to finance social protection schemes - and rightly so .
it is rarely the case that the majority of a population is covered by social protection systems that the members themselves finance through contributions - social and private insurance schemes and community-based mutual insurance associations , for instance .
this is because , in low-income countries especially , contributions to such schemes are too high for many people .
at the same time , the idea of social transfer schemes financed by the state from tax revenues is often rejected on the grounds that governments in low-income countries do not enjoy wide enough budget margins to be able to fund such schemes .
yet this year 's european report on development -lrb- erd -rrb- reflects a turning point in the academic debate .
even low-income countries that can not afford comprehensive social protection for all their citizens can find satisfactory solutions for particularly vulnerable groups .
for example lesotho , among other african countries , has created a tax-financed system that grants a modest flat pension to everybody over a certain age .
although lesotho is a poor country , the program costs less than two percent of gross national income , and in many households it benefits not only the elderly but also their student grandchildren who want to lay better foundations for their later working lives .
similarly , ethiopia has developed a program that provides poor families jobs in rural infrastructure construction .
the international labor organization estimates that the total cost of establishing both of these programs as well as an unconditional cash transfer program for orphans would not exceed six percent of national income in any sub-saharan african country .
unfortunately , the 2010 erd does not explain how and by whom social protection is to be organized where the state is unwilling or unable to do so .
in such cases , social protection can be provided only by non-governmental actors through , for example , micro-insurance schemes .
the erd restricts the definition of social protection to action conducted by the state , and so does not consider this course of action .
where efficient government does not exist , self-help in the shape of , say , mutual insurance continues to be the only way out .
this is now true of a quarter to a half of all countries in sub-saharan africa , as noted in last year 's erd .

not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content .
australia offers support to wikileaks founder , operation payback begins should assange be extradited to the united states ?
why ?
he did not spy , he did not steal all the data that was passed along to him - nor is he a us citizen .
the us has been caught with the pants way down and of course , does n't like it one bit .
the us has sprung a " leaki " in its " weaki " and does n't like it one " bitty . "
as the saying goes … those who live in glass houses should not be throwing stones . - vera , germany i believe asange did bring out the true colors of individuals , opinion makers and governments in the present context of world politics .
everyone should admire his forthright exposure , however bitter it may be ; more so the americans who expect democracies and freedom to speech to flourish around the globe .
extradition and implicating him will only show the us in bad light . - mohan , india no , he should n't be extradited .
it 's a witch hunt to divert blame from the people who should be overseeing us security .
we 've paid good money for homeland security .
whose fault is it that thousands of secret documents were released ? - wayne , us definitely not .
supporting corruption and lack of common sense has been the m.o. for too long .
someone needs to wake up the people over here , wikileaks is a good start . - gene , us the us has only itself to blame for the leaks ... its a schoolyard bully that 's now having a tantrum and calling on its buddies to help it in a scrap because it knows it ca n't nuke everyone that does n't agree with it .
in australia the us is seen as a gutless mongrel that will do anything to get its own way especially concerning energy drilling . - tom , australia julian assange is a xxi century hero , in the sixties the fight against the empire was with " guerrillas , " today the fight is with internet .
and he 's going to win . - crstina , spain the us is paranoid about wikileaks .
a typical response of killing the messenger .
no extradition of julian assange .
the eu should promote transparency and be more open about foreign policies and clarity of diplomatic mores in language . - j. , the netherlands no way jose !
who cares about america ?
not me anyway : -rrb- i 'm so happy about wikileaks and anything that harms america .
they think an insult to us is immoral , and that they are somehow better than the rest of us .
they are just greedy , self-important and power-obsessed .
everything they touch is tarnished .
they are so last century .
bring on the rise of china and india !
how dare they think they can " spy " on other countries in the un ! - brian , ireland if any european country extradites julian assange to the united states , it will be for a political " crime . "
is europe the running dog of the us , or a group of sovereign nations dedicated to freedom of the press , freedom of the individual and people having the right to know what is going on ?
kevin rudd claims that the core problem is the failure by the us to protect its diplomatic communications .
i think the core problem is the behavior of the us .
the reason that wikileaks has not released the diplomatic communications of other countries -lrb- eg : germany , australia -rrb- is that they are better behaved and do not goose-step on the world stage , trying to take over the world . - charles , australia i believe that having all that " secret " info available for everybody to learn was not the " status quo " however it was disclosed and it is done .
the fellow in jail in the united kingdom is actually a journalist devoted to inform the public .
if he ever is extradited to the us he can claim " freedom of expression . "
now , in terms of those " ladies " claiming sex crimes , that is a bit doubtful .
they have waited until now , come on !
i believe that it was a politically manipulated act to get him behind bars .
and if those allegedly " crimes " were committed in sweden , should n't he then be extradited to that country ? - elena , us no .
he 's a hero who has struck a powerful blow for freedom !
he should be given the medal of freedom award ! - michael , us no , he should not be extradited to the us ; he has not been charged with any us crime .
whatever one thinks about wikileaks , mr. assange is taking a principled stand against the establishment for personal convictions and at great risk to himself .
if the political solution is to restrict freedom of the internet it will amplify assange 's stance : that many elected politicians are duplicitous control freaks who need their over-used and abused powers curtailed .
he deserves respect , support and applause for his courage . - a. , japan i believe that assange is being targeted for what he did .
if he 's found guilty of real sexual misconduct , i believe he should be punished , but as far as the internet crap , i believe he 'll prevail .
he 'll probably either wimp out for future stuff , or he 'll feel more emboldened .
i 'd like to see the hackers messing with mastercard put to be punished though .
it causes too many undeserving people a lot of pain . - joe , us i am completely baffled by the case .
mr. assange has been arrested in a country -lrb- uk -rrb- which belongs to the interpol group of countries so , according to the rules , he might be obviously extradited to sweden - country which relies on " the rules " within the interpol group .
at the same time , mr. assange has been accused of allegedly having broken the law of another country -lrb- usa -rrb- which is also in the interpol group .
in addition , his own country -lrb- australia -rrb- has now given a hint of standing up for him by offering him legal help , not ruling out his extradition to australia -lrb- being also the interpol member . -rrb-
in addition , there is the international court of justice in the hague -lrb- operating within the uno . -rrb-
so international law , respective rules of law of the countries mentioned , international organizations -lrb- interpol , uno , eu -rrb- are all to be bundled in this case which is too much intricate to the ' untrained eye ' in this " legal maze .

credit card firms mastercard and visa later suspended payments made to wikileaks , while the swiss post office shut down a bank account opened by wikileaks founder julian assange .
pillay said the case " raises complex human rights questions about balancing freedom of information and the need to protect national security or public order . "
" if wikileaks has committed any recognizable illegal acts then this should be handled through the legal system and not through pressure and intimidation including on third parties , " said pillay a former un war crimes judge .

supporters of assange claim that the charges against him have been manufactured as part of a bid to halt the website 's activities , along with the pressure on firms to cut wikileaks ' income stream .
' pot calls kettle black , ' putin russian prime minister vladimir putin said that assange 's arrest in britain , for extradition , was " undemocratic " and accused the us of " hypocrisy " for attacking russia 's record on democracy .

is that democracy ?

florian henckel von donnersmarck is the most recent german director to switch to hollywood with " the tourist . " angelina jolie 's new film " the tourist " sees the actress purring , posing and prodding men from paris to venice - a bit like how the film itself got its start .
dissatisfied with the original script , jolie called up german director florian henckel von donnersmarck and convinced him .
if you 'll rewrite the script and direct , she said , i 'm in .
the movie is the director 's second , following his 2006 oscar-winning debut film , " the lives of others . "
von donnersmarck made his way across the pond for his big-budget hollywood premiere , but the capital of show business is a bit different than the director had imagined .
" i had thought that everything would be a bit more lascivious , adventurous and sexually decadent - that everybody would sleep with everybody , " he told dpa news agency .
" but really it 's just hardworking people that do n't go to bed too late because they have to get up at six for an appointment with their personal trainers . "
the first result of von donnersmarck 's venture to hollywood opens on december 10 in the us and makes its german debut on december 16 .
poor reviews ahead of the us premiere do n't bode well for the film , however , with variety calling it " a euro-chic trifle " .
the hollywood reporter website said the film was " served under a label promising first-class champagne " but tasted like " last night 's prosecco . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a door opened for director von donnersmarck after his 2007 oscar win never far from home the 37-year-old director moved to tinseltown just six months after his 2007 oscar win , as calls from agents and other industry insiders began to pour in .
but a change of location is nothing new for the cologne-born director , who spent stints of his childhood in brussels , berlin and new york and studied in st. petersburg and oxford .
on the other hand , the director insists his home country has n't left his thoughts or his work .
" in my mind , i have n't left germany , " said von donnersmarck in an interview with the weekly frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung .
" i would lose much too much by not being able to keep making german films and taking up german topics and themes . "
that may set him apart from some of his german colleagues , who have made the switch from making films at home to creating hollywood blockbusters .
hollywood superstars , german roots von donnersmarck 's story sounds a bit like that of wolfgang petersen , director of 1981 's " das boot " -lrb- " the boat " -rrb- , which garnered a host of oscar nominations -lrb- although no wins -rrb- and catapulted its director to international fame .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " das boot " -lrb- 1981 -rrb- is a dramatic war film following the fate of a world war ii submarine petersen made the move from hamburg to hollywood , where he went on to direct major hits , including " in the line of fire " -lrb- 1993 -rrb- , " air force one " -lrb- 1997 -rrb- and " troy " -lrb- 2004 -rrb- .
although petersen now enjoys being one of the few directors with the privilege of making the " final cut " on his films , it had n't always been smooth sailing .
his 2006 " poseidon " was a flop in comparison with its massive $ 160-million budget .
petersen is n't the only german-born director to have churned out international blockbusters in the last two decades .
he 's joined by roland emmerich , director of thrillers heavy on special effects like " independence day " -lrb- 1996 -rrb- , " the patriot " -lrb- 2000 -rrb- and " the day after tomorrow " -lrb- 2004 -rrb- .
the director got his foot in the door in hollywood with 1994 's " stargate . "
emmerich had begun his career in his home country with a series of lesser-known films , first in german and then in english .
the move to hollywood filmmaking was a shock in at least one way for the self-described penny-pincher from southern germany .
" i have the nature of a very thrifty person , " emmerich said in 1994 .
" so it 's really strange to suddenly be on top of a project with more than a 50 million dollar budget . "
like von donnersmarck , emmerich still draws inspiration from germany and returned to potsdam to direct his most recent film , " anonymous , " set for release in 2011 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hirschbiegel 's " downfall " -lrb- 2004 -rrb- follows hitler in his final days no guarantees but even oscar nominations and star-studded casts have n't been enough to save some of von donnersmarck 's germany-to-hollywood colleagues from box office defeat .
oliver hirschbiegel 's 2004 drama " downfall " garnered an oscar nomination for best foreign language film and paved the way for the director 's la debut with 2007 's " the invasion . "
but despite a cast including nicole kidman and daniel craig , the movie was a flop and fell millions of dollars short of its budget .
german-born director mennan yapo , who has turkish roots , suffered a similar fate after his direction in 2004 's " lautlos " -lrb- " soundless " -rrb- drew international acclaim .
he followed up with " the premonition , " starring sandra bullock , about a housewife with a chilling suspicion , but critics generally panned the effort .
it remains to be seen whether " the tourist " will live up to its hollywood-sized expectations , despite initial negative reviews in the us .
but if not , von donnersmarck can reassure himself with the fact that he 's already an oscar-winner , unlike some of his predecessors .
if the film turns out to be a success after all , he may just become another in a long line of german-speaking directors to go down in hollywood 's movie-making history , from fritz lang to billy wilder .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de finance -pipe- 10.12.2010 cancun divided over how to pay for consequences of climate change großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how can cancun help poorer nations face climate change ?
the goal of a legally binding treaty to reduce pollution has fallen by the wayside , so efforts in cancun have been focusing on a fund to help channel hundreds of billions of dollars in aid towards poor countries . enshrined in the copenhagen accord was the pledge to raise billions of dollars of climate aid .
the headline figures were impressive : 100 billion dollars -lrb- 76 billion euro -rrb- a year as of 2020 , and at least seven billion euros from the eu over the next few years to get the ball rolling .
yet the nitty gritty details of how that money should be managed and distributed were left for cancun . but negotiations on the fund are being stalled because the us want to tie the creation of the fund to other issues , in particular they want big developing emitting countries , particularly china to be more transparent about the action they are taking to mitigate the effects of climate change . " that essentially puts a handbrake on how far we can go in creating a fund , " steve herz , a climate policy advisor at greenpeace told deutsche welle .
" it risks a watered down decision , " he added . a new draft proposal has spelled out the technicalities for setting up a global climate fund .
it will help poor nations create a mechanism to share clean technologies , protect tropical forests and help the poor adapt to impacts ranging from storms to rising sea levels . in a revision , the text explicitly calls for a role for women in the fight against climate change . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : environmentalists want the money to help poor nations adapt to climate change " at last women , who are among the most affected by climate change , are not being ignored , " said executive director of oxfam jeremy hobbs at a press conference . but some environmentalists criticized the draft for removing a reference to ensuring that 50 percent of assistance goes toward helping people adapt to climate change . " the current draft sees too many important decisions pushed down the road , " hobbs said . the omission would allow wealthy nations to meet pledges through other means , such as offering technical know-how to help curb emissions of greenhouse gases blamed for global warming . role of the world bank negotiators said they saw steady progress in setting up the architecture of a future climate fund .
a remaining sticking point is whether to include a role for international bodies , such as the world bank , in administering aid . donor countries want to have guarantees that the money is actually spent on global climate protection .
the developing countries receiving the funds want freedom of choice on their national measures and no preconditions , for example , on policy priorities . " there 's a tug of war going on right now .
the dispute is about the trustee role , " said steve herz . donor countries want the world bank to play a role as trustee , which - according to herz - " could mean that they just cut cheques , but it could also mean a broader role in implementing and conceiving projects " . negotiators are currently trying to agree on the scope of the trustee role . as the globe 's largest poverty-fighting institution , with 65 years of experience in development finance , the world bank says it can play a helpful role . " our specialty is essentially delivering results at scale .
the world has lots of pilots and lots of wonderful experiments going on a small scale and those are really good .
but what the world really needs now is scale .
i think we can play a helpful role in bringing together the overall packages , " andrew steer , special envoy for climate change at the world bank , told deutsche welle . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : loans to create solar energy plants could generate income , according to the world bank but there are some delegations that are very skeptical about the world bank administering the funds .
in particular , developing countries oppose a climate fund managed by the bank and instead want the unfccc to be the fund 's manager . the un ambassadors of bolivia , pablo solon , summed up their reservations : " to have the world bank as the entity that is going to manage this is something that we do not support , " solon told deutsche welle . " why ?
because as you know , there has been a crisis , an international crisis and part of the reason for this crisis is the imf and the world bank , which have imposed a policy that has provoked this crisis " . the world bank has also been criticized for not acting progressively enough on climate related issues . " it continues to promote as its central paradigm fossil fuel based energy production , " said steve herz a report by oil change international and sierra club said the world bank increased its lending for fossil fuels from 1.5 billion dollars in 2006 to 6.2 billion dollars in 2010 . carbon markets on the sidelines of the conference , the world bank launched a new multi-million dollar fund to help emerging market countries set up their own carbon markets carbon markets create a profit-generating system whereby a cap is put on the total amount of carbon emissions and companies can trade in surplus rights to emit carbon dioxide into the atmosphere .
the idea is to create a market based system that incentivizes companies to reduce carbon emissions . the world bank thinks this system can play a bigger role .
" today only two percent of clean development mechanism money goes to africa and we have found that in our own portfolio of carbon markets , we have more than 20 percent going to africa and it works fine .
in other words , we believe that it is possible to extend the reach of carbon markets and offsets to those low income countries , " steer said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : carbon markets have allowed china 's wind energy sector to expand rapidly friends of the earth , an environmental advocacy group is strongly critical of carbon markets . " carbon markets are an irreparably flawed means of addressing climate change , " said karen orenstein of friends of the earth us .
" they further entrench the economic arrangements that facilitate the north 's over-consumption and have landed us in this climate crisis in the first place . " nnimmo bassey , executive director of environmental rights action in nigeria and chair of friends of the earth international , thinks that the negotiations are missing the real issues by concentrating too much on market issues . " all the negotiators talk about is how to use the market to soften global warming – carbon offsetting by planting a tree somewhere in africa while you keep polluting in europe , " he told deutsche welle . " this is not a solution , because pollution emissions have to stop at the source .
and they are not talking about lifestyle changes ; they are not talking about less consumption and less of production . " with talks due to end on friday , many negotiators believed they could come to agreement in three key areas : the architecture of a global climate fund , aid to discourage deforestation , and verification of countries ' climate pledges . author : natalia dannenberg -lrb- afp , dpa -rrb- editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

after pressure from china , 20 nations have said they wo n't be attending the ceremony . a total of 65 countries have embassies in the norwegian capital of oslo and recently they 've all received the same two pieces of mail . an invitation from the nobel prize committee to attend the award ceremony for the 2011 nobel winners and a letter from the chinese embassy requesting they steer clear of the event . " we have noticed that the chinese are very engaged this year , " said geir lundestad , director of the nobel institute .
" they want as few nations as possible to accept the invitation .
now we 'll see who does not come for political reasons and who have other reasons . " the nobel committee has said 44 nations will be sending envoys to the ceremony , including eu member states , the united states , japan , india , south korea , south africa , indonesia and brazil . political , social motives bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at the ceremony , 20 countries will have empty chairs but another 20 countries have said they will not be in attendance .
serbia cited its interest in maintaining good relations with china for its absence , but other countries , including russia , are offering other reasons .
moscow has said scheduling difficulties - not political considerations - were keeping it away . but the scheduling conflicts veil russia 's political motive not to attend , according to sergei lukashevsky , the head of moscow 's sakharov museum . " that russia is not participating in the nobel peace prize 's award ceremony once again makes it clear that human rights do not play a prominent role in our foreign policy , " he said . " russia and china are members of the shanghai organization for cooperation and one of its goals is the fight against so-called extremism , " lukashevsky added .
" what that really means is that the countries support each other when it comes to fighting uncomfortable political situations . several countries in the middle east as well as afghanistan , pakistan and the philippines are also avoiding the ceremony because for economic and political reasons , according to rainer sollich , head of deutsche welle 's arabic department . " they are all states that have problems concerning human rights and operate under the understanding that they would n't want china at a ceremony honoring someone they view as an opponent of their regime . " china 's confucius prize china 's policy regarding the award ceremony and the still-imprisoned dissident liu has been clear .
referring to the nobel committee , chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman jiang yu said , " we will not change because of interference by a few clowns . " beijing awarded its own version of the nobel peace prize on thursday by giving the " confucius peace prize " to former taiwan vice-president lien chan .
like with liu 's nobel , chan was not in attendance to claim the award and his office said he was unaware of the prize . china has blocked access to the website of norwegian broadcaster nrk , the station said on thursday .
access to the bbc and cnn has also been affected ahead of friday 's ceremony , according to nrk . conspicuous absence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more protests in support of liu are scheduled for thursday friday will mark only the second time in the more than 100-year history of the prize that neither the laureate nor a representative will be able to come accept the award .
german journalist and pacifist carl von ossietzky , who was locked up in a nazi concentration camp , could not travel to oslo for his prize ceremony in 1936 . in addition to liu and ossietzky , myanmar 's aung san suu kyi was also barred from receiving her nobel peace prize in 1991 . liu has long been an outspoken opponent of chinese leadership in beijing and was at the forefront of the 1989 tiananmen square protests .
he was jailed in december 2009 for 11 years on subversion charges after co-authoring " charter 08 , " a manifesto that called for political reform in china . nobel officials said an empty chair would be used to represent liu 's absence . the 20 nations which will not attend the nobel ceremony are : afghanistan , china , colombia , cuba , egypt , iran , iraq , kazakhstan , morocco , pakistan , the philippines , russia , saudi arabia , serbia , sri lanka , sudan , tunisia , ukraine , venezuela and vietnam . authors : matthias von hein , jegor winogradow / sms -lrb- afp -rrb- editor : jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we have noticed that the chinese are very engaged this year , " said geir lundestad , director of the nobel institute .
" they want as few nations as possible to accept the invitation .
now we 'll see who does not come for political reasons and who have other reasons . " the nobel committee has said 44 nations will be sending envoys to the ceremony , including eu member states , the united states , japan , india , south korea , south africa , indonesia and brazil . political , social motives bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at the ceremony , 20 countries will have empty chairs but another 20 countries have said they will not be in attendance .
serbia cited its interest in maintaining good relations with china for its absence , but other countries , including russia , are offering other reasons .
moscow has said scheduling difficulties - not political considerations - were keeping it away . but the scheduling conflicts veil russia 's political motive not to attend , according to sergei lukashevsky , the head of moscow 's sakharov museum . " that russia is not participating in the nobel peace prize 's award ceremony once again makes it clear that human rights do not play a prominent role in our foreign policy , " he said . " russia and china are members of the shanghai organization for cooperation and one of its goals is the fight against so-called extremism , " lukashevsky added .
" what that really means is that the countries support each other when it comes to fighting uncomfortable political situations . several countries in the middle east as well as afghanistan , pakistan and the philippines are also avoiding the ceremony because for economic and political reasons , according to rainer sollich , head of deutsche welle 's arabic department . " they are all states that have problems concerning human rights and operate under the understanding that they would n't want china at a ceremony honoring someone they view as an opponent of their regime . " china 's confucius prize china 's policy regarding the award ceremony and the still-imprisoned dissident liu has been clear .
referring to the nobel committee , chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman jiang yu said , " we will not change because of interference by a few clowns . " beijing awarded its own version of the nobel peace prize on thursday by giving the " confucius peace prize " to former taiwan vice-president lien chan .
like with liu 's nobel , chan was not in attendance to claim the award and his office said he was unaware of the prize . china has blocked access to the website of norwegian broadcaster nrk , the station said on thursday .
access to the bbc and cnn has also been affected ahead of friday 's ceremony , according to nrk . conspicuous absence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more protests in support of liu are scheduled for thursday friday will mark only the second time in the more than 100-year history of the prize that neither the laureate nor a representative will be able to come accept the award .
german journalist and pacifist carl von ossietzky , who was locked up in a nazi concentration camp , could not travel to oslo for his prize ceremony in 1936 . in addition to liu and ossietzky , myanmar 's aung san suu kyi was also barred from receiving her nobel peace prize in 1991 . liu has long been an outspoken opponent of chinese leadership in beijing and was at the forefront of the 1989 tiananmen square protests .
he was jailed in december 2009 for 11 years on subversion charges after co-authoring " charter 08 , " a manifesto that called for political reform in china . nobel officials said an empty chair would be used to represent liu 's absence . the 20 nations which will not attend the nobel ceremony are : afghanistan , china , colombia , cuba , egypt , iran , iraq , kazakhstan , morocco , pakistan , the philippines , russia , saudi arabia , serbia , sri lanka , sudan , tunisia , ukraine , venezuela and vietnam . authors : matthias von hein , jegor winogradow / sms -lrb- afp -rrb- editor : jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de climate -pipe- 10.12.2010 shadow of kyoto looms over final day of climate talks großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : limiting global temperature increases to 2 degrees is a key point at the talks a new treaty to combat climate change is not going to emerge in cancun , but the conference could see breakthroughs on forestry and finance , provided a dispute over kyoto does n't derail the last day of talks . accusations of " brinkmanship " are dominating climate talks as they enter their final day in cancun , mexico .
although no over-arching treaty to tackle climate change is up for grabs this year , struggles over principles risk progress on smaller achievements in the final hours of negotiations . japan 's hard line on the kyoto protocol remains the main concern for parties trying to bridge differences on a range of issues , including forestry protection , climate finance and accounting methodologies .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the japanese delegation has come in for criticism japan has refused to climb down from its refusal to consider extending kyoto when its first commitment period expires in 2012 , despite openings for compromises throughout the talks .
" we know that european union countries insist on a second commitment period , but we think this is n't a fair way of dealing with emissions globally , " said japanese negotiator akira yamada on thursday evening , describing this dispute as " ongoing " and " difficult . "
kyoto binds 37 wealthy nations to cut their greenhouse gas emissions , but japan does not want to be part of an agreement that does n't include binding rules for the world ’ s top two emitters , china and the us .
developing countries see kyoto as crucial for holding the industrialized world to account for a problem that is mostly of its making .
it seemed that a crisis over kyoto might be avoided earlier in the conference , following conciliatory language from china and india , but by the end of the week environmental groups were naming japan as the " worst " participant at the talks .
" they should show more flexibility and not pick a fight where it is not necessary , " said david turnbull , executive director of the climate action network , an umbrella group of environmental organizations .
anger at brazil yet harsh criticism has also been leveled at certain developing countries , among them brazil , amid fears that even lesser gains may slip through negotiators ' fingers in cancun .
brazil has been widely applauded for how it is tackling the destruction of the amazon .
indeed , last week it announced that its rate of deforestation dropped 14 percent over a 12-month period in 2010 , to reach its lowest level on record .
yet environmental groups accused brazil on thursday of rolling back gains in discussions on forestry protection measures because of its resistance to a system with international checks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : global deforestation rates have slowed over the last 10 years don lehr , a spokesperson for the eco-systems climate alliance , described talks on forestry on thursday as deadlocked .
" if we are not going to break down the sovereignty issues , we ’ ll never deal with climate change , " said rosalind reeve of global witness , an organisation that tracks resource exploitation , in reference to brazil 's position .
" you need a monitoring system that works nationally and internationally to build integrity .
there ’ s two sides to this equation ; there ’ s carbon and there ’ s safeguards . "
brazil has long been wary of efforts to secure international monitoring commitments in a global system to curb deforestation which would reward conservation in poor countries . despite the concerns of countries like brazil and papua new guinea , many have hoped to see cancun at least achieve an agreement on the scheme known as redd - reducing emissions from deforestation and degradation .
that is looking difficult on friday .
" we are not in favour of monitoring in an international process , " said a senior brazilian negotiator , suggesting that it would simply add excessive layers of bureaucracy that would " overcharge " domestic measures .
money matters though the situation could change in the final hours of talks , efforts to agree on a fund to help poor countries pay for their response to climate change also appear stalled . " saying , as has been said , ' well we won ’ t talk about a climate fund until we are clear about the rules ' then other people say ' well we won ’ t talk about the rules until a climate fund can exist ' - that kind of thing is just going to delay things too much and get us into silly posturing , " said jeremy hobbs , executive director of oxfam , which campaigns against poverty . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : progess at the talks has been painfully slow rich countries pledged in copenhagen last year to raise $ 30 billion -lrb- 22 billion euros -rrb- over the next few years to help developing countries already begin to meet the costs of climate change .
developing countries have expressed dismay that much of that pledged money appears to have been watered down through technical measures .
the fast start finance is supposed to help build trust in rich countries ’ pledges to deliver $ 100 billion dollars annually as of 2020 for a so-called green fund for developing countries , which in turn might make poorer countries amenable to adopting their own binding emissions cuts .
details of the fund - such as who will have control of it , where the money will come from and the conditions of its use - were supposed to be ironed out in cancun .
but these , too , appear to remain points of contest as the conference draws to a close .

the decision marks a profound change for germany , where compulsory service was re-introduced 50 years ago . senior officials in germany 's coalition government have agreed to suspend military conscription as of july 1 , 2011 .
defense minister karl theodor zu guttenberg 's proposal was accepted during closed-door talks in berlin on thursday evening .
the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- of chancellor angela merkel and its bavarian sister party the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- have both in principle approved abolishing the draft at party conferences in the past six weeks .
their other coalition partner , the pro-business free democrats , had included stopping conscription in their manifesto during last year 's general election .
sources taking part in the meeting said the next step would be for merkel 's cabinet to approve a draft bill that could be put to parliament ; this is expected to happen on december 15 .
troop reduction bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : defense minister guttenberg says the change will save money guttenberg 's plan would also see troop numbers reduced the current level of 250,000 soldiers to 185,000 .
of these , 170,000 would be professional soldiers , with volunteers making up the remainder .
with his reform , guttenberg hopes to save up to 8.3 billion euros .
however , the suspension of conscription could create some new problems ; for instance , the alternative community service offered to those who refuse military service would also be dropped .
social and welfare institutions fear that this could lead to a lack of personnel , as in the past they have relied heavily on youngsters who want to avoid military service .
the suspension also means that student numbers are likely to climb , posing problems for universities .
compulsory military service in germany lasts for six months and only applies to young men .
women are allowed to join the german army , the bundeswehr , either as professionals or volunteers , but are not obliged to do so .

liu took a prominent part in the protests there and was sentenced to two years in prison .
he was jailed last december for 11 years on subversion charges after he co-authored a document called charter 08 , which calls for political reform in china .
authorities have also cracked down on activists in the run-up to the ceremony and have prevented liu 's family and friends from attending .
empty chair the nobel committee chose to represent liu with an empty chair during the ceremony , calling this a symbol of the chinese policy to isolate and repress dissidents .
in a moving gesture , jagland placed the nobel diploma on the vacant seat .
it is the first time that a laureate under detention has not been formally represented since 1935 , when nazi germany stopped the pacifist carl von ossietzky from attending .
it is also the first time since then that the prize money of 1.13 million euros -lrb- $ 1.5 million -rrb- will not be handed out .

standing alongside serb prime minister mirko cvetkovic , he said that the eu " regrets the decision of serbia not to attend " the ceremony and added that serbia was " expected to embrace euro values and coordinate " with partners .
his words had a deep impact : while the foreign minister of serbia had originally defended the country 's decision not to attend the ceremony , serbia decided to send its ombudsman for human rights , sasa jankovic , to oslo .
serbia was the only eu candidate that originally decided to stay away from the ceremony honoring chinese human rights activist liu xiaobo .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the chinese government refused to let liu xiaobo attend the ceremony : his seat remained empty after the announcement of this year 's laureate , china had protested against the nobel committee 's decision and had urged other countries to boycott the ceremony .
serbia followed china 's call , as it relies on chinese government support for serbia 's opposition to an independent kosovo .
caught between a rock and a hard place but serbia is caught in a clash of interests , because it wants to join the 27-nation bloc of the european union .
fuele and other eu representatives clarified that serbia needed to comply with the joint decision of eu member states to send representatives to oslo in order not to lessen its chances of becoming a member state .
pedrag simic , political scientist at the university of belgrad says that despite serbia 's goal to join the european union , the country would still rely on four pillars of international politics - brussels , washington , moscow , and peking .
" a small country can only follow one superpower , " he said .
simic added that serbia 's attempts to be loyal to both china and the european union had to result in a dilemma such as the current one at some point .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de retail -pipe- 10.12.2010 toys r ' scarce in german stores großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lego hopes to fufill every child 's wish this christmas toy makers and retailers in germany could n't be happier : christmas shoppers appear to have a near insatiable appetite for toys .
products from traditional european toymakers like lego and playmobil are in high demand . german parents typically spend oodles on their kids for christmas .
but with the buoyant economy this season , they 're spending even more .
so much more , in fact , that retailers are scrambling to stock hot products , like playmobil 's " robo-gangster " toy car with figures or lego 's " stars wars " spaceship .
some manufacturers now warn they may no longer be able to fulfill everyone 's christmas wish .
" we know that from now until christmas demand will be growing daily -lrb- so -rrb- we ca n't guarantee 100 percent that every product will be available right up to december 24 , " said dirk engehausen , the lego deutschland managing director , in an interview with the german news station n-tv .
other german and european manufacturers have a similar holiday message to convey : they have n't run out of any products yet , but supplies are depleting fast and finding the one or other popular product a few days before christmas could prove to be a real treasure hunt .
hurry while the supply lasts " none of our products have completely sold out in germany but some stores have run out of select products , " playmobil spokeswoman judith schweinitz told deutsche welle .
" if you 're really determined to find these , you will but you might have to look around . "
while manufacturers had projected stronger holiday sales , few if any thought they would so strong .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : children in germany can expect plenty of gifts this year " we anticipated more demand this christmas but we 're surprised nevertheless by how huge the demand has been , " said heinrich huentelsmann , a ravensburger spokesperson .
" our tiptoi product , for instance , is still available but is becoming hard to find . "
that toy is one of the few that the german maker of games , puzzle and toys manufacturers in china .
more than 85 percent of its products are made in europe .
" we can react very quickly to demand in europe because most of our production is here , " huentelsmann told deutsche welle .
" we do n't have long logistics paths . "
ravensburger expects it will be able to deliver all products right up to christmas , he said .
but the company is n't making any guarantees .
anticipating greater demand this year , lego delivered 10 percent more products to retailers in advance of the holiday shopping season , according to company spokeswoman helena seppelfricke .
but with some products , like the company 's classic fire department set and " technik " series , in huge demand , she admits the company could easily have delivered more .
" same procedure " most european traditional toymakers including lego , which is based in denmark with additional production sites in hungary , the czech republic and mexico , show their new products at trade events early in the year and begin talks with its buyer at the same time .
however , their ability to boost production to meet unexpected christmas demand generally decreases the closer the holiday shopping season approaches .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : playmobil toys are as popular as ever " it 's pretty much the same procedure every year , " said steffen kahnt , deputy director of germany 's federal association of toy retailer -lrb- bvs -rrb- .
" retailers need to decide how many products to order and manufacturers how many to make .
but no one really knows what the demand will be , especially for new products .
so you hope you make the right call . "
stockpiling products is n't a viable option in the competitive toy sector , according to kahnt .
both manufacturers and retailers , he says , strive to have only as much stock as they see necessary to better control their operating costs .
that said , the industry may want to up production for the 2011 gift season , if the past 24 months are any indication .
record-breaking sales " more products were actually sold last year than the year before , " kahnt said .
" that surprised us .
but no one really thought that sales this year would be so good . "
the german toy industry association -lrb- dvsi -rrb- expects sales to increase six percent this to 2.52 billion euros , compared to 2.38 billion euros the year .
if that mark is reached , the holiday sales will be a huge factor .
retailers generate more than 40 percent of their annual revenue during the holiday shopping season .
for sure , numbers like these will make manufacturers and retailers happy .
their big challenge now is to deliver enough toys to make kids – and their parents – just as happy .

some , like the ones taking your entry ticket , are dressed as toy soldiers in keeping with the winter fairytale theme .
others wear army boots and the thick , riot-police-style boiler suits emblazoned with the large reflective " security " badge on the back . recent threats of " mumbai style attacks " have boosted the private security business in the past few weeks .

the number of people employed in the industry has doubled and sales , too , with revenue this year expected to reach 4.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 5.9 billion -rrb- . sven hallscheidt , spokesman for the german chambers of industry and commerce -lrb- dihk -rrb- , attributes the growing demand for security services by individuals and companies to a deep social change .
" it 's a development in society , " he said .
" on the one hand , it is influenced by reports in the media – we all know the reports about possible terrorist attacks – but also reports of attacks in public generally . " the security business is not only expanding but also becoming more complex .
company security is taking on an evermore important role , requiring a new breed of skilled workers – from guards and logistics planners to engineers – to create security systems . essential as the police and that role is extending beyond guarding buildings , cash logistics and the likes into areas such as critical infrastructure , making the private security industry as essential as the police . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the police no longer have the resources to protect essential infrastructure bodo pfalzgraf , chairman of the berlin police union , says the police force in germany simply does n't have the capacity to meet the country 's security requirements .
" first of all , we have in germany about as many police employees as there are employees in the private security industry , it 's 50 – 50 , " he told deutsche welle .
" in my opinion , the infrastructure of german security is inconceivable without private security personnel .
they guard nuclear power stations – they 're not just skin-headed , tattooed bouncers . " the growing importance of the private security sector , however , is also raising questions over jurisdiction , with some politicians warning against the dangers of over-privatizing security – particularly in airports . no special privileges but security manager ostmann says that even in places like christmas markets where private companies protect public spaces , the rules about what guards can and ca n't do are clear .
" the police always have the final say , " he said .
" we have the same rights as any other citizen , but we have no special powers .
and there are no difficulties over areas of competence .
i 'd say it is a very good partnership . " official agreements , like contracts , are organized on a state government level between the police and private security firms but there are still ambiguities , according to pfalzgraf . " a danger exists if there is no clear delineation between the two , and the government is not providing one at the moment , " he said .
" today , anyone can start a private security firm – they have to fulfil very few conditions .
and as of may 1 , 2011 , there 's going to be another opening of the market in europe – in other words , eastern european companies from poland , czech republic and lithuania will be able to start security services here .
that i think is a problem . " pfalzgraf believes it 's high time the state creates more rigorous industry standards to cope with the rising need for private security firms .
as for shoppers in berlin 's christmas markets , they 're fine with such distinctions – as long they feel safe . author : ben knight editor : john blau send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

standing alongside serb prime minister mirko cvetkovic , he said that the eu " regrets the decision of serbia not to attend " the ceremony and added that serbia was " expected to embrace euro values and coordinate " with partners .
his words had a deep impact : while the foreign minister of serbia had originally defended the country 's decision not to attend the ceremony , serbia decided to send its ombudsman for human rights , sasa jankovic , to oslo .
serbia was the only eu candidate that originally decided to stay away from the ceremony honoring chinese human rights activist liu xiaobo .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the chinese government refused to let liu xiaobo attend the ceremony : his seat remained empty after the announcement of this year 's laureate , china had protested against the nobel committee 's decision and had urged other countries to boycott the ceremony .
serbia followed china 's call , as it relies on chinese government support for serbia 's opposition to an independent kosovo .
caught between a rock and a hard place but serbia is caught in a clash of interests , because it wants to join the 27-nation bloc of the european union .
fuele and other eu representatives clarified that serbia needed to comply with the joint decision of eu member states to send representatives to oslo in order not to lessen its chances of becoming a member state .
pedrag simic , political scientist at the university of belgrad says that despite serbia 's goal to join the european union , the country would still rely on four pillars of international politics - brussels , washington , moscow , and peking .
" a small country can only follow one superpower , " he said .
simic added that serbia 's attempts to be loyal to both china and the european union had to result in a dilemma such as the current one at some point .

not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content .
australia offers support to wikileaks founder , operation payback begins should assange be extradited to the united states ?
why ?
he did not spy , he did not steal all the data that was passed along to him - nor is he a us citizen .
the us has been caught with the pants way down and of course , does n't like it one bit .
the us has sprung a " leaki " in its " weaki " and does n't like it one " bitty . "
as the saying goes … those who live in glass houses should not be throwing stones . - vera , germany i believe asange did bring out the true colors of individuals , opinion makers and governments in the present context of world politics .
everyone should admire his forthright exposure , however bitter it may be ; more so the americans who expect democracies and freedom to speech to flourish around the globe .
extradition and implicating him will only show the us in bad light . - mohan , india no , he should n't be extradited .
it 's a witch hunt to divert blame from the people who should be overseeing us security .
we 've paid good money for homeland security .
whose fault is it that thousands of secret documents were released ? - wayne , us definitely not .
supporting corruption and lack of common sense has been the m.o. for too long .
someone needs to wake up the people over here , wikileaks is a good start . - gene , us the us has only itself to blame for the leaks ... its a schoolyard bully that 's now having a tantrum and calling on its buddies to help it in a scrap because it knows it ca n't nuke everyone that does n't agree with it .
in australia the us is seen as a gutless mongrel that will do anything to get its own way especially concerning energy drilling . - tom , australia julian assange is a xxi century hero , in the sixties the fight against the empire was with " guerrillas , " today the fight is with internet .
and he 's going to win . - crstina , spain the us is paranoid about wikileaks .
a typical response of killing the messenger .
no extradition of julian assange .
the eu should promote transparency and be more open about foreign policies and clarity of diplomatic mores in language . - j. , the netherlands no way jose !
who cares about america ?
not me anyway : -rrb- i 'm so happy about wikileaks and anything that harms america .
they think an insult to us is immoral , and that they are somehow better than the rest of us .
they are just greedy , self-important and power-obsessed .
everything they touch is tarnished .
they are so last century .
bring on the rise of china and india !
how dare they think they can " spy " on other countries in the un ! - brian , ireland if any european country extradites julian assange to the united states , it will be for a political " crime . "
is europe the running dog of the us , or a group of sovereign nations dedicated to freedom of the press , freedom of the individual and people having the right to know what is going on ?
kevin rudd claims that the core problem is the failure by the us to protect its diplomatic communications .
i think the core problem is the behavior of the us .
the reason that wikileaks has not released the diplomatic communications of other countries -lrb- eg : germany , australia -rrb- is that they are better behaved and do not goose-step on the world stage , trying to take over the world . - charles , australia i believe that having all that " secret " info available for everybody to learn was not the " status quo " however it was disclosed and it is done .
the fellow in jail in the united kingdom is actually a journalist devoted to inform the public .
if he ever is extradited to the us he can claim " freedom of expression . "
now , in terms of those " ladies " claiming sex crimes , that is a bit doubtful .
they have waited until now , come on !
i believe that it was a politically manipulated act to get him behind bars .
and if those allegedly " crimes " were committed in sweden , should n't he then be extradited to that country ? - elena , us no .
he 's a hero who has struck a powerful blow for freedom !
he should be given the medal of freedom award ! - michael , us no , he should not be extradited to the us ; he has not been charged with any us crime .
whatever one thinks about wikileaks , mr. assange is taking a principled stand against the establishment for personal convictions and at great risk to himself .
if the political solution is to restrict freedom of the internet it will amplify assange 's stance : that many elected politicians are duplicitous control freaks who need their over-used and abused powers curtailed .
he deserves respect , support and applause for his courage . - a. , japan i believe that assange is being targeted for what he did .
if he 's found guilty of real sexual misconduct , i believe he should be punished , but as far as the internet crap , i believe he 'll prevail .
he 'll probably either wimp out for future stuff , or he 'll feel more emboldened .
i 'd like to see the hackers messing with mastercard put to be punished though .
it causes too many undeserving people a lot of pain . - joe , us i am completely baffled by the case .
mr. assange has been arrested in a country -lrb- uk -rrb- which belongs to the interpol group of countries so , according to the rules , he might be obviously extradited to sweden - country which relies on " the rules " within the interpol group .
at the same time , mr. assange has been accused of allegedly having broken the law of another country -lrb- usa -rrb- which is also in the interpol group .
in addition , his own country -lrb- australia -rrb- has now given a hint of standing up for him by offering him legal help , not ruling out his extradition to australia -lrb- being also the interpol member . -rrb-
in addition , there is the international court of justice in the hague -lrb- operating within the uno . -rrb-
so international law , respective rules of law of the countries mentioned , international organizations -lrb- interpol , uno , eu -rrb- are all to be bundled in this case which is too much intricate to the ' untrained eye ' in this " legal maze .

that doesn ’ t hold true for some other countries . the charge that us foreign policy is hypocritical is all but new , but the wikileaks data release has added some additional fuel to it .
just a few days ago , libya 's leader muammar gaddafi lauded the organization for exposing us " hypocrisy " through its diplomacy conducted behind closed doors , in comments published via the state news agency jana .
according to gaddafi , the leaked cables " proved that america is not what it has led allies and friends to believe it to be " and that " us relations with its allies are hypocritical . "
while there is certainly an expected discrepancy in the tone and style of these confidential reports and the language us diplomats use in public , the cables actually reveal that the us has been largely consistent with the overall messages and themes it conveys to its international partners in private and in public , argue scholars interviewed by deutsche welle . " there 's nothing in these cables that is different from what we actually know about us foreign policy without these cables , " says thomas risse , director of the center for transnational relations , foreign and security policy at the free university of berlin .
" the whole approach by these people from wikileaks seems to be that there is a public side to us foreign policy and then there is this secret side and that there is some sort conspiracy involved in all this , " he says .
" and i do n't see a huge mismatch actually between what the us says in public and what it does . "
clear goals one of the dominant topics in these cables are us security interests and the fact that washington considers transnational terrorism a major threat , adds risse : " that is exactly what barack obama and hillary clinton would say every day . "
the same is true for other top issues such as the iranian nuclear program , the spread of nuclear and ballistic missiles and the stabilization of afghanistan , says dan reiter , a professor of international relations at emory university in atlanta : " at the broadest level i think the cables reveal that the goals the us is engaging in private are essentially similar to the goals that it is espousing in public . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : saudi king abdullah urged the president barack obama to take action against iran asked whether the insights gained from reading the frank assessments of diplomats engaged in shaping and carrying out us foreign policy will alter their view of the us role or status in the world , risse and reiter both answer with a resounding no . " the us is not an empire , there are very clear limits to us influence in the world , " says risse .
" of course the us is a superpower .
it has interests in all corners of the world , it does try to influence other governments , but that 's ok .
there 's nothing that would get me worked up about this at all . "
no puppet master the cables are " not terribly surprising , " notes reiter .
" one does n't get an image of the united states as this all-powerful puppet master trying to pull the strings of various governments around the world to serve its corporate interests .
that 's an image which does not emerge . "
instead , the cables paint a picture of the us acting as one would expect a major power to do so , adds reiter .
" i do n't think that anything we see is terribly different from the way most states have conducted their foreign policy in the modern era . "
what 's more surprising to the analysts is the behavior of arab countries that becomes evident in the cables .
while the opposition of arab states to iran 's nuclear program has been known in foreign policy circles for some time , the contrast between confidential assessments made in private and public statements is particularly stark . double talk " the level of hypocrisy that comes out of these cables is much higher for instance in the middle east , " says risse .
" it 's very clear from these cables that most arab states feel really threatened by iranian nuclear power , however they would never say that in public .
in fact , they say the opposite in public . "
according to the cables , king abdullah of saudi arabia and king hamed ibn isa khalifa of bahrain are among arab leaders who pressed the us to attack iran .
king abdullah repeatedly exhorted the united states to " cut off the head of the snake " and take military action against tehran 's nuclear facilities .
open questions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : to evaluate the cables properly , scholars need more information about the documents in contrast to that , conclude the experts , the general outlines of us foreign policy are pretty much in sync with what the wikileaks documents have revealed so far and they have n't unearthed anything entirely unexpected .
nevertheless , argues risse , the document dump still poses a serious problem : " if you look at these cables from the perspective of an academic or historian , the real big question is what is the sample , ? " says risse . " is this a random selection , is this a selection that is representative of the whole or what exactly is it .
we have absolutely no way to judge this . "
risse notes , that even if all 250,000 cables are published in the end , it is still not clear how large a sample this is , how relevant the cables are or were in the decision-making processes for us officials and what the criteria were to publish them .
without those answers , many of which could be provided by wikileaks , a thorough assessment of the cables and its content wo n't be possible . author : michael knigge editor : rob mudge send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in its one-hundred-year history , this is the first time that the prize is awarded to a chinese citizen .
yet , the laureate , his family members , and even close friends are incarcerated in their own country .
no one can come to receive the award . the scottish pen has produced a " liu xiaobo chair " , which has been sent over to oslo .
now it stands in the city hall .
this empty chair is a reminder that its owner , who should enjoy the highest international honor today , is absent from the ceremony , banquet and concert , which are devoted to him . the host country 's king , the queen , european royal families , foreign ambassadors and representatives , as well as guests from overseas gather in the bright hall decorated with flowers and make a toast to xiaobo .
but many of us are still melancholy , and we ask , where is liu xiaobo and his beloved liu xia ?
let us travel through time and space and visit liu xia first . we are in haidian district , beijing , yuyuantan south road number 9 .
from a distance one can see the white building where the lius live .
the police cars are parked in front of the house ; several policemen parade around .
journalists from far and near are cordoned off some hundred meters away .
no one is allowed to get into the forbidden zone . thin , with a shaven head -lrb- or short-cropped hair -rrb- , liu xia is sitting alone in the empty home .
rinse the ashtray the coffee table wiped take the glass cups boil two cups of longjing or oolong aside the table you sit looking at the cup in front of the empty seat stare at the cup , listen is there the move of key in the hole ...
the cup in the hand , you take a sip lifted the cup to the sun cup and your fingers penetrated by the sun palm was stained by the transparent green delicate a hint of panic is there too the cup on the opposite site you know will be empty for a long time it takes long till the man opens your door -lrb- from liu ’ s poem " sunshine and cups - to my little finger , who drinks tea every day " -rrb- liu xia may wait for a long time , maybe another ten years .
now we visit xiaobo in jinzhou prison in the small chinese town nanshan in liaoning province .
entering the gate , we see several scattered buildings .
surprisingly , we see a huge office wall on which is written boldly ' 1984 ' .
a few months ago , liu xia , accompanied by the stainless steel mouse liu di , wang jinbo , mo zhixu and wang zhongxia , came here for a visit .
they were amazed at orwell ’ s rebirth in a chinese prison . snickering , they took pictures in front of the " 1984 wall " .
several officers rushed to them and took them into custody .
separately , they were interrogated for hours . we enter xiaobo ’ s cell now .
he shares with five other prisoners a 3 by 4 meter space .
his head is bald , shaved like an ordinary criminal .
his body is swollen by the padded jacket and trousers .
scarf , hat and gloves are a must in the cell because the concrete floor of the prison is cold .
the small window beneath the high ceiling is always open .
in winter , the indoor temperature is higher than outdoors ; it is a few degrees above zero .
the odor of the open toilet bucket in the corner is neutralized by the cold air , but one can not ignore the stench of the daily waste of several men .
the smell not only fills the room , it penetrates through clothes , and into the pores of the skin . this is the first winter that xiaobo spends in a prison in northern china .
he will have to adjust himself to the circumstances .
he does not know whether he will have frostbite .
to sit and lie on the concrete floors all year round may cause neck and spine pain and lead to kidney problems .
his stomach disease has given him a hard time since his imprisonment .
xiaobo has exited his cell today , but he does not want to show it to others otherwise his cell-mates might become cynical and angry .
sitting there , his thoughts fly to oslo .
he has had constant dreams about it .
who will be there at the ceremony ?
who will receive the prize for me ?
it could not be liu xia .
she has not sent any sign of life for a while .
my acceptance speech is long written in my head , but who can read it out aloud for me ?
does the king wear a majestic tuxedo , and the queen her crown at the banquet ?
will the distinguished guests think of the dead in tiananmen square and the tiananmen mothers and make a toast ?
sitting in the dungeon , xiaobo does not know that the announcement of his award induced a tsunami in zhongnanhai , and the rulers had a mild concussion , followed by delusions : they believe that their enemies are all over the world , so the grip on the naughty writers and the guy who held the crab dinner party must be tightened .
they must not go outside the country , otherwise they could endanger national security .
liu xiaobo ’ s dinner on december 10 , 2010 may look like this : boiled vegetables with sand , and a few pieces of fat meat as a special treat .
he might have an extra piece of steamed bread , and his rice bowl could also be refilled today .
in short , it is a privileged meal that will long be remembered , because it is a meal that will leave the stomach truly filled .
after all , he is the first chinese to win the nobel peace prize .

in its one-hundred-year history , this is the first time that the prize is awarded to a chinese citizen .
yet , the laureate , his family members , and even close friends are incarcerated in their own country .
no one can come to receive the award . the scottish pen has produced a " liu xiaobo chair " , which has been sent over to oslo .
now it stands in the city hall .
this empty chair is a reminder that its owner , who should enjoy the highest international honor today , is absent from the ceremony , banquet and concert , which are devoted to him . the host country 's king , the queen , european royal families , foreign ambassadors and representatives , as well as guests from overseas gather in the bright hall decorated with flowers and make a toast to xiaobo .
but many of us are still melancholy , and we ask , where is liu xiaobo and his beloved liu xia ?
let us travel through time and space and visit liu xia first . we are in haidian district , beijing , yuyuantan south road number 9 .
from a distance one can see the white building where the lius live .
the police cars are parked in front of the house ; several policemen parade around .
journalists from far and near are cordoned off some hundred meters away .
no one is allowed to get into the forbidden zone . thin , with a shaven head -lrb- or short-cropped hair -rrb- , liu xia is sitting alone in the empty home .
rinse the ashtray the coffee table wiped take the glass cups boil two cups of longjing or oolong aside the table you sit looking at the cup in front of the empty seat stare at the cup , listen is there the move of key in the hole ...
the cup in the hand , you take a sip lifted the cup to the sun cup and your fingers penetrated by the sun palm was stained by the transparent green delicate a hint of panic is there too the cup on the opposite site you know will be empty for a long time it takes long till the man opens your door -lrb- from liu ’ s poem " sunshine and cups - to my little finger , who drinks tea every day " -rrb- liu xia may wait for a long time , maybe another ten years .
now we visit xiaobo in jinzhou prison in the small chinese town nanshan in liaoning province .
entering the gate , we see several scattered buildings .
surprisingly , we see a huge office wall on which is written boldly ' 1984 ' .
a few months ago , liu xia , accompanied by the stainless steel mouse liu di , wang jinbo , mo zhixu and wang zhongxia , came here for a visit .
they were amazed at orwell ’ s rebirth in a chinese prison . snickering , they took pictures in front of the " 1984 wall " .

meanwhile , russia 's prime minister accuses the us of hypocrisy over the affair . the un commissioner for human rights navi pillay expressed dismay over the withdrawal of financial and internet services to the controversial wikileaks website .
pillay said that measures taken by companies - which wikileaks ' supporters claim are due to pressure from foreign governments - could represent an infringement of the right to freedom of expression . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pillay said courts should decide on the balance between security and freedom " i 'm concerned about reports of pressure exerted on private companies , including banks , credit card companies , and internet service providers to close down credit lines for donations to wikileaks as well as to stop hosting the website or its mother sites , " navi pillay told a news conference on thursday .
" they could be interpreted as an attempt to censor the publication of information , thus potentially violating wikileaks ' right to freedom of expression . "
payments suspended , account closed wikileaks angered the us and other governments with the release in november of 250,000 confidential diplomatic cables , with washington saying the information could put american lives in danger .
credit card firms mastercard and visa later suspended payments made to wikileaks , while the swiss post office shut down a bank account opened by wikileaks founder julian assange .
pillay said the case " raises complex human rights questions about balancing freedom of information and the need to protect national security or public order . "
" if wikileaks has committed any recognizable illegal acts then this should be handled through the legal system and not through pressure and intimidation including on third parties , " said pillay a former un war crimes judge .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : assange was arrested in london , and awaits a hearing pillay noted that such questions were not related to charges against assange for crimes including rape in sweden .
supporters of assange claim that the charges against him have been manufactured as part of a bid to halt the website 's activities , along with the pressure on firms to cut wikileaks ' income stream .
' pot calls kettle black , ' putin russian prime minister vladimir putin said that assange 's arrest in britain , for extradition , was " undemocratic " and accused the us of " hypocrisy " for attacking russia 's record on democracy .
" if we are talking about democracy , it should be complete .
why was mr. assange hidden in jail ?
is that democracy ?
as we say in the village , the pot is calling the kettle black , " putin told reporters .
" i want to send the ball back to our american colleagues . "
assange is currently in custody in britain awaiting a hearing over his extradition after a warrant was issued by sweden .
meanwhile , wikileaks supporters on thursday vowed to step up cyber-attacks on companies that have taken action against wikileaks .

each december in oslo , the arguments about whether the right recipient was chosen can be just as fierce as the threats these winners often face because of their work .
individuals who take a stand for peace and reconciliation in difficult conflict situations tend to have more enemies than friends .
by awarding the detained chinese professor of literature and democracy activist , liu xiabo , this year 's peace prize in oslo on october 8 , the nobel committee made an apt comment on the changing global balance of power .
this is how its decision should be interpreted .
a rising power like china needs to respect human and civil rights for the benefit of all mankind - that was the message from oslo .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : adrienne woltersdorf , the head of deutsche welle 's chinese service , is in oslo it is a slap in the chinese authorities ' face .
they have reacted accordingly and suppressed any domestic discourse about the so eagerly awaited - and now so despised - first chinese nobel laureate in history .
in addition , many activists , including liu 's wife liu xia , were preemptively intimidated or simply put under house arrest .
the regime 's harsh reactions show that the norwegian jury really touched a nerve in beijing .
but it is ridiculous that those loyal to the regime allege that the nobel committee intended to provocatively and maliciously challenge china 's rise .
the truth , in fact , is the precise opposite .
for quite some time , even veteran cadres of the mao era have been calling for more freedom of thought in china .
just recently , a group of influential former cadres reiterated this demand in a letter to the new party leadership .
a rapidly changing society , they argued , needs freedom of debate and opportunity for criticism in order to make wise decisions for the future .
such voices will be encouraged by the nobel peace prize , and only the chinese can decide how china should develop .
in this sense , the peace prize for liu xiaobo is also a unique chance for the badly divided and marginalized chinese democracy movement .
oslo could thus become the starting point for a new movement .
but before this happens , democracy activists inside and outside of china will have to prove that they can restrain their somtimes excessive egos , and dedicate themselves to the collective cause .
the powers-that-be in beijing will do everything they can to continue to marginalize the proponents of democracy .
they have given sufficient proof during the past weeks that they are perfectly capable of doing this .
but the chinese civil rights activists now have an internationally recognized leader .
they have a prudent manifesto - liu xiaobo 's " charter ' 08 " document - they have a sympathetic international audience , and they have the internet ; all that they 're missing is a single movement to unite them .

the capital is also easily the arty-fartiest place in the country .
coincidence ?
dw 's ben knight does n't think so . most of my friends are losers .
i mean that in a good way , obviously .
they are all talented and creative and sometimes even a bit inspired , but they are also , each and every last one of them , work-shy fops .
obviously i am as well : it takes one to know one , as we used to say in primary school .
there 's a great sequence in the movie " trainspotting " where junkie hero renton explains the complex art of staying on the dole .
it entails reverse-psychology tricks like going to a job interview and appearing psychotically eager to work in a leisure center .
the film shows that such efforts require invention , nerve , subtlety , selfishness , discipline and some drugs - the exact elements of a successful artistic career .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an artist at work there is probably no clearer illustration of one of the deeper truths of life in a western european social democracy : the attributes of an artist are exactly the same as the ones you need to successfully maintain your unemployment .
this is heightened in berlin , where it takes the sacrifice of an artist to truly perfect the art of not earning your living .
creative industries there are , they say , some broad similarities between my hometown , manchester , and berlin .
both were throbbing industrial powerhouses in the 19th century , lost their luster and declined in the late 20th century , only to become trendy pop cultural centers in the last 20 years - manchester not so much anymore , but you get the general idea .
both cities have also become famous for hanging their new economic hopes on the " creative industries . "
this very spongy term refers to anything from actor to fashion designer , to independent shopkeeper , to web designer , and includes all the attendant skill sets , cameramen , lighting technicians , office managers etc .

the capital is also easily the arty-fartiest place in the country .
coincidence ?
dw 's ben knight does n't think so . most of my friends are losers .
i mean that in a good way , obviously .
they are all talented and creative and sometimes even a bit inspired , but they are also , each and every last one of them , work-shy fops .
obviously i am as well : it takes one to know one , as we used to say in primary school .
there 's a great sequence in the movie " trainspotting " where junkie hero renton explains the complex art of staying on the dole .
it entails reverse-psychology tricks like going to a job interview and appearing psychotically eager to work in a leisure center .
the film shows that such efforts require invention , nerve , subtlety , selfishness , discipline and some drugs - the exact elements of a successful artistic career .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an artist at work there is probably no clearer illustration of one of the deeper truths of life in a western european social democracy : the attributes of an artist are exactly the same as the ones you need to successfully maintain your unemployment .
this is heightened in berlin , where it takes the sacrifice of an artist to truly perfect the art of not earning your living .
creative industries there are , they say , some broad similarities between my hometown , manchester , and berlin .
both were throbbing industrial powerhouses in the 19th century , lost their luster and declined in the late 20th century , only to become trendy pop cultural centers in the last 20 years - manchester not so much anymore , but you get the general idea .
both cities have also become famous for hanging their new economic hopes on the " creative industries . "
this very spongy term refers to anything from actor to fashion designer , to independent shopkeeper , to web designer , and includes all the attendant skill sets , cameramen , lighting technicians , office managers etc .
the point is you do n't make anything - you delight , you entertain , you disseminate knowledge and information , or you sing cabaret songs naked in a disused warehouse in front of an audience of twelve .
by capitalizing on the cache and the large student population , the two cities deliberately encouraged a whole class of freelance migrants engaged in some kind of creative endeavor in an attempt to re-invent the city 's economy .
but the similarity with manchester ends when it comes to the social security system .
in berlin , many creative types live - at least partially - on the standard long-term unemployment benefit called hartz iv .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : focus : wikileaks disclosures wikileaks exposes shell 's infiltration of nigeria 's government wikileaks release could lead to shift from transparency to secrecy opinion : wikileaks is a test of us commitment to free press opinion : wikileaks ' latest release is a diplomatic waterloo international relations -pipe- 10.12.2010 wikileaks cables show consistent us foreign policy , say experts großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there 's no huge clash between public and private goals of the us state department contrary to oft-stated claims , the wikileaks cables show no huge credibility gap between official us policies and what diplomats write in confidential cables , say experts .
that doesn ’ t hold true for some other countries . the charge that us foreign policy is hypocritical is all but new , but the wikileaks data release has added some additional fuel to it .
just a few days ago , libya 's leader muammar gaddafi lauded the organization for exposing us " hypocrisy " through its diplomacy conducted behind closed doors , in comments published via the state news agency jana .
according to gaddafi , the leaked cables " proved that america is not what it has led allies and friends to believe it to be " and that " us relations with its allies are hypocritical . "
while there is certainly an expected discrepancy in the tone and style of these confidential reports and the language us diplomats use in public , the cables actually reveal that the us has been largely consistent with the overall messages and themes it conveys to its international partners in private and in public , argue scholars interviewed by deutsche welle . " there 's nothing in these cables that is different from what we actually know about us foreign policy without these cables , " says thomas risse , director of the center for transnational relations , foreign and security policy at the free university of berlin .
" the whole approach by these people from wikileaks seems to be that there is a public side to us foreign policy and then there is this secret side and that there is some sort conspiracy involved in all this , " he says .
" and i do n't see a huge mismatch actually between what the us says in public and what it does . "
clear goals one of the dominant topics in these cables are us security interests and the fact that washington considers transnational terrorism a major threat , adds risse : " that is exactly what barack obama and hillary clinton would say every day . "
the same is true for other top issues such as the iranian nuclear program , the spread of nuclear and ballistic missiles and the stabilization of afghanistan , says dan reiter , a professor of international relations at emory university in atlanta : " at the broadest level i think the cables reveal that the goals the us is engaging in private are essentially similar to the goals that it is espousing in public . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : saudi king abdullah urged the president barack obama to take action against iran asked whether the insights gained from reading the frank assessments of diplomats engaged in shaping and carrying out us foreign policy will alter their view of the us role or status in the world , risse and reiter both answer with a resounding no . " the us is not an empire , there are very clear limits to us influence in the world , " says risse .
" of course the us is a superpower .
it has interests in all corners of the world , it does try to influence other governments , but that 's ok .
there 's nothing that would get me worked up about this at all . "
no puppet master the cables are " not terribly surprising , " notes reiter .
" one does n't get an image of the united states as this all-powerful puppet master trying to pull the strings of various governments around the world to serve its corporate interests .
that 's an image which does not emerge . "
instead , the cables paint a picture of the us acting as one would expect a major power to do so , adds reiter .
" i do n't think that anything we see is terribly different from the way most states have conducted their foreign policy in the modern era . "
what 's more surprising to the analysts is the behavior of arab countries that becomes evident in the cables .
while the opposition of arab states to iran 's nuclear program has been known in foreign policy circles for some time , the contrast between confidential assessments made in private and public statements is particularly stark . double talk " the level of hypocrisy that comes out of these cables is much higher for instance in the middle east , " says risse .
" it 's very clear from these cables that most arab states feel really threatened by iranian nuclear power , however they would never say that in public .
in fact , they say the opposite in public . "
according to the cables , king abdullah of saudi arabia and king hamed ibn isa khalifa of bahrain are among arab leaders who pressed the us to attack iran .
king abdullah repeatedly exhorted the united states to " cut off the head of the snake " and take military action against tehran 's nuclear facilities .
open questions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : to evaluate the cables properly , scholars need more information about the documents in contrast to that , conclude the experts , the general outlines of us foreign policy are pretty much in sync with what the wikileaks documents have revealed so far and they have n't unearthed anything entirely unexpected .
nevertheless , argues risse , the document dump still poses a serious problem : " if you look at these cables from the perspective of an academic or historian , the real big question is what is the sample , ? " says risse . " is this a random selection , is this a selection that is representative of the whole or what exactly is it .
we have absolutely no way to judge this . "
risse notes , that even if all 250,000 cables are published in the end , it is still not clear how large a sample this is , how relevant the cables are or were in the decision-making processes for us officials and what the criteria were to publish them .
without those answers , many of which could be provided by wikileaks , a thorough assessment of the cables and its content wo n't be possible . author : michael knigge editor : rob mudge send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de retail -pipe- 10.12.2010 toys r ' scarce in german stores großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lego hopes to fufill every child 's wish this christmas toy makers and retailers in germany could n't be happier : christmas shoppers appear to have a near insatiable appetite for toys .
products from traditional european toymakers like lego and playmobil are in high demand . german parents typically spend oodles on their kids for christmas .
but with the buoyant economy this season , they 're spending even more .
so much more , in fact , that retailers are scrambling to stock hot products , like playmobil 's " robo-gangster " toy car with figures or lego 's " stars wars " spaceship .
some manufacturers now warn they may no longer be able to fulfill everyone 's christmas wish .
" we know that from now until christmas demand will be growing daily -lrb- so -rrb- we ca n't guarantee 100 percent that every product will be available right up to december 24 , " said dirk engehausen , the lego deutschland managing director , in an interview with the german news station n-tv .
other german and european manufacturers have a similar holiday message to convey : they have n't run out of any products yet , but supplies are depleting fast and finding the one or other popular product a few days before christmas could prove to be a real treasure hunt .
hurry while the supply lasts " none of our products have completely sold out in germany but some stores have run out of select products , " playmobil spokeswoman judith schweinitz told deutsche welle .
" if you 're really determined to find these , you will but you might have to look around . "
while manufacturers had projected stronger holiday sales , few if any thought they would so strong .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : children in germany can expect plenty of gifts this year " we anticipated more demand this christmas but we 're surprised nevertheless by how huge the demand has been , " said heinrich huentelsmann , a ravensburger spokesperson .
" our tiptoi product , for instance , is still available but is becoming hard to find . "
that toy is one of the few that the german maker of games , puzzle and toys manufacturers in china .
more than 85 percent of its products are made in europe .
" we can react very quickly to demand in europe because most of our production is here , " huentelsmann told deutsche welle .
" we do n't have long logistics paths . "
ravensburger expects it will be able to deliver all products right up to christmas , he said .
but the company is n't making any guarantees .
anticipating greater demand this year , lego delivered 10 percent more products to retailers in advance of the holiday shopping season , according to company spokeswoman helena seppelfricke .
but with some products , like the company 's classic fire department set and " technik " series , in huge demand , she admits the company could easily have delivered more .
" same procedure " most european traditional toymakers including lego , which is based in denmark with additional production sites in hungary , the czech republic and mexico , show their new products at trade events early in the year and begin talks with its buyer at the same time .
however , their ability to boost production to meet unexpected christmas demand generally decreases the closer the holiday shopping season approaches .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : playmobil toys are as popular as ever " it 's pretty much the same procedure every year , " said steffen kahnt , deputy director of germany 's federal association of toy retailer -lrb- bvs -rrb- .
" retailers need to decide how many products to order and manufacturers how many to make .
but no one really knows what the demand will be , especially for new products .
so you hope you make the right call . "
stockpiling products is n't a viable option in the competitive toy sector , according to kahnt .
both manufacturers and retailers , he says , strive to have only as much stock as they see necessary to better control their operating costs .
that said , the industry may want to up production for the 2011 gift season , if the past 24 months are any indication .
record-breaking sales " more products were actually sold last year than the year before , " kahnt said .
" that surprised us .
but no one really thought that sales this year would be so good . "
the german toy industry association -lrb- dvsi -rrb- expects sales to increase six percent this to 2.52 billion euros , compared to 2.38 billion euros the year .
if that mark is reached , the holiday sales will be a huge factor .
retailers generate more than 40 percent of their annual revenue during the holiday shopping season .
for sure , numbers like these will make manufacturers and retailers happy .
their big challenge now is to deliver enough toys to make kids – and their parents – just as happy .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de internet -pipe- 10.12.2010 dutch police arrest hacker over alleged cyber attacks großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hackers mostly remain undiscovered hackers have been waging cyber war on the websites of opponents of wikileaks , saying they 're fighting for a " free and open " internet .
dutch police have arrested a teenager accused of taking part in the attacks . dutch authorities on friday said police in the netherlands arrested a 16-year-old who has admitted to attacking websites belonging to wikileaks opponents .
a spokesman for the national prosecutor 's office said the teenager had " admitted launching attacks on visa and mastercard sites . "
a statement said he was probably " part of a larger group of hackers . "
hackers unite hackers from around the world have stepped up cyber attacks following the arrest of wikileaks boss julian assange .
assange is wanted by sweden in connection with sexual misconduct charges the online attacks have mainly targeted companies that have deprived wikileaks of their services , including the websites of the online payment service paypal , and the credit card giants visa and mastercard , which had stopped processing donations for wikileaks .
also targeted were amazon.com , which had banished wikileaks from using its rented servers , a swiss bank and the website of the swedish prosecutor who had issued an arrest warrant for assange on charges of sexual misconduct .
the group of hackers , which calls itself " anonymous , " says it wants to keep the internet open and free .
wikileaks has distanced itself from the cyber attacks , but said they reflected public opinion .
in a statement , the organization said it had no contact with anonymous and had not received prior notice of any of the group 's actions .
assange : " charges fabricated " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : julian assange says he is innocent of the charges assange is currently in a british jail after handing himself in to police on tuesday . police have moved the wikileaks ' chief from the main part of wandsworth prison to an isolation unit , his lawyer said friday . " the prison authorities are doing it for his own safety , presumably , " jennifer robinson , one of assange 's legal team told the afp news agency . assange has been refused the use of his own laptop but will be given a prison computer with limited internet access , the guardian newspaper reported friday .
assange says the swedish sexual misconduct charges are a fabrication intended to stop his organization from continuing to publish confidential documents .
wikileaks is facing international condemnation for its publication of confidential material , often concerning diplomatic relations between countries .
some of the documents have caused embarrassment to the nations concerned .
assange is due to appear in a london court for a second time on tuesday , when prosecutors want to question him about allegations of rape and sexual molestation made by two women .

you have to pay a one-euro entrance fee , and while the mulled wine , roasted almonds and arts-and-craft knick-knacks are much the same as in any other christmas market , you are treated to a live ballet show , based on a russian fairytale , to go with your sense of exclusivity .
you also see more security guards .
some , like the ones taking your entry ticket , are dressed as toy soldiers in keeping with the winter fairytale theme .
others wear army boots and the thick , riot-police-style boiler suits emblazoned with the large reflective " security " badge on the back . recent threats of " mumbai style attacks " have boosted the private security business in the past few weeks .
thomas ostmann , berlin manager of german security company agsus , noticed a rise in demand immediately . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : recent terrorist threats in berlin have heightened demand for security firms " yes , we 've definitely noticed that , " he told deutsche welle .
" ahead of the christmas markets , we felt a rise in anxiety among the stand owners .
it is going down a little now , but there is significantly more manpower and security on the markets . "
security boom the added holiday season demand has come on top of a general expansion in the security industry over the past decade .
germany currently has 4,000 security companies , up 1,000 over a decade ago .
the number of people employed in the industry has doubled and sales , too , with revenue this year expected to reach 4.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 5.9 billion -rrb- . sven hallscheidt , spokesman for the german chambers of industry and commerce -lrb- dihk -rrb- , attributes the growing demand for security services by individuals and companies to a deep social change .
" it 's a development in society , " he said .
" on the one hand , it is influenced by reports in the media – we all know the reports about possible terrorist attacks – but also reports of attacks in public generally . " the security business is not only expanding but also becoming more complex .
company security is taking on an evermore important role , requiring a new breed of skilled workers – from guards and logistics planners to engineers – to create security systems . essential as the police and that role is extending beyond guarding buildings , cash logistics and the likes into areas such as critical infrastructure , making the private security industry as essential as the police . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the police no longer have the resources to protect essential infrastructure bodo pfalzgraf , chairman of the berlin police union , says the police force in germany simply does n't have the capacity to meet the country 's security requirements .
" first of all , we have in germany about as many police employees as there are employees in the private security industry , it 's 50 – 50 , " he told deutsche welle .
" in my opinion , the infrastructure of german security is inconceivable without private security personnel .
they guard nuclear power stations – they 're not just skin-headed , tattooed bouncers . " the growing importance of the private security sector , however , is also raising questions over jurisdiction , with some politicians warning against the dangers of over-privatizing security – particularly in airports . no special privileges but security manager ostmann says that even in places like christmas markets where private companies protect public spaces , the rules about what guards can and ca n't do are clear .
" the police always have the final say , " he said .
" we have the same rights as any other citizen , but we have no special powers .
and there are no difficulties over areas of competence .
i 'd say it is a very good partnership . " official agreements , like contracts , are organized on a state government level between the police and private security firms but there are still ambiguities , according to pfalzgraf . " a danger exists if there is no clear delineation between the two , and the government is not providing one at the moment , " he said .
" today , anyone can start a private security firm – they have to fulfil very few conditions .
and as of may 1 , 2011 , there 's going to be another opening of the market in europe – in other words , eastern european companies from poland , czech republic and lithuania will be able to start security services here .
that i think is a problem . " pfalzgraf believes it 's high time the state creates more rigorous industry standards to cope with the rising need for private security firms .
as for shoppers in berlin 's christmas markets , they 're fine with such distinctions – as long they feel safe . author : ben knight editor : john blau send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in its one-hundred-year history , this is the first time that the prize is awarded to a chinese citizen .
yet , the laureate , his family members , and even close friends are incarcerated in their own country .
no one can come to receive the award . the scottish pen has produced a " liu xiaobo chair " , which has been sent over to oslo .
now it stands in the city hall .
this empty chair is a reminder that its owner , who should enjoy the highest international honor today , is absent from the ceremony , banquet and concert , which are devoted to him . the host country 's king , the queen , european royal families , foreign ambassadors and representatives , as well as guests from overseas gather in the bright hall decorated with flowers and make a toast to xiaobo .
but many of us are still melancholy , and we ask , where is liu xiaobo and his beloved liu xia ?
let us travel through time and space and visit liu xia first . we are in haidian district , beijing , yuyuantan south road number 9 .
from a distance one can see the white building where the lius live .
the police cars are parked in front of the house ; several policemen parade around .
journalists from far and near are cordoned off some hundred meters away .
no one is allowed to get into the forbidden zone . thin , with a shaven head -lrb- or short-cropped hair -rrb- , liu xia is sitting alone in the empty home .
rinse the ashtray the coffee table wiped take the glass cups boil two cups of longjing or oolong aside the table you sit looking at the cup in front of the empty seat stare at the cup , listen is there the move of key in the hole ...
the cup in the hand , you take a sip lifted the cup to the sun cup and your fingers penetrated by the sun palm was stained by the transparent green delicate a hint of panic is there too the cup on the opposite site you know will be empty for a long time it takes long till the man opens your door -lrb- from liu ’ s poem " sunshine and cups - to my little finger , who drinks tea every day " -rrb- liu xia may wait for a long time , maybe another ten years .
now we visit xiaobo in jinzhou prison in the small chinese town nanshan in liaoning province .
entering the gate , we see several scattered buildings .
surprisingly , we see a huge office wall on which is written boldly ' 1984 ' .
a few months ago , liu xia , accompanied by the stainless steel mouse liu di , wang jinbo , mo zhixu and wang zhongxia , came here for a visit .
they were amazed at orwell ’ s rebirth in a chinese prison . snickering , they took pictures in front of the " 1984 wall " .
several officers rushed to them and took them into custody .
separately , they were interrogated for hours . we enter xiaobo ’ s cell now .
he shares with five other prisoners a 3 by 4 meter space .
his head is bald , shaved like an ordinary criminal .
his body is swollen by the padded jacket and trousers .
scarf , hat and gloves are a must in the cell because the concrete floor of the prison is cold .
the small window beneath the high ceiling is always open .
in winter , the indoor temperature is higher than outdoors ; it is a few degrees above zero .
the odor of the open toilet bucket in the corner is neutralized by the cold air , but one can not ignore the stench of the daily waste of several men .
the smell not only fills the room , it penetrates through clothes , and into the pores of the skin . this is the first winter that xiaobo spends in a prison in northern china .
he will have to adjust himself to the circumstances .
he does not know whether he will have frostbite .
to sit and lie on the concrete floors all year round may cause neck and spine pain and lead to kidney problems .
his stomach disease has given him a hard time since his imprisonment .
xiaobo has exited his cell today , but he does not want to show it to others otherwise his cell-mates might become cynical and angry .
sitting there , his thoughts fly to oslo .
he has had constant dreams about it .
who will be there at the ceremony ?
who will receive the prize for me ?
it could not be liu xia .
she has not sent any sign of life for a while .
my acceptance speech is long written in my head , but who can read it out aloud for me ?
does the king wear a majestic tuxedo , and the queen her crown at the banquet ?
will the distinguished guests think of the dead in tiananmen square and the tiananmen mothers and make a toast ?
sitting in the dungeon , xiaobo does not know that the announcement of his award induced a tsunami in zhongnanhai , and the rulers had a mild concussion , followed by delusions : they believe that their enemies are all over the world , so the grip on the naughty writers and the guy who held the crab dinner party must be tightened .
they must not go outside the country , otherwise they could endanger national security .
liu xiaobo ’ s dinner on december 10 , 2010 may look like this : boiled vegetables with sand , and a few pieces of fat meat as a special treat .
he might have an extra piece of steamed bread , and his rice bowl could also be refilled today .
in short , it is a privileged meal that will long be remembered , because it is a meal that will leave the stomach truly filled .
after all , he is the first chinese to win the nobel peace prize .

that doesn ’ t hold true for some other countries . the charge that us foreign policy is hypocritical is all but new , but the wikileaks data release has added some additional fuel to it .
just a few days ago , libya 's leader muammar gaddafi lauded the organization for exposing us " hypocrisy " through its diplomacy conducted behind closed doors , in comments published via the state news agency jana .
according to gaddafi , the leaked cables " proved that america is not what it has led allies and friends to believe it to be " and that " us relations with its allies are hypocritical . "
while there is certainly an expected discrepancy in the tone and style of these confidential reports and the language us diplomats use in public , the cables actually reveal that the us has been largely consistent with the overall messages and themes it conveys to its international partners in private and in public , argue scholars interviewed by deutsche welle . " there 's nothing in these cables that is different from what we actually know about us foreign policy without these cables , " says thomas risse , director of the center for transnational relations , foreign and security policy at the free university of berlin .
" the whole approach by these people from wikileaks seems to be that there is a public side to us foreign policy and then there is this secret side and that there is some sort conspiracy involved in all this , " he says .
" and i do n't see a huge mismatch actually between what the us says in public and what it does . "
clear goals one of the dominant topics in these cables are us security interests and the fact that washington considers transnational terrorism a major threat , adds risse : " that is exactly what barack obama and hillary clinton would say every day . "
the same is true for other top issues such as the iranian nuclear program , the spread of nuclear and ballistic missiles and the stabilization of afghanistan , says dan reiter , a professor of international relations at emory university in atlanta : " at the broadest level i think the cables reveal that the goals the us is engaging in private are essentially similar to the goals that it is espousing in public . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : saudi king abdullah urged the president barack obama to take action against iran asked whether the insights gained from reading the frank assessments of diplomats engaged in shaping and carrying out us foreign policy will alter their view of the us role or status in the world , risse and reiter both answer with a resounding no . " the us is not an empire , there are very clear limits to us influence in the world , " says risse .
" of course the us is a superpower .
it has interests in all corners of the world , it does try to influence other governments , but that 's ok .
there 's nothing that would get me worked up about this at all . "
no puppet master the cables are " not terribly surprising , " notes reiter .
" one does n't get an image of the united states as this all-powerful puppet master trying to pull the strings of various governments around the world to serve its corporate interests .
that 's an image which does not emerge . "
instead , the cables paint a picture of the us acting as one would expect a major power to do so , adds reiter .
" i do n't think that anything we see is terribly different from the way most states have conducted their foreign policy in the modern era . "
what 's more surprising to the analysts is the behavior of arab countries that becomes evident in the cables .
while the opposition of arab states to iran 's nuclear program has been known in foreign policy circles for some time , the contrast between confidential assessments made in private and public statements is particularly stark . double talk " the level of hypocrisy that comes out of these cables is much higher for instance in the middle east , " says risse .
" it 's very clear from these cables that most arab states feel really threatened by iranian nuclear power , however they would never say that in public .
in fact , they say the opposite in public . "
according to the cables , king abdullah of saudi arabia and king hamed ibn isa khalifa of bahrain are among arab leaders who pressed the us to attack iran .
king abdullah repeatedly exhorted the united states to " cut off the head of the snake " and take military action against tehran 's nuclear facilities .
open questions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : to evaluate the cables properly , scholars need more information about the documents in contrast to that , conclude the experts , the general outlines of us foreign policy are pretty much in sync with what the wikileaks documents have revealed so far and they have n't unearthed anything entirely unexpected .
nevertheless , argues risse , the document dump still poses a serious problem : " if you look at these cables from the perspective of an academic or historian , the real big question is what is the sample , ? " says risse . " is this a random selection , is this a selection that is representative of the whole or what exactly is it .
we have absolutely no way to judge this . "
risse notes , that even if all 250,000 cables are published in the end , it is still not clear how large a sample this is , how relevant the cables are or were in the decision-making processes for us officials and what the criteria were to publish them .
without those answers , many of which could be provided by wikileaks , a thorough assessment of the cables and its content wo n't be possible . author : michael knigge editor : rob mudge send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the capital is also easily the arty-fartiest place in the country .
coincidence ?
dw 's ben knight does n't think so . most of my friends are losers .
i mean that in a good way , obviously .
they are all talented and creative and sometimes even a bit inspired , but they are also , each and every last one of them , work-shy fops .
obviously i am as well : it takes one to know one , as we used to say in primary school .
there 's a great sequence in the movie " trainspotting " where junkie hero renton explains the complex art of staying on the dole .
it entails reverse-psychology tricks like going to a job interview and appearing psychotically eager to work in a leisure center .
the film shows that such efforts require invention , nerve , subtlety , selfishness , discipline and some drugs - the exact elements of a successful artistic career .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an artist at work there is probably no clearer illustration of one of the deeper truths of life in a western european social democracy : the attributes of an artist are exactly the same as the ones you need to successfully maintain your unemployment .
this is heightened in berlin , where it takes the sacrifice of an artist to truly perfect the art of not earning your living .
creative industries there are , they say , some broad similarities between my hometown , manchester , and berlin .
both were throbbing industrial powerhouses in the 19th century , lost their luster and declined in the late 20th century , only to become trendy pop cultural centers in the last 20 years - manchester not so much anymore , but you get the general idea .
both cities have also become famous for hanging their new economic hopes on the " creative industries . "
this very spongy term refers to anything from actor to fashion designer , to independent shopkeeper , to web designer , and includes all the attendant skill sets , cameramen , lighting technicians , office managers etc .
the point is you do n't make anything - you delight , you entertain , you disseminate knowledge and information , or you sing cabaret songs naked in a disused warehouse in front of an audience of twelve .
by capitalizing on the cache and the large student population , the two cities deliberately encouraged a whole class of freelance migrants engaged in some kind of creative endeavor in an attempt to re-invent the city 's economy .
but the similarity with manchester ends when it comes to the social security system .
in berlin , many creative types live - at least partially - on the standard long-term unemployment benefit called hartz iv .
it does n't help the job statistics , but it does mean that the city 's economy is run , to a certain extent , by the welfare state .
social security for the middle class bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unemployment center : the lifeblood of a creative economy when it comes to dealing with the job center to claim your benefits , being an artist is a double-edged sword .
most artists do not earn enough to live from their art , so they are understandably unwilling to mention the meager side earnings their talents bring .
they live double lives : naked dadaist performance artists at night , out-of-work it specialists by day .
but others have a little more nerve , and tell their case manager they are " professional " artists .
if they have a degree as well -lrb- a degree puts you in a different , more exclusive waiting room -rrb- they get special dispensation from the endless round of pointless job applications and interviews that most hartz iv recipients are forced to take .
instead , professional unemployed artists are allowed to count applications for grants and scholarships as their applications , and can get the state to pay for acting lessons .
so there 's a tip , if the hard times are getting to you .
ben knight does n't really think his friends are losers .

standing alongside serb prime minister mirko cvetkovic , he said that the eu " regrets the decision of serbia not to attend " the ceremony and added that serbia was " expected to embrace euro values and coordinate " with partners .
his words had a deep impact : while the foreign minister of serbia had originally defended the country 's decision not to attend the ceremony , serbia decided to send its ombudsman for human rights , sasa jankovic , to oslo .
serbia was the only eu candidate that originally decided to stay away from the ceremony honoring chinese human rights activist liu xiaobo .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the chinese government refused to let liu xiaobo attend the ceremony : his seat remained empty after the announcement of this year 's laureate , china had protested against the nobel committee 's decision and had urged other countries to boycott the ceremony .
serbia followed china 's call , as it relies on chinese government support for serbia 's opposition to an independent kosovo .
caught between a rock and a hard place but serbia is caught in a clash of interests , because it wants to join the 27-nation bloc of the european union .
fuele and other eu representatives clarified that serbia needed to comply with the joint decision of eu member states to send representatives to oslo in order not to lessen its chances of becoming a member state .
pedrag simic , political scientist at the university of belgrad says that despite serbia 's goal to join the european union , the country would still rely on four pillars of international politics - brussels , washington , moscow , and peking .
" a small country can only follow one superpower , " he said .
simic added that serbia 's attempts to be loyal to both china and the european union had to result in a dilemma such as the current one at some point .

dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content .
australia offers support to wikileaks founder , operation payback begins should assange be extradited to the united states ?
why ?
he did not spy , he did not steal all the data that was passed along to him - nor is he a us citizen .
the us has been caught with the pants way down and of course , does n't like it one bit .
the us has sprung a " leaki " in its " weaki " and does n't like it one " bitty . "
as the saying goes … those who live in glass houses should not be throwing stones . - vera , germany i believe asange did bring out the true colors of individuals , opinion makers and governments in the present context of world politics .
everyone should admire his forthright exposure , however bitter it may be ; more so the americans who expect democracies and freedom to speech to flourish around the globe .
extradition and implicating him will only show the us in bad light . - mohan , india no , he should n't be extradited .
it 's a witch hunt to divert blame from the people who should be overseeing us security .
we 've paid good money for homeland security .
whose fault is it that thousands of secret documents were released ? - wayne , us definitely not .
supporting corruption and lack of common sense has been the m.o. for too long .
someone needs to wake up the people over here , wikileaks is a good start . - gene , us the us has only itself to blame for the leaks ... its a schoolyard bully that 's now having a tantrum and calling on its buddies to help it in a scrap because it knows it ca n't nuke everyone that does n't agree with it .
in australia the us is seen as a gutless mongrel that will do anything to get its own way especially concerning energy drilling . - tom , australia julian assange is a xxi century hero , in the sixties the fight against the empire was with " guerrillas , " today the fight is with internet .
and he 's going to win . - crstina , spain the us is paranoid about wikileaks .
a typical response of killing the messenger .
no extradition of julian assange .
the eu should promote transparency and be more open about foreign policies and clarity of diplomatic mores in language . - j. , the netherlands no way jose !
who cares about america ?
not me anyway : -rrb- i 'm so happy about wikileaks and anything that harms america .
they think an insult to us is immoral , and that they are somehow better than the rest of us .
they are just greedy , self-important and power-obsessed .
everything they touch is tarnished .
they are so last century .
bring on the rise of china and india !
how dare they think they can " spy " on other countries in the un ! - brian , ireland if any european country extradites julian assange to the united states , it will be for a political " crime . "
is europe the running dog of the us , or a group of sovereign nations dedicated to freedom of the press , freedom of the individual and people having the right to know what is going on ?
kevin rudd claims that the core problem is the failure by the us to protect its diplomatic communications .
i think the core problem is the behavior of the us .
the reason that wikileaks has not released the diplomatic communications of other countries -lrb- eg : germany , australia -rrb- is that they are better behaved and do not goose-step on the world stage , trying to take over the world . - charles , australia i believe that having all that " secret " info available for everybody to learn was not the " status quo " however it was disclosed and it is done .
the fellow in jail in the united kingdom is actually a journalist devoted to inform the public .
if he ever is extradited to the us he can claim " freedom of expression . "
now , in terms of those " ladies " claiming sex crimes , that is a bit doubtful .
they have waited until now , come on !
i believe that it was a politically manipulated act to get him behind bars .
and if those allegedly " crimes " were committed in sweden , should n't he then be extradited to that country ? - elena , us no .
he 's a hero who has struck a powerful blow for freedom !
he should be given the medal of freedom award ! - michael , us no , he should not be extradited to the us ; he has not been charged with any us crime .
whatever one thinks about wikileaks , mr. assange is taking a principled stand against the establishment for personal convictions and at great risk to himself .
if the political solution is to restrict freedom of the internet it will amplify assange 's stance : that many elected politicians are duplicitous control freaks who need their over-used and abused powers curtailed .
he deserves respect , support and applause for his courage . - a. , japan i believe that assange is being targeted for what he did .
if he 's found guilty of real sexual misconduct , i believe he should be punished , but as far as the internet crap , i believe he 'll prevail .
he 'll probably either wimp out for future stuff , or he 'll feel more emboldened .
i 'd like to see the hackers messing with mastercard put to be punished though .
it causes too many undeserving people a lot of pain . - joe , us i am completely baffled by the case .
mr. assange has been arrested in a country -lrb- uk -rrb- which belongs to the interpol group of countries so , according to the rules , he might be obviously extradited to sweden - country which relies on " the rules " within the interpol group .
at the same time , mr. assange has been accused of allegedly having broken the law of another country -lrb- usa -rrb- which is also in the interpol group .
in addition , his own country -lrb- australia -rrb- has now given a hint of standing up for him by offering him legal help , not ruling out his extradition to australia -lrb- being also the interpol member . -rrb-
in addition , there is the international court of justice in the hague -lrb- operating within the uno . -rrb-
so international law , respective rules of law of the countries mentioned , international organizations -lrb- interpol , uno , eu -rrb- are all to be bundled in this case which is too much intricate to the ' untrained eye ' in this " legal maze .

australia offers support to wikileaks founder , operation payback begins should assange be extradited to the united states ?
why ?
he did not spy , he did not steal all the data that was passed along to him - nor is he a us citizen .
the us has been caught with the pants way down and of course , does n't like it one bit .
the us has sprung a " leaki " in its " weaki " and does n't like it one " bitty . "
as the saying goes … those who live in glass houses should not be throwing stones . - vera , germany i believe asange did bring out the true colors of individuals , opinion makers and governments in the present context of world politics .
everyone should admire his forthright exposure , however bitter it may be ; more so the americans who expect democracies and freedom to speech to flourish around the globe .
extradition and implicating him will only show the us in bad light . - mohan , india no , he should n't be extradited .
it 's a witch hunt to divert blame from the people who should be overseeing us security .
we 've paid good money for homeland security .
whose fault is it that thousands of secret documents were released ? - wayne , us definitely not .
supporting corruption and lack of common sense has been the m.o. for too long .
someone needs to wake up the people over here , wikileaks is a good start . - gene , us the us has only itself to blame for the leaks ... its a schoolyard bully that 's now having a tantrum and calling on its buddies to help it in a scrap because it knows it ca n't nuke everyone that does n't agree with it .
in australia the us is seen as a gutless mongrel that will do anything to get its own way especially concerning energy drilling . - tom , australia julian assange is a xxi century hero , in the sixties the fight against the empire was with " guerrillas , " today the fight is with internet .
and he 's going to win . - crstina , spain the us is paranoid about wikileaks .
a typical response of killing the messenger .
no extradition of julian assange .
the eu should promote transparency and be more open about foreign policies and clarity of diplomatic mores in language . - j. , the netherlands no way jose !
who cares about america ?
not me anyway : -rrb- i 'm so happy about wikileaks and anything that harms america .
they think an insult to us is immoral , and that they are somehow better than the rest of us .
they are just greedy , self-important and power-obsessed .
everything they touch is tarnished .
they are so last century .
bring on the rise of china and india !
how dare they think they can " spy " on other countries in the un ! - brian , ireland if any european country extradites julian assange to the united states , it will be for a political " crime . "
is europe the running dog of the us , or a group of sovereign nations dedicated to freedom of the press , freedom of the individual and people having the right to know what is going on ?
kevin rudd claims that the core problem is the failure by the us to protect its diplomatic communications .
i think the core problem is the behavior of the us .
the reason that wikileaks has not released the diplomatic communications of other countries -lrb- eg : germany , australia -rrb- is that they are better behaved and do not goose-step on the world stage , trying to take over the world . - charles , australia i believe that having all that " secret " info available for everybody to learn was not the " status quo " however it was disclosed and it is done .
the fellow in jail in the united kingdom is actually a journalist devoted to inform the public .
if he ever is extradited to the us he can claim " freedom of expression . "
now , in terms of those " ladies " claiming sex crimes , that is a bit doubtful .
they have waited until now , come on !
i believe that it was a politically manipulated act to get him behind bars .
and if those allegedly " crimes " were committed in sweden , should n't he then be extradited to that country ? - elena , us no .
he 's a hero who has struck a powerful blow for freedom !
he should be given the medal of freedom award ! - michael , us no , he should not be extradited to the us ; he has not been charged with any us crime .
whatever one thinks about wikileaks , mr. assange is taking a principled stand against the establishment for personal convictions and at great risk to himself .
if the political solution is to restrict freedom of the internet it will amplify assange 's stance : that many elected politicians are duplicitous control freaks who need their over-used and abused powers curtailed .
he deserves respect , support and applause for his courage . - a. , japan i believe that assange is being targeted for what he did .
if he 's found guilty of real sexual misconduct , i believe he should be punished , but as far as the internet crap , i believe he 'll prevail .
he 'll probably either wimp out for future stuff , or he 'll feel more emboldened .
i 'd like to see the hackers messing with mastercard put to be punished though .
it causes too many undeserving people a lot of pain . - joe , us i am completely baffled by the case .
mr. assange has been arrested in a country -lrb- uk -rrb- which belongs to the interpol group of countries so , according to the rules , he might be obviously extradited to sweden - country which relies on " the rules " within the interpol group .
at the same time , mr. assange has been accused of allegedly having broken the law of another country -lrb- usa -rrb- which is also in the interpol group .
in addition , his own country -lrb- australia -rrb- has now given a hint of standing up for him by offering him legal help , not ruling out his extradition to australia -lrb- being also the interpol member . -rrb-
in addition , there is the international court of justice in the hague -lrb- operating within the uno . -rrb-
so international law , respective rules of law of the countries mentioned , international organizations -lrb- interpol , uno , eu -rrb- are all to be bundled in this case which is too much intricate to the ' untrained eye ' in this " legal maze .

" there is a spirit that is uniting us all , " the german chancellor told reporters during a break in the talks .
" if the euro fails , the european union fails , too . "
president sarkozy , meanwhile , pledged that germany and france " will defend the euro , because the euro is europe . "
sarkozy also backed germany 's opposition to creating unified european sovereign bonds .
the idea of harmonizing some eurozone debt , as suggested by several members of the currency union , has met with strong opposition from germany and france , whose balance sheets are relatively healthy .
" french and german citizens would not be happy if we were to bundle the debts together , " the french president said .
he argued that the concept might be worth considering in the future , but only after the bloc 's members ramp up their economic and political cooperation .
" we should not put the cart before the horse , " sarkozy told reporters .
european leaders , or bullies ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france and germany are unwilling to unify european debts earlier in the week , merkel and germany had come under fire over this issue from luxembourg 's prime minister jean-claude juncker , who also heads the eurozone .
juncker said that creating taboo subjects without even considering the ideas of others was " a very un-european way of dealing with european issues . " as the two largest eu members , france and germany both have a sizeable share of the voting power within the bloc , and need relatively little support from other countries in order to secure a majority .
" without agreement from france and germany - the historic motors of european integration and two economies that make up half of the eurozone 's gross domestic product - nothing very important is possible , " professor henrik uterwedde from the franco-german institute in ludwigsburg told deutsche welle .
" so on the one hand , they must reach agreements , and help the union move forward , but at the same time , they do n't always do enough to treat the other members as equal partners and involve them in the decision-making processes . "
friday 's meeting was in preparation for the eu summit in brussels on december 16 and 17 , at which the bloc 's economic difficulties such as unemployment and national debt are bound to top the agenda .
troop deployment symbolic of closer cooperation while sarkozy and merkel discussed the harmonization of economic policies like labor and taxation laws , saying this would improve the eurozone 's coherence as an economic bloc , military leaders just across the border were preparing a more visible symbol of franco-german cooperation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the last german battalions in france had a very different mission the first german battalion to be stationed on french soil since the nazi occupation in world war ii officially took up their post near the border-city of strasbourg on friday .
german defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg and his french counterpart alain juppe attended a ceremony to mark the event .
" german soldiers are today welcome in france , " merkel said across the border in freiburg .
" for me , that has great symbolism , after all that germany was guilty of during the nazi era . "
the battalion , which will eventually consist of 600 soldiers , is part of the joint franco-german brigade .
" i was always surprised that the franco-german brigade only consisted of french soldiers in germany , " sarkozy said .
" we are two sovereign nations , two countries at peace , two countries that founded europe . "
franco-german genesis of eu sarkozy was referring to the forerunner of the modern-day european union , the european coal and steel community .
this trade-oriented union was established in 1953 as part of post-war efforts to negate the possibility of future conflict between france and germany by making them economically interdependent .
between 1870 and 1945 , the two neighbors fought three devastating wars .
" above all else , i think putting these german troops in france is a symbolic exercise , " franco-german expert , professor henrik uterwedde said .
" but sometimes symbolism is important . "
" that famous photo of -lsb- former german chancellor -rsb- helmut kohl and -lsb- then french president -rsb- francois mitterand standing hand-in-hand at the world war one commemorations in verdun in 1984 was pure symbolism , too - but it was a hugely significant image . "
bildunterschrift : sometimes symbolism can move mountains the alsace region where the german battalion us now stationed spans the franco-german border , and has changed hands several times over the centuries .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : focus : wikileaks disclosures wikileaks exposes shell 's infiltration of nigeria 's government wikileaks release could lead to shift from transparency to secrecy opinion : wikileaks is a test of us commitment to free press opinion : wikileaks ' latest release is a diplomatic waterloo international relations -pipe- 10.12.2010 wikileaks cables show consistent us foreign policy , say experts großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there 's no huge clash between public and private goals of the us state department contrary to oft-stated claims , the wikileaks cables show no huge credibility gap between official us policies and what diplomats write in confidential cables , say experts .
that doesn ’ t hold true for some other countries . the charge that us foreign policy is hypocritical is all but new , but the wikileaks data release has added some additional fuel to it .
just a few days ago , libya 's leader muammar gaddafi lauded the organization for exposing us " hypocrisy " through its diplomacy conducted behind closed doors , in comments published via the state news agency jana .
according to gaddafi , the leaked cables " proved that america is not what it has led allies and friends to believe it to be " and that " us relations with its allies are hypocritical . "
while there is certainly an expected discrepancy in the tone and style of these confidential reports and the language us diplomats use in public , the cables actually reveal that the us has been largely consistent with the overall messages and themes it conveys to its international partners in private and in public , argue scholars interviewed by deutsche welle . " there 's nothing in these cables that is different from what we actually know about us foreign policy without these cables , " says thomas risse , director of the center for transnational relations , foreign and security policy at the free university of berlin .
" the whole approach by these people from wikileaks seems to be that there is a public side to us foreign policy and then there is this secret side and that there is some sort conspiracy involved in all this , " he says .
" and i do n't see a huge mismatch actually between what the us says in public and what it does . "
clear goals one of the dominant topics in these cables are us security interests and the fact that washington considers transnational terrorism a major threat , adds risse : " that is exactly what barack obama and hillary clinton would say every day . "
the same is true for other top issues such as the iranian nuclear program , the spread of nuclear and ballistic missiles and the stabilization of afghanistan , says dan reiter , a professor of international relations at emory university in atlanta : " at the broadest level i think the cables reveal that the goals the us is engaging in private are essentially similar to the goals that it is espousing in public . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : saudi king abdullah urged the president barack obama to take action against iran asked whether the insights gained from reading the frank assessments of diplomats engaged in shaping and carrying out us foreign policy will alter their view of the us role or status in the world , risse and reiter both answer with a resounding no . " the us is not an empire , there are very clear limits to us influence in the world , " says risse .
" of course the us is a superpower .
it has interests in all corners of the world , it does try to influence other governments , but that 's ok .
there 's nothing that would get me worked up about this at all . "
no puppet master the cables are " not terribly surprising , " notes reiter .
" one does n't get an image of the united states as this all-powerful puppet master trying to pull the strings of various governments around the world to serve its corporate interests .
that 's an image which does not emerge . "
instead , the cables paint a picture of the us acting as one would expect a major power to do so , adds reiter .
" i do n't think that anything we see is terribly different from the way most states have conducted their foreign policy in the modern era . "
what 's more surprising to the analysts is the behavior of arab countries that becomes evident in the cables .
while the opposition of arab states to iran 's nuclear program has been known in foreign policy circles for some time , the contrast between confidential assessments made in private and public statements is particularly stark . double talk " the level of hypocrisy that comes out of these cables is much higher for instance in the middle east , " says risse .
" it 's very clear from these cables that most arab states feel really threatened by iranian nuclear power , however they would never say that in public .
in fact , they say the opposite in public . "
according to the cables , king abdullah of saudi arabia and king hamed ibn isa khalifa of bahrain are among arab leaders who pressed the us to attack iran .
king abdullah repeatedly exhorted the united states to " cut off the head of the snake " and take military action against tehran 's nuclear facilities .
open questions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : to evaluate the cables properly , scholars need more information about the documents in contrast to that , conclude the experts , the general outlines of us foreign policy are pretty much in sync with what the wikileaks documents have revealed so far and they have n't unearthed anything entirely unexpected .
nevertheless , argues risse , the document dump still poses a serious problem : " if you look at these cables from the perspective of an academic or historian , the real big question is what is the sample , ? " says risse . " is this a random selection , is this a selection that is representative of the whole or what exactly is it .
we have absolutely no way to judge this . "
risse notes , that even if all 250,000 cables are published in the end , it is still not clear how large a sample this is , how relevant the cables are or were in the decision-making processes for us officials and what the criteria were to publish them .
without those answers , many of which could be provided by wikileaks , a thorough assessment of the cables and its content wo n't be possible . author : michael knigge editor : rob mudge send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but guests gathered around an empty chair to congratulate the laureate , who was not represented at the ceremony . the nobel peace prize committee has concluded its award ceremony in oslo with the prizewinner and guest of honor , imprisoned chinese dissident liu xiaobo , absent .
the prize was meant to " point out the relationship between human rights , democracy and peace " , nobel peace prize committee chairman thorbjoern jagland said in his opening comments .
he called liu a symbol of the " non-violent struggle for such -lsb- human -rsb- rights in china " , and compared him with nelson mandela .
he went on to say that liu had done nothing but exercise his civil rights , and called on china to release him .
in his absence , norwegian actress liv ullmann read a final statement titled " i have no enemies " released by liu 's supporters after his sentencing a year ago .
in it , liu said " there is no force that can put an end to the human quest for freedom , and china will in the end become a nation ruled by law , where human rights reign supreme . "
he also spoke of his wife , liu xia , who is now under house arrest in beijing , saying her love " is the sunlight that leaps over high walls and penetrates the iron bars of my prison window . "
international solidarity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : liu xiaobo is considered a criminal by the chinese authorities throughout friday , western governments paid tribute to liu 's contribution to democracy and human rights , calling on china to release the dissident from prison .
in berlin , german human rights commissioner markus loening praised liu 's courageous stand for human rights .
" the participation of germany as well as all eu partners represented in oslo and many other countries in the ceremony in oslo is therefore a simple sign of respect for liu xiaobo and for all who work to promote human rights and democracy without resorting to violence , " a statement from loening on the german foreign ministry website said .
united states president barack obama meanwhile hailed liu as a beacon of freedom : " the values he espouses are universal , his struggle is peaceful , and he should be released as soon as possible , " obama said .
event overshadowed the event in the norwegian capital was overshadowed not only by liu 's absence , but also by china 's wider anger at his selection .
several nations decided to boycott the ceremony at beijing 's request after the chinese government condemned the decision to award the prize to the democracy activist .
almost a third of the 50 countries invited to the event stayed away , including russia , pakistan and saudi arabia .
many of those not attending are thought to have bowed to chinese pressure .
serbia , which was heavily criticized by the european union for its initial decision not to attend , decided at the last minute to send an ombudsman after all .
chinese media condemn choice bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an empty chair represented liu at the ceremony official chinese media have slammed the choice of liu as nobel peace prize laureate , calling it an attempt to impose foreign values on china .
liu has been a critic of the chinese government since the tiananmen square massacre of 1989 .
liu took a prominent part in the protests there and was sentenced to two years in prison .
he was jailed last december for 11 years on subversion charges after he co-authored a document called charter 08 , which calls for political reform in china .
authorities have also cracked down on activists in the run-up to the ceremony and have prevented liu 's family and friends from attending .
empty chair the nobel committee chose to represent liu with an empty chair during the ceremony , calling this a symbol of the chinese policy to isolate and repress dissidents .
in a moving gesture , jagland placed the nobel diploma on the vacant seat .
it is the first time that a laureate under detention has not been formally represented since 1935 , when nazi germany stopped the pacifist carl von ossietzky from attending .
it is also the first time since then that the prize money of 1.13 million euros -lrb- $ 1.5 million -rrb- will not be handed out .

but the west seems unmoved . despite changes in afghan law and a constitution designed to protect women 's rights , violence and abuse of women continue to be a serious problem in the country , and the government is not doing enough to prevent it .
that is the conclusion of a new report published by the united nations assistance mission in afghanistan -lrb- unama -rrb- .
the most common forms of abuse include forced and child marriage , honor killings and giving away girls to settle disputes under the tradition of baad .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the report says violence against afghan women is still widespread " the report describes the prevalence of these practices , " georgette gagnon , unama 's director of human rights , said at a press conference .
" it looks at the consequences these practices have on the lives of afghan women and girls and the community as a whole and it also looks at the efforts of the afghan government to address violence against women . "
one of these efforts , the 2009 law of elimination of violence against women -lrb- evaw -rrb- , came under particular scrutiny .
the law , which gagnon described as " a huge gain of legal protection of women 's rights , " criminalizes buying and selling women for marriage , forcing a woman to marry without her consent , forcing girls to marry when they are underage , and forcing girls and women to commit self-immolation - when they set themselves on fire .
ignorance and lack of enforcement but according to the report , the new law is not being enforced in many parts of the country , and is often not even known .
bele grau , program manager for afghanistan at the women 's rights organisation medica mondiale agreed with this assessment .
" on the theoretical and legal level the situation is getting better – but in practice it is often not implemented , " she told deutsche welle .
" this law has been in force for a year , but a lot of judges do n't even know it , and if they do , they do n't enforce it . "
the un women 's organization unifem says that around 87 percent of afghan women suffer from domestic violence , and that half of all girls are married under the age of 15 .
on top of this , grau says that many of the rights that women have won are repealed by new laws .
she cites one recent regulation that bans women who have run away from an abusive home from seeking refuge with strangers .
this in practice leaves many women only the unrealistic option of going to relatives .
many women are also still imprisoned for running away , in contravention of the evaw law .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : westerwelle suggested democracy can not be imposed on afghanistan the report found that much of the abuse is founded in afghan tradition .
" one very harmful practice that we heard a lot about is baad , which is the giving away of girls to settle disputes , " said gagnon .
" many of the women told us that instead of a murderer being punished , an innocent girl is punished and she has to spend all her life in slavery and is subjected to cruel violence .
sometimes she is forced to sleep with the animals in the barn . "
western indifference the report sets out a number of recommendations for the afghan government to deal with the problem , but grau says that the west has an obligation to apply pressure in order to protect women 's rights – not least because this is often used to add legitimacy to the war in afghanistan .
" we 've noticed this in most of the western governments , " she said .
" for the past year , all the talk is about withdrawal of troops , and negotiations with the taliban etc . , and that afghans have to work out for themselves how much democracy or women 's rights they want .
these are now all internal afghan issues that are n't discussed or even noticed anymore .
the german government is no exception to this . "
she believes that pressure could be exhorted through the financial aid the west gives to the afghan government .
" the western governments still give afghanistan a lot of development money , " she said .
" and when they make conditions for giving this money , we think they should make them for human rights and women 's rights , not just for taking over security duties . "
" the issue of women 's rights was also one of the justifications for the war itself , but that is suddenly disappearing from the agenda , " she added .
" earlier this year , -lrb- german foreign minister guido -rrb- westerwelle said , ' well , afghanistan is not switzerland , ' and with that everything is swept from the table . "

dutch police have arrested a teenager accused of taking part in the attacks . dutch authorities on friday said police in the netherlands arrested a 16-year-old who has admitted to attacking websites belonging to wikileaks opponents .
a spokesman for the national prosecutor 's office said the teenager had " admitted launching attacks on visa and mastercard sites . "
a statement said he was probably " part of a larger group of hackers . "
hackers unite hackers from around the world have stepped up cyber attacks following the arrest of wikileaks boss julian assange .
assange is wanted by sweden in connection with sexual misconduct charges the online attacks have mainly targeted companies that have deprived wikileaks of their services , including the websites of the online payment service paypal , and the credit card giants visa and mastercard , which had stopped processing donations for wikileaks .
also targeted were amazon.com , which had banished wikileaks from using its rented servers , a swiss bank and the website of the swedish prosecutor who had issued an arrest warrant for assange on charges of sexual misconduct .
the group of hackers , which calls itself " anonymous , " says it wants to keep the internet open and free .
wikileaks has distanced itself from the cyber attacks , but said they reflected public opinion .
in a statement , the organization said it had no contact with anonymous and had not received prior notice of any of the group 's actions .
assange : " charges fabricated " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : julian assange says he is innocent of the charges assange is currently in a british jail after handing himself in to police on tuesday . police have moved the wikileaks ' chief from the main part of wandsworth prison to an isolation unit , his lawyer said friday . " the prison authorities are doing it for his own safety , presumably , " jennifer robinson , one of assange 's legal team told the afp news agency . assange has been refused the use of his own laptop but will be given a prison computer with limited internet access , the guardian newspaper reported friday .
assange says the swedish sexual misconduct charges are a fabrication intended to stop his organization from continuing to publish confidential documents .
wikileaks is facing international condemnation for its publication of confidential material , often concerning diplomatic relations between countries .
some of the documents have caused embarrassment to the nations concerned .
assange is due to appear in a london court for a second time on tuesday , when prosecutors want to question him about allegations of rape and sexual molestation made by two women .

meanwhile , russia 's prime minister accuses the us of hypocrisy over the affair . the un commissioner for human rights navi pillay expressed dismay over the withdrawal of financial and internet services to the controversial wikileaks website .
pillay said that measures taken by companies - which wikileaks ' supporters claim are due to pressure from foreign governments - could represent an infringement of the right to freedom of expression . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pillay said courts should decide on the balance between security and freedom " i 'm concerned about reports of pressure exerted on private companies , including banks , credit card companies , and internet service providers to close down credit lines for donations to wikileaks as well as to stop hosting the website or its mother sites , " navi pillay told a news conference on thursday .
" they could be interpreted as an attempt to censor the publication of information , thus potentially violating wikileaks ' right to freedom of expression . "
payments suspended , account closed wikileaks angered the us and other governments with the release in november of 250,000 confidential diplomatic cables , with washington saying the information could put american lives in danger .
credit card firms mastercard and visa later suspended payments made to wikileaks , while the swiss post office shut down a bank account opened by wikileaks founder julian assange .
pillay said the case " raises complex human rights questions about balancing freedom of information and the need to protect national security or public order . "
" if wikileaks has committed any recognizable illegal acts then this should be handled through the legal system and not through pressure and intimidation including on third parties , " said pillay a former un war crimes judge .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : assange was arrested in london , and awaits a hearing pillay noted that such questions were not related to charges against assange for crimes including rape in sweden .
supporters of assange claim that the charges against him have been manufactured as part of a bid to halt the website 's activities , along with the pressure on firms to cut wikileaks ' income stream .
' pot calls kettle black , ' putin russian prime minister vladimir putin said that assange 's arrest in britain , for extradition , was " undemocratic " and accused the us of " hypocrisy " for attacking russia 's record on democracy .
" if we are talking about democracy , it should be complete .
why was mr. assange hidden in jail ?
is that democracy ?
as we say in the village , the pot is calling the kettle black , " putin told reporters .
" i want to send the ball back to our american colleagues . "
assange is currently in custody in britain awaiting a hearing over his extradition after a warrant was issued by sweden .
meanwhile , wikileaks supporters on thursday vowed to step up cyber-attacks on companies that have taken action against wikileaks .
a group calling itself " anonymous " has claimed credit for temporarily bringing down the websites of visa and mastercard .
