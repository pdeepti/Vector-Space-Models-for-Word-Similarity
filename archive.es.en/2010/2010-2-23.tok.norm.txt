" but it will take some time before the complete network is functioning again , " he said .
germanwings said that 120 of its 160 scheduled flights would operate on tuesday , despite the aftermath of the industrial action .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some 4,000 pilots were briefly on strike transport minister relieved german transport minister peter raumsauer told zdf he was relieved that resolution efforts and suggestions he had made since last weekend had been adopted by all sides .
" i now hope and demand that the negotiating parties reach a sustainable , amicable agreement and that no aircraft remains grounded , " he said . travel clouded by controllers ' strike meanwhile , european travellers can expect more disruption on tuesday , due to a work stoppage by french air traffic controllers .
that stoppage is expected to hamper half the flights at paris ' orly airport and a quarter of flights from the main charles de gaulle airport , according to france 's aviation authority dgac .
air france has vowed to maintain most long-haul services .
some french provincial airports also expect cancellations .
four french unions have called the five-day strike , from tuesday until saturday , to protest against government plans to merge france 's air traffic control activities with those of neighbouring countries .
controllers fear the merger will end their role as french state employees .
dgac insists their status will not change .
meanwhile , the british union unite says 81 percent of its cabin crew members working for british airways have voted in favour of strike action .
that creates the prospect of a strike within the next 28 days , although the easter holiday period is reported to have been ruled out. ipj / dpa / reuters / afp editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

istanbul police were questioning 29 of them at their headquarters , news broadcaster ntv reported .
police also brought 10 of the arrested officers to an istanbul court early on tuesday , according to the state-run anatolian news agency .
the court is to decide whether to hold them in custody .
the series of arrests is one of the biggest against the military , which has ousted four governments since 1960 and considers itself to be the guardian of turkey 's secular tradition .
turkish prime minister tayyip erdogan commented on the arrests during an official visit to madrid .
" after the security forces have finished this process , the judiciary will make its assessment , " erdogan said .
coup plot bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ruling ak party has support from voters and the european union the crackdown relates to the 2003 " sledgehammer " plot to overthrow the government , led by the islam-rooted ak party .
media reports have said the military planned to provoke an attack from neighboring greece and plant bombs inside istanbul mosques and museums to incite chaos and justify a military coup .
military leaders have denied the accusations and claim the plot was only a hypothetical training scenario .
more than 200 people have been arrested since the story broke in 2007 , including military officers , politicians , lawyers and writers .
critics of the government claim prime minister erdogan has used the investigation to silence opposition .
governmental power struggle the ak party , or justice and development party , came to power only a year after its founding when it won a parliamentary majority in 2002 and ended decades of secularist rule .
the party brands itself as pro-market and pro-western , favoring turkey 's bid for membership of the european union .
but the staunchly secular institutions of the military and judiciary have been in a deep power struggle with the government , which has solid electoral support .
erdogan has sought parliamentary support to curb the power of judges and prosecutors , and has said he would call a referendum on a constitutional reform to the judicial system if plans in parliament fail .
his government has also moved to curb the military 's influence in state affairs as part of a democratic reform plan aimed at eventual eu membership. acb / dpa / ap / reuters editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de afghanistan -pipe- 23.02.2010 dutch pullout will give nato headaches , but wo n't lead to domino effect großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it could be hard for nato to find a replacement for dutch troops a withdrawal of dutch troops from afghanistan would certainly increase the pressure on its allies to take their place .
but it is unlikely to trigger a domino effect among other countries who have troops there . by the sheer number of troops , the dutch deployment does n't rank among top international contingents in afghanistan .
however , its force of 1,800 soldiers has not only been in charge of the uruzgan province in the dangerous southern part of the country , but has generally been seen as doing an excellent job there .
so the planned dutch pullout from afghanistan as a consequence of the governmen crisis in the hague will clearly have repercussions for nato 's military mission in the country at a time when most allies are already under pressure to justify their engagement at home .
this has already led to worries about a possible domino effect in the sense that other countries might also feel forced to reconsider their committments to afghanistan .
" it 's true that the afghanistan mission is very unpopular in many european countries , so it is definitely a cause for concern if the dutch withdraw on account of the collapsed government , " eva gross , who heads the eu foreign and security policy program at the institute for european studies at vrije universiteit brussel in belgium , told deutsche welle .
" but to speak of a domino effect may be overstating the case . "
each country in europe has its own dynamics and traditions , therefore gross does n't believe an automatic discussion about troop withdrawals in other eu states is likely .
german troop increase will go ahead for germany , where a parliamentary vote on the expansion of berlin 's afghan mission is scheduled for later this week , the dutch decision wo n't have an immediate effect either , argue experts .
public opinion in germany ca n't be swayed much by the dutch political crisis because a solid majority of germans is already against the military engagement in afghanistan , says klaus-peter schoeppner , head of tns emnid , a major german polling and reseach firm .
while germans are very skeptical about the afghan misson , schoeppner thinks that most of them can live with the exit scenario envisaged by the government .
" so , i do n't think that this topic will gain much traction in germany , " he told deutsche welle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany plans to send up to 850 additional troops to afghanistan what 's more , adds schoeppner , germans do n't view the mission in afghanistan as predominantly a military one .
" we regard ourselves as the number one humanitarian nation , " said schoeppner .
a fast withdrawal from afghanistan would not only end germany 's military , but also its humanitarian responsibilities .
currently there is no indication that this is a likely option for the government , he added .
" i am fairly confindent that the increase of troops will go through in parliament , mainly because the political elites have been in favor of a continuation of the mandate , " said gross .
exit strategies while the dutch withdrawal will not have any imminent effect on the committments of other allies , it will further increase the debate in many countries about timetables and exit strategies .
" we have seen this in discussions already in germany , britain or the united states that the focus is now already much more on finding ways of withdrawing their troops from afghanistan , " said gross .
that could make it hard for nato to find a replacement for dutch troops , if the new government in the hague does in fact decide to withdraw its soldiers .
australia already publicly dismissed a possible leadership role in uruzgan province and canada has said it wants to pull out its troops at the end of next year .
germany , which is currently in charge of the regional command in the north of afghanistan , has repeatedly rejected a german engagement in the south and is unlikely to change that position .
" i think it would be difficult for us to do more in afghanistan , because others leave , " said schoeppner .
if no other countries are willing to take over the dutch role in the south , the us might ultimately be forced to fulfill that task itself .
as an alternative , american officials have aired a possible role for non-nato troops in afghanistan .
but whether such an expansion of the afghan mission is realistic and how it could work is still unclear .
explaining the mission at least for now then , the political turmoil over the future of dutch troops in afghanistan will merely increase the pressure on nato planners to sketch out possible scenarios for a dutch withdrawal and not lead to a domino effect in other countries .
however , argue experts , since public sentiment is already very pessimistic about the afghan mission , military events on the ground can always have a major impact on public opinion .
bildunterschrift : politicians must better explain the rationale behind the afghan mission , say experts " in most countries a a rather large attack with loss of life would probably push the public to reject military engagement , " said gross .
since that is always possible , governments can only do one thing : " they have to communicate the reasons why we are in afghanistan much better and much more carefully .
i think the dutch withdrawal and the collapse of the government definitely highlights that the european public is unconvinced of the value of the afghan mission and that european politicians have some explaining to do , " she said .

but in the face of criticism and protests , the law wo n't be enforced , says the government . a new law to curb child pornography has come into force in germany , but , in a legal curiosity , it is not going to be used by the courts .
the salient point is that instead of blocking child porn websites , the government now thinks it would better to erase them . the controversial legislation was drafted in 2009 by the former conservative family minister , ursula von der leyen , who said that she was willing to act against " a massive spread of child pornography on the internet . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ursula von der leyen is eager to stop child abuse material on the internet " we are no longer going to tolerate the fact that pictures of children being raped are massively accessed and distributed on the internet in germany , " she said , shortly before introducing the bill to parliament last year . mere symbolism under the new law , the german federal criminal office -lrb- bka -rrb- is supposed to provide a regularly updated list of websites , which they 've found to contain child pornographic pictures and images . german internet providers must then post a red " stop " sign on them , but are not allowed to erase them .
the german law also does n't extend to providers based abroad . christian bahls from the organisation " abuse victims against internet access blocking " accused the government of pursuing " a policy of symbolism , " which he described as " a slap in the face of the victims of child pornography . " " the victims of abuse are being abused again , namely as symbols in a questionable government campaign , " he said . freedom vs crime fighting since last summer , there 's been a groundswell of protests by germans who see the law as a first step on the path towards government censorship of the internet . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protestors demanding internet freedom did n't want to listen to the government 's arguments franziska heine has been spearheading a public pressure campaign called " expedition against internet blocking , " which is aimed at forcing parliament to re-introduce the law . about 134.000 germans have signed on to an official petition to parliament pressed by the group . mrs heine claimed that the law was based on " entirely false information " about the distribution of child pornography . " the law has huge repercussion for the freedom of information , but does little to help the victims , " she said . mrs heine 's opinion is supported by police specialists investigating cases of child pornography . frank federau , a member of a special unit at the regional police office in the federal state of lower saxony , believes child abuse material is not primarily exchanged using the internet . " the internet is a channel of communication for paedophiles , but the material as such is distributed on cds and dvds via ordinary mail . " legal doubts wolfgang hoffmann-riem , an expert on constitutional law , even believed that the new law was not in line with the german constitution . " the fact that the federal criminal office has been made responsible for providing the list of websites to be banned , is a clear breach of power-sharing laws in germany . " hoffman-riem pointed out that police in the 16 german federal states were in charge of crime fighting and investigating criminal content on the internet , and that the law infringed upon their duties . in the face of so much criticism , the government has decided to amend the law in the course of the next few months . the new legislation , the government said , would then allow providers to erase child pornography websites . author : uwe hessler editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

soldiers tell of rituals with names like " fire dance " and the " jukebox " . germany 's parliamentary commissioner for the armed forces , reinhold robbe , said he had received 54 written accounts of abuse and degrading treatment since he submitted a report about hazing in the military .
several of the letters he received from soldiers corroborated previous allegations that mountain infantry troops at a camp in bavaria had been forced to drink alcohol and eat raw pork liver until they threw up .
robbe , a member of the social democratic party , demanded that the training curriculum be changed and said that the " dangerous , tasteless rituals must stop . "
fire dances and jukeboxes the new letters also bring to light other forms of hazing .
one former member of the marines said that new sailors were often subjected to harsh rituals during their first nights at sea .
he described the " fire dance , " in which a man was forced to strip off his pants and have a lighted wick placed in his anus ; another in which a floor polishing machine with rough bristles was held against a recruit 's naked bottom until the skin turned red .
a volunteer soldier stationed in southern germany between 1996 and 1998 told of soldiers being forced to play " jukebox , " during which they were shut into a locker , which was then stood upside down , and the occupant forced to sing certain songs .
defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg renewed his promise of a complete investigation .
he did not rule out the possibility of disciplinary action for those involved , although he warned against making an across-the-board judgment .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de internet -pipe- 23.02.2010 german child pornography law hits snags großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german government wants to curb internet freedom to fight child pornography germany has enacted a law aimed at curbing child pornography on the internet .
but in the face of criticism and protests , the law wo n't be enforced , says the government . a new law to curb child pornography has come into force in germany , but , in a legal curiosity , it is not going to be used by the courts .
the salient point is that instead of blocking child porn websites , the government now thinks it would better to erase them . the controversial legislation was drafted in 2009 by the former conservative family minister , ursula von der leyen , who said that she was willing to act against " a massive spread of child pornography on the internet . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ursula von der leyen is eager to stop child abuse material on the internet " we are no longer going to tolerate the fact that pictures of children being raped are massively accessed and distributed on the internet in germany , " she said , shortly before introducing the bill to parliament last year . mere symbolism under the new law , the german federal criminal office -lrb- bka -rrb- is supposed to provide a regularly updated list of websites , which they 've found to contain child pornographic pictures and images . german internet providers must then post a red " stop " sign on them , but are not allowed to erase them .
the german law also does n't extend to providers based abroad . christian bahls from the organisation " abuse victims against internet access blocking " accused the government of pursuing " a policy of symbolism , " which he described as " a slap in the face of the victims of child pornography . " " the victims of abuse are being abused again , namely as symbols in a questionable government campaign , " he said . freedom vs crime fighting since last summer , there 's been a groundswell of protests by germans who see the law as a first step on the path towards government censorship of the internet . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protestors demanding internet freedom did n't want to listen to the government 's arguments franziska heine has been spearheading a public pressure campaign called " expedition against internet blocking , " which is aimed at forcing parliament to re-introduce the law . about 134.000 germans have signed on to an official petition to parliament pressed by the group . mrs heine claimed that the law was based on " entirely false information " about the distribution of child pornography . " the law has huge repercussion for the freedom of information , but does little to help the victims , " she said . mrs heine 's opinion is supported by police specialists investigating cases of child pornography . frank federau , a member of a special unit at the regional police office in the federal state of lower saxony , believes child abuse material is not primarily exchanged using the internet . " the internet is a channel of communication for paedophiles , but the material as such is distributed on cds and dvds via ordinary mail . " legal doubts wolfgang hoffmann-riem , an expert on constitutional law , even believed that the new law was not in line with the german constitution . " the fact that the federal criminal office has been made responsible for providing the list of websites to be banned , is a clear breach of power-sharing laws in germany . " hoffman-riem pointed out that police in the 16 german federal states were in charge of crime fighting and investigating criminal content on the internet , and that the law infringed upon their duties . in the face of so much criticism , the government has decided to amend the law in the course of the next few months . the new legislation , the government said , would then allow providers to erase child pornography websites . author : uwe hessler editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but it is unlikely to trigger a domino effect among other countries who have troops there . by the sheer number of troops , the dutch deployment does n't rank among top international contingents in afghanistan .
however , its force of 1,800 soldiers has not only been in charge of the uruzgan province in the dangerous southern part of the country , but has generally been seen as doing an excellent job there .
so the planned dutch pullout from afghanistan as a consequence of the governmen crisis in the hague will clearly have repercussions for nato 's military mission in the country at a time when most allies are already under pressure to justify their engagement at home .
this has already led to worries about a possible domino effect in the sense that other countries might also feel forced to reconsider their committments to afghanistan .
" it 's true that the afghanistan mission is very unpopular in many european countries , so it is definitely a cause for concern if the dutch withdraw on account of the collapsed government , " eva gross , who heads the eu foreign and security policy program at the institute for european studies at vrije universiteit brussel in belgium , told deutsche welle .
" but to speak of a domino effect may be overstating the case . "
each country in europe has its own dynamics and traditions , therefore gross does n't believe an automatic discussion about troop withdrawals in other eu states is likely .
german troop increase will go ahead for germany , where a parliamentary vote on the expansion of berlin 's afghan mission is scheduled for later this week , the dutch decision wo n't have an immediate effect either , argue experts .
public opinion in germany ca n't be swayed much by the dutch political crisis because a solid majority of germans is already against the military engagement in afghanistan , says klaus-peter schoeppner , head of tns emnid , a major german polling and reseach firm .
while germans are very skeptical about the afghan misson , schoeppner thinks that most of them can live with the exit scenario envisaged by the government .
" so , i do n't think that this topic will gain much traction in germany , " he told deutsche welle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany plans to send up to 850 additional troops to afghanistan what 's more , adds schoeppner , germans do n't view the mission in afghanistan as predominantly a military one .
" we regard ourselves as the number one humanitarian nation , " said schoeppner .
a fast withdrawal from afghanistan would not only end germany 's military , but also its humanitarian responsibilities .
currently there is no indication that this is a likely option for the government , he added .
" i am fairly confindent that the increase of troops will go through in parliament , mainly because the political elites have been in favor of a continuation of the mandate , " said gross .
exit strategies while the dutch withdrawal will not have any imminent effect on the committments of other allies , it will further increase the debate in many countries about timetables and exit strategies .
" we have seen this in discussions already in germany , britain or the united states that the focus is now already much more on finding ways of withdrawing their troops from afghanistan , " said gross .
that could make it hard for nato to find a replacement for dutch troops , if the new government in the hague does in fact decide to withdraw its soldiers .
australia already publicly dismissed a possible leadership role in uruzgan province and canada has said it wants to pull out its troops at the end of next year .
germany , which is currently in charge of the regional command in the north of afghanistan , has repeatedly rejected a german engagement in the south and is unlikely to change that position .
" i think it would be difficult for us to do more in afghanistan , because others leave , " said schoeppner .
if no other countries are willing to take over the dutch role in the south , the us might ultimately be forced to fulfill that task itself .
as an alternative , american officials have aired a possible role for non-nato troops in afghanistan .
but whether such an expansion of the afghan mission is realistic and how it could work is still unclear .
explaining the mission at least for now then , the political turmoil over the future of dutch troops in afghanistan will merely increase the pressure on nato planners to sketch out possible scenarios for a dutch withdrawal and not lead to a domino effect in other countries .
however , argue experts , since public sentiment is already very pessimistic about the afghan mission , military events on the ground can always have a major impact on public opinion .
bildunterschrift : politicians must better explain the rationale behind the afghan mission , say experts " in most countries a a rather large attack with loss of life would probably push the public to reject military engagement , " said gross .
since that is always possible , governments can only do one thing : " they have to communicate the reasons why we are in afghanistan much better and much more carefully .
i think the dutch withdrawal and the collapse of the government definitely highlights that the european public is unconvinced of the value of the afghan mission and that european politicians have some explaining to do , " she said .

soldiers tell of rituals with names like " fire dance " and the " jukebox " . germany 's parliamentary commissioner for the armed forces , reinhold robbe , said he had received 54 written accounts of abuse and degrading treatment since he submitted a report about hazing in the military .
several of the letters he received from soldiers corroborated previous allegations that mountain infantry troops at a camp in bavaria had been forced to drink alcohol and eat raw pork liver until they threw up .
robbe , a member of the social democratic party , demanded that the training curriculum be changed and said that the " dangerous , tasteless rituals must stop . "
fire dances and jukeboxes the new letters also bring to light other forms of hazing .
one former member of the marines said that new sailors were often subjected to harsh rituals during their first nights at sea .
he described the " fire dance , " in which a man was forced to strip off his pants and have a lighted wick placed in his anus ; another in which a floor polishing machine with rough bristles was held against a recruit 's naked bottom until the skin turned red .
a volunteer soldier stationed in southern germany between 1996 and 1998 told of soldiers being forced to play " jukebox , " during which they were shut into a locker , which was then stood upside down , and the occupant forced to sing certain songs .
defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg renewed his promise of a complete investigation .
he did not rule out the possibility of disciplinary action for those involved , although he warned against making an across-the-board judgment .
" every case must be pursued judiciously and emphatically , " guttenberg told fellow christian democrat politicians in berlin on tuesday. svs / dpa / apn editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the draft law , which both the german parliament and chancellor angela merkel 's cabinet are to consider in the coming weeks , would cut state-guaranteed prices by 15 percent for energy produced by solar panels on open ground .
it would also cut prices by 16 percent for solar panels on roofs , where 80 percent of solar panels in germany are , and eliminate subsidies for panels placed on arable land .
a previous plan by environment minister norbert roettgen was criticized for not going far enough .
" there must be no more panels installed on arable land , " said peter altmaier , a member of merkel 's christian democrat union -lrb- cdu -rrb- who follows the solar energy sector .
" the objective is to reduce excessive stimulation without hindering an expansion of green energy . "
unintended consequences experts have criticized solar energy subsidies in germany for failing to spur competition in the industry , which accounts for less than one percent of all german electricity production .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : environmental groups have called the law a betrayal of renewable energy the subsidies have also had several unintended consequences : farmers have installed solar panels on their arable fields ; also , the global market has greatly increased , helping manufacturers in china , where labor is cheaper .
germany remains the world leader in solar panel production , but manufacturers have lost billions of euros in recent years and have been forced to cut and outsource jobs .
german group q-cells grew significantly until posting a 1.36-billion euro -lrb- $ 1.84 billion -rrb- net loss in 2009 .
support and opposition the reduction would save german consumers some of the one billion euros they pay per month in fees that underwrite solar energy production , according to hans-peter friedrich , a leader in the cdu 's bavarian sister party , the christian social union .
the law is supported by farmers resentful of investors who bought up arable land only to " harvest the sunshine . "
but the solar panel manufacturing lobby staunchly opposes the cutbacks , and some companies gave employees the day off to protest the law in berlin .
environmental groups also criticized the government , calling the law a betrayal of renewable energy. acb / apn / dpa / afp / reuters editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the draft law , which both the german parliament and chancellor angela merkel 's cabinet are to consider in the coming weeks , would cut state-guaranteed prices by 15 percent for energy produced by solar panels on open ground .
it would also cut prices by 16 percent for solar panels on roofs , where 80 percent of solar panels in germany are , and eliminate subsidies for panels placed on arable land .
a previous plan by environment minister norbert roettgen was criticized for not going far enough .
" there must be no more panels installed on arable land , " said peter altmaier , a member of merkel 's christian democrat union -lrb- cdu -rrb- who follows the solar energy sector .
" the objective is to reduce excessive stimulation without hindering an expansion of green energy . "
unintended consequences experts have criticized solar energy subsidies in germany for failing to spur competition in the industry , which accounts for less than one percent of all german electricity production .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : environmental groups have called the law a betrayal of renewable energy the subsidies have also had several unintended consequences : farmers have installed solar panels on their arable fields ; also , the global market has greatly increased , helping manufacturers in china , where labor is cheaper .

minister aigner said her staff were consulting with justice ministry officials , with the aim of tightening legislation .

she is demanding that google 's panoramic cameras be mounted no higher than 1.8 meters – instead of the current 2.5 meters on camera cars – so that views over fences and walls into residents ' gardens and courtyards are blocked .

soldiers tell of rituals with names like " fire dance " and the " jukebox " . germany 's parliamentary commissioner for the armed forces , reinhold robbe , said he had received 54 written accounts of abuse and degrading treatment since he submitted a report about hazing in the military .
several of the letters he received from soldiers corroborated previous allegations that mountain infantry troops at a camp in bavaria had been forced to drink alcohol and eat raw pork liver until they threw up .
robbe , a member of the social democratic party , demanded that the training curriculum be changed and said that the " dangerous , tasteless rituals must stop . "
fire dances and jukeboxes the new letters also bring to light other forms of hazing .
one former member of the marines said that new sailors were often subjected to harsh rituals during their first nights at sea .
he described the " fire dance , " in which a man was forced to strip off his pants and have a lighted wick placed in his anus ; another in which a floor polishing machine with rough bristles was held against a recruit 's naked bottom until the skin turned red .
a volunteer soldier stationed in southern germany between 1996 and 1998 told of soldiers being forced to play " jukebox , " during which they were shut into a locker , which was then stood upside down , and the occupant forced to sing certain songs .
defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg renewed his promise of a complete investigation .
he did not rule out the possibility of disciplinary action for those involved , although he warned against making an across-the-board judgment .
" every case must be pursued judiciously and emphatically , " guttenberg told fellow christian democrat politicians in berlin on tuesday. svs / dpa / apn editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but it is unlikely to trigger a domino effect among other countries who have troops there . by the sheer number of troops , the dutch deployment does n't rank among top international contingents in afghanistan .
however , its force of 1,800 soldiers has not only been in charge of the uruzgan province in the dangerous southern part of the country , but has generally been seen as doing an excellent job there .
so the planned dutch pullout from afghanistan as a consequence of the governmen crisis in the hague will clearly have repercussions for nato 's military mission in the country at a time when most allies are already under pressure to justify their engagement at home .
this has already led to worries about a possible domino effect in the sense that other countries might also feel forced to reconsider their committments to afghanistan .
" it 's true that the afghanistan mission is very unpopular in many european countries , so it is definitely a cause for concern if the dutch withdraw on account of the collapsed government , " eva gross , who heads the eu foreign and security policy program at the institute for european studies at vrije universiteit brussel in belgium , told deutsche welle .
" but to speak of a domino effect may be overstating the case . "
each country in europe has its own dynamics and traditions , therefore gross does n't believe an automatic discussion about troop withdrawals in other eu states is likely .
german troop increase will go ahead for germany , where a parliamentary vote on the expansion of berlin 's afghan mission is scheduled for later this week , the dutch decision wo n't have an immediate effect either , argue experts .
public opinion in germany ca n't be swayed much by the dutch political crisis because a solid majority of germans is already against the military engagement in afghanistan , says klaus-peter schoeppner , head of tns emnid , a major german polling and reseach firm .
while germans are very skeptical about the afghan misson , schoeppner thinks that most of them can live with the exit scenario envisaged by the government .
" so , i do n't think that this topic will gain much traction in germany , " he told deutsche welle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany plans to send up to 850 additional troops to afghanistan what 's more , adds schoeppner , germans do n't view the mission in afghanistan as predominantly a military one .
" we regard ourselves as the number one humanitarian nation , " said schoeppner .
a fast withdrawal from afghanistan would not only end germany 's military , but also its humanitarian responsibilities .
currently there is no indication that this is a likely option for the government , he added .
" i am fairly confindent that the increase of troops will go through in parliament , mainly because the political elites have been in favor of a continuation of the mandate , " said gross .
exit strategies while the dutch withdrawal will not have any imminent effect on the committments of other allies , it will further increase the debate in many countries about timetables and exit strategies .
" we have seen this in discussions already in germany , britain or the united states that the focus is now already much more on finding ways of withdrawing their troops from afghanistan , " said gross .
that could make it hard for nato to find a replacement for dutch troops , if the new government in the hague does in fact decide to withdraw its soldiers .
australia already publicly dismissed a possible leadership role in uruzgan province and canada has said it wants to pull out its troops at the end of next year .
germany , which is currently in charge of the regional command in the north of afghanistan , has repeatedly rejected a german engagement in the south and is unlikely to change that position .
" i think it would be difficult for us to do more in afghanistan , because others leave , " said schoeppner .
if no other countries are willing to take over the dutch role in the south , the us might ultimately be forced to fulfill that task itself .
as an alternative , american officials have aired a possible role for non-nato troops in afghanistan .
but whether such an expansion of the afghan mission is realistic and how it could work is still unclear .
explaining the mission at least for now then , the political turmoil over the future of dutch troops in afghanistan will merely increase the pressure on nato planners to sketch out possible scenarios for a dutch withdrawal and not lead to a domino effect in other countries .
however , argue experts , since public sentiment is already very pessimistic about the afghan mission , military events on the ground can always have a major impact on public opinion .
bildunterschrift : politicians must better explain the rationale behind the afghan mission , say experts " in most countries a a rather large attack with loss of life would probably push the public to reject military engagement , " said gross .
since that is always possible , governments can only do one thing : " they have to communicate the reasons why we are in afghanistan much better and much more carefully .
i think the dutch withdrawal and the collapse of the government definitely highlights that the european public is unconvinced of the value of the afghan mission and that european politicians have some explaining to do , " she said .

the two clubs now await a second duel in spain in march . stuttgart made the most of the capacity home crowd at mercedes-benz arena , starting the match energetically and taking it to barcelona .
the early initiative paid dividends when brazilian forward cacau headed in a perfect timo gebhart center ball from the right on the 25-minute mark .
the germans continued to press barcelona 's defense and came close to snatching goals on three more occasions , in addition to an appeal for handball by barca defender gerard pique .
at the outset of the second half , barcelona came out a different team and pulled level within seven minutes through frontman zlatan ibrahimovic .
the opportunity came when stuttgart failed to clear a corner and the ball came back in for pique , who headed down for ibrahimovic to volley home .
the initial shot was parried by stuttgart keeper jens lehmann , but ibrahimovic was able to knock the rebound over the goal line .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cacau 's goal came midway through the first half the catalans dominated the remainder of the clash , a fact stuttgart coach christian gross seized upon .
" we should have scored a second goal in the first half , " gross said following the match .
" we had clear chances . "
barcelona midfielder andreas iniesta was upbeat about the result , saying he was confident the ball was now in barcelona 's court .
" we knew that it was going to be a difficult game , " said the spain international .
" and the truth is that they really made us suffer in the first half .
" now we have the tie in our favor , but there are still 90 minutes left to play . "
in tuesday night 's other champions league clash , french club bordeaux defeated greek giants olympiacos 0-1 away from home .

the two clubs now await a second duel in spain in march . stuttgart made the most of the capacity home crowd at mercedes-benz arena , starting the match energetically and taking it to barcelona .
the early initiative paid dividends when brazilian forward cacau headed in a perfect timo gebhart center ball from the right on the 25-minute mark .
the germans continued to press barcelona 's defense and came close to snatching goals on three more occasions , in addition to an appeal for handball by barca defender gerard pique .
at the outset of the second half , barcelona came out a different team and pulled level within seven minutes through frontman zlatan ibrahimovic .
the opportunity came when stuttgart failed to clear a corner and the ball came back in for pique , who headed down for ibrahimovic to volley home .
the initial shot was parried by stuttgart keeper jens lehmann , but ibrahimovic was able to knock the rebound over the goal line .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de afghanistan -pipe- 23.02.2010 dutch pullout will give nato headaches , but wo n't lead to domino effect großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it could be hard for nato to find a replacement for dutch troops a withdrawal of dutch troops from afghanistan would certainly increase the pressure on its allies to take their place .
but it is unlikely to trigger a domino effect among other countries who have troops there . by the sheer number of troops , the dutch deployment does n't rank among top international contingents in afghanistan .
however , its force of 1,800 soldiers has not only been in charge of the uruzgan province in the dangerous southern part of the country , but has generally been seen as doing an excellent job there .
so the planned dutch pullout from afghanistan as a consequence of the governmen crisis in the hague will clearly have repercussions for nato 's military mission in the country at a time when most allies are already under pressure to justify their engagement at home .
this has already led to worries about a possible domino effect in the sense that other countries might also feel forced to reconsider their committments to afghanistan .
" it 's true that the afghanistan mission is very unpopular in many european countries , so it is definitely a cause for concern if the dutch withdraw on account of the collapsed government , " eva gross , who heads the eu foreign and security policy program at the institute for european studies at vrije universiteit brussel in belgium , told deutsche welle .
" but to speak of a domino effect may be overstating the case . "
each country in europe has its own dynamics and traditions , therefore gross does n't believe an automatic discussion about troop withdrawals in other eu states is likely .
german troop increase will go ahead for germany , where a parliamentary vote on the expansion of berlin 's afghan mission is scheduled for later this week , the dutch decision wo n't have an immediate effect either , argue experts .
public opinion in germany ca n't be swayed much by the dutch political crisis because a solid majority of germans is already against the military engagement in afghanistan , says klaus-peter schoeppner , head of tns emnid , a major german polling and reseach firm .
while germans are very skeptical about the afghan misson , schoeppner thinks that most of them can live with the exit scenario envisaged by the government .
" so , i do n't think that this topic will gain much traction in germany , " he told deutsche welle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany plans to send up to 850 additional troops to afghanistan what 's more , adds schoeppner , germans do n't view the mission in afghanistan as predominantly a military one .
" we regard ourselves as the number one humanitarian nation , " said schoeppner .
a fast withdrawal from afghanistan would not only end germany 's military , but also its humanitarian responsibilities .
currently there is no indication that this is a likely option for the government , he added .
" i am fairly confindent that the increase of troops will go through in parliament , mainly because the political elites have been in favor of a continuation of the mandate , " said gross .
exit strategies while the dutch withdrawal will not have any imminent effect on the committments of other allies , it will further increase the debate in many countries about timetables and exit strategies .
" we have seen this in discussions already in germany , britain or the united states that the focus is now already much more on finding ways of withdrawing their troops from afghanistan , " said gross .
that could make it hard for nato to find a replacement for dutch troops , if the new government in the hague does in fact decide to withdraw its soldiers .
australia already publicly dismissed a possible leadership role in uruzgan province and canada has said it wants to pull out its troops at the end of next year .
germany , which is currently in charge of the regional command in the north of afghanistan , has repeatedly rejected a german engagement in the south and is unlikely to change that position .
" i think it would be difficult for us to do more in afghanistan , because others leave , " said schoeppner .
if no other countries are willing to take over the dutch role in the south , the us might ultimately be forced to fulfill that task itself .
as an alternative , american officials have aired a possible role for non-nato troops in afghanistan .
but whether such an expansion of the afghan mission is realistic and how it could work is still unclear .

however , its force of 1,800 soldiers has not only been in charge of the uruzgan province in the dangerous southern part of the country , but has generally been seen as doing an excellent job there .
so the planned dutch pullout from afghanistan as a consequence of the governmen crisis in the hague will clearly have repercussions for nato 's military mission in the country at a time when most allies are already under pressure to justify their engagement at home .
this has already led to worries about a possible domino effect in the sense that other countries might also feel forced to reconsider their committments to afghanistan .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de energy -pipe- 23.02.2010 germany to cut subsidies for solar energy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is the world leader in solar panel production a law proposed by chancellor angela merkel 's government would greatly reduce subsidies for solar energy production , and in some cases eliminate them all together . the center-right german government is proposing legislation to severely reduce state subsidies to solar power in an attempt to prevent market saturation and save money .
the draft law , which both the german parliament and chancellor angela merkel 's cabinet are to consider in the coming weeks , would cut state-guaranteed prices by 15 percent for energy produced by solar panels on open ground .
it would also cut prices by 16 percent for solar panels on roofs , where 80 percent of solar panels in germany are , and eliminate subsidies for panels placed on arable land .
a previous plan by environment minister norbert roettgen was criticized for not going far enough .
" there must be no more panels installed on arable land , " said peter altmaier , a member of merkel 's christian democrat union -lrb- cdu -rrb- who follows the solar energy sector .
" the objective is to reduce excessive stimulation without hindering an expansion of green energy . "
unintended consequences experts have criticized solar energy subsidies in germany for failing to spur competition in the industry , which accounts for less than one percent of all german electricity production .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : environmental groups have called the law a betrayal of renewable energy the subsidies have also had several unintended consequences : farmers have installed solar panels on their arable fields ; also , the global market has greatly increased , helping manufacturers in china , where labor is cheaper .
germany remains the world leader in solar panel production , but manufacturers have lost billions of euros in recent years and have been forced to cut and outsource jobs .
german group q-cells grew significantly until posting a 1.36-billion euro -lrb- $ 1.84 billion -rrb- net loss in 2009 .
support and opposition the reduction would save german consumers some of the one billion euros they pay per month in fees that underwrite solar energy production , according to hans-peter friedrich , a leader in the cdu 's bavarian sister party , the christian social union .
the law is supported by farmers resentful of investors who bought up arable land only to " harvest the sunshine . "
but the solar panel manufacturing lobby staunchly opposes the cutbacks , and some companies gave employees the day off to protest the law in berlin .
environmental groups also criticized the government , calling the law a betrayal of renewable energy. acb / apn / dpa / afp / reuters editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de germany 's solar industry worried about future in wake of subsidy cuts stocks in solar technology companies fell in german trading following news that chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats may press for bigger cuts to solar subsidies than sought by the environment ministry .
-lrb- 21.01.2010 -rrb- solar thermal energy on the march the global market for solar thermal energy has skyrocketed , particularly in china .
despite the boom , what 's considered the most important of all solar technologies still has a long way to reach its true potential .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de africa -pipe- 23.02.2010 corruption stifles learning in africa , report finds großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : corruption is still keeping some african children out of the classroom a new report from anti-corruption organisation transparency international has found that systematic corruption and mismanagement are keeping many african children from a decent education , despite years of reform . when it comes to tackling poverty , poor health or limited opportunities for growth , a good education is widely seen as a magic bullet for developing countries .
indeed , education is considered so crucial that when the united nations released its millennium development goals for 2015 , universal primary education was slated as the number two priority , second only to eradicating extreme poverty and hunger .
but a report released by berlin-based anti-corruption organisation transparency international suggests that endemic corruption in african schooling systems is still seeing large numbers of primary-aged african children denied their right to an education .
" basically all issues around resourcing had a dimension of corruption , with resources being exploited or embezzled by someone for private gain , but sometimes also just plain mismanagement , " said stephane stassen , who co-authored the report .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : giving children an education is crucial in post-war sierra leone the transparency international study " good governance lessons for primary education " was produced as part of the organisation 's africa education watch initiative and examined the impact of corruption on education quality and availability in seven african countries , interviewing over 8500 educators and parents in ghana , madagascar , morocco , niger , senegal , sierra leone and uganda .
change coming too slow to the continent the data collected paints a troubling picture of education in africa : despite two decades of reforms designed to allow greater levels of management at the local level and improve accountability , school administration is still not , for the most part , a genuinely corruption-free and participatory governance system .
" despite all these measures , there were still many governance challenges , " said stephane stassen , who heads transparency international 's africa education watch program .
one of the most striking examples is that of so-called registration fees , which parents from every country surveyed reported paying , although by law primary schooling is free .
the number of parents forced to pay these illegal accounting fees ranged from 9 % in ghana , to 90 % in morocco , the report found .
" similarly , in some countries where they had also abolished exam fees , they were still being charged , " said stassen .
he added that in many countries , textbooks were often not available .
and even if they were dispatched to schools , they were often not distributed for free .
the problems were also identified at higher levels , for example when schools receiving grants with which to run themselves were not receiving the full amount , or it was coming with a delay .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most parents can not afford high school fees the average cost of enrolling a primary-aged child in an african school for one year is three euros .
by comparison , the average per capita income in sierra leone is just us $ 260 -lrb- 190 euros -rrb- per year .
the costs charged for " free " textbooks as well as the fees of illegal " compulsory tutoring " - charged by some teachers to supplement their meagre incomes - puts an additional strain on african families .
crucial learning years missed these prohibitively high costs can lead to higher school dropout rates at a crucial time in children 's lives . " primary education is really the place where you get the basics for your life later on .
this is where you learn to read and write , this is where you learn to count , and if , for example if in africa you want to have a chance in trade or to go beyond your village , these are really skills you need to acquire . "
stassen said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : illiteracy among older people is high in many parts of africa he added that without a basic education , it would be nearly impossible to go on to high school or college .
" it 's really hard to get people back to school later on , and this is why we have to get things right now " .
literacy remains low in many parts of africa .
in senegal , for instance , just 43 percent of adults were considered literate in 2007 , compared to 72 percent in madagascar .
despite the obstacles , enrolment figures for primary-aged children in africa are on the increase .
according to 2009 figures from the un , net enrolment in sub-saharan africa went from 58 percent in 2000 to 74 percent in 2007 and from 91 percent to 96 percent over the same period of time in northern africa .
but enrolment figures do not tell the whole story : not only may corrupt practices prevent children from attending school , but they also lower the quality of education for students once they get there .
" even if you are in class , it might mean that you do n't learn much , because you have one textbook for ten learners if not more , " stassen said mismanagement partly to blame in many schools , the report found resources were being wasted or lost , not wilfully , but because those responsible for their management were simply ill-equipped for the job .
overall , 85 percent of schools across all countries had either deficient accounting systems or none at all , and in morocco , just 23 percent of head teachers received training in financial management , despite being responsible for budgets .
in niger that figure drops to just 8 percent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stephane stassen heads transparency international 's africa education watch program " schools where the head teacher had been trained and prepared to do his job in terms of managing the resources of the schools were … the schools where less of these corrupt practices were appearing , " said stassen .
" in a sense , what we found was that head teachers and teachers themselves were really feeling that they had been abandoned by the system . "
a way forward universal schooling for primary-aged children may be untenable by 2015 , but transparency international 's report suggests the reforms that have been made to date are in fact helping african schoolchildren .
the report found that schools that were more frequently audited tended to perform better : education outcomes were better and parents reported paying fewer illegal fees .
training in financial management for head teachers and school management committees could be strengthened , said stassen , to improve accountability .
stassen added that helping african parents to understand more about their rights within the schooling system was a crucial step in increasing engagement and accountability .
" i think that by combining inspections , grassroots accountability and better transparency in the system , you could really have an education system which is more efficient and better-resourced . "

the draft law , which both the german parliament and chancellor angela merkel 's cabinet are to consider in the coming weeks , would cut state-guaranteed prices by 15 percent for energy produced by solar panels on open ground .
it would also cut prices by 16 percent for solar panels on roofs , where 80 percent of solar panels in germany are , and eliminate subsidies for panels placed on arable land .
a previous plan by environment minister norbert roettgen was criticized for not going far enough .
" there must be no more panels installed on arable land , " said peter altmaier , a member of merkel 's christian democrat union -lrb- cdu -rrb- who follows the solar energy sector .
" the objective is to reduce excessive stimulation without hindering an expansion of green energy . "
unintended consequences experts have criticized solar energy subsidies in germany for failing to spur competition in the industry , which accounts for less than one percent of all german electricity production .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : environmental groups have called the law a betrayal of renewable energy the subsidies have also had several unintended consequences : farmers have installed solar panels on their arable fields ; also , the global market has greatly increased , helping manufacturers in china , where labor is cheaper .
germany remains the world leader in solar panel production , but manufacturers have lost billions of euros in recent years and have been forced to cut and outsource jobs .
german group q-cells grew significantly until posting a 1.36-billion euro -lrb- $ 1.84 billion -rrb- net loss in 2009 .
support and opposition the reduction would save german consumers some of the one billion euros they pay per month in fees that underwrite solar energy production , according to hans-peter friedrich , a leader in the cdu 's bavarian sister party , the christian social union .
the law is supported by farmers resentful of investors who bought up arable land only to " harvest the sunshine . "
but the solar panel manufacturing lobby staunchly opposes the cutbacks , and some companies gave employees the day off to protest the law in berlin .
environmental groups also criticized the government , calling the law a betrayal of renewable energy. acb / apn / dpa / afp / reuters editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the draft law , which both the german parliament and chancellor angela merkel 's cabinet are to consider in the coming weeks , would cut state-guaranteed prices by 15 percent for energy produced by solar panels on open ground .
it would also cut prices by 16 percent for solar panels on roofs , where 80 percent of solar panels in germany are , and eliminate subsidies for panels placed on arable land .
a previous plan by environment minister norbert roettgen was criticized for not going far enough .
" there must be no more panels installed on arable land , " said peter altmaier , a member of merkel 's christian democrat union -lrb- cdu -rrb- who follows the solar energy sector .
" the objective is to reduce excessive stimulation without hindering an expansion of green energy . "
unintended consequences experts have criticized solar energy subsidies in germany for failing to spur competition in the industry , which accounts for less than one percent of all german electricity production .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : environmental groups have called the law a betrayal of renewable energy the subsidies have also had several unintended consequences : farmers have installed solar panels on their arable fields ; also , the global market has greatly increased , helping manufacturers in china , where labor is cheaper .
germany remains the world leader in solar panel production , but manufacturers have lost billions of euros in recent years and have been forced to cut and outsource jobs .
german group q-cells grew significantly until posting a 1.36-billion euro -lrb- $ 1.84 billion -rrb- net loss in 2009 .
support and opposition the reduction would save german consumers some of the one billion euros they pay per month in fees that underwrite solar energy production , according to hans-peter friedrich , a leader in the cdu 's bavarian sister party , the christian social union .
the law is supported by farmers resentful of investors who bought up arable land only to " harvest the sunshine . "
but the solar panel manufacturing lobby staunchly opposes the cutbacks , and some companies gave employees the day off to protest the law in berlin .
environmental groups also criticized the government , calling the law a betrayal of renewable energy. acb / apn / dpa / afp / reuters editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

pilot union cockpit agreed not to call any further strikes before march 8 .
it welcomed monday 's court decision to resume wage talks . the pilot 's union also withdrew variable compensation , or profit sharing , from its list of key demands , which had been misinterpreted .
both sides agreed to return to the negotiating table without setting any preconditions .
germany 's national carrier confirmed that both parties would resume talks immediately .
" the parties agreed in front of the court that the strike is to be suspended through the 8th of march " , lufthansa spokesman andreas bartels told ap news agency . lufthansa said the 4,000 pilots will return to work tuesday though it would take some time for normal operations to resume .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : normal operations to resume after striking pilots agree to suspend strike the walkout began midnight monday and caused the cancellation of hundreds of flights on germany 's largest airline , disrupting travel for thousands of people .
lufthansa had asked a frankfurt labor court for an injunction against the strike , which had threatened to drag on until thursday .
representatives from the union and lufthansa agreed to resume talks as they met before a judge monday evening .
travel chaos averted the airline had earlier predicted that the strike would cause about 800 flights per day to be canceled , totaling 3,200 flights for the week .
international routes were hardest hit by the strike , while most domestic service remained intact , lufthansa said .
cockpit spokesman joerg handwerg told the afp news agency that the strike was " a great success . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de internet -pipe- 23.02.2010 google rejects berlin 's privacy concerns over street view application großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : google says street view offers a unique new experience internet giant google said tuesday it aimed to launch its street view application in germany by the end of the year .
yet berlin insists there are concerns that the technology could breach privacy laws . google , which wants to extend its street view panoramic photos to germany later this year , has rejected strong privacy objections raised by the german government .
consumer affairs minister ilse aigner is demanding that the internet giant only displays its imagery after each affected german citizen has given his or her permission .
minister aigner said her staff were consulting with justice ministry officials , with the aim of tightening legislation .
she also demanded that google be ready to make people 's faces , car and house numbers , and even facades unrecognizable .
" a vague picture pixel change is not sufficient , " she said in berlin .
" i do not share the company 's assessment that all personal data concerns have been resolved . "
her ministry , she said , had been flooded with calls by citizens worried about protecting their privacy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a stroll in the internet , but is data privacy safeguarded ?
the head of google 's legal department , arnd haller said " we take personal data privacy very seriously .
we 've been discussing privacy issues all over europe , but here in germany the intensity of the questions is really impressive . "
a consultant hired by google , nikolas forgo , who is a hanover professor on informatics law , said a violation of personal rights was improbable .
google has already pledged to disguise car number plates and peoples ' faces .
berlin says google needs individual permission aigner had recently accused google 's service of being on the verge of violating the privacy of millions of citizens , each individually .
she demanded that google seek the permission from each person photographed on streets prior to publication .
street view photos are taken by camera cars which can capture all-round 360-degrees images .
these enable google users to simulate a stroll while sitting at their computers .
google has been gathering images of streets and public spaces in germany since 2008 .
the online service began in 2007 in four cities in the united states .
australia and japan soon followed .
in total google has initiated similar imaging projects in 19 countries , including many in europe .
satellites help pinpoint the panoramic scenes on maps using geo-data systems .
in a special exception for germany , haller said individuals would be able to file an objection with google to seek the removal of recognizable features .
" we 've a web site on-line with the relevant names and places where google street views are taken .
we also allow users to opt out in advance . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : street view is already available in several european countries " an immersive experience " google software developer raphael leiteritz said he believed street view was worth fighting for : " cards and maps have been two-dimensional for many years .
street view for the first time gives you an immersive experience .
you do n't look on a city from the top .
you can visit it and you can look around . "
that does not impress aigner .
she is demanding that google 's panoramic cameras be mounted no higher than 1.8 meters – instead of the current 2.5 meters on camera cars – so that views over fences and walls into residents ' gardens and courtyards are blocked .
other data privacy advocates also point out that potential burglars can use such internet imagery to recognize and target properties .
aigner told german public radio that google must act " definitively " on objections lodged by citizens , even to the point of making a building unrecognizable .
her ministry , she added , had placed a standardized complaint form on its website. ipj / apn / dpa / afp editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

yet berlin insists there are concerns that the technology could breach privacy laws . google , which wants to extend its street view panoramic photos to germany later this year , has rejected strong privacy objections raised by the german government .
consumer affairs minister ilse aigner is demanding that the internet giant only displays its imagery after each affected german citizen has given his or her permission .
minister aigner said her staff were consulting with justice ministry officials , with the aim of tightening legislation .
she also demanded that google be ready to make people 's faces , car and house numbers , and even facades unrecognizable .
" a vague picture pixel change is not sufficient , " she said in berlin .
" i do not share the company 's assessment that all personal data concerns have been resolved . "
her ministry , she said , had been flooded with calls by citizens worried about protecting their privacy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a stroll in the internet , but is data privacy safeguarded ?
the head of google 's legal department , arnd haller said " we take personal data privacy very seriously .
we 've been discussing privacy issues all over europe , but here in germany the intensity of the questions is really impressive . "
a consultant hired by google , nikolas forgo , who is a hanover professor on informatics law , said a violation of personal rights was improbable .
google has already pledged to disguise car number plates and peoples ' faces .
berlin says google needs individual permission aigner had recently accused google 's service of being on the verge of violating the privacy of millions of citizens , each individually .
she demanded that google seek the permission from each person photographed on streets prior to publication .
street view photos are taken by camera cars which can capture all-round 360-degrees images .
these enable google users to simulate a stroll while sitting at their computers .
google has been gathering images of streets and public spaces in germany since 2008 .
the online service began in 2007 in four cities in the united states .
australia and japan soon followed .
in total google has initiated similar imaging projects in 19 countries , including many in europe .
satellites help pinpoint the panoramic scenes on maps using geo-data systems .
in a special exception for germany , haller said individuals would be able to file an objection with google to seek the removal of recognizable features .
" we 've a web site on-line with the relevant names and places where google street views are taken .
we also allow users to opt out in advance . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : street view is already available in several european countries " an immersive experience " google software developer raphael leiteritz said he believed street view was worth fighting for : " cards and maps have been two-dimensional for many years .
street view for the first time gives you an immersive experience .
you do n't look on a city from the top .
you can visit it and you can look around . "
that does not impress aigner .
she is demanding that google 's panoramic cameras be mounted no higher than 1.8 meters – instead of the current 2.5 meters on camera cars – so that views over fences and walls into residents ' gardens and courtyards are blocked .
other data privacy advocates also point out that potential burglars can use such internet imagery to recognize and target properties .
aigner told german public radio that google must act " definitively " on objections lodged by citizens , even to the point of making a building unrecognizable .
her ministry , she added , had placed a standardized complaint form on its website. ipj / apn / dpa / afp editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de internet -pipe- 23.02.2010 google rejects berlin 's privacy concerns over street view application großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : google says street view offers a unique new experience internet giant google said tuesday it aimed to launch its street view application in germany by the end of the year .
yet berlin insists there are concerns that the technology could breach privacy laws . google , which wants to extend its street view panoramic photos to germany later this year , has rejected strong privacy objections raised by the german government .
consumer affairs minister ilse aigner is demanding that the internet giant only displays its imagery after each affected german citizen has given his or her permission .
minister aigner said her staff were consulting with justice ministry officials , with the aim of tightening legislation .
she also demanded that google be ready to make people 's faces , car and house numbers , and even facades unrecognizable .
" a vague picture pixel change is not sufficient , " she said in berlin .
" i do not share the company 's assessment that all personal data concerns have been resolved . "
her ministry , she said , had been flooded with calls by citizens worried about protecting their privacy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a stroll in the internet , but is data privacy safeguarded ?
the head of google 's legal department , arnd haller said " we take personal data privacy very seriously .
we 've been discussing privacy issues all over europe , but here in germany the intensity of the questions is really impressive . "
a consultant hired by google , nikolas forgo , who is a hanover professor on informatics law , said a violation of personal rights was improbable .
google has already pledged to disguise car number plates and peoples ' faces .
berlin says google needs individual permission aigner had recently accused google 's service of being on the verge of violating the privacy of millions of citizens , each individually .
she demanded that google seek the permission from each person photographed on streets prior to publication .
street view photos are taken by camera cars which can capture all-round 360-degrees images .
these enable google users to simulate a stroll while sitting at their computers .
google has been gathering images of streets and public spaces in germany since 2008 .
the online service began in 2007 in four cities in the united states .
australia and japan soon followed .
in total google has initiated similar imaging projects in 19 countries , including many in europe .
satellites help pinpoint the panoramic scenes on maps using geo-data systems .
in a special exception for germany , haller said individuals would be able to file an objection with google to seek the removal of recognizable features .
" we 've a web site on-line with the relevant names and places where google street views are taken .
we also allow users to opt out in advance . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : street view is already available in several european countries " an immersive experience " google software developer raphael leiteritz said he believed street view was worth fighting for : " cards and maps have been two-dimensional for many years .
street view for the first time gives you an immersive experience .
you do n't look on a city from the top .
you can visit it and you can look around . "
that does not impress aigner .
she is demanding that google 's panoramic cameras be mounted no higher than 1.8 meters – instead of the current 2.5 meters on camera cars – so that views over fences and walls into residents ' gardens and courtyards are blocked .
other data privacy advocates also point out that potential burglars can use such internet imagery to recognize and target properties .
aigner told german public radio that google must act " definitively " on objections lodged by citizens , even to the point of making a building unrecognizable .
her ministry , she added , had placed a standardized complaint form on its website. ipj / apn / dpa / afp editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

soldiers tell of rituals with names like " fire dance " and the " jukebox " . germany 's parliamentary commissioner for the armed forces , reinhold robbe , said he had received 54 written accounts of abuse and degrading treatment since he submitted a report about hazing in the military .
several of the letters he received from soldiers corroborated previous allegations that mountain infantry troops at a camp in bavaria had been forced to drink alcohol and eat raw pork liver until they threw up .
robbe , a member of the social democratic party , demanded that the training curriculum be changed and said that the " dangerous , tasteless rituals must stop . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de afghanistan -pipe- 23.02.2010 dutch pullout will give nato headaches , but wo n't lead to domino effect großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it could be hard for nato to find a replacement for dutch troops a withdrawal of dutch troops from afghanistan would certainly increase the pressure on its allies to take their place .
but it is unlikely to trigger a domino effect among other countries who have troops there . by the sheer number of troops , the dutch deployment does n't rank among top international contingents in afghanistan .
however , its force of 1,800 soldiers has not only been in charge of the uruzgan province in the dangerous southern part of the country , but has generally been seen as doing an excellent job there .
so the planned dutch pullout from afghanistan as a consequence of the governmen crisis in the hague will clearly have repercussions for nato 's military mission in the country at a time when most allies are already under pressure to justify their engagement at home .
this has already led to worries about a possible domino effect in the sense that other countries might also feel forced to reconsider their committments to afghanistan .
" it 's true that the afghanistan mission is very unpopular in many european countries , so it is definitely a cause for concern if the dutch withdraw on account of the collapsed government , " eva gross , who heads the eu foreign and security policy program at the institute for european studies at vrije universiteit brussel in belgium , told deutsche welle .
" but to speak of a domino effect may be overstating the case . "
each country in europe has its own dynamics and traditions , therefore gross does n't believe an automatic discussion about troop withdrawals in other eu states is likely .
german troop increase will go ahead for germany , where a parliamentary vote on the expansion of berlin 's afghan mission is scheduled for later this week , the dutch decision wo n't have an immediate effect either , argue experts .
public opinion in germany ca n't be swayed much by the dutch political crisis because a solid majority of germans is already against the military engagement in afghanistan , says klaus-peter schoeppner , head of tns emnid , a major german polling and reseach firm .
while germans are very skeptical about the afghan misson , schoeppner thinks that most of them can live with the exit scenario envisaged by the government .
" so , i do n't think that this topic will gain much traction in germany , " he told deutsche welle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany plans to send up to 850 additional troops to afghanistan what 's more , adds schoeppner , germans do n't view the mission in afghanistan as predominantly a military one .
" we regard ourselves as the number one humanitarian nation , " said schoeppner .
a fast withdrawal from afghanistan would not only end germany 's military , but also its humanitarian responsibilities .
currently there is no indication that this is a likely option for the government , he added .
" i am fairly confindent that the increase of troops will go through in parliament , mainly because the political elites have been in favor of a continuation of the mandate , " said gross .
exit strategies while the dutch withdrawal will not have any imminent effect on the committments of other allies , it will further increase the debate in many countries about timetables and exit strategies .
" we have seen this in discussions already in germany , britain or the united states that the focus is now already much more on finding ways of withdrawing their troops from afghanistan , " said gross .
that could make it hard for nato to find a replacement for dutch troops , if the new government in the hague does in fact decide to withdraw its soldiers .
australia already publicly dismissed a possible leadership role in uruzgan province and canada has said it wants to pull out its troops at the end of next year .
germany , which is currently in charge of the regional command in the north of afghanistan , has repeatedly rejected a german engagement in the south and is unlikely to change that position .
" i think it would be difficult for us to do more in afghanistan , because others leave , " said schoeppner .
if no other countries are willing to take over the dutch role in the south , the us might ultimately be forced to fulfill that task itself .
as an alternative , american officials have aired a possible role for non-nato troops in afghanistan .
but whether such an expansion of the afghan mission is realistic and how it could work is still unclear .
explaining the mission at least for now then , the political turmoil over the future of dutch troops in afghanistan will merely increase the pressure on nato planners to sketch out possible scenarios for a dutch withdrawal and not lead to a domino effect in other countries .
however , argue experts , since public sentiment is already very pessimistic about the afghan mission , military events on the ground can always have a major impact on public opinion .
bildunterschrift : politicians must better explain the rationale behind the afghan mission , say experts " in most countries a a rather large attack with loss of life would probably push the public to reject military engagement , " said gross .
since that is always possible , governments can only do one thing : " they have to communicate the reasons why we are in afghanistan much better and much more carefully .
i think the dutch withdrawal and the collapse of the government definitely highlights that the european public is unconvinced of the value of the afghan mission and that european politicians have some explaining to do , " she said .

indeed , education is considered so crucial that when the united nations released its millennium development goals for 2015 , universal primary education was slated as the number two priority , second only to eradicating extreme poverty and hunger .
but a report released by berlin-based anti-corruption organisation transparency international suggests that endemic corruption in african schooling systems is still seeing large numbers of primary-aged african children denied their right to an education .
" basically all issues around resourcing had a dimension of corruption , with resources being exploited or embezzled by someone for private gain , but sometimes also just plain mismanagement , " said stephane stassen , who co-authored the report .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : giving children an education is crucial in post-war sierra leone the transparency international study " good governance lessons for primary education " was produced as part of the organisation 's africa education watch initiative and examined the impact of corruption on education quality and availability in seven african countries , interviewing over 8500 educators and parents in ghana , madagascar , morocco , niger , senegal , sierra leone and uganda .
change coming too slow to the continent the data collected paints a troubling picture of education in africa : despite two decades of reforms designed to allow greater levels of management at the local level and improve accountability , school administration is still not , for the most part , a genuinely corruption-free and participatory governance system .
" despite all these measures , there were still many governance challenges , " said stephane stassen , who heads transparency international 's africa education watch program .
one of the most striking examples is that of so-called registration fees , which parents from every country surveyed reported paying , although by law primary schooling is free .
the number of parents forced to pay these illegal accounting fees ranged from 9 % in ghana , to 90 % in morocco , the report found .
" similarly , in some countries where they had also abolished exam fees , they were still being charged , " said stassen .
he added that in many countries , textbooks were often not available .
and even if they were dispatched to schools , they were often not distributed for free .
the problems were also identified at higher levels , for example when schools receiving grants with which to run themselves were not receiving the full amount , or it was coming with a delay .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most parents can not afford high school fees the average cost of enrolling a primary-aged child in an african school for one year is three euros .
by comparison , the average per capita income in sierra leone is just us $ 260 -lrb- 190 euros -rrb- per year .
the costs charged for " free " textbooks as well as the fees of illegal " compulsory tutoring " - charged by some teachers to supplement their meagre incomes - puts an additional strain on african families .
crucial learning years missed these prohibitively high costs can lead to higher school dropout rates at a crucial time in children 's lives . " primary education is really the place where you get the basics for your life later on .
this is where you learn to read and write , this is where you learn to count , and if , for example if in africa you want to have a chance in trade or to go beyond your village , these are really skills you need to acquire . "
stassen said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : illiteracy among older people is high in many parts of africa he added that without a basic education , it would be nearly impossible to go on to high school or college .
" it 's really hard to get people back to school later on , and this is why we have to get things right now " .
literacy remains low in many parts of africa .
in senegal , for instance , just 43 percent of adults were considered literate in 2007 , compared to 72 percent in madagascar .
despite the obstacles , enrolment figures for primary-aged children in africa are on the increase .
according to 2009 figures from the un , net enrolment in sub-saharan africa went from 58 percent in 2000 to 74 percent in 2007 and from 91 percent to 96 percent over the same period of time in northern africa .
but enrolment figures do not tell the whole story : not only may corrupt practices prevent children from attending school , but they also lower the quality of education for students once they get there .
" even if you are in class , it might mean that you do n't learn much , because you have one textbook for ten learners if not more , " stassen said mismanagement partly to blame in many schools , the report found resources were being wasted or lost , not wilfully , but because those responsible for their management were simply ill-equipped for the job .
overall , 85 percent of schools across all countries had either deficient accounting systems or none at all , and in morocco , just 23 percent of head teachers received training in financial management , despite being responsible for budgets .
in niger that figure drops to just 8 percent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stephane stassen heads transparency international 's africa education watch program " schools where the head teacher had been trained and prepared to do his job in terms of managing the resources of the schools were … the schools where less of these corrupt practices were appearing , " said stassen .
" in a sense , what we found was that head teachers and teachers themselves were really feeling that they had been abandoned by the system . "
a way forward universal schooling for primary-aged children may be untenable by 2015 , but transparency international 's report suggests the reforms that have been made to date are in fact helping african schoolchildren .
the report found that schools that were more frequently audited tended to perform better : education outcomes were better and parents reported paying fewer illegal fees .
training in financial management for head teachers and school management committees could be strengthened , said stassen , to improve accountability .
stassen added that helping african parents to understand more about their rights within the schooling system was a crucial step in increasing engagement and accountability .
" i think that by combining inspections , grassroots accountability and better transparency in the system , you could really have an education system which is more efficient and better-resourced . "

indeed , education is considered so crucial that when the united nations released its millennium development goals for 2015 , universal primary education was slated as the number two priority , second only to eradicating extreme poverty and hunger .
but a report released by berlin-based anti-corruption organisation transparency international suggests that endemic corruption in african schooling systems is still seeing large numbers of primary-aged african children denied their right to an education .

the number of parents forced to pay these illegal accounting fees ranged from 9 % in ghana , to 90 % in morocco , the report found .

he added that in many countries , textbooks were often not available .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de internet -pipe- 23.02.2010 german child pornography law hits snags großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german government wants to curb internet freedom to fight child pornography germany has enacted a law aimed at curbing child pornography on the internet .
but in the face of criticism and protests , the law wo n't be enforced , says the government . a new law to curb child pornography has come into force in germany , but , in a legal curiosity , it is not going to be used by the courts .
the salient point is that instead of blocking child porn websites , the government now thinks it would better to erase them . the controversial legislation was drafted in 2009 by the former conservative family minister , ursula von der leyen , who said that she was willing to act against " a massive spread of child pornography on the internet . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ursula von der leyen is eager to stop child abuse material on the internet " we are no longer going to tolerate the fact that pictures of children being raped are massively accessed and distributed on the internet in germany , " she said , shortly before introducing the bill to parliament last year . mere symbolism under the new law , the german federal criminal office -lrb- bka -rrb- is supposed to provide a regularly updated list of websites , which they 've found to contain child pornographic pictures and images . german internet providers must then post a red " stop " sign on them , but are not allowed to erase them .
the german law also does n't extend to providers based abroad . christian bahls from the organisation " abuse victims against internet access blocking " accused the government of pursuing " a policy of symbolism , " which he described as " a slap in the face of the victims of child pornography . " " the victims of abuse are being abused again , namely as symbols in a questionable government campaign , " he said . freedom vs crime fighting since last summer , there 's been a groundswell of protests by germans who see the law as a first step on the path towards government censorship of the internet . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protestors demanding internet freedom did n't want to listen to the government 's arguments franziska heine has been spearheading a public pressure campaign called " expedition against internet blocking , " which is aimed at forcing parliament to re-introduce the law . about 134.000 germans have signed on to an official petition to parliament pressed by the group . mrs heine claimed that the law was based on " entirely false information " about the distribution of child pornography . " the law has huge repercussion for the freedom of information , but does little to help the victims , " she said . mrs heine 's opinion is supported by police specialists investigating cases of child pornography . frank federau , a member of a special unit at the regional police office in the federal state of lower saxony , believes child abuse material is not primarily exchanged using the internet .

indeed , education is considered so crucial that when the united nations released its millennium development goals for 2015 , universal primary education was slated as the number two priority , second only to eradicating extreme poverty and hunger .
but a report released by berlin-based anti-corruption organisation transparency international suggests that endemic corruption in african schooling systems is still seeing large numbers of primary-aged african children denied their right to an education .
" basically all issues around resourcing had a dimension of corruption , with resources being exploited or embezzled by someone for private gain , but sometimes also just plain mismanagement , " said stephane stassen , who co-authored the report .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : giving children an education is crucial in post-war sierra leone the transparency international study " good governance lessons for primary education " was produced as part of the organisation 's africa education watch initiative and examined the impact of corruption on education quality and availability in seven african countries , interviewing over 8500 educators and parents in ghana , madagascar , morocco , niger , senegal , sierra leone and uganda .
change coming too slow to the continent the data collected paints a troubling picture of education in africa : despite two decades of reforms designed to allow greater levels of management at the local level and improve accountability , school administration is still not , for the most part , a genuinely corruption-free and participatory governance system .
" despite all these measures , there were still many governance challenges , " said stephane stassen , who heads transparency international 's africa education watch program .
one of the most striking examples is that of so-called registration fees , which parents from every country surveyed reported paying , although by law primary schooling is free .
the number of parents forced to pay these illegal accounting fees ranged from 9 % in ghana , to 90 % in morocco , the report found .
" similarly , in some countries where they had also abolished exam fees , they were still being charged , " said stassen .
he added that in many countries , textbooks were often not available .
and even if they were dispatched to schools , they were often not distributed for free .
the problems were also identified at higher levels , for example when schools receiving grants with which to run themselves were not receiving the full amount , or it was coming with a delay .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most parents can not afford high school fees the average cost of enrolling a primary-aged child in an african school for one year is three euros .
by comparison , the average per capita income in sierra leone is just us $ 260 -lrb- 190 euros -rrb- per year .
the costs charged for " free " textbooks as well as the fees of illegal " compulsory tutoring " - charged by some teachers to supplement their meagre incomes - puts an additional strain on african families .
crucial learning years missed these prohibitively high costs can lead to higher school dropout rates at a crucial time in children 's lives . " primary education is really the place where you get the basics for your life later on .
this is where you learn to read and write , this is where you learn to count , and if , for example if in africa you want to have a chance in trade or to go beyond your village , these are really skills you need to acquire . "
stassen said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : illiteracy among older people is high in many parts of africa he added that without a basic education , it would be nearly impossible to go on to high school or college .
" it 's really hard to get people back to school later on , and this is why we have to get things right now " .
literacy remains low in many parts of africa .
in senegal , for instance , just 43 percent of adults were considered literate in 2007 , compared to 72 percent in madagascar .
despite the obstacles , enrolment figures for primary-aged children in africa are on the increase .
according to 2009 figures from the un , net enrolment in sub-saharan africa went from 58 percent in 2000 to 74 percent in 2007 and from 91 percent to 96 percent over the same period of time in northern africa .
but enrolment figures do not tell the whole story : not only may corrupt practices prevent children from attending school , but they also lower the quality of education for students once they get there .
" even if you are in class , it might mean that you do n't learn much , because you have one textbook for ten learners if not more , " stassen said mismanagement partly to blame in many schools , the report found resources were being wasted or lost , not wilfully , but because those responsible for their management were simply ill-equipped for the job .
overall , 85 percent of schools across all countries had either deficient accounting systems or none at all , and in morocco , just 23 percent of head teachers received training in financial management , despite being responsible for budgets .
in niger that figure drops to just 8 percent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stephane stassen heads transparency international 's africa education watch program " schools where the head teacher had been trained and prepared to do his job in terms of managing the resources of the schools were … the schools where less of these corrupt practices were appearing , " said stassen .
" in a sense , what we found was that head teachers and teachers themselves were really feeling that they had been abandoned by the system . "
a way forward universal schooling for primary-aged children may be untenable by 2015 , but transparency international 's report suggests the reforms that have been made to date are in fact helping african schoolchildren .
the report found that schools that were more frequently audited tended to perform better : education outcomes were better and parents reported paying fewer illegal fees .
training in financial management for head teachers and school management committees could be strengthened , said stassen , to improve accountability .
stassen added that helping african parents to understand more about their rights within the schooling system was a crucial step in increasing engagement and accountability .
" i think that by combining inspections , grassroots accountability and better transparency in the system , you could really have an education system which is more efficient and better-resourced . "

lufthansa had gone to court seeking an injunction against the strike .
cockpit called the walkout to press its demands for job security guarantees and pay rises for 4,500 pilots the work stoppage , which had begun early on monday , led to the cancellation of 900 flights .
it was meant to continue until thursday .

it expects normal service to be restored by friday . lufthansa says only half of its normally scheduled flights will operate on tuesday and it will take until friday to get its worldwide network completely back up to speed .
on monday evening lufthansa and the pilots ' trade union cockpit agreed during mediation in a frankfurt labour court to resume negotiations , with cockpit suspending its work stoppage until march 8 .
lufthansa had gone to court seeking an injunction against the strike .
cockpit called the walkout to press its demands for job security guarantees and pay rises for 4,500 pilots the work stoppage , which had begun early on monday , led to the cancellation of 900 flights .
it was meant to continue until thursday .
also affected were lufthhansa 's subsidiary germanwings and lufthansa 's cargo division .
aircraft parked , crews displaced that left most aircraft parked at lufthansa 's hubs in frankfurt and munich , with crews and planes displaced from normal departure points .
a lufthansa spokesman said the airline was working at top speed to reinstate its global flight schedule .
lufthansa spokesman klaus walther told zdf german public television that extra flights would be provided on germany 's main routes - frankfurt-munich , frankfurt-berlin and frankfurt-hamburg .
" but it will take some time before the complete network is functioning again , " he said .
germanwings said that 120 of its 160 scheduled flights would operate on tuesday , despite the aftermath of the industrial action .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some 4,000 pilots were briefly on strike transport minister relieved german transport minister peter raumsauer told zdf he was relieved that resolution efforts and suggestions he had made since last weekend had been adopted by all sides .
" i now hope and demand that the negotiating parties reach a sustainable , amicable agreement and that no aircraft remains grounded , " he said . travel clouded by controllers ' strike meanwhile , european travellers can expect more disruption on tuesday , due to a work stoppage by french air traffic controllers .
that stoppage is expected to hamper half the flights at paris ' orly airport and a quarter of flights from the main charles de gaulle airport , according to france 's aviation authority dgac .
air france has vowed to maintain most long-haul services .
some french provincial airports also expect cancellations .
four french unions have called the five-day strike , from tuesday until saturday , to protest against government plans to merge france 's air traffic control activities with those of neighbouring countries .
controllers fear the merger will end their role as french state employees .
dgac insists their status will not change .
meanwhile , the british union unite says 81 percent of its cabin crew members working for british airways have voted in favour of strike action .
that creates the prospect of a strike within the next 28 days , although the easter holiday period is reported to have been ruled out. ipj / dpa / reuters / afp editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de energy -pipe- 23.02.2010 germany to cut subsidies for solar energy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is the world leader in solar panel production a law proposed by chancellor angela merkel 's government would greatly reduce subsidies for solar energy production , and in some cases eliminate them all together . the center-right german government is proposing legislation to severely reduce state subsidies to solar power in an attempt to prevent market saturation and save money .
the draft law , which both the german parliament and chancellor angela merkel 's cabinet are to consider in the coming weeks , would cut state-guaranteed prices by 15 percent for energy produced by solar panels on open ground .
it would also cut prices by 16 percent for solar panels on roofs , where 80 percent of solar panels in germany are , and eliminate subsidies for panels placed on arable land .
a previous plan by environment minister norbert roettgen was criticized for not going far enough .
" there must be no more panels installed on arable land , " said peter altmaier , a member of merkel 's christian democrat union -lrb- cdu -rrb- who follows the solar energy sector .
" the objective is to reduce excessive stimulation without hindering an expansion of green energy . "
unintended consequences experts have criticized solar energy subsidies in germany for failing to spur competition in the industry , which accounts for less than one percent of all german electricity production .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : environmental groups have called the law a betrayal of renewable energy the subsidies have also had several unintended consequences : farmers have installed solar panels on their arable fields ; also , the global market has greatly increased , helping manufacturers in china , where labor is cheaper .
germany remains the world leader in solar panel production , but manufacturers have lost billions of euros in recent years and have been forced to cut and outsource jobs .
german group q-cells grew significantly until posting a 1.36-billion euro -lrb- $ 1.84 billion -rrb- net loss in 2009 .
support and opposition the reduction would save german consumers some of the one billion euros they pay per month in fees that underwrite solar energy production , according to hans-peter friedrich , a leader in the cdu 's bavarian sister party , the christian social union .
the law is supported by farmers resentful of investors who bought up arable land only to " harvest the sunshine . "

soldiers tell of rituals with names like " fire dance " and the " jukebox " . germany 's parliamentary commissioner for the armed forces , reinhold robbe , said he had received 54 written accounts of abuse and degrading treatment since he submitted a report about hazing in the military .
several of the letters he received from soldiers corroborated previous allegations that mountain infantry troops at a camp in bavaria had been forced to drink alcohol and eat raw pork liver until they threw up .
robbe , a member of the social democratic party , demanded that the training curriculum be changed and said that the " dangerous , tasteless rituals must stop . "
fire dances and jukeboxes the new letters also bring to light other forms of hazing .
one former member of the marines said that new sailors were often subjected to harsh rituals during their first nights at sea .
he described the " fire dance , " in which a man was forced to strip off his pants and have a lighted wick placed in his anus ; another in which a floor polishing machine with rough bristles was held against a recruit 's naked bottom until the skin turned red .
a volunteer soldier stationed in southern germany between 1996 and 1998 told of soldiers being forced to play " jukebox , " during which they were shut into a locker , which was then stood upside down , and the occupant forced to sing certain songs .
defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg renewed his promise of a complete investigation .
he did not rule out the possibility of disciplinary action for those involved , although he warned against making an across-the-board judgment .
" every case must be pursued judiciously and emphatically , " guttenberg told fellow christian democrat politicians in berlin on tuesday. svs / dpa / apn editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de africa -pipe- 23.02.2010 corruption stifles learning in africa , report finds großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : corruption is still keeping some african children out of the classroom a new report from anti-corruption organisation transparency international has found that systematic corruption and mismanagement are keeping many african children from a decent education , despite years of reform . when it comes to tackling poverty , poor health or limited opportunities for growth , a good education is widely seen as a magic bullet for developing countries .
indeed , education is considered so crucial that when the united nations released its millennium development goals for 2015 , universal primary education was slated as the number two priority , second only to eradicating extreme poverty and hunger .
but a report released by berlin-based anti-corruption organisation transparency international suggests that endemic corruption in african schooling systems is still seeing large numbers of primary-aged african children denied their right to an education .
" basically all issues around resourcing had a dimension of corruption , with resources being exploited or embezzled by someone for private gain , but sometimes also just plain mismanagement , " said stephane stassen , who co-authored the report .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : giving children an education is crucial in post-war sierra leone the transparency international study " good governance lessons for primary education " was produced as part of the organisation 's africa education watch initiative and examined the impact of corruption on education quality and availability in seven african countries , interviewing over 8500 educators and parents in ghana , madagascar , morocco , niger , senegal , sierra leone and uganda .
change coming too slow to the continent the data collected paints a troubling picture of education in africa : despite two decades of reforms designed to allow greater levels of management at the local level and improve accountability , school administration is still not , for the most part , a genuinely corruption-free and participatory governance system .
" despite all these measures , there were still many governance challenges , " said stephane stassen , who heads transparency international 's africa education watch program .
one of the most striking examples is that of so-called registration fees , which parents from every country surveyed reported paying , although by law primary schooling is free .
the number of parents forced to pay these illegal accounting fees ranged from 9 % in ghana , to 90 % in morocco , the report found .
" similarly , in some countries where they had also abolished exam fees , they were still being charged , " said stassen .
he added that in many countries , textbooks were often not available .
and even if they were dispatched to schools , they were often not distributed for free .
the problems were also identified at higher levels , for example when schools receiving grants with which to run themselves were not receiving the full amount , or it was coming with a delay .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most parents can not afford high school fees the average cost of enrolling a primary-aged child in an african school for one year is three euros .
by comparison , the average per capita income in sierra leone is just us $ 260 -lrb- 190 euros -rrb- per year .
the costs charged for " free " textbooks as well as the fees of illegal " compulsory tutoring " - charged by some teachers to supplement their meagre incomes - puts an additional strain on african families .
crucial learning years missed these prohibitively high costs can lead to higher school dropout rates at a crucial time in children 's lives . " primary education is really the place where you get the basics for your life later on .
this is where you learn to read and write , this is where you learn to count , and if , for example if in africa you want to have a chance in trade or to go beyond your village , these are really skills you need to acquire . "
stassen said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : illiteracy among older people is high in many parts of africa he added that without a basic education , it would be nearly impossible to go on to high school or college .
" it 's really hard to get people back to school later on , and this is why we have to get things right now " .
literacy remains low in many parts of africa .
in senegal , for instance , just 43 percent of adults were considered literate in 2007 , compared to 72 percent in madagascar .
despite the obstacles , enrolment figures for primary-aged children in africa are on the increase .
according to 2009 figures from the un , net enrolment in sub-saharan africa went from 58 percent in 2000 to 74 percent in 2007 and from 91 percent to 96 percent over the same period of time in northern africa .
but enrolment figures do not tell the whole story : not only may corrupt practices prevent children from attending school , but they also lower the quality of education for students once they get there .
" even if you are in class , it might mean that you do n't learn much , because you have one textbook for ten learners if not more , " stassen said mismanagement partly to blame in many schools , the report found resources were being wasted or lost , not wilfully , but because those responsible for their management were simply ill-equipped for the job .
overall , 85 percent of schools across all countries had either deficient accounting systems or none at all , and in morocco , just 23 percent of head teachers received training in financial management , despite being responsible for budgets .
in niger that figure drops to just 8 percent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stephane stassen heads transparency international 's africa education watch program " schools where the head teacher had been trained and prepared to do his job in terms of managing the resources of the schools were … the schools where less of these corrupt practices were appearing , " said stassen .
" in a sense , what we found was that head teachers and teachers themselves were really feeling that they had been abandoned by the system . "
a way forward universal schooling for primary-aged children may be untenable by 2015 , but transparency international 's report suggests the reforms that have been made to date are in fact helping african schoolchildren .
the report found that schools that were more frequently audited tended to perform better : education outcomes were better and parents reported paying fewer illegal fees .
training in financial management for head teachers and school management committees could be strengthened , said stassen , to improve accountability .
stassen added that helping african parents to understand more about their rights within the schooling system was a crucial step in increasing engagement and accountability .
" i think that by combining inspections , grassroots accountability and better transparency in the system , you could really have an education system which is more efficient and better-resourced . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de africa -pipe- 23.02.2010 corruption stifles learning in africa , report finds großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : corruption is still keeping some african children out of the classroom a new report from anti-corruption organisation transparency international has found that systematic corruption and mismanagement are keeping many african children from a decent education , despite years of reform . when it comes to tackling poverty , poor health or limited opportunities for growth , a good education is widely seen as a magic bullet for developing countries .
indeed , education is considered so crucial that when the united nations released its millennium development goals for 2015 , universal primary education was slated as the number two priority , second only to eradicating extreme poverty and hunger .
but a report released by berlin-based anti-corruption organisation transparency international suggests that endemic corruption in african schooling systems is still seeing large numbers of primary-aged african children denied their right to an education .
" basically all issues around resourcing had a dimension of corruption , with resources being exploited or embezzled by someone for private gain , but sometimes also just plain mismanagement , " said stephane stassen , who co-authored the report .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : giving children an education is crucial in post-war sierra leone the transparency international study " good governance lessons for primary education " was produced as part of the organisation 's africa education watch initiative and examined the impact of corruption on education quality and availability in seven african countries , interviewing over 8500 educators and parents in ghana , madagascar , morocco , niger , senegal , sierra leone and uganda .
change coming too slow to the continent the data collected paints a troubling picture of education in africa : despite two decades of reforms designed to allow greater levels of management at the local level and improve accountability , school administration is still not , for the most part , a genuinely corruption-free and participatory governance system .
" despite all these measures , there were still many governance challenges , " said stephane stassen , who heads transparency international 's africa education watch program .
one of the most striking examples is that of so-called registration fees , which parents from every country surveyed reported paying , although by law primary schooling is free .
the number of parents forced to pay these illegal accounting fees ranged from 9 % in ghana , to 90 % in morocco , the report found .
" similarly , in some countries where they had also abolished exam fees , they were still being charged , " said stassen .
he added that in many countries , textbooks were often not available .
and even if they were dispatched to schools , they were often not distributed for free .
the problems were also identified at higher levels , for example when schools receiving grants with which to run themselves were not receiving the full amount , or it was coming with a delay .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most parents can not afford high school fees the average cost of enrolling a primary-aged child in an african school for one year is three euros .
by comparison , the average per capita income in sierra leone is just us $ 260 -lrb- 190 euros -rrb- per year .
the costs charged for " free " textbooks as well as the fees of illegal " compulsory tutoring " - charged by some teachers to supplement their meagre incomes - puts an additional strain on african families .
crucial learning years missed these prohibitively high costs can lead to higher school dropout rates at a crucial time in children 's lives . " primary education is really the place where you get the basics for your life later on .
this is where you learn to read and write , this is where you learn to count , and if , for example if in africa you want to have a chance in trade or to go beyond your village , these are really skills you need to acquire . "
stassen said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : illiteracy among older people is high in many parts of africa he added that without a basic education , it would be nearly impossible to go on to high school or college .
" it 's really hard to get people back to school later on , and this is why we have to get things right now " .
literacy remains low in many parts of africa .
in senegal , for instance , just 43 percent of adults were considered literate in 2007 , compared to 72 percent in madagascar .
despite the obstacles , enrolment figures for primary-aged children in africa are on the increase .
according to 2009 figures from the un , net enrolment in sub-saharan africa went from 58 percent in 2000 to 74 percent in 2007 and from 91 percent to 96 percent over the same period of time in northern africa .
but enrolment figures do not tell the whole story : not only may corrupt practices prevent children from attending school , but they also lower the quality of education for students once they get there .
" even if you are in class , it might mean that you do n't learn much , because you have one textbook for ten learners if not more , " stassen said mismanagement partly to blame in many schools , the report found resources were being wasted or lost , not wilfully , but because those responsible for their management were simply ill-equipped for the job .
overall , 85 percent of schools across all countries had either deficient accounting systems or none at all , and in morocco , just 23 percent of head teachers received training in financial management , despite being responsible for budgets .
in niger that figure drops to just 8 percent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stephane stassen heads transparency international 's africa education watch program " schools where the head teacher had been trained and prepared to do his job in terms of managing the resources of the schools were … the schools where less of these corrupt practices were appearing , " said stassen .
" in a sense , what we found was that head teachers and teachers themselves were really feeling that they had been abandoned by the system . "
a way forward universal schooling for primary-aged children may be untenable by 2015 , but transparency international 's report suggests the reforms that have been made to date are in fact helping african schoolchildren .
the report found that schools that were more frequently audited tended to perform better : education outcomes were better and parents reported paying fewer illegal fees .
training in financial management for head teachers and school management committees could be strengthened , said stassen , to improve accountability .
stassen added that helping african parents to understand more about their rights within the schooling system was a crucial step in increasing engagement and accountability .
" i think that by combining inspections , grassroots accountability and better transparency in the system , you could really have an education system which is more efficient and better-resourced . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de internet -pipe- 23.02.2010 google rejects berlin 's privacy concerns over street view application großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : google says street view offers a unique new experience internet giant google said tuesday it aimed to launch its street view application in germany by the end of the year .
yet berlin insists there are concerns that the technology could breach privacy laws . google , which wants to extend its street view panoramic photos to germany later this year , has rejected strong privacy objections raised by the german government .
consumer affairs minister ilse aigner is demanding that the internet giant only displays its imagery after each affected german citizen has given his or her permission .
minister aigner said her staff were consulting with justice ministry officials , with the aim of tightening legislation .
she also demanded that google be ready to make people 's faces , car and house numbers , and even facades unrecognizable .
" a vague picture pixel change is not sufficient , " she said in berlin .
" i do not share the company 's assessment that all personal data concerns have been resolved . "
her ministry , she said , had been flooded with calls by citizens worried about protecting their privacy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a stroll in the internet , but is data privacy safeguarded ?
the head of google 's legal department , arnd haller said " we take personal data privacy very seriously .
we 've been discussing privacy issues all over europe , but here in germany the intensity of the questions is really impressive . "
a consultant hired by google , nikolas forgo , who is a hanover professor on informatics law , said a violation of personal rights was improbable .
google has already pledged to disguise car number plates and peoples ' faces .
berlin says google needs individual permission aigner had recently accused google 's service of being on the verge of violating the privacy of millions of citizens , each individually .
she demanded that google seek the permission from each person photographed on streets prior to publication .
street view photos are taken by camera cars which can capture all-round 360-degrees images .
these enable google users to simulate a stroll while sitting at their computers .
google has been gathering images of streets and public spaces in germany since 2008 .
the online service began in 2007 in four cities in the united states .
australia and japan soon followed .
in total google has initiated similar imaging projects in 19 countries , including many in europe .
satellites help pinpoint the panoramic scenes on maps using geo-data systems .
in a special exception for germany , haller said individuals would be able to file an objection with google to seek the removal of recognizable features .
" we 've a web site on-line with the relevant names and places where google street views are taken .
we also allow users to opt out in advance . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : street view is already available in several european countries " an immersive experience " google software developer raphael leiteritz said he believed street view was worth fighting for : " cards and maps have been two-dimensional for many years .
street view for the first time gives you an immersive experience .
you do n't look on a city from the top .
you can visit it and you can look around . "
that does not impress aigner .
she is demanding that google 's panoramic cameras be mounted no higher than 1.8 meters – instead of the current 2.5 meters on camera cars – so that views over fences and walls into residents ' gardens and courtyards are blocked .
other data privacy advocates also point out that potential burglars can use such internet imagery to recognize and target properties .
aigner told german public radio that google must act " definitively " on objections lodged by citizens , even to the point of making a building unrecognizable .
her ministry , she added , had placed a standardized complaint form on its website. ipj / apn / dpa / afp editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de development policy -pipe- 23.02.2010 european think-tanks call for new beginning in eu development policy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : simon maxwell is an economist with odi , london leading european think-tanks propose new approaches in development policy to cope with future challenges .
the eu should take on more prominent role in the area , argue this week 's commenators sven grimm and simon maxwell . while the new eu commission in the process of constitution , the european think-tanks group has presented a memorandum entitled " new challenges , new beginnings – next steps in european development cooperation " . the group comprises the think tanks die -lrb- germany -rrb- , odi -lrb- uk -rrb- , fride -lrb- spain -rrb- , and the european centre for development policy management ecdpm .
the memorandum analyses both current european policy and emerging challenges in climate change , migration , trade policy as well as the coherence of and division of labor in development policy .
eu should become more prominent actor in development field based on this analysis , the think-tanks group has formulated a number of recommendations for national and european decision-makers .
europe has still not succeeded in carving out a place for itself as a player in the world of the ' big two ' - the us and china .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : activists were disappointed with the lack of results at the copenhagen climate talks this became evident not least at the failed climate negotiations in copenhagen , where , when it came to the pivotal rounds of the talks , the us and china constituted more or less a group of their own .
if we viewed the european union 's external relations as a chorus , what we would see is a group of inveterate soloists seeking to prepare a new piece without a conductor .
in adopting the treaty of lisbon the eu might be said to have struggled though one page of the score .
this deserves praise .
but at a point of time where the dilapidated state of the global concert hall is becoming only all too evident , the real concern is : at present the substance and emphases of world politics are shifting towards the pacific .
europe depends on international decisions while europe is a globally networked region , it does have a marked atlantic orientation .
peace and prosperity in europe are dependent in crucial ways on whether or not the decisions taken in international bodies are of a long-term nature .
one consequence of this is that the distinction between domestic and foreign policy is growing increasingly blurred .
there is no isle of the blessed in a global financial and economic crisis , neither in europe nor in africa nor anywhere else .
the global climate is changing , and our way of life is going to have to change .
this goes not only for the us or china , the new global polluter , but also for europe , and especially for it – as well as for africa , which has contributed as good as nothing to climate change .
in short : we have an enlightened self-interest in global development .
eu should offer global leadership the tenor of the eu memorandum 's authors : if europe is to continue to be taken seriously as a global actor on its own merits , both european and national leaders need to address five central points : bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu should take on a more a more prominent role in development policy first , development policy needs to be seen as an element of approaches to global problem-solving – which means that it needs to become one of the central areas of european foreign policy .
here europe must offer global leadership .
the world trade talks are set to continue in geneva this year .
in september the united nations will be hosting a summit on the state of the un millennium development goals -lrb- mdgs -rrb- .
in june canada is to host the g8 / g20 for a conference on the financial crisis .
in addition , the climate talks will be returning to bonn in june .
how far will europe 's voice carry in these concerts ?
effectiveness of development aid impacts on european credibility the second point concerns commitments on the volume and effectiveness of global development assistance .
this is a matter of europe 's own credibility .
not enough that the donors operating in africa often trip over one another for lack of coordination , the eu countries are currently offering 20 billion euros less in aid than they had originally pledged .
and there are fears that commitments on climate protection finance could come at the expense of other fields , with europe , in effect , pursuing a zero-sum policy – taking , as it were , funds from its right pocket and putting them into its left .
coordinating different fields third , development assistance must not be allowed simply to make up for what european policy has taken away elsewhere .
trade , climate protection , and immigration policy are key fields that need to be coordinated with the objectives of development policy .
this is a permanent task for which there can and will be no quick fixes .
investing in international partnerships bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sven grimm , researcher with bonn-based think-tank die fourth , it is essential to invest in global partnerships .
these are investments in a shared future .
partners need to be able act on equal terms – in order then to seek , on an equal footing , solutions to common problems .
in view of the fact that reforms of the bretton woods institutions are on the immediate agenda , the international decisions that need to be taken in the near future will put europe to the test .
international power shifts are already becoming evident .
measured in terms of its economic power , which is declining in relation to asia , europe is overrepresented in imf and world bank .
when it comes to international bodies , europe often seems to confuse quantity with quality , and having a large number of representatives in the g20 or the imf does not necessarily mean more influence if efforts to coordinate such steps have not been successfully coordinated in advance .
only as a chorus will europe prove able to make its voice heard .
potential role of eu foreign service and finally , fifth , the memorandum points to the potentials of the new european foreign service .
its mix of personnel drawn from member states and eu institutions may be seen as an opportunity .
at present , though , there are more questions than answers concerning this matter .
agreements – including the reform-oriented lisbon treaty – will be doomed to lead a life on paper unless europe 's responsible institutions and leaders prove able to improve their cooperation .
in other words , the question is : does europe now need to opt for more centralization ?
this is , in fact , not a realistic option , as the protracted wrangling in recent years over eu reforms has shown .
taking lisbon treaty as framework to improve policies the treaty of lisbon is certainly not the big bang for european global power .
but it does provide a good framework for improved coordination .
it is essential that efforts to improve the eu 's division of labor actually bear fruit if europe 's diversity is to be orchestrated to form a good chorus .
otherwise europe 's voice is likely to turn out to be little more than world-political background noise .
but one thing that can be said with certainty is that for the european countries global acoustics would be far worse in a world dominated by the big two .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de internet -pipe- 23.02.2010 german child pornography law hits snags großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german government wants to curb internet freedom to fight child pornography germany has enacted a law aimed at curbing child pornography on the internet .
but in the face of criticism and protests , the law wo n't be enforced , says the government . a new law to curb child pornography has come into force in germany , but , in a legal curiosity , it is not going to be used by the courts .
the salient point is that instead of blocking child porn websites , the government now thinks it would better to erase them . the controversial legislation was drafted in 2009 by the former conservative family minister , ursula von der leyen , who said that she was willing to act against " a massive spread of child pornography on the internet . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ursula von der leyen is eager to stop child abuse material on the internet " we are no longer going to tolerate the fact that pictures of children being raped are massively accessed and distributed on the internet in germany , " she said , shortly before introducing the bill to parliament last year . mere symbolism under the new law , the german federal criminal office -lrb- bka -rrb- is supposed to provide a regularly updated list of websites , which they 've found to contain child pornographic pictures and images . german internet providers must then post a red " stop " sign on them , but are not allowed to erase them .
the german law also does n't extend to providers based abroad . christian bahls from the organisation " abuse victims against internet access blocking " accused the government of pursuing " a policy of symbolism , " which he described as " a slap in the face of the victims of child pornography . " " the victims of abuse are being abused again , namely as symbols in a questionable government campaign , " he said . freedom vs crime fighting since last summer , there 's been a groundswell of protests by germans who see the law as a first step on the path towards government censorship of the internet . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protestors demanding internet freedom did n't want to listen to the government 's arguments franziska heine has been spearheading a public pressure campaign called " expedition against internet blocking , " which is aimed at forcing parliament to re-introduce the law . about 134.000 germans have signed on to an official petition to parliament pressed by the group . mrs heine claimed that the law was based on " entirely false information " about the distribution of child pornography . " the law has huge repercussion for the freedom of information , but does little to help the victims , " she said . mrs heine 's opinion is supported by police specialists investigating cases of child pornography . frank federau , a member of a special unit at the regional police office in the federal state of lower saxony , believes child abuse material is not primarily exchanged using the internet . " the internet is a channel of communication for paedophiles , but the material as such is distributed on cds and dvds via ordinary mail .

but in the face of criticism and protests , the law wo n't be enforced , says the government . a new law to curb child pornography has come into force in germany , but , in a legal curiosity , it is not going to be used by the courts .
the salient point is that instead of blocking child porn websites , the government now thinks it would better to erase them . the controversial legislation was drafted in 2009 by the former conservative family minister , ursula von der leyen , who said that she was willing to act against " a massive spread of child pornography on the internet . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ursula von der leyen is eager to stop child abuse material on the internet " we are no longer going to tolerate the fact that pictures of children being raped are massively accessed and distributed on the internet in germany , " she said , shortly before introducing the bill to parliament last year . mere symbolism under the new law , the german federal criminal office -lrb- bka -rrb- is supposed to provide a regularly updated list of websites , which they 've found to contain child pornographic pictures and images . german internet providers must then post a red " stop " sign on them , but are not allowed to erase them .
the german law also does n't extend to providers based abroad . christian bahls from the organisation " abuse victims against internet access blocking " accused the government of pursuing " a policy of symbolism , " which he described as " a slap in the face of the victims of child pornography . " " the victims of abuse are being abused again , namely as symbols in a questionable government campaign , " he said . freedom vs crime fighting since last summer , there 's been a groundswell of protests by germans who see the law as a first step on the path towards government censorship of the internet . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protestors demanding internet freedom did n't want to listen to the government 's arguments franziska heine has been spearheading a public pressure campaign called " expedition against internet blocking , " which is aimed at forcing parliament to re-introduce the law . about 134.000 germans have signed on to an official petition to parliament pressed by the group . mrs heine claimed that the law was based on " entirely false information " about the distribution of child pornography . " the law has huge repercussion for the freedom of information , but does little to help the victims , " she said . mrs heine 's opinion is supported by police specialists investigating cases of child pornography . frank federau , a member of a special unit at the regional police office in the federal state of lower saxony , believes child abuse material is not primarily exchanged using the internet .

but it is unlikely to trigger a domino effect among other countries who have troops there . by the sheer number of troops , the dutch deployment does n't rank among top international contingents in afghanistan .
however , its force of 1,800 soldiers has not only been in charge of the uruzgan province in the dangerous southern part of the country , but has generally been seen as doing an excellent job there .
so the planned dutch pullout from afghanistan as a consequence of the governmen crisis in the hague will clearly have repercussions for nato 's military mission in the country at a time when most allies are already under pressure to justify their engagement at home .
this has already led to worries about a possible domino effect in the sense that other countries might also feel forced to reconsider their committments to afghanistan .
" it 's true that the afghanistan mission is very unpopular in many european countries , so it is definitely a cause for concern if the dutch withdraw on account of the collapsed government , " eva gross , who heads the eu foreign and security policy program at the institute for european studies at vrije universiteit brussel in belgium , told deutsche welle .
" but to speak of a domino effect may be overstating the case . "
each country in europe has its own dynamics and traditions , therefore gross does n't believe an automatic discussion about troop withdrawals in other eu states is likely .
german troop increase will go ahead for germany , where a parliamentary vote on the expansion of berlin 's afghan mission is scheduled for later this week , the dutch decision wo n't have an immediate effect either , argue experts .
public opinion in germany ca n't be swayed much by the dutch political crisis because a solid majority of germans is already against the military engagement in afghanistan , says klaus-peter schoeppner , head of tns emnid , a major german polling and reseach firm .
while germans are very skeptical about the afghan misson , schoeppner thinks that most of them can live with the exit scenario envisaged by the government .
" so , i do n't think that this topic will gain much traction in germany , " he told deutsche welle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany plans to send up to 850 additional troops to afghanistan what 's more , adds schoeppner , germans do n't view the mission in afghanistan as predominantly a military one .
" we regard ourselves as the number one humanitarian nation , " said schoeppner .
a fast withdrawal from afghanistan would not only end germany 's military , but also its humanitarian responsibilities .
currently there is no indication that this is a likely option for the government , he added .
" i am fairly confindent that the increase of troops will go through in parliament , mainly because the political elites have been in favor of a continuation of the mandate , " said gross .
exit strategies while the dutch withdrawal will not have any imminent effect on the committments of other allies , it will further increase the debate in many countries about timetables and exit strategies .
" we have seen this in discussions already in germany , britain or the united states that the focus is now already much more on finding ways of withdrawing their troops from afghanistan , " said gross .
that could make it hard for nato to find a replacement for dutch troops , if the new government in the hague does in fact decide to withdraw its soldiers .
australia already publicly dismissed a possible leadership role in uruzgan province and canada has said it wants to pull out its troops at the end of next year .
germany , which is currently in charge of the regional command in the north of afghanistan , has repeatedly rejected a german engagement in the south and is unlikely to change that position .
" i think it would be difficult for us to do more in afghanistan , because others leave , " said schoeppner .
if no other countries are willing to take over the dutch role in the south , the us might ultimately be forced to fulfill that task itself .
as an alternative , american officials have aired a possible role for non-nato troops in afghanistan .
but whether such an expansion of the afghan mission is realistic and how it could work is still unclear .
explaining the mission at least for now then , the political turmoil over the future of dutch troops in afghanistan will merely increase the pressure on nato planners to sketch out possible scenarios for a dutch withdrawal and not lead to a domino effect in other countries .
however , argue experts , since public sentiment is already very pessimistic about the afghan mission , military events on the ground can always have a major impact on public opinion .
bildunterschrift : politicians must better explain the rationale behind the afghan mission , say experts " in most countries a a rather large attack with loss of life would probably push the public to reject military engagement , " said gross .
since that is always possible , governments can only do one thing : " they have to communicate the reasons why we are in afghanistan much better and much more carefully .
i think the dutch withdrawal and the collapse of the government definitely highlights that the european public is unconvinced of the value of the afghan mission and that european politicians have some explaining to do , " she said .

but it is unlikely to trigger a domino effect among other countries who have troops there . by the sheer number of troops , the dutch deployment does n't rank among top international contingents in afghanistan .
however , its force of 1,800 soldiers has not only been in charge of the uruzgan province in the dangerous southern part of the country , but has generally been seen as doing an excellent job there .
so the planned dutch pullout from afghanistan as a consequence of the governmen crisis in the hague will clearly have repercussions for nato 's military mission in the country at a time when most allies are already under pressure to justify their engagement at home .
this has already led to worries about a possible domino effect in the sense that other countries might also feel forced to reconsider their committments to afghanistan .
" it 's true that the afghanistan mission is very unpopular in many european countries , so it is definitely a cause for concern if the dutch withdraw on account of the collapsed government , " eva gross , who heads the eu foreign and security policy program at the institute for european studies at vrije universiteit brussel in belgium , told deutsche welle .
" but to speak of a domino effect may be overstating the case . "
each country in europe has its own dynamics and traditions , therefore gross does n't believe an automatic discussion about troop withdrawals in other eu states is likely .
german troop increase will go ahead for germany , where a parliamentary vote on the expansion of berlin 's afghan mission is scheduled for later this week , the dutch decision wo n't have an immediate effect either , argue experts .
public opinion in germany ca n't be swayed much by the dutch political crisis because a solid majority of germans is already against the military engagement in afghanistan , says klaus-peter schoeppner , head of tns emnid , a major german polling and reseach firm .
while germans are very skeptical about the afghan misson , schoeppner thinks that most of them can live with the exit scenario envisaged by the government .
" so , i do n't think that this topic will gain much traction in germany , " he told deutsche welle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany plans to send up to 850 additional troops to afghanistan what 's more , adds schoeppner , germans do n't view the mission in afghanistan as predominantly a military one .
" we regard ourselves as the number one humanitarian nation , " said schoeppner .
a fast withdrawal from afghanistan would not only end germany 's military , but also its humanitarian responsibilities .
currently there is no indication that this is a likely option for the government , he added .
" i am fairly confindent that the increase of troops will go through in parliament , mainly because the political elites have been in favor of a continuation of the mandate , " said gross .
exit strategies while the dutch withdrawal will not have any imminent effect on the committments of other allies , it will further increase the debate in many countries about timetables and exit strategies .
" we have seen this in discussions already in germany , britain or the united states that the focus is now already much more on finding ways of withdrawing their troops from afghanistan , " said gross .
that could make it hard for nato to find a replacement for dutch troops , if the new government in the hague does in fact decide to withdraw its soldiers .
australia already publicly dismissed a possible leadership role in uruzgan province and canada has said it wants to pull out its troops at the end of next year .
germany , which is currently in charge of the regional command in the north of afghanistan , has repeatedly rejected a german engagement in the south and is unlikely to change that position .
" i think it would be difficult for us to do more in afghanistan , because others leave , " said schoeppner .
if no other countries are willing to take over the dutch role in the south , the us might ultimately be forced to fulfill that task itself .
as an alternative , american officials have aired a possible role for non-nato troops in afghanistan .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de development policy -pipe- 23.02.2010 european think-tanks call for new beginning in eu development policy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : simon maxwell is an economist with odi , london leading european think-tanks propose new approaches in development policy to cope with future challenges .
the eu should take on more prominent role in the area , argue this week 's commenators sven grimm and simon maxwell . while the new eu commission in the process of constitution , the european think-tanks group has presented a memorandum entitled " new challenges , new beginnings – next steps in european development cooperation " . the group comprises the think tanks die -lrb- germany -rrb- , odi -lrb- uk -rrb- , fride -lrb- spain -rrb- , and the european centre for development policy management ecdpm .
the memorandum analyses both current european policy and emerging challenges in climate change , migration , trade policy as well as the coherence of and division of labor in development policy .
eu should become more prominent actor in development field based on this analysis , the think-tanks group has formulated a number of recommendations for national and european decision-makers .
europe has still not succeeded in carving out a place for itself as a player in the world of the ' big two ' - the us and china .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : activists were disappointed with the lack of results at the copenhagen climate talks this became evident not least at the failed climate negotiations in copenhagen , where , when it came to the pivotal rounds of the talks , the us and china constituted more or less a group of their own .
if we viewed the european union 's external relations as a chorus , what we would see is a group of inveterate soloists seeking to prepare a new piece without a conductor .
in adopting the treaty of lisbon the eu might be said to have struggled though one page of the score .
this deserves praise .
but at a point of time where the dilapidated state of the global concert hall is becoming only all too evident , the real concern is : at present the substance and emphases of world politics are shifting towards the pacific .
europe depends on international decisions while europe is a globally networked region , it does have a marked atlantic orientation .
peace and prosperity in europe are dependent in crucial ways on whether or not the decisions taken in international bodies are of a long-term nature .
one consequence of this is that the distinction between domestic and foreign policy is growing increasingly blurred .
there is no isle of the blessed in a global financial and economic crisis , neither in europe nor in africa nor anywhere else .
the global climate is changing , and our way of life is going to have to change .
this goes not only for the us or china , the new global polluter , but also for europe , and especially for it – as well as for africa , which has contributed as good as nothing to climate change .
in short : we have an enlightened self-interest in global development .
eu should offer global leadership the tenor of the eu memorandum 's authors : if europe is to continue to be taken seriously as a global actor on its own merits , both european and national leaders need to address five central points : bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu should take on a more a more prominent role in development policy first , development policy needs to be seen as an element of approaches to global problem-solving – which means that it needs to become one of the central areas of european foreign policy .
here europe must offer global leadership .
the world trade talks are set to continue in geneva this year .
in september the united nations will be hosting a summit on the state of the un millennium development goals -lrb- mdgs -rrb- .
in june canada is to host the g8 / g20 for a conference on the financial crisis .
in addition , the climate talks will be returning to bonn in june .
how far will europe 's voice carry in these concerts ?
effectiveness of development aid impacts on european credibility the second point concerns commitments on the volume and effectiveness of global development assistance .
this is a matter of europe 's own credibility .
not enough that the donors operating in africa often trip over one another for lack of coordination , the eu countries are currently offering 20 billion euros less in aid than they had originally pledged .
and there are fears that commitments on climate protection finance could come at the expense of other fields , with europe , in effect , pursuing a zero-sum policy – taking , as it were , funds from its right pocket and putting them into its left .
coordinating different fields third , development assistance must not be allowed simply to make up for what european policy has taken away elsewhere .
trade , climate protection , and immigration policy are key fields that need to be coordinated with the objectives of development policy .
this is a permanent task for which there can and will be no quick fixes .
investing in international partnerships bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sven grimm , researcher with bonn-based think-tank die fourth , it is essential to invest in global partnerships .
these are investments in a shared future .
partners need to be able act on equal terms – in order then to seek , on an equal footing , solutions to common problems .
in view of the fact that reforms of the bretton woods institutions are on the immediate agenda , the international decisions that need to be taken in the near future will put europe to the test .
international power shifts are already becoming evident .
measured in terms of its economic power , which is declining in relation to asia , europe is overrepresented in imf and world bank .
when it comes to international bodies , europe often seems to confuse quantity with quality , and having a large number of representatives in the g20 or the imf does not necessarily mean more influence if efforts to coordinate such steps have not been successfully coordinated in advance .
only as a chorus will europe prove able to make its voice heard .
potential role of eu foreign service and finally , fifth , the memorandum points to the potentials of the new european foreign service .
its mix of personnel drawn from member states and eu institutions may be seen as an opportunity .
at present , though , there are more questions than answers concerning this matter .
agreements – including the reform-oriented lisbon treaty – will be doomed to lead a life on paper unless europe 's responsible institutions and leaders prove able to improve their cooperation .
in other words , the question is : does europe now need to opt for more centralization ?
this is , in fact , not a realistic option , as the protracted wrangling in recent years over eu reforms has shown .
taking lisbon treaty as framework to improve policies the treaty of lisbon is certainly not the big bang for european global power .
but it does provide a good framework for improved coordination .
it is essential that efforts to improve the eu 's division of labor actually bear fruit if europe 's diversity is to be orchestrated to form a good chorus .
otherwise europe 's voice is likely to turn out to be little more than world-political background noise .
but one thing that can be said with certainty is that for the european countries global acoustics would be far worse in a world dominated by the big two . " sven grimm is a researcher at the department bi- and multilateral development cooperation with the german development institute / deutsches institut für entwicklungspolitik -lrb- die -rrb- , a think tank based in bonn . simon maxwell is a senior research associate with leading british think tank , the overseas development institute -lrb- odi -rrb- . the german development institute / deutsches institut für entwicklungspolitik -lrb- die -rrb- is one of the leading think tanks for development policy world-wide .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : activists were disappointed with the lack of results at the copenhagen climate talks this became evident not least at the failed climate negotiations in copenhagen , where , when it came to the pivotal rounds of the talks , the us and china constituted more or less a group of their own .
if we viewed the european union 's external relations as a chorus , what we would see is a group of inveterate soloists seeking to prepare a new piece without a conductor .
in adopting the treaty of lisbon the eu might be said to have struggled though one page of the score .
this deserves praise .
but at a point of time where the dilapidated state of the global concert hall is becoming only all too evident , the real concern is : at present the substance and emphases of world politics are shifting towards the pacific .
europe depends on international decisions while europe is a globally networked region , it does have a marked atlantic orientation .
peace and prosperity in europe are dependent in crucial ways on whether or not the decisions taken in international bodies are of a long-term nature .
one consequence of this is that the distinction between domestic and foreign policy is growing increasingly blurred .
there is no isle of the blessed in a global financial and economic crisis , neither in europe nor in africa nor anywhere else .
the global climate is changing , and our way of life is going to have to change .
this goes not only for the us or china , the new global polluter , but also for europe , and especially for it – as well as for africa , which has contributed as good as nothing to climate change .
in short : we have an enlightened self-interest in global development .
eu should offer global leadership the tenor of the eu memorandum 's authors : if europe is to continue to be taken seriously as a global actor on its own merits , both european and national leaders need to address five central points : bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu should take on a more a more prominent role in development policy first , development policy needs to be seen as an element of approaches to global problem-solving – which means that it needs to become one of the central areas of european foreign policy .
here europe must offer global leadership .
the world trade talks are set to continue in geneva this year .
in september the united nations will be hosting a summit on the state of the un millennium development goals -lrb- mdgs -rrb- .
in june canada is to host the g8 / g20 for a conference on the financial crisis .
in addition , the climate talks will be returning to bonn in june .
how far will europe 's voice carry in these concerts ?
effectiveness of development aid impacts on european credibility the second point concerns commitments on the volume and effectiveness of global development assistance .
this is a matter of europe 's own credibility .
not enough that the donors operating in africa often trip over one another for lack of coordination , the eu countries are currently offering 20 billion euros less in aid than they had originally pledged .
and there are fears that commitments on climate protection finance could come at the expense of other fields , with europe , in effect , pursuing a zero-sum policy – taking , as it were , funds from its right pocket and putting them into its left .
coordinating different fields third , development assistance must not be allowed simply to make up for what european policy has taken away elsewhere .
trade , climate protection , and immigration policy are key fields that need to be coordinated with the objectives of development policy .
this is a permanent task for which there can and will be no quick fixes .
investing in international partnerships bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sven grimm , researcher with bonn-based think-tank die fourth , it is essential to invest in global partnerships .
these are investments in a shared future .
partners need to be able act on equal terms – in order then to seek , on an equal footing , solutions to common problems .
in view of the fact that reforms of the bretton woods institutions are on the immediate agenda , the international decisions that need to be taken in the near future will put europe to the test .
international power shifts are already becoming evident .
measured in terms of its economic power , which is declining in relation to asia , europe is overrepresented in imf and world bank .
when it comes to international bodies , europe often seems to confuse quantity with quality , and having a large number of representatives in the g20 or the imf does not necessarily mean more influence if efforts to coordinate such steps have not been successfully coordinated in advance .
only as a chorus will europe prove able to make its voice heard .
potential role of eu foreign service and finally , fifth , the memorandum points to the potentials of the new european foreign service .
its mix of personnel drawn from member states and eu institutions may be seen as an opportunity .
at present , though , there are more questions than answers concerning this matter .
agreements – including the reform-oriented lisbon treaty – will be doomed to lead a life on paper unless europe 's responsible institutions and leaders prove able to improve their cooperation .
in other words , the question is : does europe now need to opt for more centralization ?
this is , in fact , not a realistic option , as the protracted wrangling in recent years over eu reforms has shown .
taking lisbon treaty as framework to improve policies the treaty of lisbon is certainly not the big bang for european global power .
but it does provide a good framework for improved coordination .
it is essential that efforts to improve the eu 's division of labor actually bear fruit if europe 's diversity is to be orchestrated to form a good chorus .
otherwise europe 's voice is likely to turn out to be little more than world-political background noise .
but one thing that can be said with certainty is that for the european countries global acoustics would be far worse in a world dominated by the big two .

measured in terms of its economic power , which is declining in relation to asia , europe is overrepresented in imf and world bank .
when it comes to international bodies , europe often seems to confuse quantity with quality , and having a large number of representatives in the g20 or the imf does not necessarily mean more influence if efforts to coordinate such steps have not been successfully coordinated in advance .
only as a chorus will europe prove able to make its voice heard .
potential role of eu foreign service and finally , fifth , the memorandum points to the potentials of the new european foreign service .
its mix of personnel drawn from member states and eu institutions may be seen as an opportunity .
at present , though , there are more questions than answers concerning this matter .
agreements – including the reform-oriented lisbon treaty – will be doomed to lead a life on paper unless europe 's responsible institutions and leaders prove able to improve their cooperation .
in other words , the question is : does europe now need to opt for more centralization ?
this is , in fact , not a realistic option , as the protracted wrangling in recent years over eu reforms has shown .
taking lisbon treaty as framework to improve policies the treaty of lisbon is certainly not the big bang for european global power .
but it does provide a good framework for improved coordination .
it is essential that efforts to improve the eu 's division of labor actually bear fruit if europe 's diversity is to be orchestrated to form a good chorus .
otherwise europe 's voice is likely to turn out to be little more than world-political background noise .
but one thing that can be said with certainty is that for the european countries global acoustics would be far worse in a world dominated by the big two .

the eu should take on more prominent role in the area , argue this week 's commenators sven grimm and simon maxwell . while the new eu commission in the process of constitution , the european think-tanks group has presented a memorandum entitled " new challenges , new beginnings – next steps in european development cooperation " . the group comprises the think tanks die -lrb- germany -rrb- , odi -lrb- uk -rrb- , fride -lrb- spain -rrb- , and the european centre for development policy management ecdpm .
the memorandum analyses both current european policy and emerging challenges in climate change , migration , trade policy as well as the coherence of and division of labor in development policy .
eu should become more prominent actor in development field based on this analysis , the think-tanks group has formulated a number of recommendations for national and european decision-makers .
europe has still not succeeded in carving out a place for itself as a player in the world of the ' big two ' - the us and china .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : activists were disappointed with the lack of results at the copenhagen climate talks this became evident not least at the failed climate negotiations in copenhagen , where , when it came to the pivotal rounds of the talks , the us and china constituted more or less a group of their own .
if we viewed the european union 's external relations as a chorus , what we would see is a group of inveterate soloists seeking to prepare a new piece without a conductor .
in adopting the treaty of lisbon the eu might be said to have struggled though one page of the score .
this deserves praise .
but at a point of time where the dilapidated state of the global concert hall is becoming only all too evident , the real concern is : at present the substance and emphases of world politics are shifting towards the pacific .
europe depends on international decisions while europe is a globally networked region , it does have a marked atlantic orientation .
peace and prosperity in europe are dependent in crucial ways on whether or not the decisions taken in international bodies are of a long-term nature .
one consequence of this is that the distinction between domestic and foreign policy is growing increasingly blurred .
there is no isle of the blessed in a global financial and economic crisis , neither in europe nor in africa nor anywhere else .
the global climate is changing , and our way of life is going to have to change .
this goes not only for the us or china , the new global polluter , but also for europe , and especially for it – as well as for africa , which has contributed as good as nothing to climate change .
in short : we have an enlightened self-interest in global development .
eu should offer global leadership the tenor of the eu memorandum 's authors : if europe is to continue to be taken seriously as a global actor on its own merits , both european and national leaders need to address five central points : bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu should take on a more a more prominent role in development policy first , development policy needs to be seen as an element of approaches to global problem-solving – which means that it needs to become one of the central areas of european foreign policy .
here europe must offer global leadership .
the world trade talks are set to continue in geneva this year .
in september the united nations will be hosting a summit on the state of the un millennium development goals -lrb- mdgs -rrb- .
in june canada is to host the g8 / g20 for a conference on the financial crisis .
in addition , the climate talks will be returning to bonn in june .
how far will europe 's voice carry in these concerts ?
effectiveness of development aid impacts on european credibility the second point concerns commitments on the volume and effectiveness of global development assistance .
this is a matter of europe 's own credibility .
not enough that the donors operating in africa often trip over one another for lack of coordination , the eu countries are currently offering 20 billion euros less in aid than they had originally pledged .
and there are fears that commitments on climate protection finance could come at the expense of other fields , with europe , in effect , pursuing a zero-sum policy – taking , as it were , funds from its right pocket and putting them into its left .
coordinating different fields third , development assistance must not be allowed simply to make up for what european policy has taken away elsewhere .
trade , climate protection , and immigration policy are key fields that need to be coordinated with the objectives of development policy .
this is a permanent task for which there can and will be no quick fixes .
investing in international partnerships bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sven grimm , researcher with bonn-based think-tank die fourth , it is essential to invest in global partnerships .
these are investments in a shared future .
partners need to be able act on equal terms – in order then to seek , on an equal footing , solutions to common problems .
in view of the fact that reforms of the bretton woods institutions are on the immediate agenda , the international decisions that need to be taken in the near future will put europe to the test .
international power shifts are already becoming evident .
measured in terms of its economic power , which is declining in relation to asia , europe is overrepresented in imf and world bank .
when it comes to international bodies , europe often seems to confuse quantity with quality , and having a large number of representatives in the g20 or the imf does not necessarily mean more influence if efforts to coordinate such steps have not been successfully coordinated in advance .

but in the face of criticism and protests , the law wo n't be enforced , says the government . a new law to curb child pornography has come into force in germany , but , in a legal curiosity , it is not going to be used by the courts .
the salient point is that instead of blocking child porn websites , the government now thinks it would better to erase them . the controversial legislation was drafted in 2009 by the former conservative family minister , ursula von der leyen , who said that she was willing to act against " a massive spread of child pornography on the internet . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ursula von der leyen is eager to stop child abuse material on the internet " we are no longer going to tolerate the fact that pictures of children being raped are massively accessed and distributed on the internet in germany , " she said , shortly before introducing the bill to parliament last year . mere symbolism under the new law , the german federal criminal office -lrb- bka -rrb- is supposed to provide a regularly updated list of websites , which they 've found to contain child pornographic pictures and images . german internet providers must then post a red " stop " sign on them , but are not allowed to erase them .
the german law also does n't extend to providers based abroad . christian bahls from the organisation " abuse victims against internet access blocking " accused the government of pursuing " a policy of symbolism , " which he described as " a slap in the face of the victims of child pornography . " " the victims of abuse are being abused again , namely as symbols in a questionable government campaign , " he said . freedom vs crime fighting since last summer , there 's been a groundswell of protests by germans who see the law as a first step on the path towards government censorship of the internet . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protestors demanding internet freedom did n't want to listen to the government 's arguments franziska heine has been spearheading a public pressure campaign called " expedition against internet blocking , " which is aimed at forcing parliament to re-introduce the law . about 134.000 germans have signed on to an official petition to parliament pressed by the group . mrs heine claimed that the law was based on " entirely false information " about the distribution of child pornography . " the law has huge repercussion for the freedom of information , but does little to help the victims , " she said . mrs heine 's opinion is supported by police specialists investigating cases of child pornography . frank federau , a member of a special unit at the regional police office in the federal state of lower saxony , believes child abuse material is not primarily exchanged using the internet .

the eu should take on more prominent role in the area , argue this week 's commenators sven grimm and simon maxwell . while the new eu commission in the process of constitution , the european think-tanks group has presented a memorandum entitled " new challenges , new beginnings – next steps in european development cooperation " . the group comprises the think tanks die -lrb- germany -rrb- , odi -lrb- uk -rrb- , fride -lrb- spain -rrb- , and the european centre for development policy management ecdpm .
the memorandum analyses both current european policy and emerging challenges in climate change , migration , trade policy as well as the coherence of and division of labor in development policy .
eu should become more prominent actor in development field based on this analysis , the think-tanks group has formulated a number of recommendations for national and european decision-makers .
europe has still not succeeded in carving out a place for itself as a player in the world of the ' big two ' - the us and china .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : activists were disappointed with the lack of results at the copenhagen climate talks this became evident not least at the failed climate negotiations in copenhagen , where , when it came to the pivotal rounds of the talks , the us and china constituted more or less a group of their own .
if we viewed the european union 's external relations as a chorus , what we would see is a group of inveterate soloists seeking to prepare a new piece without a conductor .
in adopting the treaty of lisbon the eu might be said to have struggled though one page of the score .
this deserves praise .
but at a point of time where the dilapidated state of the global concert hall is becoming only all too evident , the real concern is : at present the substance and emphases of world politics are shifting towards the pacific .
europe depends on international decisions while europe is a globally networked region , it does have a marked atlantic orientation .
peace and prosperity in europe are dependent in crucial ways on whether or not the decisions taken in international bodies are of a long-term nature .
one consequence of this is that the distinction between domestic and foreign policy is growing increasingly blurred .
there is no isle of the blessed in a global financial and economic crisis , neither in europe nor in africa nor anywhere else .
the global climate is changing , and our way of life is going to have to change .
this goes not only for the us or china , the new global polluter , but also for europe , and especially for it – as well as for africa , which has contributed as good as nothing to climate change .
in short : we have an enlightened self-interest in global development .
eu should offer global leadership the tenor of the eu memorandum 's authors : if europe is to continue to be taken seriously as a global actor on its own merits , both european and national leaders need to address five central points : bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu should take on a more a more prominent role in development policy first , development policy needs to be seen as an element of approaches to global problem-solving – which means that it needs to become one of the central areas of european foreign policy .
here europe must offer global leadership .
the world trade talks are set to continue in geneva this year .
in september the united nations will be hosting a summit on the state of the un millennium development goals -lrb- mdgs -rrb- .
in june canada is to host the g8 / g20 for a conference on the financial crisis .
in addition , the climate talks will be returning to bonn in june .
how far will europe 's voice carry in these concerts ?
effectiveness of development aid impacts on european credibility the second point concerns commitments on the volume and effectiveness of global development assistance .
this is a matter of europe 's own credibility .
not enough that the donors operating in africa often trip over one another for lack of coordination , the eu countries are currently offering 20 billion euros less in aid than they had originally pledged .
and there are fears that commitments on climate protection finance could come at the expense of other fields , with europe , in effect , pursuing a zero-sum policy – taking , as it were , funds from its right pocket and putting them into its left .
coordinating different fields third , development assistance must not be allowed simply to make up for what european policy has taken away elsewhere .
trade , climate protection , and immigration policy are key fields that need to be coordinated with the objectives of development policy .
this is a permanent task for which there can and will be no quick fixes .
investing in international partnerships bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sven grimm , researcher with bonn-based think-tank die fourth , it is essential to invest in global partnerships .
these are investments in a shared future .
partners need to be able act on equal terms – in order then to seek , on an equal footing , solutions to common problems .
in view of the fact that reforms of the bretton woods institutions are on the immediate agenda , the international decisions that need to be taken in the near future will put europe to the test .
international power shifts are already becoming evident .
measured in terms of its economic power , which is declining in relation to asia , europe is overrepresented in imf and world bank .
when it comes to international bodies , europe often seems to confuse quantity with quality , and having a large number of representatives in the g20 or the imf does not necessarily mean more influence if efforts to coordinate such steps have not been successfully coordinated in advance .
only as a chorus will europe prove able to make its voice heard .
potential role of eu foreign service and finally , fifth , the memorandum points to the potentials of the new european foreign service .
its mix of personnel drawn from member states and eu institutions may be seen as an opportunity .
at present , though , there are more questions than answers concerning this matter .
agreements – including the reform-oriented lisbon treaty – will be doomed to lead a life on paper unless europe 's responsible institutions and leaders prove able to improve their cooperation .
in other words , the question is : does europe now need to opt for more centralization ?
this is , in fact , not a realistic option , as the protracted wrangling in recent years over eu reforms has shown .
taking lisbon treaty as framework to improve policies the treaty of lisbon is certainly not the big bang for european global power .
but it does provide a good framework for improved coordination .
it is essential that efforts to improve the eu 's division of labor actually bear fruit if europe 's diversity is to be orchestrated to form a good chorus .
otherwise europe 's voice is likely to turn out to be little more than world-political background noise .
but one thing that can be said with certainty is that for the european countries global acoustics would be far worse in a world dominated by the big two .

one consequence of this is that the distinction between domestic and foreign policy is growing increasingly blurred .
there is no isle of the blessed in a global financial and economic crisis , neither in europe nor in africa nor anywhere else .
the global climate is changing , and our way of life is going to have to change .
this goes not only for the us or china , the new global polluter , but also for europe , and especially for it – as well as for africa , which has contributed as good as nothing to climate change .
in short : we have an enlightened self-interest in global development .
eu should offer global leadership the tenor of the eu memorandum 's authors : if europe is to continue to be taken seriously as a global actor on its own merits , both european and national leaders need to address five central points : bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu should take on a more a more prominent role in development policy first , development policy needs to be seen as an element of approaches to global problem-solving – which means that it needs to become one of the central areas of european foreign policy .
here europe must offer global leadership .
the world trade talks are set to continue in geneva this year .
in september the united nations will be hosting a summit on the state of the un millennium development goals -lrb- mdgs -rrb- .
in june canada is to host the g8 / g20 for a conference on the financial crisis .
in addition , the climate talks will be returning to bonn in june .
how far will europe 's voice carry in these concerts ?
effectiveness of development aid impacts on european credibility the second point concerns commitments on the volume and effectiveness of global development assistance .
this is a matter of europe 's own credibility .
not enough that the donors operating in africa often trip over one another for lack of coordination , the eu countries are currently offering 20 billion euros less in aid than they had originally pledged .
and there are fears that commitments on climate protection finance could come at the expense of other fields , with europe , in effect , pursuing a zero-sum policy – taking , as it were , funds from its right pocket and putting them into its left .
coordinating different fields third , development assistance must not be allowed simply to make up for what european policy has taken away elsewhere .
trade , climate protection , and immigration policy are key fields that need to be coordinated with the objectives of development policy .
this is a permanent task for which there can and will be no quick fixes .
investing in international partnerships bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sven grimm , researcher with bonn-based think-tank die fourth , it is essential to invest in global partnerships .
these are investments in a shared future .
partners need to be able act on equal terms – in order then to seek , on an equal footing , solutions to common problems .
in view of the fact that reforms of the bretton woods institutions are on the immediate agenda , the international decisions that need to be taken in the near future will put europe to the test .
international power shifts are already becoming evident .
measured in terms of its economic power , which is declining in relation to asia , europe is overrepresented in imf and world bank .
when it comes to international bodies , europe often seems to confuse quantity with quality , and having a large number of representatives in the g20 or the imf does not necessarily mean more influence if efforts to coordinate such steps have not been successfully coordinated in advance .
only as a chorus will europe prove able to make its voice heard .
potential role of eu foreign service and finally , fifth , the memorandum points to the potentials of the new european foreign service .
its mix of personnel drawn from member states and eu institutions may be seen as an opportunity .
at present , though , there are more questions than answers concerning this matter .
agreements – including the reform-oriented lisbon treaty – will be doomed to lead a life on paper unless europe 's responsible institutions and leaders prove able to improve their cooperation .
in other words , the question is : does europe now need to opt for more centralization ?
this is , in fact , not a realistic option , as the protracted wrangling in recent years over eu reforms has shown .
taking lisbon treaty as framework to improve policies the treaty of lisbon is certainly not the big bang for european global power .
but it does provide a good framework for improved coordination .
it is essential that efforts to improve the eu 's division of labor actually bear fruit if europe 's diversity is to be orchestrated to form a good chorus .
otherwise europe 's voice is likely to turn out to be little more than world-political background noise .
but one thing that can be said with certainty is that for the european countries global acoustics would be far worse in a world dominated by the big two .

the two clubs now await a second duel in spain in march . stuttgart made the most of the capacity home crowd at mercedes-benz arena , starting the match energetically and taking it to barcelona .
the early initiative paid dividends when brazilian forward cacau headed in a perfect timo gebhart center ball from the right on the 25-minute mark .
the germans continued to press barcelona 's defense and came close to snatching goals on three more occasions , in addition to an appeal for handball by barca defender gerard pique .
at the outset of the second half , barcelona came out a different team and pulled level within seven minutes through frontman zlatan ibrahimovic .
the opportunity came when stuttgart failed to clear a corner and the ball came back in for pique , who headed down for ibrahimovic to volley home .
the initial shot was parried by stuttgart keeper jens lehmann , but ibrahimovic was able to knock the rebound over the goal line .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cacau 's goal came midway through the first half the catalans dominated the remainder of the clash , a fact stuttgart coach christian gross seized upon .
" we should have scored a second goal in the first half , " gross said following the match .
" we had clear chances . "
barcelona midfielder andreas iniesta was upbeat about the result , saying he was confident the ball was now in barcelona 's court .
" we knew that it was going to be a difficult game , " said the spain international .
" and the truth is that they really made us suffer in the first half .
" now we have the tie in our favor , but there are still 90 minutes left to play . "
in tuesday night 's other champions league clash , french club bordeaux defeated greek giants olympiacos 0-1 away from home .

the two clubs now await a second duel in spain in march . stuttgart made the most of the capacity home crowd at mercedes-benz arena , starting the match energetically and taking it to barcelona .
the early initiative paid dividends when brazilian forward cacau headed in a perfect timo gebhart center ball from the right on the 25-minute mark .
the germans continued to press barcelona 's defense and came close to snatching goals on three more occasions , in addition to an appeal for handball by barca defender gerard pique .
at the outset of the second half , barcelona came out a different team and pulled level within seven minutes through frontman zlatan ibrahimovic .
the opportunity came when stuttgart failed to clear a corner and the ball came back in for pique , who headed down for ibrahimovic to volley home .
the initial shot was parried by stuttgart keeper jens lehmann , but ibrahimovic was able to knock the rebound over the goal line .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cacau 's goal came midway through the first half the catalans dominated the remainder of the clash , a fact stuttgart coach christian gross seized upon .
" we should have scored a second goal in the first half , " gross said following the match .
" we had clear chances . "
barcelona midfielder andreas iniesta was upbeat about the result , saying he was confident the ball was now in barcelona 's court .
" we knew that it was going to be a difficult game , " said the spain international .
" and the truth is that they really made us suffer in the first half .
" now we have the tie in our favor , but there are still 90 minutes left to play . "

indeed , education is considered so crucial that when the united nations released its millennium development goals for 2015 , universal primary education was slated as the number two priority , second only to eradicating extreme poverty and hunger .
but a report released by berlin-based anti-corruption organisation transparency international suggests that endemic corruption in african schooling systems is still seeing large numbers of primary-aged african children denied their right to an education .
" basically all issues around resourcing had a dimension of corruption , with resources being exploited or embezzled by someone for private gain , but sometimes also just plain mismanagement , " said stephane stassen , who co-authored the report .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : giving children an education is crucial in post-war sierra leone the transparency international study " good governance lessons for primary education " was produced as part of the organisation 's africa education watch initiative and examined the impact of corruption on education quality and availability in seven african countries , interviewing over 8500 educators and parents in ghana , madagascar , morocco , niger , senegal , sierra leone and uganda .
change coming too slow to the continent the data collected paints a troubling picture of education in africa : despite two decades of reforms designed to allow greater levels of management at the local level and improve accountability , school administration is still not , for the most part , a genuinely corruption-free and participatory governance system .
" despite all these measures , there were still many governance challenges , " said stephane stassen , who heads transparency international 's africa education watch program .
one of the most striking examples is that of so-called registration fees , which parents from every country surveyed reported paying , although by law primary schooling is free .
the number of parents forced to pay these illegal accounting fees ranged from 9 % in ghana , to 90 % in morocco , the report found .
" similarly , in some countries where they had also abolished exam fees , they were still being charged , " said stassen .
he added that in many countries , textbooks were often not available .
and even if they were dispatched to schools , they were often not distributed for free .
the problems were also identified at higher levels , for example when schools receiving grants with which to run themselves were not receiving the full amount , or it was coming with a delay .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most parents can not afford high school fees the average cost of enrolling a primary-aged child in an african school for one year is three euros .
by comparison , the average per capita income in sierra leone is just us $ 260 -lrb- 190 euros -rrb- per year .
the costs charged for " free " textbooks as well as the fees of illegal " compulsory tutoring " - charged by some teachers to supplement their meagre incomes - puts an additional strain on african families .
crucial learning years missed these prohibitively high costs can lead to higher school dropout rates at a crucial time in children 's lives . " primary education is really the place where you get the basics for your life later on .
this is where you learn to read and write , this is where you learn to count , and if , for example if in africa you want to have a chance in trade or to go beyond your village , these are really skills you need to acquire . "
stassen said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : illiteracy among older people is high in many parts of africa he added that without a basic education , it would be nearly impossible to go on to high school or college .
" it 's really hard to get people back to school later on , and this is why we have to get things right now " .
literacy remains low in many parts of africa .
in senegal , for instance , just 43 percent of adults were considered literate in 2007 , compared to 72 percent in madagascar .
despite the obstacles , enrolment figures for primary-aged children in africa are on the increase .
according to 2009 figures from the un , net enrolment in sub-saharan africa went from 58 percent in 2000 to 74 percent in 2007 and from 91 percent to 96 percent over the same period of time in northern africa .
but enrolment figures do not tell the whole story : not only may corrupt practices prevent children from attending school , but they also lower the quality of education for students once they get there .
" even if you are in class , it might mean that you do n't learn much , because you have one textbook for ten learners if not more , " stassen said mismanagement partly to blame in many schools , the report found resources were being wasted or lost , not wilfully , but because those responsible for their management were simply ill-equipped for the job .
overall , 85 percent of schools across all countries had either deficient accounting systems or none at all , and in morocco , just 23 percent of head teachers received training in financial management , despite being responsible for budgets .
in niger that figure drops to just 8 percent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stephane stassen heads transparency international 's africa education watch program " schools where the head teacher had been trained and prepared to do his job in terms of managing the resources of the schools were … the schools where less of these corrupt practices were appearing , " said stassen .
" in a sense , what we found was that head teachers and teachers themselves were really feeling that they had been abandoned by the system . "
a way forward universal schooling for primary-aged children may be untenable by 2015 , but transparency international 's report suggests the reforms that have been made to date are in fact helping african schoolchildren .
the report found that schools that were more frequently audited tended to perform better : education outcomes were better and parents reported paying fewer illegal fees .
training in financial management for head teachers and school management committees could be strengthened , said stassen , to improve accountability .
stassen added that helping african parents to understand more about their rights within the schooling system was a crucial step in increasing engagement and accountability .
" i think that by combining inspections , grassroots accountability and better transparency in the system , you could really have an education system which is more efficient and better-resourced . "

indeed , education is considered so crucial that when the united nations released its millennium development goals for 2015 , universal primary education was slated as the number two priority , second only to eradicating extreme poverty and hunger .
but a report released by berlin-based anti-corruption organisation transparency international suggests that endemic corruption in african schooling systems is still seeing large numbers of primary-aged african children denied their right to an education .
" basically all issues around resourcing had a dimension of corruption , with resources being exploited or embezzled by someone for private gain , but sometimes also just plain mismanagement , " said stephane stassen , who co-authored the report .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : giving children an education is crucial in post-war sierra leone the transparency international study " good governance lessons for primary education " was produced as part of the organisation 's africa education watch initiative and examined the impact of corruption on education quality and availability in seven african countries , interviewing over 8500 educators and parents in ghana , madagascar , morocco , niger , senegal , sierra leone and uganda .
change coming too slow to the continent the data collected paints a troubling picture of education in africa : despite two decades of reforms designed to allow greater levels of management at the local level and improve accountability , school administration is still not , for the most part , a genuinely corruption-free and participatory governance system .
" despite all these measures , there were still many governance challenges , " said stephane stassen , who heads transparency international 's africa education watch program .
one of the most striking examples is that of so-called registration fees , which parents from every country surveyed reported paying , although by law primary schooling is free .
the number of parents forced to pay these illegal accounting fees ranged from 9 % in ghana , to 90 % in morocco , the report found .
" similarly , in some countries where they had also abolished exam fees , they were still being charged , " said stassen .
he added that in many countries , textbooks were often not available .
and even if they were dispatched to schools , they were often not distributed for free .
the problems were also identified at higher levels , for example when schools receiving grants with which to run themselves were not receiving the full amount , or it was coming with a delay .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most parents can not afford high school fees the average cost of enrolling a primary-aged child in an african school for one year is three euros .
by comparison , the average per capita income in sierra leone is just us $ 260 -lrb- 190 euros -rrb- per year .
the costs charged for " free " textbooks as well as the fees of illegal " compulsory tutoring " - charged by some teachers to supplement their meagre incomes - puts an additional strain on african families .
crucial learning years missed these prohibitively high costs can lead to higher school dropout rates at a crucial time in children 's lives . " primary education is really the place where you get the basics for your life later on .
this is where you learn to read and write , this is where you learn to count , and if , for example if in africa you want to have a chance in trade or to go beyond your village , these are really skills you need to acquire . "
stassen said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : illiteracy among older people is high in many parts of africa he added that without a basic education , it would be nearly impossible to go on to high school or college .
" it 's really hard to get people back to school later on , and this is why we have to get things right now " .
literacy remains low in many parts of africa .
in senegal , for instance , just 43 percent of adults were considered literate in 2007 , compared to 72 percent in madagascar .
despite the obstacles , enrolment figures for primary-aged children in africa are on the increase .
according to 2009 figures from the un , net enrolment in sub-saharan africa went from 58 percent in 2000 to 74 percent in 2007 and from 91 percent to 96 percent over the same period of time in northern africa .
but enrolment figures do not tell the whole story : not only may corrupt practices prevent children from attending school , but they also lower the quality of education for students once they get there .
" even if you are in class , it might mean that you do n't learn much , because you have one textbook for ten learners if not more , " stassen said mismanagement partly to blame in many schools , the report found resources were being wasted or lost , not wilfully , but because those responsible for their management were simply ill-equipped for the job .
overall , 85 percent of schools across all countries had either deficient accounting systems or none at all , and in morocco , just 23 percent of head teachers received training in financial management , despite being responsible for budgets .
in niger that figure drops to just 8 percent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stephane stassen heads transparency international 's africa education watch program " schools where the head teacher had been trained and prepared to do his job in terms of managing the resources of the schools were … the schools where less of these corrupt practices were appearing , " said stassen .
" in a sense , what we found was that head teachers and teachers themselves were really feeling that they had been abandoned by the system . "
a way forward universal schooling for primary-aged children may be untenable by 2015 , but transparency international 's report suggests the reforms that have been made to date are in fact helping african schoolchildren .
the report found that schools that were more frequently audited tended to perform better : education outcomes were better and parents reported paying fewer illegal fees .
training in financial management for head teachers and school management committees could be strengthened , said stassen , to improve accountability .
stassen added that helping african parents to understand more about their rights within the schooling system was a crucial step in increasing engagement and accountability .
" i think that by combining inspections , grassroots accountability and better transparency in the system , you could really have an education system which is more efficient and better-resourced . "

it expects normal service to be restored by friday . lufthansa says only half of its normally scheduled flights will operate on tuesday and it will take until friday to get its worldwide network completely back up to speed .
on monday evening lufthansa and the pilots ' trade union cockpit agreed during mediation in a frankfurt labour court to resume negotiations , with cockpit suspending its work stoppage until march 8 .
lufthansa had gone to court seeking an injunction against the strike .
cockpit called the walkout to press its demands for job security guarantees and pay rises for 4,500 pilots the work stoppage , which had begun early on monday , led to the cancellation of 900 flights .
it was meant to continue until thursday .
also affected were lufthhansa 's subsidiary germanwings and lufthansa 's cargo division .
aircraft parked , crews displaced that left most aircraft parked at lufthansa 's hubs in frankfurt and munich , with crews and planes displaced from normal departure points .
a lufthansa spokesman said the airline was working at top speed to reinstate its global flight schedule .
lufthansa spokesman klaus walther told zdf german public television that extra flights would be provided on germany 's main routes - frankfurt-munich , frankfurt-berlin and frankfurt-hamburg .

istanbul police were questioning 29 of them at their headquarters , news broadcaster ntv reported .
police also brought 10 of the arrested officers to an istanbul court early on tuesday , according to the state-run anatolian news agency .
the court is to decide whether to hold them in custody .
the series of arrests is one of the biggest against the military , which has ousted four governments since 1960 and considers itself to be the guardian of turkey 's secular tradition .
turkish prime minister tayyip erdogan commented on the arrests during an official visit to madrid .
" after the security forces have finished this process , the judiciary will make its assessment , " erdogan said .
coup plot bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ruling ak party has support from voters and the european union the crackdown relates to the 2003 " sledgehammer " plot to overthrow the government , led by the islam-rooted ak party .
media reports have said the military planned to provoke an attack from neighboring greece and plant bombs inside istanbul mosques and museums to incite chaos and justify a military coup .
military leaders have denied the accusations and claim the plot was only a hypothetical training scenario .
more than 200 people have been arrested since the story broke in 2007 , including military officers , politicians , lawyers and writers .
critics of the government claim prime minister erdogan has used the investigation to silence opposition .
governmental power struggle the ak party , or justice and development party , came to power only a year after its founding when it won a parliamentary majority in 2002 and ended decades of secularist rule .
the party brands itself as pro-market and pro-western , favoring turkey 's bid for membership of the european union .
but the staunchly secular institutions of the military and judiciary have been in a deep power struggle with the government , which has solid electoral support .
erdogan has sought parliamentary support to curb the power of judges and prosecutors , and has said he would call a referendum on a constitutional reform to the judicial system if plans in parliament fail .
his government has also moved to curb the military 's influence in state affairs as part of a democratic reform plan aimed at eventual eu membership. acb / dpa / ap / reuters editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

soldiers tell of rituals with names like " fire dance " and the " jukebox " . germany 's parliamentary commissioner for the armed forces , reinhold robbe , said he had received 54 written accounts of abuse and degrading treatment since he submitted a report about hazing in the military .
several of the letters he received from soldiers corroborated previous allegations that mountain infantry troops at a camp in bavaria had been forced to drink alcohol and eat raw pork liver until they threw up .
robbe , a member of the social democratic party , demanded that the training curriculum be changed and said that the " dangerous , tasteless rituals must stop . "
fire dances and jukeboxes the new letters also bring to light other forms of hazing .
one former member of the marines said that new sailors were often subjected to harsh rituals during their first nights at sea .
he described the " fire dance , " in which a man was forced to strip off his pants and have a lighted wick placed in his anus ; another in which a floor polishing machine with rough bristles was held against a recruit 's naked bottom until the skin turned red .
a volunteer soldier stationed in southern germany between 1996 and 1998 told of soldiers being forced to play " jukebox , " during which they were shut into a locker , which was then stood upside down , and the occupant forced to sing certain songs .
defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg renewed his promise of a complete investigation .
he did not rule out the possibility of disciplinary action for those involved , although he warned against making an across-the-board judgment .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de energy -pipe- 23.02.2010 germany to cut subsidies for solar energy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is the world leader in solar panel production a law proposed by chancellor angela merkel 's government would greatly reduce subsidies for solar energy production , and in some cases eliminate them all together . the center-right german government is proposing legislation to severely reduce state subsidies to solar power in an attempt to prevent market saturation and save money .
the draft law , which both the german parliament and chancellor angela merkel 's cabinet are to consider in the coming weeks , would cut state-guaranteed prices by 15 percent for energy produced by solar panels on open ground .
it would also cut prices by 16 percent for solar panels on roofs , where 80 percent of solar panels in germany are , and eliminate subsidies for panels placed on arable land .
a previous plan by environment minister norbert roettgen was criticized for not going far enough .
" there must be no more panels installed on arable land , " said peter altmaier , a member of merkel 's christian democrat union -lrb- cdu -rrb- who follows the solar energy sector .
" the objective is to reduce excessive stimulation without hindering an expansion of green energy . "
unintended consequences experts have criticized solar energy subsidies in germany for failing to spur competition in the industry , which accounts for less than one percent of all german electricity production .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : environmental groups have called the law a betrayal of renewable energy the subsidies have also had several unintended consequences : farmers have installed solar panels on their arable fields ; also , the global market has greatly increased , helping manufacturers in china , where labor is cheaper .
germany remains the world leader in solar panel production , but manufacturers have lost billions of euros in recent years and have been forced to cut and outsource jobs .
german group q-cells grew significantly until posting a 1.36-billion euro -lrb- $ 1.84 billion -rrb- net loss in 2009 .
support and opposition the reduction would save german consumers some of the one billion euros they pay per month in fees that underwrite solar energy production , according to hans-peter friedrich , a leader in the cdu 's bavarian sister party , the christian social union .
the law is supported by farmers resentful of investors who bought up arable land only to " harvest the sunshine . "
but the solar panel manufacturing lobby staunchly opposes the cutbacks , and some companies gave employees the day off to protest the law in berlin .

the draft law , which both the german parliament and chancellor angela merkel 's cabinet are to consider in the coming weeks , would cut state-guaranteed prices by 15 percent for energy produced by solar panels on open ground .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de internet -pipe- 23.02.2010 google rejects berlin 's privacy concerns over street view application großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : google says street view offers a unique new experience internet giant google said tuesday it aimed to launch its street view application in germany by the end of the year .
yet berlin insists there are concerns that the technology could breach privacy laws . google , which wants to extend its street view panoramic photos to germany later this year , has rejected strong privacy objections raised by the german government .
consumer affairs minister ilse aigner is demanding that the internet giant only displays its imagery after each affected german citizen has given his or her permission .
minister aigner said her staff were consulting with justice ministry officials , with the aim of tightening legislation .
she also demanded that google be ready to make people 's faces , car and house numbers , and even facades unrecognizable .
" a vague picture pixel change is not sufficient , " she said in berlin .
" i do not share the company 's assessment that all personal data concerns have been resolved . "
her ministry , she said , had been flooded with calls by citizens worried about protecting their privacy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a stroll in the internet , but is data privacy safeguarded ?
the head of google 's legal department , arnd haller said " we take personal data privacy very seriously .
we 've been discussing privacy issues all over europe , but here in germany the intensity of the questions is really impressive . "
a consultant hired by google , nikolas forgo , who is a hanover professor on informatics law , said a violation of personal rights was improbable .
google has already pledged to disguise car number plates and peoples ' faces .
berlin says google needs individual permission aigner had recently accused google 's service of being on the verge of violating the privacy of millions of citizens , each individually .
she demanded that google seek the permission from each person photographed on streets prior to publication .
street view photos are taken by camera cars which can capture all-round 360-degrees images .
these enable google users to simulate a stroll while sitting at their computers .
google has been gathering images of streets and public spaces in germany since 2008 .
the online service began in 2007 in four cities in the united states .
australia and japan soon followed .
in total google has initiated similar imaging projects in 19 countries , including many in europe .
satellites help pinpoint the panoramic scenes on maps using geo-data systems .
in a special exception for germany , haller said individuals would be able to file an objection with google to seek the removal of recognizable features .
" we 've a web site on-line with the relevant names and places where google street views are taken .
we also allow users to opt out in advance . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : street view is already available in several european countries " an immersive experience " google software developer raphael leiteritz said he believed street view was worth fighting for : " cards and maps have been two-dimensional for many years .
street view for the first time gives you an immersive experience .
you do n't look on a city from the top .
you can visit it and you can look around . "
that does not impress aigner .
she is demanding that google 's panoramic cameras be mounted no higher than 1.8 meters – instead of the current 2.5 meters on camera cars – so that views over fences and walls into residents ' gardens and courtyards are blocked .
other data privacy advocates also point out that potential burglars can use such internet imagery to recognize and target properties .
aigner told german public radio that google must act " definitively " on objections lodged by citizens , even to the point of making a building unrecognizable .
her ministry , she added , had placed a standardized complaint form on its website. ipj / apn / dpa / afp editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

yet berlin insists there are concerns that the technology could breach privacy laws . google , which wants to extend its street view panoramic photos to germany later this year , has rejected strong privacy objections raised by the german government .
consumer affairs minister ilse aigner is demanding that the internet giant only displays its imagery after each affected german citizen has given his or her permission .
minister aigner said her staff were consulting with justice ministry officials , with the aim of tightening legislation .
she also demanded that google be ready to make people 's faces , car and house numbers , and even facades unrecognizable .
" a vague picture pixel change is not sufficient , " she said in berlin .
" i do not share the company 's assessment that all personal data concerns have been resolved . "
her ministry , she said , had been flooded with calls by citizens worried about protecting their privacy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a stroll in the internet , but is data privacy safeguarded ?
the head of google 's legal department , arnd haller said " we take personal data privacy very seriously .
we 've been discussing privacy issues all over europe , but here in germany the intensity of the questions is really impressive . "
a consultant hired by google , nikolas forgo , who is a hanover professor on informatics law , said a violation of personal rights was improbable .
google has already pledged to disguise car number plates and peoples ' faces .
berlin says google needs individual permission aigner had recently accused google 's service of being on the verge of violating the privacy of millions of citizens , each individually .
she demanded that google seek the permission from each person photographed on streets prior to publication .
street view photos are taken by camera cars which can capture all-round 360-degrees images .
these enable google users to simulate a stroll while sitting at their computers .
google has been gathering images of streets and public spaces in germany since 2008 .
the online service began in 2007 in four cities in the united states .
australia and japan soon followed .
in total google has initiated similar imaging projects in 19 countries , including many in europe .
satellites help pinpoint the panoramic scenes on maps using geo-data systems .
in a special exception for germany , haller said individuals would be able to file an objection with google to seek the removal of recognizable features .
" we 've a web site on-line with the relevant names and places where google street views are taken .
we also allow users to opt out in advance . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : street view is already available in several european countries " an immersive experience " google software developer raphael leiteritz said he believed street view was worth fighting for : " cards and maps have been two-dimensional for many years .
street view for the first time gives you an immersive experience .
you do n't look on a city from the top .
you can visit it and you can look around . "
that does not impress aigner .
she is demanding that google 's panoramic cameras be mounted no higher than 1.8 meters – instead of the current 2.5 meters on camera cars – so that views over fences and walls into residents ' gardens and courtyards are blocked .
other data privacy advocates also point out that potential burglars can use such internet imagery to recognize and target properties .
aigner told german public radio that google must act " definitively " on objections lodged by citizens , even to the point of making a building unrecognizable .
her ministry , she added , had placed a standardized complaint form on its website. ipj / apn / dpa / afp editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

google has been gathering images of streets and public spaces in germany since 2008 .
the online service began in 2007 in four cities in the united states .
australia and japan soon followed .
in total google has initiated similar imaging projects in 19 countries , including many in europe .
satellites help pinpoint the panoramic scenes on maps using geo-data systems .
in a special exception for germany , haller said individuals would be able to file an objection with google to seek the removal of recognizable features .
" we 've a web site on-line with the relevant names and places where google street views are taken .
we also allow users to opt out in advance . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : street view is already available in several european countries " an immersive experience " google software developer raphael leiteritz said he believed street view was worth fighting for : " cards and maps have been two-dimensional for many years .
street view for the first time gives you an immersive experience .
you do n't look on a city from the top .
you can visit it and you can look around . "
that does not impress aigner .
she is demanding that google 's panoramic cameras be mounted no higher than 1.8 meters – instead of the current 2.5 meters on camera cars – so that views over fences and walls into residents ' gardens and courtyards are blocked .
other data privacy advocates also point out that potential burglars can use such internet imagery to recognize and target properties .
aigner told german public radio that google must act " definitively " on objections lodged by citizens , even to the point of making a building unrecognizable .
her ministry , she added , had placed a standardized complaint form on its website. ipj / apn / dpa / afp editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but it is unlikely to trigger a domino effect among other countries who have troops there . by the sheer number of troops , the dutch deployment does n't rank among top international contingents in afghanistan .
however , its force of 1,800 soldiers has not only been in charge of the uruzgan province in the dangerous southern part of the country , but has generally been seen as doing an excellent job there .
so the planned dutch pullout from afghanistan as a consequence of the governmen crisis in the hague will clearly have repercussions for nato 's military mission in the country at a time when most allies are already under pressure to justify their engagement at home .
this has already led to worries about a possible domino effect in the sense that other countries might also feel forced to reconsider their committments to afghanistan .
" it 's true that the afghanistan mission is very unpopular in many european countries , so it is definitely a cause for concern if the dutch withdraw on account of the collapsed government , " eva gross , who heads the eu foreign and security policy program at the institute for european studies at vrije universiteit brussel in belgium , told deutsche welle .
" but to speak of a domino effect may be overstating the case . "
each country in europe has its own dynamics and traditions , therefore gross does n't believe an automatic discussion about troop withdrawals in other eu states is likely .
german troop increase will go ahead for germany , where a parliamentary vote on the expansion of berlin 's afghan mission is scheduled for later this week , the dutch decision wo n't have an immediate effect either , argue experts .
public opinion in germany ca n't be swayed much by the dutch political crisis because a solid majority of germans is already against the military engagement in afghanistan , says klaus-peter schoeppner , head of tns emnid , a major german polling and reseach firm .
while germans are very skeptical about the afghan misson , schoeppner thinks that most of them can live with the exit scenario envisaged by the government .
" so , i do n't think that this topic will gain much traction in germany , " he told deutsche welle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany plans to send up to 850 additional troops to afghanistan what 's more , adds schoeppner , germans do n't view the mission in afghanistan as predominantly a military one .
" we regard ourselves as the number one humanitarian nation , " said schoeppner .
a fast withdrawal from afghanistan would not only end germany 's military , but also its humanitarian responsibilities .
currently there is no indication that this is a likely option for the government , he added .
" i am fairly confindent that the increase of troops will go through in parliament , mainly because the political elites have been in favor of a continuation of the mandate , " said gross .
exit strategies while the dutch withdrawal will not have any imminent effect on the committments of other allies , it will further increase the debate in many countries about timetables and exit strategies .
" we have seen this in discussions already in germany , britain or the united states that the focus is now already much more on finding ways of withdrawing their troops from afghanistan , " said gross .
that could make it hard for nato to find a replacement for dutch troops , if the new government in the hague does in fact decide to withdraw its soldiers .
australia already publicly dismissed a possible leadership role in uruzgan province and canada has said it wants to pull out its troops at the end of next year .
germany , which is currently in charge of the regional command in the north of afghanistan , has repeatedly rejected a german engagement in the south and is unlikely to change that position .
" i think it would be difficult for us to do more in afghanistan , because others leave , " said schoeppner .
if no other countries are willing to take over the dutch role in the south , the us might ultimately be forced to fulfill that task itself .
as an alternative , american officials have aired a possible role for non-nato troops in afghanistan .
but whether such an expansion of the afghan mission is realistic and how it could work is still unclear .
explaining the mission at least for now then , the political turmoil over the future of dutch troops in afghanistan will merely increase the pressure on nato planners to sketch out possible scenarios for a dutch withdrawal and not lead to a domino effect in other countries .
however , argue experts , since public sentiment is already very pessimistic about the afghan mission , military events on the ground can always have a major impact on public opinion .
bildunterschrift : politicians must better explain the rationale behind the afghan mission , say experts " in most countries a a rather large attack with loss of life would probably push the public to reject military engagement , " said gross .
since that is always possible , governments can only do one thing : " they have to communicate the reasons why we are in afghanistan much better and much more carefully .
i think the dutch withdrawal and the collapse of the government definitely highlights that the european public is unconvinced of the value of the afghan mission and that european politicians have some explaining to do , " she said .

" it 's true that the afghanistan mission is very unpopular in many european countries , so it is definitely a cause for concern if the dutch withdraw on account of the collapsed government , " eva gross , who heads the eu foreign and security policy program at the institute for european studies at vrije universiteit brussel in belgium , told deutsche welle .
" but to speak of a domino effect may be overstating the case . "
each country in europe has its own dynamics and traditions , therefore gross does n't believe an automatic discussion about troop withdrawals in other eu states is likely .
german troop increase will go ahead for germany , where a parliamentary vote on the expansion of berlin 's afghan mission is scheduled for later this week , the dutch decision wo n't have an immediate effect either , argue experts .
public opinion in germany ca n't be swayed much by the dutch political crisis because a solid majority of germans is already against the military engagement in afghanistan , says klaus-peter schoeppner , head of tns emnid , a major german polling and reseach firm .
while germans are very skeptical about the afghan misson , schoeppner thinks that most of them can live with the exit scenario envisaged by the government .
" so , i do n't think that this topic will gain much traction in germany , " he told deutsche welle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany plans to send up to 850 additional troops to afghanistan what 's more , adds schoeppner , germans do n't view the mission in afghanistan as predominantly a military one .
" we regard ourselves as the number one humanitarian nation , " said schoeppner .
a fast withdrawal from afghanistan would not only end germany 's military , but also its humanitarian responsibilities .
currently there is no indication that this is a likely option for the government , he added .
" i am fairly confindent that the increase of troops will go through in parliament , mainly because the political elites have been in favor of a continuation of the mandate , " said gross .
exit strategies while the dutch withdrawal will not have any imminent effect on the committments of other allies , it will further increase the debate in many countries about timetables and exit strategies .
" we have seen this in discussions already in germany , britain or the united states that the focus is now already much more on finding ways of withdrawing their troops from afghanistan , " said gross .
that could make it hard for nato to find a replacement for dutch troops , if the new government in the hague does in fact decide to withdraw its soldiers .
australia already publicly dismissed a possible leadership role in uruzgan province and canada has said it wants to pull out its troops at the end of next year .
germany , which is currently in charge of the regional command in the north of afghanistan , has repeatedly rejected a german engagement in the south and is unlikely to change that position .
" i think it would be difficult for us to do more in afghanistan , because others leave , " said schoeppner .
if no other countries are willing to take over the dutch role in the south , the us might ultimately be forced to fulfill that task itself .
as an alternative , american officials have aired a possible role for non-nato troops in afghanistan .
but whether such an expansion of the afghan mission is realistic and how it could work is still unclear .
explaining the mission at least for now then , the political turmoil over the future of dutch troops in afghanistan will merely increase the pressure on nato planners to sketch out possible scenarios for a dutch withdrawal and not lead to a domino effect in other countries .
however , argue experts , since public sentiment is already very pessimistic about the afghan mission , military events on the ground can always have a major impact on public opinion .
bildunterschrift : politicians must better explain the rationale behind the afghan mission , say experts " in most countries a a rather large attack with loss of life would probably push the public to reject military engagement , " said gross .
since that is always possible , governments can only do one thing : " they have to communicate the reasons why we are in afghanistan much better and much more carefully .
i think the dutch withdrawal and the collapse of the government definitely highlights that the european public is unconvinced of the value of the afghan mission and that european politicians have some explaining to do , " she said .

but it is unlikely to trigger a domino effect among other countries who have troops there . by the sheer number of troops , the dutch deployment does n't rank among top international contingents in afghanistan .
however , its force of 1,800 soldiers has not only been in charge of the uruzgan province in the dangerous southern part of the country , but has generally been seen as doing an excellent job there .

but in the face of criticism and protests , the law wo n't be enforced , says the government . a new law to curb child pornography has come into force in germany , but , in a legal curiosity , it is not going to be used by the courts .
the salient point is that instead of blocking child porn websites , the government now thinks it would better to erase them . the controversial legislation was drafted in 2009 by the former conservative family minister , ursula von der leyen , who said that she was willing to act against " a massive spread of child pornography on the internet . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ursula von der leyen is eager to stop child abuse material on the internet " we are no longer going to tolerate the fact that pictures of children being raped are massively accessed and distributed on the internet in germany , " she said , shortly before introducing the bill to parliament last year . mere symbolism under the new law , the german federal criminal office -lrb- bka -rrb- is supposed to provide a regularly updated list of websites , which they 've found to contain child pornographic pictures and images . german internet providers must then post a red " stop " sign on them , but are not allowed to erase them .
the german law also does n't extend to providers based abroad . christian bahls from the organisation " abuse victims against internet access blocking " accused the government of pursuing " a policy of symbolism , " which he described as " a slap in the face of the victims of child pornography . " " the victims of abuse are being abused again , namely as symbols in a questionable government campaign , " he said . freedom vs crime fighting since last summer , there 's been a groundswell of protests by germans who see the law as a first step on the path towards government censorship of the internet . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protestors demanding internet freedom did n't want to listen to the government 's arguments franziska heine has been spearheading a public pressure campaign called " expedition against internet blocking , " which is aimed at forcing parliament to re-introduce the law . about 134.000 germans have signed on to an official petition to parliament pressed by the group . mrs heine claimed that the law was based on " entirely false information " about the distribution of child pornography . " the law has huge repercussion for the freedom of information , but does little to help the victims , " she said . mrs heine 's opinion is supported by police specialists investigating cases of child pornography . frank federau , a member of a special unit at the regional police office in the federal state of lower saxony , believes child abuse material is not primarily exchanged using the internet .

indeed , education is considered so crucial that when the united nations released its millennium development goals for 2015 , universal primary education was slated as the number two priority , second only to eradicating extreme poverty and hunger .
but a report released by berlin-based anti-corruption organisation transparency international suggests that endemic corruption in african schooling systems is still seeing large numbers of primary-aged african children denied their right to an education .
" basically all issues around resourcing had a dimension of corruption , with resources being exploited or embezzled by someone for private gain , but sometimes also just plain mismanagement , " said stephane stassen , who co-authored the report .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : giving children an education is crucial in post-war sierra leone the transparency international study " good governance lessons for primary education " was produced as part of the organisation 's africa education watch initiative and examined the impact of corruption on education quality and availability in seven african countries , interviewing over 8500 educators and parents in ghana , madagascar , morocco , niger , senegal , sierra leone and uganda .
change coming too slow to the continent the data collected paints a troubling picture of education in africa : despite two decades of reforms designed to allow greater levels of management at the local level and improve accountability , school administration is still not , for the most part , a genuinely corruption-free and participatory governance system .
" despite all these measures , there were still many governance challenges , " said stephane stassen , who heads transparency international 's africa education watch program .
one of the most striking examples is that of so-called registration fees , which parents from every country surveyed reported paying , although by law primary schooling is free .
the number of parents forced to pay these illegal accounting fees ranged from 9 % in ghana , to 90 % in morocco , the report found .
" similarly , in some countries where they had also abolished exam fees , they were still being charged , " said stassen .
he added that in many countries , textbooks were often not available .
and even if they were dispatched to schools , they were often not distributed for free .
the problems were also identified at higher levels , for example when schools receiving grants with which to run themselves were not receiving the full amount , or it was coming with a delay .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most parents can not afford high school fees the average cost of enrolling a primary-aged child in an african school for one year is three euros .
by comparison , the average per capita income in sierra leone is just us $ 260 -lrb- 190 euros -rrb- per year .
the costs charged for " free " textbooks as well as the fees of illegal " compulsory tutoring " - charged by some teachers to supplement their meagre incomes - puts an additional strain on african families .
crucial learning years missed these prohibitively high costs can lead to higher school dropout rates at a crucial time in children 's lives . " primary education is really the place where you get the basics for your life later on .
this is where you learn to read and write , this is where you learn to count , and if , for example if in africa you want to have a chance in trade or to go beyond your village , these are really skills you need to acquire . "
stassen said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : illiteracy among older people is high in many parts of africa he added that without a basic education , it would be nearly impossible to go on to high school or college .
" it 's really hard to get people back to school later on , and this is why we have to get things right now " .
literacy remains low in many parts of africa .
in senegal , for instance , just 43 percent of adults were considered literate in 2007 , compared to 72 percent in madagascar .
despite the obstacles , enrolment figures for primary-aged children in africa are on the increase .
according to 2009 figures from the un , net enrolment in sub-saharan africa went from 58 percent in 2000 to 74 percent in 2007 and from 91 percent to 96 percent over the same period of time in northern africa .
but enrolment figures do not tell the whole story : not only may corrupt practices prevent children from attending school , but they also lower the quality of education for students once they get there .
" even if you are in class , it might mean that you do n't learn much , because you have one textbook for ten learners if not more , " stassen said mismanagement partly to blame in many schools , the report found resources were being wasted or lost , not wilfully , but because those responsible for their management were simply ill-equipped for the job .
overall , 85 percent of schools across all countries had either deficient accounting systems or none at all , and in morocco , just 23 percent of head teachers received training in financial management , despite being responsible for budgets .
in niger that figure drops to just 8 percent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stephane stassen heads transparency international 's africa education watch program " schools where the head teacher had been trained and prepared to do his job in terms of managing the resources of the schools were … the schools where less of these corrupt practices were appearing , " said stassen .
" in a sense , what we found was that head teachers and teachers themselves were really feeling that they had been abandoned by the system . "
a way forward universal schooling for primary-aged children may be untenable by 2015 , but transparency international 's report suggests the reforms that have been made to date are in fact helping african schoolchildren .
the report found that schools that were more frequently audited tended to perform better : education outcomes were better and parents reported paying fewer illegal fees .
training in financial management for head teachers and school management committees could be strengthened , said stassen , to improve accountability .
stassen added that helping african parents to understand more about their rights within the schooling system was a crucial step in increasing engagement and accountability .
" i think that by combining inspections , grassroots accountability and better transparency in the system , you could really have an education system which is more efficient and better-resourced . "

istanbul police were questioning 29 of them at their headquarters , news broadcaster ntv reported .
police also brought 10 of the arrested officers to an istanbul court early on tuesday , according to the state-run anatolian news agency .
the court is to decide whether to hold them in custody .
the series of arrests is one of the biggest against the military , which has ousted four governments since 1960 and considers itself to be the guardian of turkey 's secular tradition .
turkish prime minister tayyip erdogan commented on the arrests during an official visit to madrid .
" after the security forces have finished this process , the judiciary will make its assessment , " erdogan said .
coup plot bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ruling ak party has support from voters and the european union the crackdown relates to the 2003 " sledgehammer " plot to overthrow the government , led by the islam-rooted ak party .
media reports have said the military planned to provoke an attack from neighboring greece and plant bombs inside istanbul mosques and museums to incite chaos and justify a military coup .
military leaders have denied the accusations and claim the plot was only a hypothetical training scenario .
more than 200 people have been arrested since the story broke in 2007 , including military officers , politicians , lawyers and writers .
critics of the government claim prime minister erdogan has used the investigation to silence opposition .
governmental power struggle the ak party , or justice and development party , came to power only a year after its founding when it won a parliamentary majority in 2002 and ended decades of secularist rule .
the party brands itself as pro-market and pro-western , favoring turkey 's bid for membership of the european union .
but the staunchly secular institutions of the military and judiciary have been in a deep power struggle with the government , which has solid electoral support .
erdogan has sought parliamentary support to curb the power of judges and prosecutors , and has said he would call a referendum on a constitutional reform to the judicial system if plans in parliament fail .

soldiers tell of rituals with names like " fire dance " and the " jukebox " . germany 's parliamentary commissioner for the armed forces , reinhold robbe , said he had received 54 written accounts of abuse and degrading treatment since he submitted a report about hazing in the military .
several of the letters he received from soldiers corroborated previous allegations that mountain infantry troops at a camp in bavaria had been forced to drink alcohol and eat raw pork liver until they threw up .
robbe , a member of the social democratic party , demanded that the training curriculum be changed and said that the " dangerous , tasteless rituals must stop . "
fire dances and jukeboxes the new letters also bring to light other forms of hazing .
one former member of the marines said that new sailors were often subjected to harsh rituals during their first nights at sea .
he described the " fire dance , " in which a man was forced to strip off his pants and have a lighted wick placed in his anus ; another in which a floor polishing machine with rough bristles was held against a recruit 's naked bottom until the skin turned red .
a volunteer soldier stationed in southern germany between 1996 and 1998 told of soldiers being forced to play " jukebox , " during which they were shut into a locker , which was then stood upside down , and the occupant forced to sing certain songs .
defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg renewed his promise of a complete investigation .
he did not rule out the possibility of disciplinary action for those involved , although he warned against making an across-the-board judgment .
" every case must be pursued judiciously and emphatically , " guttenberg told fellow christian democrat politicians in berlin on tuesday. svs / dpa / apn editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the draft law , which both the german parliament and chancellor angela merkel 's cabinet are to consider in the coming weeks , would cut state-guaranteed prices by 15 percent for energy produced by solar panels on open ground .
it would also cut prices by 16 percent for solar panels on roofs , where 80 percent of solar panels in germany are , and eliminate subsidies for panels placed on arable land .
a previous plan by environment minister norbert roettgen was criticized for not going far enough .
" there must be no more panels installed on arable land , " said peter altmaier , a member of merkel 's christian democrat union -lrb- cdu -rrb- who follows the solar energy sector .

support and opposition the reduction would save german consumers some of the one billion euros they pay per month in fees that underwrite solar energy production , according to hans-peter friedrich , a leader in the cdu 's bavarian sister party , the christian social union .
the law is supported by farmers resentful of investors who bought up arable land only to " harvest the sunshine . "
but the solar panel manufacturing lobby staunchly opposes the cutbacks , and some companies gave employees the day off to protest the law in berlin .

the draft law , which both the german parliament and chancellor angela merkel 's cabinet are to consider in the coming weeks , would cut state-guaranteed prices by 15 percent for energy produced by solar panels on open ground .
it would also cut prices by 16 percent for solar panels on roofs , where 80 percent of solar panels in germany are , and eliminate subsidies for panels placed on arable land .

yet berlin insists there are concerns that the technology could breach privacy laws . google , which wants to extend its street view panoramic photos to germany later this year , has rejected strong privacy objections raised by the german government .
consumer affairs minister ilse aigner is demanding that the internet giant only displays its imagery after each affected german citizen has given his or her permission .
minister aigner said her staff were consulting with justice ministry officials , with the aim of tightening legislation .
she also demanded that google be ready to make people 's faces , car and house numbers , and even facades unrecognizable .
" a vague picture pixel change is not sufficient , " she said in berlin .
" i do not share the company 's assessment that all personal data concerns have been resolved . "
her ministry , she said , had been flooded with calls by citizens worried about protecting their privacy .

the head of google 's legal department , arnd haller said " we take personal data privacy very seriously .
we 've been discussing privacy issues all over europe , but here in germany the intensity of the questions is really impressive . "
a consultant hired by google , nikolas forgo , who is a hanover professor on informatics law , said a violation of personal rights was improbable .
google has already pledged to disguise car number plates and peoples ' faces .
berlin says google needs individual permission aigner had recently accused google 's service of being on the verge of violating the privacy of millions of citizens , each individually .
she demanded that google seek the permission from each person photographed on streets prior to publication .
street view photos are taken by camera cars which can capture all-round 360-degrees images .
these enable google users to simulate a stroll while sitting at their computers .
google has been gathering images of streets and public spaces in germany since 2008 .
the online service began in 2007 in four cities in the united states .
australia and japan soon followed .
in total google has initiated similar imaging projects in 19 countries , including many in europe .
satellites help pinpoint the panoramic scenes on maps using geo-data systems .
in a special exception for germany , haller said individuals would be able to file an objection with google to seek the removal of recognizable features .
" we 've a web site on-line with the relevant names and places where google street views are taken .
we also allow users to opt out in advance . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : street view is already available in several european countries " an immersive experience " google software developer raphael leiteritz said he believed street view was worth fighting for : " cards and maps have been two-dimensional for many years .
street view for the first time gives you an immersive experience .
you do n't look on a city from the top .
you can visit it and you can look around . "
that does not impress aigner .
she is demanding that google 's panoramic cameras be mounted no higher than 1.8 meters – instead of the current 2.5 meters on camera cars – so that views over fences and walls into residents ' gardens and courtyards are blocked .
other data privacy advocates also point out that potential burglars can use such internet imagery to recognize and target properties .

street view photos are taken by camera cars which can capture all-round 360-degrees images .
these enable google users to simulate a stroll while sitting at their computers .
google has been gathering images of streets and public spaces in germany since 2008 .
the online service began in 2007 in four cities in the united states .
australia and japan soon followed .
in total google has initiated similar imaging projects in 19 countries , including many in europe .
satellites help pinpoint the panoramic scenes on maps using geo-data systems .
in a special exception for germany , haller said individuals would be able to file an objection with google to seek the removal of recognizable features .
" we 've a web site on-line with the relevant names and places where google street views are taken .
we also allow users to opt out in advance . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : street view is already available in several european countries " an immersive experience " google software developer raphael leiteritz said he believed street view was worth fighting for : " cards and maps have been two-dimensional for many years .
street view for the first time gives you an immersive experience .
you do n't look on a city from the top .
you can visit it and you can look around . "
that does not impress aigner .
she is demanding that google 's panoramic cameras be mounted no higher than 1.8 meters – instead of the current 2.5 meters on camera cars – so that views over fences and walls into residents ' gardens and courtyards are blocked .
other data privacy advocates also point out that potential burglars can use such internet imagery to recognize and target properties .
aigner told german public radio that google must act " definitively " on objections lodged by citizens , even to the point of making a building unrecognizable .
her ministry , she added , had placed a standardized complaint form on its website. ipj / apn / dpa / afp editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

they questioned an upcoming concert in minsk , saying letting it go on would be a " costly mistake " for the country . rammstein 's music could " destroy the belarusian state system , " said the country 's council for morality on monday . the council described the band 's songs as propaganda for " violence , masochism , homosexuality and other abnormalities " and said " permitting a rammstein concert would be a costly mistake .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de internet -pipe- 23.02.2010 google rejects berlin 's privacy concerns over street view application großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : google says street view offers a unique new experience internet giant google said tuesday it aimed to launch its street view application in germany by the end of the year .
yet berlin insists there are concerns that the technology could breach privacy laws . google , which wants to extend its street view panoramic photos to germany later this year , has rejected strong privacy objections raised by the german government .
consumer affairs minister ilse aigner is demanding that the internet giant only displays its imagery after each affected german citizen has given his or her permission .
minister aigner said her staff were consulting with justice ministry officials , with the aim of tightening legislation .
she also demanded that google be ready to make people 's faces , car and house numbers , and even facades unrecognizable .
" a vague picture pixel change is not sufficient , " she said in berlin .
" i do not share the company 's assessment that all personal data concerns have been resolved . "
her ministry , she said , had been flooded with calls by citizens worried about protecting their privacy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a stroll in the internet , but is data privacy safeguarded ?
the head of google 's legal department , arnd haller said " we take personal data privacy very seriously .
we 've been discussing privacy issues all over europe , but here in germany the intensity of the questions is really impressive . "
a consultant hired by google , nikolas forgo , who is a hanover professor on informatics law , said a violation of personal rights was improbable .
google has already pledged to disguise car number plates and peoples ' faces .
berlin says google needs individual permission aigner had recently accused google 's service of being on the verge of violating the privacy of millions of citizens , each individually .
she demanded that google seek the permission from each person photographed on streets prior to publication .
street view photos are taken by camera cars which can capture all-round 360-degrees images .
these enable google users to simulate a stroll while sitting at their computers .
google has been gathering images of streets and public spaces in germany since 2008 .
the online service began in 2007 in four cities in the united states .
australia and japan soon followed .
in total google has initiated similar imaging projects in 19 countries , including many in europe .
satellites help pinpoint the panoramic scenes on maps using geo-data systems .
in a special exception for germany , haller said individuals would be able to file an objection with google to seek the removal of recognizable features .
" we 've a web site on-line with the relevant names and places where google street views are taken .
we also allow users to opt out in advance . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : street view is already available in several european countries " an immersive experience " google software developer raphael leiteritz said he believed street view was worth fighting for : " cards and maps have been two-dimensional for many years .
street view for the first time gives you an immersive experience .
you do n't look on a city from the top .
you can visit it and you can look around . "
that does not impress aigner .
she is demanding that google 's panoramic cameras be mounted no higher than 1.8 meters – instead of the current 2.5 meters on camera cars – so that views over fences and walls into residents ' gardens and courtyards are blocked .
other data privacy advocates also point out that potential burglars can use such internet imagery to recognize and target properties .
aigner told german public radio that google must act " definitively " on objections lodged by citizens , even to the point of making a building unrecognizable .
her ministry , she added , had placed a standardized complaint form on its website. ipj / apn / dpa / afp editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de internet -pipe- 23.02.2010 google rejects berlin 's privacy concerns over street view application großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : google says street view offers a unique new experience internet giant google said tuesday it aimed to launch its street view application in germany by the end of the year .
yet berlin insists there are concerns that the technology could breach privacy laws . google , which wants to extend its street view panoramic photos to germany later this year , has rejected strong privacy objections raised by the german government .
consumer affairs minister ilse aigner is demanding that the internet giant only displays its imagery after each affected german citizen has given his or her permission .
minister aigner said her staff were consulting with justice ministry officials , with the aim of tightening legislation .
she also demanded that google be ready to make people 's faces , car and house numbers , and even facades unrecognizable .
" a vague picture pixel change is not sufficient , " she said in berlin .
" i do not share the company 's assessment that all personal data concerns have been resolved . "
her ministry , she said , had been flooded with calls by citizens worried about protecting their privacy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a stroll in the internet , but is data privacy safeguarded ?
the head of google 's legal department , arnd haller said " we take personal data privacy very seriously .
we 've been discussing privacy issues all over europe , but here in germany the intensity of the questions is really impressive . "
a consultant hired by google , nikolas forgo , who is a hanover professor on informatics law , said a violation of personal rights was improbable .
google has already pledged to disguise car number plates and peoples ' faces .
berlin says google needs individual permission aigner had recently accused google 's service of being on the verge of violating the privacy of millions of citizens , each individually .
she demanded that google seek the permission from each person photographed on streets prior to publication .
street view photos are taken by camera cars which can capture all-round 360-degrees images .
these enable google users to simulate a stroll while sitting at their computers .
google has been gathering images of streets and public spaces in germany since 2008 .
the online service began in 2007 in four cities in the united states .
australia and japan soon followed .
in total google has initiated similar imaging projects in 19 countries , including many in europe .
satellites help pinpoint the panoramic scenes on maps using geo-data systems .
in a special exception for germany , haller said individuals would be able to file an objection with google to seek the removal of recognizable features .
" we 've a web site on-line with the relevant names and places where google street views are taken .
we also allow users to opt out in advance . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : street view is already available in several european countries " an immersive experience " google software developer raphael leiteritz said he believed street view was worth fighting for : " cards and maps have been two-dimensional for many years .
street view for the first time gives you an immersive experience .
you do n't look on a city from the top .
you can visit it and you can look around . "
that does not impress aigner .
she is demanding that google 's panoramic cameras be mounted no higher than 1.8 meters – instead of the current 2.5 meters on camera cars – so that views over fences and walls into residents ' gardens and courtyards are blocked .
other data privacy advocates also point out that potential burglars can use such internet imagery to recognize and target properties .
aigner told german public radio that google must act " definitively " on objections lodged by citizens , even to the point of making a building unrecognizable .
her ministry , she added , had placed a standardized complaint form on its website. ipj / apn / dpa / afp editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the two clubs now await a second duel in spain in march . stuttgart made the most of the capacity home crowd at mercedes-benz arena , starting the match energetically and taking it to barcelona .
the early initiative paid dividends when brazilian forward cacau headed in a perfect timo gebhart center ball from the right on the 25-minute mark .
the germans continued to press barcelona 's defense and came close to snatching goals on three more occasions , in addition to an appeal for handball by barca defender gerard pique .
at the outset of the second half , barcelona came out a different team and pulled level within seven minutes through frontman zlatan ibrahimovic .
the opportunity came when stuttgart failed to clear a corner and the ball came back in for pique , who headed down for ibrahimovic to volley home .
the initial shot was parried by stuttgart keeper jens lehmann , but ibrahimovic was able to knock the rebound over the goal line .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cacau 's goal came midway through the first half the catalans dominated the remainder of the clash , a fact stuttgart coach christian gross seized upon .
" we should have scored a second goal in the first half , " gross said following the match .
" we had clear chances . "
barcelona midfielder andreas iniesta was upbeat about the result , saying he was confident the ball was now in barcelona 's court .
" we knew that it was going to be a difficult game , " said the spain international .
" and the truth is that they really made us suffer in the first half .
" now we have the tie in our favor , but there are still 90 minutes left to play . "

the two clubs now await a second duel in spain in march . stuttgart made the most of the capacity home crowd at mercedes-benz arena , starting the match energetically and taking it to barcelona .
the early initiative paid dividends when brazilian forward cacau headed in a perfect timo gebhart center ball from the right on the 25-minute mark .
the germans continued to press barcelona 's defense and came close to snatching goals on three more occasions , in addition to an appeal for handball by barca defender gerard pique .
at the outset of the second half , barcelona came out a different team and pulled level within seven minutes through frontman zlatan ibrahimovic .
the opportunity came when stuttgart failed to clear a corner and the ball came back in for pique , who headed down for ibrahimovic to volley home .
the initial shot was parried by stuttgart keeper jens lehmann , but ibrahimovic was able to knock the rebound over the goal line .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cacau 's goal came midway through the first half the catalans dominated the remainder of the clash , a fact stuttgart coach christian gross seized upon .
" we should have scored a second goal in the first half , " gross said following the match .
" we had clear chances . "
barcelona midfielder andreas iniesta was upbeat about the result , saying he was confident the ball was now in barcelona 's court .
" we knew that it was going to be a difficult game , " said the spain international .
" and the truth is that they really made us suffer in the first half .
" now we have the tie in our favor , but there are still 90 minutes left to play . "
in tuesday night 's other champions league clash , french club bordeaux defeated greek giants olympiacos 0-1 away from home .

but in the face of criticism and protests , the law wo n't be enforced , says the government . a new law to curb child pornography has come into force in germany , but , in a legal curiosity , it is not going to be used by the courts .
the salient point is that instead of blocking child porn websites , the government now thinks it would better to erase them . the controversial legislation was drafted in 2009 by the former conservative family minister , ursula von der leyen , who said that she was willing to act against " a massive spread of child pornography on the internet . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ursula von der leyen is eager to stop child abuse material on the internet " we are no longer going to tolerate the fact that pictures of children being raped are massively accessed and distributed on the internet in germany , " she said , shortly before introducing the bill to parliament last year . mere symbolism under the new law , the german federal criminal office -lrb- bka -rrb- is supposed to provide a regularly updated list of websites , which they 've found to contain child pornographic pictures and images . german internet providers must then post a red " stop " sign on them , but are not allowed to erase them .
the german law also does n't extend to providers based abroad . christian bahls from the organisation " abuse victims against internet access blocking " accused the government of pursuing " a policy of symbolism , " which he described as " a slap in the face of the victims of child pornography . " " the victims of abuse are being abused again , namely as symbols in a questionable government campaign , " he said . freedom vs crime fighting since last summer , there 's been a groundswell of protests by germans who see the law as a first step on the path towards government censorship of the internet . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protestors demanding internet freedom did n't want to listen to the government 's arguments franziska heine has been spearheading a public pressure campaign called " expedition against internet blocking , " which is aimed at forcing parliament to re-introduce the law . about 134.000 germans have signed on to an official petition to parliament pressed by the group . mrs heine claimed that the law was based on " entirely false information " about the distribution of child pornography . " the law has huge repercussion for the freedom of information , but does little to help the victims , " she said . mrs heine 's opinion is supported by police specialists investigating cases of child pornography . frank federau , a member of a special unit at the regional police office in the federal state of lower saxony , believes child abuse material is not primarily exchanged using the internet . " the internet is a channel of communication for paedophiles , but the material as such is distributed on cds and dvds via ordinary mail . " legal doubts wolfgang hoffmann-riem , an expert on constitutional law , even believed that the new law was not in line with the german constitution . " the fact that the federal criminal office has been made responsible for providing the list of websites to be banned , is a clear breach of power-sharing laws in germany . " hoffman-riem pointed out that police in the 16 german federal states were in charge of crime fighting and investigating criminal content on the internet , and that the law infringed upon their duties . in the face of so much criticism , the government has decided to amend the law in the course of the next few months . the new legislation , the government said , would then allow providers to erase child pornography websites . author : uwe hessler editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

soldiers tell of rituals with names like " fire dance " and the " jukebox " . germany 's parliamentary commissioner for the armed forces , reinhold robbe , said he had received 54 written accounts of abuse and degrading treatment since he submitted a report about hazing in the military .
several of the letters he received from soldiers corroborated previous allegations that mountain infantry troops at a camp in bavaria had been forced to drink alcohol and eat raw pork liver until they threw up .
robbe , a member of the social democratic party , demanded that the training curriculum be changed and said that the " dangerous , tasteless rituals must stop . "
fire dances and jukeboxes the new letters also bring to light other forms of hazing .
one former member of the marines said that new sailors were often subjected to harsh rituals during their first nights at sea .
he described the " fire dance , " in which a man was forced to strip off his pants and have a lighted wick placed in his anus ; another in which a floor polishing machine with rough bristles was held against a recruit 's naked bottom until the skin turned red .
a volunteer soldier stationed in southern germany between 1996 and 1998 told of soldiers being forced to play " jukebox , " during which they were shut into a locker , which was then stood upside down , and the occupant forced to sing certain songs .
defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg renewed his promise of a complete investigation .
he did not rule out the possibility of disciplinary action for those involved , although he warned against making an across-the-board judgment .
" every case must be pursued judiciously and emphatically , " guttenberg told fellow christian democrat politicians in berlin on tuesday. svs / dpa / apn editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de afghanistan -pipe- 23.02.2010 dutch pullout will give nato headaches , but wo n't lead to domino effect großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it could be hard for nato to find a replacement for dutch troops a withdrawal of dutch troops from afghanistan would certainly increase the pressure on its allies to take their place .
but it is unlikely to trigger a domino effect among other countries who have troops there . by the sheer number of troops , the dutch deployment does n't rank among top international contingents in afghanistan .
however , its force of 1,800 soldiers has not only been in charge of the uruzgan province in the dangerous southern part of the country , but has generally been seen as doing an excellent job there .
so the planned dutch pullout from afghanistan as a consequence of the governmen crisis in the hague will clearly have repercussions for nato 's military mission in the country at a time when most allies are already under pressure to justify their engagement at home .
this has already led to worries about a possible domino effect in the sense that other countries might also feel forced to reconsider their committments to afghanistan .
" it 's true that the afghanistan mission is very unpopular in many european countries , so it is definitely a cause for concern if the dutch withdraw on account of the collapsed government , " eva gross , who heads the eu foreign and security policy program at the institute for european studies at vrije universiteit brussel in belgium , told deutsche welle .
" but to speak of a domino effect may be overstating the case . "
each country in europe has its own dynamics and traditions , therefore gross does n't believe an automatic discussion about troop withdrawals in other eu states is likely .
german troop increase will go ahead for germany , where a parliamentary vote on the expansion of berlin 's afghan mission is scheduled for later this week , the dutch decision wo n't have an immediate effect either , argue experts .
public opinion in germany ca n't be swayed much by the dutch political crisis because a solid majority of germans is already against the military engagement in afghanistan , says klaus-peter schoeppner , head of tns emnid , a major german polling and reseach firm .
while germans are very skeptical about the afghan misson , schoeppner thinks that most of them can live with the exit scenario envisaged by the government .
" so , i do n't think that this topic will gain much traction in germany , " he told deutsche welle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany plans to send up to 850 additional troops to afghanistan what 's more , adds schoeppner , germans do n't view the mission in afghanistan as predominantly a military one .
" we regard ourselves as the number one humanitarian nation , " said schoeppner .
a fast withdrawal from afghanistan would not only end germany 's military , but also its humanitarian responsibilities .
currently there is no indication that this is a likely option for the government , he added .
" i am fairly confindent that the increase of troops will go through in parliament , mainly because the political elites have been in favor of a continuation of the mandate , " said gross .
exit strategies while the dutch withdrawal will not have any imminent effect on the committments of other allies , it will further increase the debate in many countries about timetables and exit strategies .
" we have seen this in discussions already in germany , britain or the united states that the focus is now already much more on finding ways of withdrawing their troops from afghanistan , " said gross .
that could make it hard for nato to find a replacement for dutch troops , if the new government in the hague does in fact decide to withdraw its soldiers .
australia already publicly dismissed a possible leadership role in uruzgan province and canada has said it wants to pull out its troops at the end of next year .
germany , which is currently in charge of the regional command in the north of afghanistan , has repeatedly rejected a german engagement in the south and is unlikely to change that position .
" i think it would be difficult for us to do more in afghanistan , because others leave , " said schoeppner .
if no other countries are willing to take over the dutch role in the south , the us might ultimately be forced to fulfill that task itself .
as an alternative , american officials have aired a possible role for non-nato troops in afghanistan .
but whether such an expansion of the afghan mission is realistic and how it could work is still unclear .
explaining the mission at least for now then , the political turmoil over the future of dutch troops in afghanistan will merely increase the pressure on nato planners to sketch out possible scenarios for a dutch withdrawal and not lead to a domino effect in other countries .
however , argue experts , since public sentiment is already very pessimistic about the afghan mission , military events on the ground can always have a major impact on public opinion .
bildunterschrift : politicians must better explain the rationale behind the afghan mission , say experts " in most countries a a rather large attack with loss of life would probably push the public to reject military engagement , " said gross .
since that is always possible , governments can only do one thing : " they have to communicate the reasons why we are in afghanistan much better and much more carefully .
i think the dutch withdrawal and the collapse of the government definitely highlights that the european public is unconvinced of the value of the afghan mission and that european politicians have some explaining to do , " she said .

but it is unlikely to trigger a domino effect among other countries who have troops there . by the sheer number of troops , the dutch deployment does n't rank among top international contingents in afghanistan .
however , its force of 1,800 soldiers has not only been in charge of the uruzgan province in the dangerous southern part of the country , but has generally been seen as doing an excellent job there .
so the planned dutch pullout from afghanistan as a consequence of the governmen crisis in the hague will clearly have repercussions for nato 's military mission in the country at a time when most allies are already under pressure to justify their engagement at home .
this has already led to worries about a possible domino effect in the sense that other countries might also feel forced to reconsider their committments to afghanistan .
" it 's true that the afghanistan mission is very unpopular in many european countries , so it is definitely a cause for concern if the dutch withdraw on account of the collapsed government , " eva gross , who heads the eu foreign and security policy program at the institute for european studies at vrije universiteit brussel in belgium , told deutsche welle .
" but to speak of a domino effect may be overstating the case . "
each country in europe has its own dynamics and traditions , therefore gross does n't believe an automatic discussion about troop withdrawals in other eu states is likely .
german troop increase will go ahead for germany , where a parliamentary vote on the expansion of berlin 's afghan mission is scheduled for later this week , the dutch decision wo n't have an immediate effect either , argue experts .
public opinion in germany ca n't be swayed much by the dutch political crisis because a solid majority of germans is already against the military engagement in afghanistan , says klaus-peter schoeppner , head of tns emnid , a major german polling and reseach firm .
while germans are very skeptical about the afghan misson , schoeppner thinks that most of them can live with the exit scenario envisaged by the government .
" so , i do n't think that this topic will gain much traction in germany , " he told deutsche welle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany plans to send up to 850 additional troops to afghanistan what 's more , adds schoeppner , germans do n't view the mission in afghanistan as predominantly a military one .
" we regard ourselves as the number one humanitarian nation , " said schoeppner .
a fast withdrawal from afghanistan would not only end germany 's military , but also its humanitarian responsibilities .
currently there is no indication that this is a likely option for the government , he added .
" i am fairly confindent that the increase of troops will go through in parliament , mainly because the political elites have been in favor of a continuation of the mandate , " said gross .
exit strategies while the dutch withdrawal will not have any imminent effect on the committments of other allies , it will further increase the debate in many countries about timetables and exit strategies .
" we have seen this in discussions already in germany , britain or the united states that the focus is now already much more on finding ways of withdrawing their troops from afghanistan , " said gross .
that could make it hard for nato to find a replacement for dutch troops , if the new government in the hague does in fact decide to withdraw its soldiers .
australia already publicly dismissed a possible leadership role in uruzgan province and canada has said it wants to pull out its troops at the end of next year .
germany , which is currently in charge of the regional command in the north of afghanistan , has repeatedly rejected a german engagement in the south and is unlikely to change that position .
" i think it would be difficult for us to do more in afghanistan , because others leave , " said schoeppner .
if no other countries are willing to take over the dutch role in the south , the us might ultimately be forced to fulfill that task itself .
as an alternative , american officials have aired a possible role for non-nato troops in afghanistan .
but whether such an expansion of the afghan mission is realistic and how it could work is still unclear .
explaining the mission at least for now then , the political turmoil over the future of dutch troops in afghanistan will merely increase the pressure on nato planners to sketch out possible scenarios for a dutch withdrawal and not lead to a domino effect in other countries .
however , argue experts , since public sentiment is already very pessimistic about the afghan mission , military events on the ground can always have a major impact on public opinion .
bildunterschrift : politicians must better explain the rationale behind the afghan mission , say experts " in most countries a a rather large attack with loss of life would probably push the public to reject military engagement , " said gross .
since that is always possible , governments can only do one thing : " they have to communicate the reasons why we are in afghanistan much better and much more carefully .
i think the dutch withdrawal and the collapse of the government definitely highlights that the european public is unconvinced of the value of the afghan mission and that european politicians have some explaining to do , " she said .

but it is unlikely to trigger a domino effect among other countries who have troops there . by the sheer number of troops , the dutch deployment does n't rank among top international contingents in afghanistan .
however , its force of 1,800 soldiers has not only been in charge of the uruzgan province in the dangerous southern part of the country , but has generally been seen as doing an excellent job there .
so the planned dutch pullout from afghanistan as a consequence of the governmen crisis in the hague will clearly have repercussions for nato 's military mission in the country at a time when most allies are already under pressure to justify their engagement at home .
this has already led to worries about a possible domino effect in the sense that other countries might also feel forced to reconsider their committments to afghanistan .
" it 's true that the afghanistan mission is very unpopular in many european countries , so it is definitely a cause for concern if the dutch withdraw on account of the collapsed government , " eva gross , who heads the eu foreign and security policy program at the institute for european studies at vrije universiteit brussel in belgium , told deutsche welle .
" but to speak of a domino effect may be overstating the case . "
each country in europe has its own dynamics and traditions , therefore gross does n't believe an automatic discussion about troop withdrawals in other eu states is likely .
german troop increase will go ahead for germany , where a parliamentary vote on the expansion of berlin 's afghan mission is scheduled for later this week , the dutch decision wo n't have an immediate effect either , argue experts .
public opinion in germany ca n't be swayed much by the dutch political crisis because a solid majority of germans is already against the military engagement in afghanistan , says klaus-peter schoeppner , head of tns emnid , a major german polling and reseach firm .
while germans are very skeptical about the afghan misson , schoeppner thinks that most of them can live with the exit scenario envisaged by the government .
" so , i do n't think that this topic will gain much traction in germany , " he told deutsche welle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany plans to send up to 850 additional troops to afghanistan what 's more , adds schoeppner , germans do n't view the mission in afghanistan as predominantly a military one .
" we regard ourselves as the number one humanitarian nation , " said schoeppner .
a fast withdrawal from afghanistan would not only end germany 's military , but also its humanitarian responsibilities .
currently there is no indication that this is a likely option for the government , he added .
" i am fairly confindent that the increase of troops will go through in parliament , mainly because the political elites have been in favor of a continuation of the mandate , " said gross .
exit strategies while the dutch withdrawal will not have any imminent effect on the committments of other allies , it will further increase the debate in many countries about timetables and exit strategies .
" we have seen this in discussions already in germany , britain or the united states that the focus is now already much more on finding ways of withdrawing their troops from afghanistan , " said gross .
that could make it hard for nato to find a replacement for dutch troops , if the new government in the hague does in fact decide to withdraw its soldiers .
australia already publicly dismissed a possible leadership role in uruzgan province and canada has said it wants to pull out its troops at the end of next year .
germany , which is currently in charge of the regional command in the north of afghanistan , has repeatedly rejected a german engagement in the south and is unlikely to change that position .
" i think it would be difficult for us to do more in afghanistan , because others leave , " said schoeppner .
if no other countries are willing to take over the dutch role in the south , the us might ultimately be forced to fulfill that task itself .
as an alternative , american officials have aired a possible role for non-nato troops in afghanistan .
but whether such an expansion of the afghan mission is realistic and how it could work is still unclear .

" we have seen this in discussions already in germany , britain or the united states that the focus is now already much more on finding ways of withdrawing their troops from afghanistan , " said gross .
that could make it hard for nato to find a replacement for dutch troops , if the new government in the hague does in fact decide to withdraw its soldiers .
australia already publicly dismissed a possible leadership role in uruzgan province and canada has said it wants to pull out its troops at the end of next year .
germany , which is currently in charge of the regional command in the north of afghanistan , has repeatedly rejected a german engagement in the south and is unlikely to change that position .
" i think it would be difficult for us to do more in afghanistan , because others leave , " said schoeppner .
if no other countries are willing to take over the dutch role in the south , the us might ultimately be forced to fulfill that task itself .
as an alternative , american officials have aired a possible role for non-nato troops in afghanistan .
but whether such an expansion of the afghan mission is realistic and how it could work is still unclear .
explaining the mission at least for now then , the political turmoil over the future of dutch troops in afghanistan will merely increase the pressure on nato planners to sketch out possible scenarios for a dutch withdrawal and not lead to a domino effect in other countries .
however , argue experts , since public sentiment is already very pessimistic about the afghan mission , military events on the ground can always have a major impact on public opinion .
bildunterschrift : politicians must better explain the rationale behind the afghan mission , say experts " in most countries a a rather large attack with loss of life would probably push the public to reject military engagement , " said gross .
since that is always possible , governments can only do one thing : " they have to communicate the reasons why we are in afghanistan much better and much more carefully .
i think the dutch withdrawal and the collapse of the government definitely highlights that the european public is unconvinced of the value of the afghan mission and that european politicians have some explaining to do , " she said .

soldiers tell of rituals with names like " fire dance " and the " jukebox " . germany 's parliamentary commissioner for the armed forces , reinhold robbe , said he had received 54 written accounts of abuse and degrading treatment since he submitted a report about hazing in the military .
several of the letters he received from soldiers corroborated previous allegations that mountain infantry troops at a camp in bavaria had been forced to drink alcohol and eat raw pork liver until they threw up .
robbe , a member of the social democratic party , demanded that the training curriculum be changed and said that the " dangerous , tasteless rituals must stop . "
fire dances and jukeboxes the new letters also bring to light other forms of hazing .
one former member of the marines said that new sailors were often subjected to harsh rituals during their first nights at sea .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de energy -pipe- 23.02.2010 germany to cut subsidies for solar energy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is the world leader in solar panel production a law proposed by chancellor angela merkel 's government would greatly reduce subsidies for solar energy production , and in some cases eliminate them all together . the center-right german government is proposing legislation to severely reduce state subsidies to solar power in an attempt to prevent market saturation and save money .
the draft law , which both the german parliament and chancellor angela merkel 's cabinet are to consider in the coming weeks , would cut state-guaranteed prices by 15 percent for energy produced by solar panels on open ground .
it would also cut prices by 16 percent for solar panels on roofs , where 80 percent of solar panels in germany are , and eliminate subsidies for panels placed on arable land .
a previous plan by environment minister norbert roettgen was criticized for not going far enough .
" there must be no more panels installed on arable land , " said peter altmaier , a member of merkel 's christian democrat union -lrb- cdu -rrb- who follows the solar energy sector .
" the objective is to reduce excessive stimulation without hindering an expansion of green energy . "

support and opposition the reduction would save german consumers some of the one billion euros they pay per month in fees that underwrite solar energy production , according to hans-peter friedrich , a leader in the cdu 's bavarian sister party , the christian social union .

the draft law , which both the german parliament and chancellor angela merkel 's cabinet are to consider in the coming weeks , would cut state-guaranteed prices by 15 percent for energy produced by solar panels on open ground .
it would also cut prices by 16 percent for solar panels on roofs , where 80 percent of solar panels in germany are , and eliminate subsidies for panels placed on arable land .
a previous plan by environment minister norbert roettgen was criticized for not going far enough .
" there must be no more panels installed on arable land , " said peter altmaier , a member of merkel 's christian democrat union -lrb- cdu -rrb- who follows the solar energy sector .
" the objective is to reduce excessive stimulation without hindering an expansion of green energy . "

the draft law , which both the german parliament and chancellor angela merkel 's cabinet are to consider in the coming weeks , would cut state-guaranteed prices by 15 percent for energy produced by solar panels on open ground .
it would also cut prices by 16 percent for solar panels on roofs , where 80 percent of solar panels in germany are , and eliminate subsidies for panels placed on arable land .
a previous plan by environment minister norbert roettgen was criticized for not going far enough .
" there must be no more panels installed on arable land , " said peter altmaier , a member of merkel 's christian democrat union -lrb- cdu -rrb- who follows the solar energy sector .
" the objective is to reduce excessive stimulation without hindering an expansion of green energy . "
unintended consequences experts have criticized solar energy subsidies in germany for failing to spur competition in the industry , which accounts for less than one percent of all german electricity production .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : environmental groups have called the law a betrayal of renewable energy the subsidies have also had several unintended consequences : farmers have installed solar panels on their arable fields ; also , the global market has greatly increased , helping manufacturers in china , where labor is cheaper .
germany remains the world leader in solar panel production , but manufacturers have lost billions of euros in recent years and have been forced to cut and outsource jobs .
german group q-cells grew significantly until posting a 1.36-billion euro -lrb- $ 1.84 billion -rrb- net loss in 2009 .
support and opposition the reduction would save german consumers some of the one billion euros they pay per month in fees that underwrite solar energy production , according to hans-peter friedrich , a leader in the cdu 's bavarian sister party , the christian social union .
the law is supported by farmers resentful of investors who bought up arable land only to " harvest the sunshine . "
but the solar panel manufacturing lobby staunchly opposes the cutbacks , and some companies gave employees the day off to protest the law in berlin .
environmental groups also criticized the government , calling the law a betrayal of renewable energy. acb / apn / dpa / afp / reuters editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

indeed , education is considered so crucial that when the united nations released its millennium development goals for 2015 , universal primary education was slated as the number two priority , second only to eradicating extreme poverty and hunger .
but a report released by berlin-based anti-corruption organisation transparency international suggests that endemic corruption in african schooling systems is still seeing large numbers of primary-aged african children denied their right to an education .
" basically all issues around resourcing had a dimension of corruption , with resources being exploited or embezzled by someone for private gain , but sometimes also just plain mismanagement , " said stephane stassen , who co-authored the report .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : giving children an education is crucial in post-war sierra leone the transparency international study " good governance lessons for primary education " was produced as part of the organisation 's africa education watch initiative and examined the impact of corruption on education quality and availability in seven african countries , interviewing over 8500 educators and parents in ghana , madagascar , morocco , niger , senegal , sierra leone and uganda .
change coming too slow to the continent the data collected paints a troubling picture of education in africa : despite two decades of reforms designed to allow greater levels of management at the local level and improve accountability , school administration is still not , for the most part , a genuinely corruption-free and participatory governance system .
" despite all these measures , there were still many governance challenges , " said stephane stassen , who heads transparency international 's africa education watch program .
one of the most striking examples is that of so-called registration fees , which parents from every country surveyed reported paying , although by law primary schooling is free .
the number of parents forced to pay these illegal accounting fees ranged from 9 % in ghana , to 90 % in morocco , the report found .
" similarly , in some countries where they had also abolished exam fees , they were still being charged , " said stassen .
he added that in many countries , textbooks were often not available .
and even if they were dispatched to schools , they were often not distributed for free .
the problems were also identified at higher levels , for example when schools receiving grants with which to run themselves were not receiving the full amount , or it was coming with a delay .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most parents can not afford high school fees the average cost of enrolling a primary-aged child in an african school for one year is three euros .
by comparison , the average per capita income in sierra leone is just us $ 260 -lrb- 190 euros -rrb- per year .
the costs charged for " free " textbooks as well as the fees of illegal " compulsory tutoring " - charged by some teachers to supplement their meagre incomes - puts an additional strain on african families .
crucial learning years missed these prohibitively high costs can lead to higher school dropout rates at a crucial time in children 's lives . " primary education is really the place where you get the basics for your life later on .
this is where you learn to read and write , this is where you learn to count , and if , for example if in africa you want to have a chance in trade or to go beyond your village , these are really skills you need to acquire . "
stassen said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : illiteracy among older people is high in many parts of africa he added that without a basic education , it would be nearly impossible to go on to high school or college .
" it 's really hard to get people back to school later on , and this is why we have to get things right now " .
literacy remains low in many parts of africa .
in senegal , for instance , just 43 percent of adults were considered literate in 2007 , compared to 72 percent in madagascar .
despite the obstacles , enrolment figures for primary-aged children in africa are on the increase .
according to 2009 figures from the un , net enrolment in sub-saharan africa went from 58 percent in 2000 to 74 percent in 2007 and from 91 percent to 96 percent over the same period of time in northern africa .
but enrolment figures do not tell the whole story : not only may corrupt practices prevent children from attending school , but they also lower the quality of education for students once they get there .
" even if you are in class , it might mean that you do n't learn much , because you have one textbook for ten learners if not more , " stassen said mismanagement partly to blame in many schools , the report found resources were being wasted or lost , not wilfully , but because those responsible for their management were simply ill-equipped for the job .
overall , 85 percent of schools across all countries had either deficient accounting systems or none at all , and in morocco , just 23 percent of head teachers received training in financial management , despite being responsible for budgets .
in niger that figure drops to just 8 percent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stephane stassen heads transparency international 's africa education watch program " schools where the head teacher had been trained and prepared to do his job in terms of managing the resources of the schools were … the schools where less of these corrupt practices were appearing , " said stassen .
" in a sense , what we found was that head teachers and teachers themselves were really feeling that they had been abandoned by the system . "
a way forward universal schooling for primary-aged children may be untenable by 2015 , but transparency international 's report suggests the reforms that have been made to date are in fact helping african schoolchildren .
the report found that schools that were more frequently audited tended to perform better : education outcomes were better and parents reported paying fewer illegal fees .
training in financial management for head teachers and school management committees could be strengthened , said stassen , to improve accountability .
stassen added that helping african parents to understand more about their rights within the schooling system was a crucial step in increasing engagement and accountability .
" i think that by combining inspections , grassroots accountability and better transparency in the system , you could really have an education system which is more efficient and better-resourced . "

change coming too slow to the continent the data collected paints a troubling picture of education in africa : despite two decades of reforms designed to allow greater levels of management at the local level and improve accountability , school administration is still not , for the most part , a genuinely corruption-free and participatory governance system .
" despite all these measures , there were still many governance challenges , " said stephane stassen , who heads transparency international 's africa education watch program .
one of the most striking examples is that of so-called registration fees , which parents from every country surveyed reported paying , although by law primary schooling is free .
the number of parents forced to pay these illegal accounting fees ranged from 9 % in ghana , to 90 % in morocco , the report found .
" similarly , in some countries where they had also abolished exam fees , they were still being charged , " said stassen .
he added that in many countries , textbooks were often not available .
and even if they were dispatched to schools , they were often not distributed for free .
the problems were also identified at higher levels , for example when schools receiving grants with which to run themselves were not receiving the full amount , or it was coming with a delay .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most parents can not afford high school fees the average cost of enrolling a primary-aged child in an african school for one year is three euros .
by comparison , the average per capita income in sierra leone is just us $ 260 -lrb- 190 euros -rrb- per year .
the costs charged for " free " textbooks as well as the fees of illegal " compulsory tutoring " - charged by some teachers to supplement their meagre incomes - puts an additional strain on african families .
crucial learning years missed these prohibitively high costs can lead to higher school dropout rates at a crucial time in children 's lives . " primary education is really the place where you get the basics for your life later on .
this is where you learn to read and write , this is where you learn to count , and if , for example if in africa you want to have a chance in trade or to go beyond your village , these are really skills you need to acquire . "
stassen said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : illiteracy among older people is high in many parts of africa he added that without a basic education , it would be nearly impossible to go on to high school or college .
" it 's really hard to get people back to school later on , and this is why we have to get things right now " .
literacy remains low in many parts of africa .
in senegal , for instance , just 43 percent of adults were considered literate in 2007 , compared to 72 percent in madagascar .
despite the obstacles , enrolment figures for primary-aged children in africa are on the increase .
according to 2009 figures from the un , net enrolment in sub-saharan africa went from 58 percent in 2000 to 74 percent in 2007 and from 91 percent to 96 percent over the same period of time in northern africa .
but enrolment figures do not tell the whole story : not only may corrupt practices prevent children from attending school , but they also lower the quality of education for students once they get there .
" even if you are in class , it might mean that you do n't learn much , because you have one textbook for ten learners if not more , " stassen said mismanagement partly to blame in many schools , the report found resources were being wasted or lost , not wilfully , but because those responsible for their management were simply ill-equipped for the job .
overall , 85 percent of schools across all countries had either deficient accounting systems or none at all , and in morocco , just 23 percent of head teachers received training in financial management , despite being responsible for budgets .
in niger that figure drops to just 8 percent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stephane stassen heads transparency international 's africa education watch program " schools where the head teacher had been trained and prepared to do his job in terms of managing the resources of the schools were … the schools where less of these corrupt practices were appearing , " said stassen .
" in a sense , what we found was that head teachers and teachers themselves were really feeling that they had been abandoned by the system . "
a way forward universal schooling for primary-aged children may be untenable by 2015 , but transparency international 's report suggests the reforms that have been made to date are in fact helping african schoolchildren .
the report found that schools that were more frequently audited tended to perform better : education outcomes were better and parents reported paying fewer illegal fees .
training in financial management for head teachers and school management committees could be strengthened , said stassen , to improve accountability .
stassen added that helping african parents to understand more about their rights within the schooling system was a crucial step in increasing engagement and accountability .
" i think that by combining inspections , grassroots accountability and better transparency in the system , you could really have an education system which is more efficient and better-resourced . "

indeed , education is considered so crucial that when the united nations released its millennium development goals for 2015 , universal primary education was slated as the number two priority , second only to eradicating extreme poverty and hunger .
but a report released by berlin-based anti-corruption organisation transparency international suggests that endemic corruption in african schooling systems is still seeing large numbers of primary-aged african children denied their right to an education .
" basically all issues around resourcing had a dimension of corruption , with resources being exploited or embezzled by someone for private gain , but sometimes also just plain mismanagement , " said stephane stassen , who co-authored the report .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : giving children an education is crucial in post-war sierra leone the transparency international study " good governance lessons for primary education " was produced as part of the organisation 's africa education watch initiative and examined the impact of corruption on education quality and availability in seven african countries , interviewing over 8500 educators and parents in ghana , madagascar , morocco , niger , senegal , sierra leone and uganda .
change coming too slow to the continent the data collected paints a troubling picture of education in africa : despite two decades of reforms designed to allow greater levels of management at the local level and improve accountability , school administration is still not , for the most part , a genuinely corruption-free and participatory governance system .
" despite all these measures , there were still many governance challenges , " said stephane stassen , who heads transparency international 's africa education watch program .
one of the most striking examples is that of so-called registration fees , which parents from every country surveyed reported paying , although by law primary schooling is free .
the number of parents forced to pay these illegal accounting fees ranged from 9 % in ghana , to 90 % in morocco , the report found .
" similarly , in some countries where they had also abolished exam fees , they were still being charged , " said stassen .
he added that in many countries , textbooks were often not available .
and even if they were dispatched to schools , they were often not distributed for free .
the problems were also identified at higher levels , for example when schools receiving grants with which to run themselves were not receiving the full amount , or it was coming with a delay .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most parents can not afford high school fees the average cost of enrolling a primary-aged child in an african school for one year is three euros .
by comparison , the average per capita income in sierra leone is just us $ 260 -lrb- 190 euros -rrb- per year .
the costs charged for " free " textbooks as well as the fees of illegal " compulsory tutoring " - charged by some teachers to supplement their meagre incomes - puts an additional strain on african families .
crucial learning years missed these prohibitively high costs can lead to higher school dropout rates at a crucial time in children 's lives . " primary education is really the place where you get the basics for your life later on .

stassen said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : illiteracy among older people is high in many parts of africa he added that without a basic education , it would be nearly impossible to go on to high school or college .
" it 's really hard to get people back to school later on , and this is why we have to get things right now " .
literacy remains low in many parts of africa .
in senegal , for instance , just 43 percent of adults were considered literate in 2007 , compared to 72 percent in madagascar .
despite the obstacles , enrolment figures for primary-aged children in africa are on the increase .
according to 2009 figures from the un , net enrolment in sub-saharan africa went from 58 percent in 2000 to 74 percent in 2007 and from 91 percent to 96 percent over the same period of time in northern africa .
but enrolment figures do not tell the whole story : not only may corrupt practices prevent children from attending school , but they also lower the quality of education for students once they get there .
" even if you are in class , it might mean that you do n't learn much , because you have one textbook for ten learners if not more , " stassen said mismanagement partly to blame in many schools , the report found resources were being wasted or lost , not wilfully , but because those responsible for their management were simply ill-equipped for the job .
overall , 85 percent of schools across all countries had either deficient accounting systems or none at all , and in morocco , just 23 percent of head teachers received training in financial management , despite being responsible for budgets .
in niger that figure drops to just 8 percent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stephane stassen heads transparency international 's africa education watch program " schools where the head teacher had been trained and prepared to do his job in terms of managing the resources of the schools were … the schools where less of these corrupt practices were appearing , " said stassen .
" in a sense , what we found was that head teachers and teachers themselves were really feeling that they had been abandoned by the system . "
a way forward universal schooling for primary-aged children may be untenable by 2015 , but transparency international 's report suggests the reforms that have been made to date are in fact helping african schoolchildren .
the report found that schools that were more frequently audited tended to perform better : education outcomes were better and parents reported paying fewer illegal fees .
training in financial management for head teachers and school management committees could be strengthened , said stassen , to improve accountability .
stassen added that helping african parents to understand more about their rights within the schooling system was a crucial step in increasing engagement and accountability .
" i think that by combining inspections , grassroots accountability and better transparency in the system , you could really have an education system which is more efficient and better-resourced . "

it expects normal service to be restored by friday . lufthansa says only half of its normally scheduled flights will operate on tuesday and it will take until friday to get its worldwide network completely back up to speed .
on monday evening lufthansa and the pilots ' trade union cockpit agreed during mediation in a frankfurt labour court to resume negotiations , with cockpit suspending its work stoppage until march 8 .
lufthansa had gone to court seeking an injunction against the strike .
cockpit called the walkout to press its demands for job security guarantees and pay rises for 4,500 pilots the work stoppage , which had begun early on monday , led to the cancellation of 900 flights .
it was meant to continue until thursday .
also affected were lufthhansa 's subsidiary germanwings and lufthansa 's cargo division .
aircraft parked , crews displaced that left most aircraft parked at lufthansa 's hubs in frankfurt and munich , with crews and planes displaced from normal departure points .
a lufthansa spokesman said the airline was working at top speed to reinstate its global flight schedule .
lufthansa spokesman klaus walther told zdf german public television that extra flights would be provided on germany 's main routes - frankfurt-munich , frankfurt-berlin and frankfurt-hamburg .
" but it will take some time before the complete network is functioning again , " he said .
germanwings said that 120 of its 160 scheduled flights would operate on tuesday , despite the aftermath of the industrial action .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some 4,000 pilots were briefly on strike transport minister relieved german transport minister peter raumsauer told zdf he was relieved that resolution efforts and suggestions he had made since last weekend had been adopted by all sides .
" i now hope and demand that the negotiating parties reach a sustainable , amicable agreement and that no aircraft remains grounded , " he said . travel clouded by controllers ' strike meanwhile , european travellers can expect more disruption on tuesday , due to a work stoppage by french air traffic controllers .
that stoppage is expected to hamper half the flights at paris ' orly airport and a quarter of flights from the main charles de gaulle airport , according to france 's aviation authority dgac .
air france has vowed to maintain most long-haul services .
some french provincial airports also expect cancellations .
four french unions have called the five-day strike , from tuesday until saturday , to protest against government plans to merge france 's air traffic control activities with those of neighbouring countries .
controllers fear the merger will end their role as french state employees .
dgac insists their status will not change .
meanwhile , the british union unite says 81 percent of its cabin crew members working for british airways have voted in favour of strike action .
that creates the prospect of a strike within the next 28 days , although the easter holiday period is reported to have been ruled out. ipj / dpa / reuters / afp editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de development policy -pipe- 23.02.2010 european think-tanks call for new beginning in eu development policy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : simon maxwell is an economist with odi , london leading european think-tanks propose new approaches in development policy to cope with future challenges .
the eu should take on more prominent role in the area , argue this week 's commenators sven grimm and simon maxwell . while the new eu commission in the process of constitution , the european think-tanks group has presented a memorandum entitled " new challenges , new beginnings – next steps in european development cooperation " . the group comprises the think tanks die -lrb- germany -rrb- , odi -lrb- uk -rrb- , fride -lrb- spain -rrb- , and the european centre for development policy management ecdpm .
the memorandum analyses both current european policy and emerging challenges in climate change , migration , trade policy as well as the coherence of and division of labor in development policy .
eu should become more prominent actor in development field based on this analysis , the think-tanks group has formulated a number of recommendations for national and european decision-makers .
europe has still not succeeded in carving out a place for itself as a player in the world of the ' big two ' - the us and china .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : activists were disappointed with the lack of results at the copenhagen climate talks this became evident not least at the failed climate negotiations in copenhagen , where , when it came to the pivotal rounds of the talks , the us and china constituted more or less a group of their own .
if we viewed the european union 's external relations as a chorus , what we would see is a group of inveterate soloists seeking to prepare a new piece without a conductor .
in adopting the treaty of lisbon the eu might be said to have struggled though one page of the score .
this deserves praise .
but at a point of time where the dilapidated state of the global concert hall is becoming only all too evident , the real concern is : at present the substance and emphases of world politics are shifting towards the pacific .
europe depends on international decisions while europe is a globally networked region , it does have a marked atlantic orientation .
peace and prosperity in europe are dependent in crucial ways on whether or not the decisions taken in international bodies are of a long-term nature .
one consequence of this is that the distinction between domestic and foreign policy is growing increasingly blurred .
there is no isle of the blessed in a global financial and economic crisis , neither in europe nor in africa nor anywhere else .
the global climate is changing , and our way of life is going to have to change .
this goes not only for the us or china , the new global polluter , but also for europe , and especially for it – as well as for africa , which has contributed as good as nothing to climate change .
in short : we have an enlightened self-interest in global development .
eu should offer global leadership the tenor of the eu memorandum 's authors : if europe is to continue to be taken seriously as a global actor on its own merits , both european and national leaders need to address five central points : bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu should take on a more a more prominent role in development policy first , development policy needs to be seen as an element of approaches to global problem-solving – which means that it needs to become one of the central areas of european foreign policy .
here europe must offer global leadership .
the world trade talks are set to continue in geneva this year .
in september the united nations will be hosting a summit on the state of the un millennium development goals -lrb- mdgs -rrb- .
in june canada is to host the g8 / g20 for a conference on the financial crisis .
in addition , the climate talks will be returning to bonn in june .
how far will europe 's voice carry in these concerts ?
effectiveness of development aid impacts on european credibility the second point concerns commitments on the volume and effectiveness of global development assistance .
this is a matter of europe 's own credibility .
not enough that the donors operating in africa often trip over one another for lack of coordination , the eu countries are currently offering 20 billion euros less in aid than they had originally pledged .
and there are fears that commitments on climate protection finance could come at the expense of other fields , with europe , in effect , pursuing a zero-sum policy – taking , as it were , funds from its right pocket and putting them into its left .
coordinating different fields third , development assistance must not be allowed simply to make up for what european policy has taken away elsewhere .
trade , climate protection , and immigration policy are key fields that need to be coordinated with the objectives of development policy .
this is a permanent task for which there can and will be no quick fixes .
investing in international partnerships bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sven grimm , researcher with bonn-based think-tank die fourth , it is essential to invest in global partnerships .
these are investments in a shared future .
partners need to be able act on equal terms – in order then to seek , on an equal footing , solutions to common problems .
in view of the fact that reforms of the bretton woods institutions are on the immediate agenda , the international decisions that need to be taken in the near future will put europe to the test .
international power shifts are already becoming evident .
measured in terms of its economic power , which is declining in relation to asia , europe is overrepresented in imf and world bank .
when it comes to international bodies , europe often seems to confuse quantity with quality , and having a large number of representatives in the g20 or the imf does not necessarily mean more influence if efforts to coordinate such steps have not been successfully coordinated in advance .
only as a chorus will europe prove able to make its voice heard .
potential role of eu foreign service and finally , fifth , the memorandum points to the potentials of the new european foreign service .
its mix of personnel drawn from member states and eu institutions may be seen as an opportunity .
at present , though , there are more questions than answers concerning this matter .
agreements – including the reform-oriented lisbon treaty – will be doomed to lead a life on paper unless europe 's responsible institutions and leaders prove able to improve their cooperation .
in other words , the question is : does europe now need to opt for more centralization ?
this is , in fact , not a realistic option , as the protracted wrangling in recent years over eu reforms has shown .
taking lisbon treaty as framework to improve policies the treaty of lisbon is certainly not the big bang for european global power .
but it does provide a good framework for improved coordination .
it is essential that efforts to improve the eu 's division of labor actually bear fruit if europe 's diversity is to be orchestrated to form a good chorus .
otherwise europe 's voice is likely to turn out to be little more than world-political background noise .
but one thing that can be said with certainty is that for the european countries global acoustics would be far worse in a world dominated by the big two . " sven grimm is a researcher at the department bi- and multilateral development cooperation with the german development institute / deutsches institut für entwicklungspolitik -lrb- die -rrb- , a think tank based in bonn . simon maxwell is a senior research associate with leading british think tank , the overseas development institute -lrb- odi -rrb- . the german development institute / deutsches institut für entwicklungspolitik -lrb- die -rrb- is one of the leading think tanks for development policy world-wide .

the eu should take on more prominent role in the area , argue this week 's commenators sven grimm and simon maxwell . while the new eu commission in the process of constitution , the european think-tanks group has presented a memorandum entitled " new challenges , new beginnings – next steps in european development cooperation " . the group comprises the think tanks die -lrb- germany -rrb- , odi -lrb- uk -rrb- , fride -lrb- spain -rrb- , and the european centre for development policy management ecdpm .
the memorandum analyses both current european policy and emerging challenges in climate change , migration , trade policy as well as the coherence of and division of labor in development policy .
eu should become more prominent actor in development field based on this analysis , the think-tanks group has formulated a number of recommendations for national and european decision-makers .
europe has still not succeeded in carving out a place for itself as a player in the world of the ' big two ' - the us and china .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : activists were disappointed with the lack of results at the copenhagen climate talks this became evident not least at the failed climate negotiations in copenhagen , where , when it came to the pivotal rounds of the talks , the us and china constituted more or less a group of their own .
if we viewed the european union 's external relations as a chorus , what we would see is a group of inveterate soloists seeking to prepare a new piece without a conductor .
in adopting the treaty of lisbon the eu might be said to have struggled though one page of the score .
this deserves praise .
but at a point of time where the dilapidated state of the global concert hall is becoming only all too evident , the real concern is : at present the substance and emphases of world politics are shifting towards the pacific .
europe depends on international decisions while europe is a globally networked region , it does have a marked atlantic orientation .
peace and prosperity in europe are dependent in crucial ways on whether or not the decisions taken in international bodies are of a long-term nature .
one consequence of this is that the distinction between domestic and foreign policy is growing increasingly blurred .
there is no isle of the blessed in a global financial and economic crisis , neither in europe nor in africa nor anywhere else .
the global climate is changing , and our way of life is going to have to change .
this goes not only for the us or china , the new global polluter , but also for europe , and especially for it – as well as for africa , which has contributed as good as nothing to climate change .
in short : we have an enlightened self-interest in global development .
eu should offer global leadership the tenor of the eu memorandum 's authors : if europe is to continue to be taken seriously as a global actor on its own merits , both european and national leaders need to address five central points : bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu should take on a more a more prominent role in development policy first , development policy needs to be seen as an element of approaches to global problem-solving – which means that it needs to become one of the central areas of european foreign policy .
here europe must offer global leadership .
the world trade talks are set to continue in geneva this year .
in september the united nations will be hosting a summit on the state of the un millennium development goals -lrb- mdgs -rrb- .
in june canada is to host the g8 / g20 for a conference on the financial crisis .
in addition , the climate talks will be returning to bonn in june .
how far will europe 's voice carry in these concerts ?
effectiveness of development aid impacts on european credibility the second point concerns commitments on the volume and effectiveness of global development assistance .
this is a matter of europe 's own credibility .
not enough that the donors operating in africa often trip over one another for lack of coordination , the eu countries are currently offering 20 billion euros less in aid than they had originally pledged .
and there are fears that commitments on climate protection finance could come at the expense of other fields , with europe , in effect , pursuing a zero-sum policy – taking , as it were , funds from its right pocket and putting them into its left .
coordinating different fields third , development assistance must not be allowed simply to make up for what european policy has taken away elsewhere .
trade , climate protection , and immigration policy are key fields that need to be coordinated with the objectives of development policy .
this is a permanent task for which there can and will be no quick fixes .
investing in international partnerships bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sven grimm , researcher with bonn-based think-tank die fourth , it is essential to invest in global partnerships .
these are investments in a shared future .
partners need to be able act on equal terms – in order then to seek , on an equal footing , solutions to common problems .
in view of the fact that reforms of the bretton woods institutions are on the immediate agenda , the international decisions that need to be taken in the near future will put europe to the test .
international power shifts are already becoming evident .
measured in terms of its economic power , which is declining in relation to asia , europe is overrepresented in imf and world bank .
when it comes to international bodies , europe often seems to confuse quantity with quality , and having a large number of representatives in the g20 or the imf does not necessarily mean more influence if efforts to coordinate such steps have not been successfully coordinated in advance .
only as a chorus will europe prove able to make its voice heard .
potential role of eu foreign service and finally , fifth , the memorandum points to the potentials of the new european foreign service .
its mix of personnel drawn from member states and eu institutions may be seen as an opportunity .
at present , though , there are more questions than answers concerning this matter .
agreements – including the reform-oriented lisbon treaty – will be doomed to lead a life on paper unless europe 's responsible institutions and leaders prove able to improve their cooperation .
in other words , the question is : does europe now need to opt for more centralization ?
this is , in fact , not a realistic option , as the protracted wrangling in recent years over eu reforms has shown .
taking lisbon treaty as framework to improve policies the treaty of lisbon is certainly not the big bang for european global power .
but it does provide a good framework for improved coordination .
it is essential that efforts to improve the eu 's division of labor actually bear fruit if europe 's diversity is to be orchestrated to form a good chorus .
otherwise europe 's voice is likely to turn out to be little more than world-political background noise .
but one thing that can be said with certainty is that for the european countries global acoustics would be far worse in a world dominated by the big two . " sven grimm is a researcher at the department bi- and multilateral development cooperation with the german development institute / deutsches institut für entwicklungspolitik -lrb- die -rrb- , a think tank based in bonn . simon maxwell is a senior research associate with leading british think tank , the overseas development institute -lrb- odi -rrb- . the german development institute / deutsches institut für entwicklungspolitik -lrb- die -rrb- is one of the leading think tanks for development policy world-wide .

it expects normal service to be restored by friday . lufthansa says only half of its normally scheduled flights will operate on tuesday and it will take until friday to get its worldwide network completely back up to speed .
on monday evening lufthansa and the pilots ' trade union cockpit agreed during mediation in a frankfurt labour court to resume negotiations , with cockpit suspending its work stoppage until march 8 .
lufthansa had gone to court seeking an injunction against the strike .
cockpit called the walkout to press its demands for job security guarantees and pay rises for 4,500 pilots the work stoppage , which had begun early on monday , led to the cancellation of 900 flights .
it was meant to continue until thursday .
also affected were lufthhansa 's subsidiary germanwings and lufthansa 's cargo division .
aircraft parked , crews displaced that left most aircraft parked at lufthansa 's hubs in frankfurt and munich , with crews and planes displaced from normal departure points .
a lufthansa spokesman said the airline was working at top speed to reinstate its global flight schedule .
lufthansa spokesman klaus walther told zdf german public television that extra flights would be provided on germany 's main routes - frankfurt-munich , frankfurt-berlin and frankfurt-hamburg .
" but it will take some time before the complete network is functioning again , " he said .
germanwings said that 120 of its 160 scheduled flights would operate on tuesday , despite the aftermath of the industrial action .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some 4,000 pilots were briefly on strike transport minister relieved german transport minister peter raumsauer told zdf he was relieved that resolution efforts and suggestions he had made since last weekend had been adopted by all sides .
" i now hope and demand that the negotiating parties reach a sustainable , amicable agreement and that no aircraft remains grounded , " he said . travel clouded by controllers ' strike meanwhile , european travellers can expect more disruption on tuesday , due to a work stoppage by french air traffic controllers .
that stoppage is expected to hamper half the flights at paris ' orly airport and a quarter of flights from the main charles de gaulle airport , according to france 's aviation authority dgac .
air france has vowed to maintain most long-haul services .
some french provincial airports also expect cancellations .
four french unions have called the five-day strike , from tuesday until saturday , to protest against government plans to merge france 's air traffic control activities with those of neighbouring countries .
controllers fear the merger will end their role as french state employees .
dgac insists their status will not change .
meanwhile , the british union unite says 81 percent of its cabin crew members working for british airways have voted in favour of strike action .
that creates the prospect of a strike within the next 28 days , although the easter holiday period is reported to have been ruled out. ipj / dpa / reuters / afp editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

pilot union cockpit agreed not to call any further strikes before march 8 .
it welcomed monday 's court decision to resume wage talks . the pilot 's union also withdrew variable compensation , or profit sharing , from its list of key demands , which had been misinterpreted .
both sides agreed to return to the negotiating table without setting any preconditions .
germany 's national carrier confirmed that both parties would resume talks immediately .
" the parties agreed in front of the court that the strike is to be suspended through the 8th of march " , lufthansa spokesman andreas bartels told ap news agency . lufthansa said the 4,000 pilots will return to work tuesday though it would take some time for normal operations to resume .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : normal operations to resume after striking pilots agree to suspend strike the walkout began midnight monday and caused the cancellation of hundreds of flights on germany 's largest airline , disrupting travel for thousands of people .
lufthansa had asked a frankfurt labor court for an injunction against the strike , which had threatened to drag on until thursday .
representatives from the union and lufthansa agreed to resume talks as they met before a judge monday evening .
travel chaos averted the airline had earlier predicted that the strike would cause about 800 flights per day to be canceled , totaling 3,200 flights for the week .
international routes were hardest hit by the strike , while most domestic service remained intact , lufthansa said .
cockpit spokesman joerg handwerg told the afp news agency that the strike was " a great success . "
outsourcing to partners the four-day strike could have cost lufthansa more than 65 million euros -lrb- $ 88.4 million -rrb- and up to 100 million euros if all flights were grounded , according to estimates by the airline .
lufthansa pilots are demanding a 6.4 percent pay raise , more influence in company decisions and a commitment that pilots will keep their jobs if lufthansa shifts routes to affiliate airlines like austrian airlines or lufthansa italia , where pilots come cheaper .

it expects normal service to be restored by friday . lufthansa says only half of its normally scheduled flights will operate on tuesday and it will take until friday to get its worldwide network completely back up to speed .
on monday evening lufthansa and the pilots ' trade union cockpit agreed during mediation in a frankfurt labour court to resume negotiations , with cockpit suspending its work stoppage until march 8 .
lufthansa had gone to court seeking an injunction against the strike .
cockpit called the walkout to press its demands for job security guarantees and pay rises for 4,500 pilots the work stoppage , which had begun early on monday , led to the cancellation of 900 flights .
it was meant to continue until thursday .
also affected were lufthhansa 's subsidiary germanwings and lufthansa 's cargo division .
aircraft parked , crews displaced that left most aircraft parked at lufthansa 's hubs in frankfurt and munich , with crews and planes displaced from normal departure points .
a lufthansa spokesman said the airline was working at top speed to reinstate its global flight schedule .
lufthansa spokesman klaus walther told zdf german public television that extra flights would be provided on germany 's main routes - frankfurt-munich , frankfurt-berlin and frankfurt-hamburg .
" but it will take some time before the complete network is functioning again , " he said .
germanwings said that 120 of its 160 scheduled flights would operate on tuesday , despite the aftermath of the industrial action .

some french provincial airports also expect cancellations .
four french unions have called the five-day strike , from tuesday until saturday , to protest against government plans to merge france 's air traffic control activities with those of neighbouring countries .
controllers fear the merger will end their role as french state employees .
dgac insists their status will not change .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de africa -pipe- 23.02.2010 corruption stifles learning in africa , report finds großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : corruption is still keeping some african children out of the classroom a new report from anti-corruption organisation transparency international has found that systematic corruption and mismanagement are keeping many african children from a decent education , despite years of reform . when it comes to tackling poverty , poor health or limited opportunities for growth , a good education is widely seen as a magic bullet for developing countries .
indeed , education is considered so crucial that when the united nations released its millennium development goals for 2015 , universal primary education was slated as the number two priority , second only to eradicating extreme poverty and hunger .
but a report released by berlin-based anti-corruption organisation transparency international suggests that endemic corruption in african schooling systems is still seeing large numbers of primary-aged african children denied their right to an education .
" basically all issues around resourcing had a dimension of corruption , with resources being exploited or embezzled by someone for private gain , but sometimes also just plain mismanagement , " said stephane stassen , who co-authored the report .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : giving children an education is crucial in post-war sierra leone the transparency international study " good governance lessons for primary education " was produced as part of the organisation 's africa education watch initiative and examined the impact of corruption on education quality and availability in seven african countries , interviewing over 8500 educators and parents in ghana , madagascar , morocco , niger , senegal , sierra leone and uganda .
change coming too slow to the continent the data collected paints a troubling picture of education in africa : despite two decades of reforms designed to allow greater levels of management at the local level and improve accountability , school administration is still not , for the most part , a genuinely corruption-free and participatory governance system .
" despite all these measures , there were still many governance challenges , " said stephane stassen , who heads transparency international 's africa education watch program .
one of the most striking examples is that of so-called registration fees , which parents from every country surveyed reported paying , although by law primary schooling is free .
the number of parents forced to pay these illegal accounting fees ranged from 9 % in ghana , to 90 % in morocco , the report found .
" similarly , in some countries where they had also abolished exam fees , they were still being charged , " said stassen .
he added that in many countries , textbooks were often not available .
and even if they were dispatched to schools , they were often not distributed for free .
the problems were also identified at higher levels , for example when schools receiving grants with which to run themselves were not receiving the full amount , or it was coming with a delay .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most parents can not afford high school fees the average cost of enrolling a primary-aged child in an african school for one year is three euros .
by comparison , the average per capita income in sierra leone is just us $ 260 -lrb- 190 euros -rrb- per year .
the costs charged for " free " textbooks as well as the fees of illegal " compulsory tutoring " - charged by some teachers to supplement their meagre incomes - puts an additional strain on african families .
crucial learning years missed these prohibitively high costs can lead to higher school dropout rates at a crucial time in children 's lives . " primary education is really the place where you get the basics for your life later on .
this is where you learn to read and write , this is where you learn to count , and if , for example if in africa you want to have a chance in trade or to go beyond your village , these are really skills you need to acquire . "
stassen said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : illiteracy among older people is high in many parts of africa he added that without a basic education , it would be nearly impossible to go on to high school or college .
" it 's really hard to get people back to school later on , and this is why we have to get things right now " .
literacy remains low in many parts of africa .
in senegal , for instance , just 43 percent of adults were considered literate in 2007 , compared to 72 percent in madagascar .
despite the obstacles , enrolment figures for primary-aged children in africa are on the increase .
according to 2009 figures from the un , net enrolment in sub-saharan africa went from 58 percent in 2000 to 74 percent in 2007 and from 91 percent to 96 percent over the same period of time in northern africa .
but enrolment figures do not tell the whole story : not only may corrupt practices prevent children from attending school , but they also lower the quality of education for students once they get there .
" even if you are in class , it might mean that you do n't learn much , because you have one textbook for ten learners if not more , " stassen said mismanagement partly to blame in many schools , the report found resources were being wasted or lost , not wilfully , but because those responsible for their management were simply ill-equipped for the job .
overall , 85 percent of schools across all countries had either deficient accounting systems or none at all , and in morocco , just 23 percent of head teachers received training in financial management , despite being responsible for budgets .
in niger that figure drops to just 8 percent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stephane stassen heads transparency international 's africa education watch program " schools where the head teacher had been trained and prepared to do his job in terms of managing the resources of the schools were … the schools where less of these corrupt practices were appearing , " said stassen .
" in a sense , what we found was that head teachers and teachers themselves were really feeling that they had been abandoned by the system . "
a way forward universal schooling for primary-aged children may be untenable by 2015 , but transparency international 's report suggests the reforms that have been made to date are in fact helping african schoolchildren .
the report found that schools that were more frequently audited tended to perform better : education outcomes were better and parents reported paying fewer illegal fees .
training in financial management for head teachers and school management committees could be strengthened , said stassen , to improve accountability .
stassen added that helping african parents to understand more about their rights within the schooling system was a crucial step in increasing engagement and accountability .
" i think that by combining inspections , grassroots accountability and better transparency in the system , you could really have an education system which is more efficient and better-resourced . "

indeed , education is considered so crucial that when the united nations released its millennium development goals for 2015 , universal primary education was slated as the number two priority , second only to eradicating extreme poverty and hunger .
but a report released by berlin-based anti-corruption organisation transparency international suggests that endemic corruption in african schooling systems is still seeing large numbers of primary-aged african children denied their right to an education .
" basically all issues around resourcing had a dimension of corruption , with resources being exploited or embezzled by someone for private gain , but sometimes also just plain mismanagement , " said stephane stassen , who co-authored the report .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : giving children an education is crucial in post-war sierra leone the transparency international study " good governance lessons for primary education " was produced as part of the organisation 's africa education watch initiative and examined the impact of corruption on education quality and availability in seven african countries , interviewing over 8500 educators and parents in ghana , madagascar , morocco , niger , senegal , sierra leone and uganda .
change coming too slow to the continent the data collected paints a troubling picture of education in africa : despite two decades of reforms designed to allow greater levels of management at the local level and improve accountability , school administration is still not , for the most part , a genuinely corruption-free and participatory governance system .
" despite all these measures , there were still many governance challenges , " said stephane stassen , who heads transparency international 's africa education watch program .
one of the most striking examples is that of so-called registration fees , which parents from every country surveyed reported paying , although by law primary schooling is free .
the number of parents forced to pay these illegal accounting fees ranged from 9 % in ghana , to 90 % in morocco , the report found .
" similarly , in some countries where they had also abolished exam fees , they were still being charged , " said stassen .
he added that in many countries , textbooks were often not available .
and even if they were dispatched to schools , they were often not distributed for free .
the problems were also identified at higher levels , for example when schools receiving grants with which to run themselves were not receiving the full amount , or it was coming with a delay .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most parents can not afford high school fees the average cost of enrolling a primary-aged child in an african school for one year is three euros .
by comparison , the average per capita income in sierra leone is just us $ 260 -lrb- 190 euros -rrb- per year .
the costs charged for " free " textbooks as well as the fees of illegal " compulsory tutoring " - charged by some teachers to supplement their meagre incomes - puts an additional strain on african families .
crucial learning years missed these prohibitively high costs can lead to higher school dropout rates at a crucial time in children 's lives . " primary education is really the place where you get the basics for your life later on .
this is where you learn to read and write , this is where you learn to count , and if , for example if in africa you want to have a chance in trade or to go beyond your village , these are really skills you need to acquire . "
stassen said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : illiteracy among older people is high in many parts of africa he added that without a basic education , it would be nearly impossible to go on to high school or college .
" it 's really hard to get people back to school later on , and this is why we have to get things right now " .
literacy remains low in many parts of africa .
in senegal , for instance , just 43 percent of adults were considered literate in 2007 , compared to 72 percent in madagascar .
despite the obstacles , enrolment figures for primary-aged children in africa are on the increase .
according to 2009 figures from the un , net enrolment in sub-saharan africa went from 58 percent in 2000 to 74 percent in 2007 and from 91 percent to 96 percent over the same period of time in northern africa .
but enrolment figures do not tell the whole story : not only may corrupt practices prevent children from attending school , but they also lower the quality of education for students once they get there .
" even if you are in class , it might mean that you do n't learn much , because you have one textbook for ten learners if not more , " stassen said mismanagement partly to blame in many schools , the report found resources were being wasted or lost , not wilfully , but because those responsible for their management were simply ill-equipped for the job .
overall , 85 percent of schools across all countries had either deficient accounting systems or none at all , and in morocco , just 23 percent of head teachers received training in financial management , despite being responsible for budgets .
in niger that figure drops to just 8 percent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stephane stassen heads transparency international 's africa education watch program " schools where the head teacher had been trained and prepared to do his job in terms of managing the resources of the schools were … the schools where less of these corrupt practices were appearing , " said stassen .
" in a sense , what we found was that head teachers and teachers themselves were really feeling that they had been abandoned by the system . "
a way forward universal schooling for primary-aged children may be untenable by 2015 , but transparency international 's report suggests the reforms that have been made to date are in fact helping african schoolchildren .
the report found that schools that were more frequently audited tended to perform better : education outcomes were better and parents reported paying fewer illegal fees .
training in financial management for head teachers and school management committees could be strengthened , said stassen , to improve accountability .
stassen added that helping african parents to understand more about their rights within the schooling system was a crucial step in increasing engagement and accountability .
" i think that by combining inspections , grassroots accountability and better transparency in the system , you could really have an education system which is more efficient and better-resourced . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de development policy -pipe- 23.02.2010 european think-tanks call for new beginning in eu development policy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : simon maxwell is an economist with odi , london leading european think-tanks propose new approaches in development policy to cope with future challenges .
the eu should take on more prominent role in the area , argue this week 's commenators sven grimm and simon maxwell . while the new eu commission in the process of constitution , the european think-tanks group has presented a memorandum entitled " new challenges , new beginnings – next steps in european development cooperation " . the group comprises the think tanks die -lrb- germany -rrb- , odi -lrb- uk -rrb- , fride -lrb- spain -rrb- , and the european centre for development policy management ecdpm .
the memorandum analyses both current european policy and emerging challenges in climate change , migration , trade policy as well as the coherence of and division of labor in development policy .
eu should become more prominent actor in development field based on this analysis , the think-tanks group has formulated a number of recommendations for national and european decision-makers .
europe has still not succeeded in carving out a place for itself as a player in the world of the ' big two ' - the us and china .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : activists were disappointed with the lack of results at the copenhagen climate talks this became evident not least at the failed climate negotiations in copenhagen , where , when it came to the pivotal rounds of the talks , the us and china constituted more or less a group of their own .
if we viewed the european union 's external relations as a chorus , what we would see is a group of inveterate soloists seeking to prepare a new piece without a conductor .
in adopting the treaty of lisbon the eu might be said to have struggled though one page of the score .
this deserves praise .
but at a point of time where the dilapidated state of the global concert hall is becoming only all too evident , the real concern is : at present the substance and emphases of world politics are shifting towards the pacific .
europe depends on international decisions while europe is a globally networked region , it does have a marked atlantic orientation .
peace and prosperity in europe are dependent in crucial ways on whether or not the decisions taken in international bodies are of a long-term nature .
one consequence of this is that the distinction between domestic and foreign policy is growing increasingly blurred .
there is no isle of the blessed in a global financial and economic crisis , neither in europe nor in africa nor anywhere else .
the global climate is changing , and our way of life is going to have to change .
this goes not only for the us or china , the new global polluter , but also for europe , and especially for it – as well as for africa , which has contributed as good as nothing to climate change .
in short : we have an enlightened self-interest in global development .
eu should offer global leadership the tenor of the eu memorandum 's authors : if europe is to continue to be taken seriously as a global actor on its own merits , both european and national leaders need to address five central points : bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu should take on a more a more prominent role in development policy first , development policy needs to be seen as an element of approaches to global problem-solving – which means that it needs to become one of the central areas of european foreign policy .
here europe must offer global leadership .
the world trade talks are set to continue in geneva this year .
in september the united nations will be hosting a summit on the state of the un millennium development goals -lrb- mdgs -rrb- .
in june canada is to host the g8 / g20 for a conference on the financial crisis .
in addition , the climate talks will be returning to bonn in june .
how far will europe 's voice carry in these concerts ?
effectiveness of development aid impacts on european credibility the second point concerns commitments on the volume and effectiveness of global development assistance .
this is a matter of europe 's own credibility .
not enough that the donors operating in africa often trip over one another for lack of coordination , the eu countries are currently offering 20 billion euros less in aid than they had originally pledged .
and there are fears that commitments on climate protection finance could come at the expense of other fields , with europe , in effect , pursuing a zero-sum policy – taking , as it were , funds from its right pocket and putting them into its left .
coordinating different fields third , development assistance must not be allowed simply to make up for what european policy has taken away elsewhere .
trade , climate protection , and immigration policy are key fields that need to be coordinated with the objectives of development policy .
this is a permanent task for which there can and will be no quick fixes .
investing in international partnerships bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sven grimm , researcher with bonn-based think-tank die fourth , it is essential to invest in global partnerships .
these are investments in a shared future .
partners need to be able act on equal terms – in order then to seek , on an equal footing , solutions to common problems .
in view of the fact that reforms of the bretton woods institutions are on the immediate agenda , the international decisions that need to be taken in the near future will put europe to the test .
international power shifts are already becoming evident .
measured in terms of its economic power , which is declining in relation to asia , europe is overrepresented in imf and world bank .
when it comes to international bodies , europe often seems to confuse quantity with quality , and having a large number of representatives in the g20 or the imf does not necessarily mean more influence if efforts to coordinate such steps have not been successfully coordinated in advance .
only as a chorus will europe prove able to make its voice heard .
potential role of eu foreign service and finally , fifth , the memorandum points to the potentials of the new european foreign service .
its mix of personnel drawn from member states and eu institutions may be seen as an opportunity .
at present , though , there are more questions than answers concerning this matter .
agreements – including the reform-oriented lisbon treaty – will be doomed to lead a life on paper unless europe 's responsible institutions and leaders prove able to improve their cooperation .
in other words , the question is : does europe now need to opt for more centralization ?
this is , in fact , not a realistic option , as the protracted wrangling in recent years over eu reforms has shown .
taking lisbon treaty as framework to improve policies the treaty of lisbon is certainly not the big bang for european global power .
but it does provide a good framework for improved coordination .
it is essential that efforts to improve the eu 's division of labor actually bear fruit if europe 's diversity is to be orchestrated to form a good chorus .
otherwise europe 's voice is likely to turn out to be little more than world-political background noise .
but one thing that can be said with certainty is that for the european countries global acoustics would be far worse in a world dominated by the big two .

investing in international partnerships bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sven grimm , researcher with bonn-based think-tank die fourth , it is essential to invest in global partnerships .
these are investments in a shared future .
partners need to be able act on equal terms – in order then to seek , on an equal footing , solutions to common problems .
in view of the fact that reforms of the bretton woods institutions are on the immediate agenda , the international decisions that need to be taken in the near future will put europe to the test .
international power shifts are already becoming evident .
measured in terms of its economic power , which is declining in relation to asia , europe is overrepresented in imf and world bank .
when it comes to international bodies , europe often seems to confuse quantity with quality , and having a large number of representatives in the g20 or the imf does not necessarily mean more influence if efforts to coordinate such steps have not been successfully coordinated in advance .

potential role of eu foreign service and finally , fifth , the memorandum points to the potentials of the new european foreign service .
its mix of personnel drawn from member states and eu institutions may be seen as an opportunity .
at present , though , there are more questions than answers concerning this matter .
agreements – including the reform-oriented lisbon treaty – will be doomed to lead a life on paper unless europe 's responsible institutions and leaders prove able to improve their cooperation .
in other words , the question is : does europe now need to opt for more centralization ?
this is , in fact , not a realistic option , as the protracted wrangling in recent years over eu reforms has shown .
taking lisbon treaty as framework to improve policies the treaty of lisbon is certainly not the big bang for european global power .
but it does provide a good framework for improved coordination .
it is essential that efforts to improve the eu 's division of labor actually bear fruit if europe 's diversity is to be orchestrated to form a good chorus .
otherwise europe 's voice is likely to turn out to be little more than world-political background noise .

the eu should take on more prominent role in the area , argue this week 's commenators sven grimm and simon maxwell . while the new eu commission in the process of constitution , the european think-tanks group has presented a memorandum entitled " new challenges , new beginnings – next steps in european development cooperation " . the group comprises the think tanks die -lrb- germany -rrb- , odi -lrb- uk -rrb- , fride -lrb- spain -rrb- , and the european centre for development policy management ecdpm .
the memorandum analyses both current european policy and emerging challenges in climate change , migration , trade policy as well as the coherence of and division of labor in development policy .
eu should become more prominent actor in development field based on this analysis , the think-tanks group has formulated a number of recommendations for national and european decision-makers .
europe has still not succeeded in carving out a place for itself as a player in the world of the ' big two ' - the us and china .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : activists were disappointed with the lack of results at the copenhagen climate talks this became evident not least at the failed climate negotiations in copenhagen , where , when it came to the pivotal rounds of the talks , the us and china constituted more or less a group of their own .
if we viewed the european union 's external relations as a chorus , what we would see is a group of inveterate soloists seeking to prepare a new piece without a conductor .
in adopting the treaty of lisbon the eu might be said to have struggled though one page of the score .
this deserves praise .
but at a point of time where the dilapidated state of the global concert hall is becoming only all too evident , the real concern is : at present the substance and emphases of world politics are shifting towards the pacific .
europe depends on international decisions while europe is a globally networked region , it does have a marked atlantic orientation .
peace and prosperity in europe are dependent in crucial ways on whether or not the decisions taken in international bodies are of a long-term nature .
one consequence of this is that the distinction between domestic and foreign policy is growing increasingly blurred .
there is no isle of the blessed in a global financial and economic crisis , neither in europe nor in africa nor anywhere else .
the global climate is changing , and our way of life is going to have to change .
this goes not only for the us or china , the new global polluter , but also for europe , and especially for it – as well as for africa , which has contributed as good as nothing to climate change .
in short : we have an enlightened self-interest in global development .
eu should offer global leadership the tenor of the eu memorandum 's authors : if europe is to continue to be taken seriously as a global actor on its own merits , both european and national leaders need to address five central points : bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu should take on a more a more prominent role in development policy first , development policy needs to be seen as an element of approaches to global problem-solving – which means that it needs to become one of the central areas of european foreign policy .
here europe must offer global leadership .
the world trade talks are set to continue in geneva this year .
in september the united nations will be hosting a summit on the state of the un millennium development goals -lrb- mdgs -rrb- .
in june canada is to host the g8 / g20 for a conference on the financial crisis .
in addition , the climate talks will be returning to bonn in june .
how far will europe 's voice carry in these concerts ?
effectiveness of development aid impacts on european credibility the second point concerns commitments on the volume and effectiveness of global development assistance .
this is a matter of europe 's own credibility .
not enough that the donors operating in africa often trip over one another for lack of coordination , the eu countries are currently offering 20 billion euros less in aid than they had originally pledged .
and there are fears that commitments on climate protection finance could come at the expense of other fields , with europe , in effect , pursuing a zero-sum policy – taking , as it were , funds from its right pocket and putting them into its left .

the eu should take on more prominent role in the area , argue this week 's commenators sven grimm and simon maxwell . while the new eu commission in the process of constitution , the european think-tanks group has presented a memorandum entitled " new challenges , new beginnings – next steps in european development cooperation " . the group comprises the think tanks die -lrb- germany -rrb- , odi -lrb- uk -rrb- , fride -lrb- spain -rrb- , and the european centre for development policy management ecdpm .
the memorandum analyses both current european policy and emerging challenges in climate change , migration , trade policy as well as the coherence of and division of labor in development policy .
eu should become more prominent actor in development field based on this analysis , the think-tanks group has formulated a number of recommendations for national and european decision-makers .
europe has still not succeeded in carving out a place for itself as a player in the world of the ' big two ' - the us and china .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : activists were disappointed with the lack of results at the copenhagen climate talks this became evident not least at the failed climate negotiations in copenhagen , where , when it came to the pivotal rounds of the talks , the us and china constituted more or less a group of their own .
if we viewed the european union 's external relations as a chorus , what we would see is a group of inveterate soloists seeking to prepare a new piece without a conductor .
in adopting the treaty of lisbon the eu might be said to have struggled though one page of the score .
this deserves praise .
but at a point of time where the dilapidated state of the global concert hall is becoming only all too evident , the real concern is : at present the substance and emphases of world politics are shifting towards the pacific .
europe depends on international decisions while europe is a globally networked region , it does have a marked atlantic orientation .
peace and prosperity in europe are dependent in crucial ways on whether or not the decisions taken in international bodies are of a long-term nature .
one consequence of this is that the distinction between domestic and foreign policy is growing increasingly blurred .
there is no isle of the blessed in a global financial and economic crisis , neither in europe nor in africa nor anywhere else .
the global climate is changing , and our way of life is going to have to change .
this goes not only for the us or china , the new global polluter , but also for europe , and especially for it – as well as for africa , which has contributed as good as nothing to climate change .
in short : we have an enlightened self-interest in global development .
eu should offer global leadership the tenor of the eu memorandum 's authors : if europe is to continue to be taken seriously as a global actor on its own merits , both european and national leaders need to address five central points : bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu should take on a more a more prominent role in development policy first , development policy needs to be seen as an element of approaches to global problem-solving – which means that it needs to become one of the central areas of european foreign policy .
here europe must offer global leadership .
the world trade talks are set to continue in geneva this year .
in september the united nations will be hosting a summit on the state of the un millennium development goals -lrb- mdgs -rrb- .
in june canada is to host the g8 / g20 for a conference on the financial crisis .
in addition , the climate talks will be returning to bonn in june .
how far will europe 's voice carry in these concerts ?
effectiveness of development aid impacts on european credibility the second point concerns commitments on the volume and effectiveness of global development assistance .
this is a matter of europe 's own credibility .
not enough that the donors operating in africa often trip over one another for lack of coordination , the eu countries are currently offering 20 billion euros less in aid than they had originally pledged .
and there are fears that commitments on climate protection finance could come at the expense of other fields , with europe , in effect , pursuing a zero-sum policy – taking , as it were , funds from its right pocket and putting them into its left .
coordinating different fields third , development assistance must not be allowed simply to make up for what european policy has taken away elsewhere .
trade , climate protection , and immigration policy are key fields that need to be coordinated with the objectives of development policy .
this is a permanent task for which there can and will be no quick fixes .
investing in international partnerships bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sven grimm , researcher with bonn-based think-tank die fourth , it is essential to invest in global partnerships .
these are investments in a shared future .
partners need to be able act on equal terms – in order then to seek , on an equal footing , solutions to common problems .
in view of the fact that reforms of the bretton woods institutions are on the immediate agenda , the international decisions that need to be taken in the near future will put europe to the test .
international power shifts are already becoming evident .
measured in terms of its economic power , which is declining in relation to asia , europe is overrepresented in imf and world bank .
when it comes to international bodies , europe often seems to confuse quantity with quality , and having a large number of representatives in the g20 or the imf does not necessarily mean more influence if efforts to coordinate such steps have not been successfully coordinated in advance .
only as a chorus will europe prove able to make its voice heard .
potential role of eu foreign service and finally , fifth , the memorandum points to the potentials of the new european foreign service .
its mix of personnel drawn from member states and eu institutions may be seen as an opportunity .
at present , though , there are more questions than answers concerning this matter .
agreements – including the reform-oriented lisbon treaty – will be doomed to lead a life on paper unless europe 's responsible institutions and leaders prove able to improve their cooperation .
in other words , the question is : does europe now need to opt for more centralization ?
this is , in fact , not a realistic option , as the protracted wrangling in recent years over eu reforms has shown .
taking lisbon treaty as framework to improve policies the treaty of lisbon is certainly not the big bang for european global power .
but it does provide a good framework for improved coordination .
it is essential that efforts to improve the eu 's division of labor actually bear fruit if europe 's diversity is to be orchestrated to form a good chorus .
otherwise europe 's voice is likely to turn out to be little more than world-political background noise .
but one thing that can be said with certainty is that for the european countries global acoustics would be far worse in a world dominated by the big two . " sven grimm is a researcher at the department bi- and multilateral development cooperation with the german development institute / deutsches institut für entwicklungspolitik -lrb- die -rrb- , a think tank based in bonn . simon maxwell is a senior research associate with leading british think tank , the overseas development institute -lrb- odi -rrb- . the german development institute / deutsches institut für entwicklungspolitik -lrb- die -rrb- is one of the leading think tanks for development policy world-wide .

there is no isle of the blessed in a global financial and economic crisis , neither in europe nor in africa nor anywhere else .
the global climate is changing , and our way of life is going to have to change .
this goes not only for the us or china , the new global polluter , but also for europe , and especially for it – as well as for africa , which has contributed as good as nothing to climate change .
in short : we have an enlightened self-interest in global development .
eu should offer global leadership the tenor of the eu memorandum 's authors : if europe is to continue to be taken seriously as a global actor on its own merits , both european and national leaders need to address five central points : bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu should take on a more a more prominent role in development policy first , development policy needs to be seen as an element of approaches to global problem-solving – which means that it needs to become one of the central areas of european foreign policy .
here europe must offer global leadership .
the world trade talks are set to continue in geneva this year .
in september the united nations will be hosting a summit on the state of the un millennium development goals -lrb- mdgs -rrb- .
in june canada is to host the g8 / g20 for a conference on the financial crisis .
in addition , the climate talks will be returning to bonn in june .
how far will europe 's voice carry in these concerts ?
effectiveness of development aid impacts on european credibility the second point concerns commitments on the volume and effectiveness of global development assistance .
this is a matter of europe 's own credibility .
not enough that the donors operating in africa often trip over one another for lack of coordination , the eu countries are currently offering 20 billion euros less in aid than they had originally pledged .
and there are fears that commitments on climate protection finance could come at the expense of other fields , with europe , in effect , pursuing a zero-sum policy – taking , as it were , funds from its right pocket and putting them into its left .
coordinating different fields third , development assistance must not be allowed simply to make up for what european policy has taken away elsewhere .
trade , climate protection , and immigration policy are key fields that need to be coordinated with the objectives of development policy .
this is a permanent task for which there can and will be no quick fixes .
investing in international partnerships bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sven grimm , researcher with bonn-based think-tank die fourth , it is essential to invest in global partnerships .
these are investments in a shared future .
partners need to be able act on equal terms – in order then to seek , on an equal footing , solutions to common problems .
in view of the fact that reforms of the bretton woods institutions are on the immediate agenda , the international decisions that need to be taken in the near future will put europe to the test .
international power shifts are already becoming evident .
measured in terms of its economic power , which is declining in relation to asia , europe is overrepresented in imf and world bank .
when it comes to international bodies , europe often seems to confuse quantity with quality , and having a large number of representatives in the g20 or the imf does not necessarily mean more influence if efforts to coordinate such steps have not been successfully coordinated in advance .
only as a chorus will europe prove able to make its voice heard .
potential role of eu foreign service and finally , fifth , the memorandum points to the potentials of the new european foreign service .
its mix of personnel drawn from member states and eu institutions may be seen as an opportunity .
at present , though , there are more questions than answers concerning this matter .
agreements – including the reform-oriented lisbon treaty – will be doomed to lead a life on paper unless europe 's responsible institutions and leaders prove able to improve their cooperation .
in other words , the question is : does europe now need to opt for more centralization ?
this is , in fact , not a realistic option , as the protracted wrangling in recent years over eu reforms has shown .
taking lisbon treaty as framework to improve policies the treaty of lisbon is certainly not the big bang for european global power .
but it does provide a good framework for improved coordination .
it is essential that efforts to improve the eu 's division of labor actually bear fruit if europe 's diversity is to be orchestrated to form a good chorus .
otherwise europe 's voice is likely to turn out to be little more than world-political background noise .
but one thing that can be said with certainty is that for the european countries global acoustics would be far worse in a world dominated by the big two .

the eu should take on more prominent role in the area , argue this week 's commenators sven grimm and simon maxwell . while the new eu commission in the process of constitution , the european think-tanks group has presented a memorandum entitled " new challenges , new beginnings – next steps in european development cooperation " . the group comprises the think tanks die -lrb- germany -rrb- , odi -lrb- uk -rrb- , fride -lrb- spain -rrb- , and the european centre for development policy management ecdpm .
the memorandum analyses both current european policy and emerging challenges in climate change , migration , trade policy as well as the coherence of and division of labor in development policy .
eu should become more prominent actor in development field based on this analysis , the think-tanks group has formulated a number of recommendations for national and european decision-makers .
europe has still not succeeded in carving out a place for itself as a player in the world of the ' big two ' - the us and china .

if we viewed the european union 's external relations as a chorus , what we would see is a group of inveterate soloists seeking to prepare a new piece without a conductor .
in adopting the treaty of lisbon the eu might be said to have struggled though one page of the score .
this deserves praise .
but at a point of time where the dilapidated state of the global concert hall is becoming only all too evident , the real concern is : at present the substance and emphases of world politics are shifting towards the pacific .

it is essential that efforts to improve the eu 's division of labor actually bear fruit if europe 's diversity is to be orchestrated to form a good chorus .

the eu should take on more prominent role in the area , argue this week 's commenators sven grimm and simon maxwell . while the new eu commission in the process of constitution , the european think-tanks group has presented a memorandum entitled " new challenges , new beginnings – next steps in european development cooperation " . the group comprises the think tanks die -lrb- germany -rrb- , odi -lrb- uk -rrb- , fride -lrb- spain -rrb- , and the european centre for development policy management ecdpm .
the memorandum analyses both current european policy and emerging challenges in climate change , migration , trade policy as well as the coherence of and division of labor in development policy .
eu should become more prominent actor in development field based on this analysis , the think-tanks group has formulated a number of recommendations for national and european decision-makers .
europe has still not succeeded in carving out a place for itself as a player in the world of the ' big two ' - the us and china .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : activists were disappointed with the lack of results at the copenhagen climate talks this became evident not least at the failed climate negotiations in copenhagen , where , when it came to the pivotal rounds of the talks , the us and china constituted more or less a group of their own .
if we viewed the european union 's external relations as a chorus , what we would see is a group of inveterate soloists seeking to prepare a new piece without a conductor .
in adopting the treaty of lisbon the eu might be said to have struggled though one page of the score .
this deserves praise .
but at a point of time where the dilapidated state of the global concert hall is becoming only all too evident , the real concern is : at present the substance and emphases of world politics are shifting towards the pacific .
europe depends on international decisions while europe is a globally networked region , it does have a marked atlantic orientation .
peace and prosperity in europe are dependent in crucial ways on whether or not the decisions taken in international bodies are of a long-term nature .
one consequence of this is that the distinction between domestic and foreign policy is growing increasingly blurred .
there is no isle of the blessed in a global financial and economic crisis , neither in europe nor in africa nor anywhere else .
the global climate is changing , and our way of life is going to have to change .
this goes not only for the us or china , the new global polluter , but also for europe , and especially for it – as well as for africa , which has contributed as good as nothing to climate change .
in short : we have an enlightened self-interest in global development .
eu should offer global leadership the tenor of the eu memorandum 's authors : if europe is to continue to be taken seriously as a global actor on its own merits , both european and national leaders need to address five central points : bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu should take on a more a more prominent role in development policy first , development policy needs to be seen as an element of approaches to global problem-solving – which means that it needs to become one of the central areas of european foreign policy .
here europe must offer global leadership .
the world trade talks are set to continue in geneva this year .
in september the united nations will be hosting a summit on the state of the un millennium development goals -lrb- mdgs -rrb- .
in june canada is to host the g8 / g20 for a conference on the financial crisis .
in addition , the climate talks will be returning to bonn in june .
how far will europe 's voice carry in these concerts ?
effectiveness of development aid impacts on european credibility the second point concerns commitments on the volume and effectiveness of global development assistance .
this is a matter of europe 's own credibility .
not enough that the donors operating in africa often trip over one another for lack of coordination , the eu countries are currently offering 20 billion euros less in aid than they had originally pledged .
and there are fears that commitments on climate protection finance could come at the expense of other fields , with europe , in effect , pursuing a zero-sum policy – taking , as it were , funds from its right pocket and putting them into its left .
coordinating different fields third , development assistance must not be allowed simply to make up for what european policy has taken away elsewhere .
trade , climate protection , and immigration policy are key fields that need to be coordinated with the objectives of development policy .
this is a permanent task for which there can and will be no quick fixes .
investing in international partnerships bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sven grimm , researcher with bonn-based think-tank die fourth , it is essential to invest in global partnerships .
these are investments in a shared future .
partners need to be able act on equal terms – in order then to seek , on an equal footing , solutions to common problems .
in view of the fact that reforms of the bretton woods institutions are on the immediate agenda , the international decisions that need to be taken in the near future will put europe to the test .
international power shifts are already becoming evident .
measured in terms of its economic power , which is declining in relation to asia , europe is overrepresented in imf and world bank .
when it comes to international bodies , europe often seems to confuse quantity with quality , and having a large number of representatives in the g20 or the imf does not necessarily mean more influence if efforts to coordinate such steps have not been successfully coordinated in advance .
only as a chorus will europe prove able to make its voice heard .
potential role of eu foreign service and finally , fifth , the memorandum points to the potentials of the new european foreign service .
its mix of personnel drawn from member states and eu institutions may be seen as an opportunity .
at present , though , there are more questions than answers concerning this matter .
agreements – including the reform-oriented lisbon treaty – will be doomed to lead a life on paper unless europe 's responsible institutions and leaders prove able to improve their cooperation .
in other words , the question is : does europe now need to opt for more centralization ?
this is , in fact , not a realistic option , as the protracted wrangling in recent years over eu reforms has shown .
taking lisbon treaty as framework to improve policies the treaty of lisbon is certainly not the big bang for european global power .
but it does provide a good framework for improved coordination .
it is essential that efforts to improve the eu 's division of labor actually bear fruit if europe 's diversity is to be orchestrated to form a good chorus .

the draft law , which both the german parliament and chancellor angela merkel 's cabinet are to consider in the coming weeks , would cut state-guaranteed prices by 15 percent for energy produced by solar panels on open ground .
it would also cut prices by 16 percent for solar panels on roofs , where 80 percent of solar panels in germany are , and eliminate subsidies for panels placed on arable land .
a previous plan by environment minister norbert roettgen was criticized for not going far enough .
" there must be no more panels installed on arable land , " said peter altmaier , a member of merkel 's christian democrat union -lrb- cdu -rrb- who follows the solar energy sector .
" the objective is to reduce excessive stimulation without hindering an expansion of green energy . "
unintended consequences experts have criticized solar energy subsidies in germany for failing to spur competition in the industry , which accounts for less than one percent of all german electricity production .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : environmental groups have called the law a betrayal of renewable energy the subsidies have also had several unintended consequences : farmers have installed solar panels on their arable fields ; also , the global market has greatly increased , helping manufacturers in china , where labor is cheaper .
germany remains the world leader in solar panel production , but manufacturers have lost billions of euros in recent years and have been forced to cut and outsource jobs .
german group q-cells grew significantly until posting a 1.36-billion euro -lrb- $ 1.84 billion -rrb- net loss in 2009 .
support and opposition the reduction would save german consumers some of the one billion euros they pay per month in fees that underwrite solar energy production , according to hans-peter friedrich , a leader in the cdu 's bavarian sister party , the christian social union .
the law is supported by farmers resentful of investors who bought up arable land only to " harvest the sunshine . "
but the solar panel manufacturing lobby staunchly opposes the cutbacks , and some companies gave employees the day off to protest the law in berlin .
environmental groups also criticized the government , calling the law a betrayal of renewable energy. acb / apn / dpa / afp / reuters editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de germany 's solar industry worried about future in wake of subsidy cuts stocks in solar technology companies fell in german trading following news that chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats may press for bigger cuts to solar subsidies than sought by the environment ministry .

despite the boom , what 's considered the most important of all solar technologies still has a long way to reach its true potential .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de africa -pipe- 23.02.2010 corruption stifles learning in africa , report finds großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : corruption is still keeping some african children out of the classroom a new report from anti-corruption organisation transparency international has found that systematic corruption and mismanagement are keeping many african children from a decent education , despite years of reform . when it comes to tackling poverty , poor health or limited opportunities for growth , a good education is widely seen as a magic bullet for developing countries .
indeed , education is considered so crucial that when the united nations released its millennium development goals for 2015 , universal primary education was slated as the number two priority , second only to eradicating extreme poverty and hunger .
but a report released by berlin-based anti-corruption organisation transparency international suggests that endemic corruption in african schooling systems is still seeing large numbers of primary-aged african children denied their right to an education .
" basically all issues around resourcing had a dimension of corruption , with resources being exploited or embezzled by someone for private gain , but sometimes also just plain mismanagement , " said stephane stassen , who co-authored the report .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : giving children an education is crucial in post-war sierra leone the transparency international study " good governance lessons for primary education " was produced as part of the organisation 's africa education watch initiative and examined the impact of corruption on education quality and availability in seven african countries , interviewing over 8500 educators and parents in ghana , madagascar , morocco , niger , senegal , sierra leone and uganda .
change coming too slow to the continent the data collected paints a troubling picture of education in africa : despite two decades of reforms designed to allow greater levels of management at the local level and improve accountability , school administration is still not , for the most part , a genuinely corruption-free and participatory governance system .
" despite all these measures , there were still many governance challenges , " said stephane stassen , who heads transparency international 's africa education watch program .
one of the most striking examples is that of so-called registration fees , which parents from every country surveyed reported paying , although by law primary schooling is free .
the number of parents forced to pay these illegal accounting fees ranged from 9 % in ghana , to 90 % in morocco , the report found .
" similarly , in some countries where they had also abolished exam fees , they were still being charged , " said stassen .
he added that in many countries , textbooks were often not available .
and even if they were dispatched to schools , they were often not distributed for free .
the problems were also identified at higher levels , for example when schools receiving grants with which to run themselves were not receiving the full amount , or it was coming with a delay .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most parents can not afford high school fees the average cost of enrolling a primary-aged child in an african school for one year is three euros .
by comparison , the average per capita income in sierra leone is just us $ 260 -lrb- 190 euros -rrb- per year .
the costs charged for " free " textbooks as well as the fees of illegal " compulsory tutoring " - charged by some teachers to supplement their meagre incomes - puts an additional strain on african families .
crucial learning years missed these prohibitively high costs can lead to higher school dropout rates at a crucial time in children 's lives . " primary education is really the place where you get the basics for your life later on .
this is where you learn to read and write , this is where you learn to count , and if , for example if in africa you want to have a chance in trade or to go beyond your village , these are really skills you need to acquire . "
stassen said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : illiteracy among older people is high in many parts of africa he added that without a basic education , it would be nearly impossible to go on to high school or college .
" it 's really hard to get people back to school later on , and this is why we have to get things right now " .
literacy remains low in many parts of africa .
in senegal , for instance , just 43 percent of adults were considered literate in 2007 , compared to 72 percent in madagascar .
despite the obstacles , enrolment figures for primary-aged children in africa are on the increase .
according to 2009 figures from the un , net enrolment in sub-saharan africa went from 58 percent in 2000 to 74 percent in 2007 and from 91 percent to 96 percent over the same period of time in northern africa .
but enrolment figures do not tell the whole story : not only may corrupt practices prevent children from attending school , but they also lower the quality of education for students once they get there .
" even if you are in class , it might mean that you do n't learn much , because you have one textbook for ten learners if not more , " stassen said mismanagement partly to blame in many schools , the report found resources were being wasted or lost , not wilfully , but because those responsible for their management were simply ill-equipped for the job .
overall , 85 percent of schools across all countries had either deficient accounting systems or none at all , and in morocco , just 23 percent of head teachers received training in financial management , despite being responsible for budgets .
in niger that figure drops to just 8 percent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stephane stassen heads transparency international 's africa education watch program " schools where the head teacher had been trained and prepared to do his job in terms of managing the resources of the schools were … the schools where less of these corrupt practices were appearing , " said stassen .
" in a sense , what we found was that head teachers and teachers themselves were really feeling that they had been abandoned by the system . "
a way forward universal schooling for primary-aged children may be untenable by 2015 , but transparency international 's report suggests the reforms that have been made to date are in fact helping african schoolchildren .
the report found that schools that were more frequently audited tended to perform better : education outcomes were better and parents reported paying fewer illegal fees .
training in financial management for head teachers and school management committees could be strengthened , said stassen , to improve accountability .
stassen added that helping african parents to understand more about their rights within the schooling system was a crucial step in increasing engagement and accountability .
" i think that by combining inspections , grassroots accountability and better transparency in the system , you could really have an education system which is more efficient and better-resourced . "

indeed , education is considered so crucial that when the united nations released its millennium development goals for 2015 , universal primary education was slated as the number two priority , second only to eradicating extreme poverty and hunger .
but a report released by berlin-based anti-corruption organisation transparency international suggests that endemic corruption in african schooling systems is still seeing large numbers of primary-aged african children denied their right to an education .
" basically all issues around resourcing had a dimension of corruption , with resources being exploited or embezzled by someone for private gain , but sometimes also just plain mismanagement , " said stephane stassen , who co-authored the report .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : giving children an education is crucial in post-war sierra leone the transparency international study " good governance lessons for primary education " was produced as part of the organisation 's africa education watch initiative and examined the impact of corruption on education quality and availability in seven african countries , interviewing over 8500 educators and parents in ghana , madagascar , morocco , niger , senegal , sierra leone and uganda .
change coming too slow to the continent the data collected paints a troubling picture of education in africa : despite two decades of reforms designed to allow greater levels of management at the local level and improve accountability , school administration is still not , for the most part , a genuinely corruption-free and participatory governance system .
" despite all these measures , there were still many governance challenges , " said stephane stassen , who heads transparency international 's africa education watch program .
one of the most striking examples is that of so-called registration fees , which parents from every country surveyed reported paying , although by law primary schooling is free .
the number of parents forced to pay these illegal accounting fees ranged from 9 % in ghana , to 90 % in morocco , the report found .
" similarly , in some countries where they had also abolished exam fees , they were still being charged , " said stassen .
he added that in many countries , textbooks were often not available .
and even if they were dispatched to schools , they were often not distributed for free .
the problems were also identified at higher levels , for example when schools receiving grants with which to run themselves were not receiving the full amount , or it was coming with a delay .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most parents can not afford high school fees the average cost of enrolling a primary-aged child in an african school for one year is three euros .
by comparison , the average per capita income in sierra leone is just us $ 260 -lrb- 190 euros -rrb- per year .
the costs charged for " free " textbooks as well as the fees of illegal " compulsory tutoring " - charged by some teachers to supplement their meagre incomes - puts an additional strain on african families .
crucial learning years missed these prohibitively high costs can lead to higher school dropout rates at a crucial time in children 's lives . " primary education is really the place where you get the basics for your life later on .
this is where you learn to read and write , this is where you learn to count , and if , for example if in africa you want to have a chance in trade or to go beyond your village , these are really skills you need to acquire . "
stassen said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : illiteracy among older people is high in many parts of africa he added that without a basic education , it would be nearly impossible to go on to high school or college .
" it 's really hard to get people back to school later on , and this is why we have to get things right now " .
literacy remains low in many parts of africa .
in senegal , for instance , just 43 percent of adults were considered literate in 2007 , compared to 72 percent in madagascar .
despite the obstacles , enrolment figures for primary-aged children in africa are on the increase .
according to 2009 figures from the un , net enrolment in sub-saharan africa went from 58 percent in 2000 to 74 percent in 2007 and from 91 percent to 96 percent over the same period of time in northern africa .
but enrolment figures do not tell the whole story : not only may corrupt practices prevent children from attending school , but they also lower the quality of education for students once they get there .
" even if you are in class , it might mean that you do n't learn much , because you have one textbook for ten learners if not more , " stassen said mismanagement partly to blame in many schools , the report found resources were being wasted or lost , not wilfully , but because those responsible for their management were simply ill-equipped for the job .
overall , 85 percent of schools across all countries had either deficient accounting systems or none at all , and in morocco , just 23 percent of head teachers received training in financial management , despite being responsible for budgets .
in niger that figure drops to just 8 percent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stephane stassen heads transparency international 's africa education watch program " schools where the head teacher had been trained and prepared to do his job in terms of managing the resources of the schools were … the schools where less of these corrupt practices were appearing , " said stassen .
" in a sense , what we found was that head teachers and teachers themselves were really feeling that they had been abandoned by the system . "
a way forward universal schooling for primary-aged children may be untenable by 2015 , but transparency international 's report suggests the reforms that have been made to date are in fact helping african schoolchildren .
the report found that schools that were more frequently audited tended to perform better : education outcomes were better and parents reported paying fewer illegal fees .
training in financial management for head teachers and school management committees could be strengthened , said stassen , to improve accountability .
stassen added that helping african parents to understand more about their rights within the schooling system was a crucial step in increasing engagement and accountability .
" i think that by combining inspections , grassroots accountability and better transparency in the system , you could really have an education system which is more efficient and better-resourced . "

indeed , education is considered so crucial that when the united nations released its millennium development goals for 2015 , universal primary education was slated as the number two priority , second only to eradicating extreme poverty and hunger .
but a report released by berlin-based anti-corruption organisation transparency international suggests that endemic corruption in african schooling systems is still seeing large numbers of primary-aged african children denied their right to an education .
" basically all issues around resourcing had a dimension of corruption , with resources being exploited or embezzled by someone for private gain , but sometimes also just plain mismanagement , " said stephane stassen , who co-authored the report .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : giving children an education is crucial in post-war sierra leone the transparency international study " good governance lessons for primary education " was produced as part of the organisation 's africa education watch initiative and examined the impact of corruption on education quality and availability in seven african countries , interviewing over 8500 educators and parents in ghana , madagascar , morocco , niger , senegal , sierra leone and uganda .
change coming too slow to the continent the data collected paints a troubling picture of education in africa : despite two decades of reforms designed to allow greater levels of management at the local level and improve accountability , school administration is still not , for the most part , a genuinely corruption-free and participatory governance system .
" despite all these measures , there were still many governance challenges , " said stephane stassen , who heads transparency international 's africa education watch program .
one of the most striking examples is that of so-called registration fees , which parents from every country surveyed reported paying , although by law primary schooling is free .
the number of parents forced to pay these illegal accounting fees ranged from 9 % in ghana , to 90 % in morocco , the report found .
" similarly , in some countries where they had also abolished exam fees , they were still being charged , " said stassen .
he added that in many countries , textbooks were often not available .
and even if they were dispatched to schools , they were often not distributed for free .
the problems were also identified at higher levels , for example when schools receiving grants with which to run themselves were not receiving the full amount , or it was coming with a delay .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most parents can not afford high school fees the average cost of enrolling a primary-aged child in an african school for one year is three euros .
by comparison , the average per capita income in sierra leone is just us $ 260 -lrb- 190 euros -rrb- per year .
the costs charged for " free " textbooks as well as the fees of illegal " compulsory tutoring " - charged by some teachers to supplement their meagre incomes - puts an additional strain on african families .
crucial learning years missed these prohibitively high costs can lead to higher school dropout rates at a crucial time in children 's lives . " primary education is really the place where you get the basics for your life later on .
this is where you learn to read and write , this is where you learn to count , and if , for example if in africa you want to have a chance in trade or to go beyond your village , these are really skills you need to acquire . "
stassen said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : illiteracy among older people is high in many parts of africa he added that without a basic education , it would be nearly impossible to go on to high school or college .
" it 's really hard to get people back to school later on , and this is why we have to get things right now " .
literacy remains low in many parts of africa .
in senegal , for instance , just 43 percent of adults were considered literate in 2007 , compared to 72 percent in madagascar .
despite the obstacles , enrolment figures for primary-aged children in africa are on the increase .
according to 2009 figures from the un , net enrolment in sub-saharan africa went from 58 percent in 2000 to 74 percent in 2007 and from 91 percent to 96 percent over the same period of time in northern africa .
but enrolment figures do not tell the whole story : not only may corrupt practices prevent children from attending school , but they also lower the quality of education for students once they get there .
" even if you are in class , it might mean that you do n't learn much , because you have one textbook for ten learners if not more , " stassen said mismanagement partly to blame in many schools , the report found resources were being wasted or lost , not wilfully , but because those responsible for their management were simply ill-equipped for the job .
overall , 85 percent of schools across all countries had either deficient accounting systems or none at all , and in morocco , just 23 percent of head teachers received training in financial management , despite being responsible for budgets .
in niger that figure drops to just 8 percent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stephane stassen heads transparency international 's africa education watch program " schools where the head teacher had been trained and prepared to do his job in terms of managing the resources of the schools were … the schools where less of these corrupt practices were appearing , " said stassen .
" in a sense , what we found was that head teachers and teachers themselves were really feeling that they had been abandoned by the system . "
a way forward universal schooling for primary-aged children may be untenable by 2015 , but transparency international 's report suggests the reforms that have been made to date are in fact helping african schoolchildren .
the report found that schools that were more frequently audited tended to perform better : education outcomes were better and parents reported paying fewer illegal fees .
training in financial management for head teachers and school management committees could be strengthened , said stassen , to improve accountability .
stassen added that helping african parents to understand more about their rights within the schooling system was a crucial step in increasing engagement and accountability .
" i think that by combining inspections , grassroots accountability and better transparency in the system , you could really have an education system which is more efficient and better-resourced . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de internet -pipe- 23.02.2010 german child pornography law hits snags großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german government wants to curb internet freedom to fight child pornography germany has enacted a law aimed at curbing child pornography on the internet .
but in the face of criticism and protests , the law wo n't be enforced , says the government . a new law to curb child pornography has come into force in germany , but , in a legal curiosity , it is not going to be used by the courts .
the salient point is that instead of blocking child porn websites , the government now thinks it would better to erase them . the controversial legislation was drafted in 2009 by the former conservative family minister , ursula von der leyen , who said that she was willing to act against " a massive spread of child pornography on the internet .

but in the face of criticism and protests , the law wo n't be enforced , says the government . a new law to curb child pornography has come into force in germany , but , in a legal curiosity , it is not going to be used by the courts .
the salient point is that instead of blocking child porn websites , the government now thinks it would better to erase them . the controversial legislation was drafted in 2009 by the former conservative family minister , ursula von der leyen , who said that she was willing to act against " a massive spread of child pornography on the internet .

the german law also does n't extend to providers based abroad . christian bahls from the organisation " abuse victims against internet access blocking " accused the government of pursuing " a policy of symbolism , " which he described as " a slap in the face of the victims of child pornography .

" hoffman-riem pointed out that police in the 16 german federal states were in charge of crime fighting and investigating criminal content on the internet , and that the law infringed upon their duties . in the face of so much criticism , the government has decided to amend the law in the course of the next few months . the new legislation , the government said , would then allow providers to erase child pornography websites . author : uwe hessler editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but it is unlikely to trigger a domino effect among other countries who have troops there . by the sheer number of troops , the dutch deployment does n't rank among top international contingents in afghanistan .
however , its force of 1,800 soldiers has not only been in charge of the uruzgan province in the dangerous southern part of the country , but has generally been seen as doing an excellent job there .
so the planned dutch pullout from afghanistan as a consequence of the governmen crisis in the hague will clearly have repercussions for nato 's military mission in the country at a time when most allies are already under pressure to justify their engagement at home .
this has already led to worries about a possible domino effect in the sense that other countries might also feel forced to reconsider their committments to afghanistan .
" it 's true that the afghanistan mission is very unpopular in many european countries , so it is definitely a cause for concern if the dutch withdraw on account of the collapsed government , " eva gross , who heads the eu foreign and security policy program at the institute for european studies at vrije universiteit brussel in belgium , told deutsche welle .
" but to speak of a domino effect may be overstating the case . "
each country in europe has its own dynamics and traditions , therefore gross does n't believe an automatic discussion about troop withdrawals in other eu states is likely .
german troop increase will go ahead for germany , where a parliamentary vote on the expansion of berlin 's afghan mission is scheduled for later this week , the dutch decision wo n't have an immediate effect either , argue experts .
public opinion in germany ca n't be swayed much by the dutch political crisis because a solid majority of germans is already against the military engagement in afghanistan , says klaus-peter schoeppner , head of tns emnid , a major german polling and reseach firm .
while germans are very skeptical about the afghan misson , schoeppner thinks that most of them can live with the exit scenario envisaged by the government .
" so , i do n't think that this topic will gain much traction in germany , " he told deutsche welle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany plans to send up to 850 additional troops to afghanistan what 's more , adds schoeppner , germans do n't view the mission in afghanistan as predominantly a military one .
" we regard ourselves as the number one humanitarian nation , " said schoeppner .
a fast withdrawal from afghanistan would not only end germany 's military , but also its humanitarian responsibilities .
currently there is no indication that this is a likely option for the government , he added .
" i am fairly confindent that the increase of troops will go through in parliament , mainly because the political elites have been in favor of a continuation of the mandate , " said gross .
exit strategies while the dutch withdrawal will not have any imminent effect on the committments of other allies , it will further increase the debate in many countries about timetables and exit strategies .
" we have seen this in discussions already in germany , britain or the united states that the focus is now already much more on finding ways of withdrawing their troops from afghanistan , " said gross .
that could make it hard for nato to find a replacement for dutch troops , if the new government in the hague does in fact decide to withdraw its soldiers .
australia already publicly dismissed a possible leadership role in uruzgan province and canada has said it wants to pull out its troops at the end of next year .
germany , which is currently in charge of the regional command in the north of afghanistan , has repeatedly rejected a german engagement in the south and is unlikely to change that position .
" i think it would be difficult for us to do more in afghanistan , because others leave , " said schoeppner .
if no other countries are willing to take over the dutch role in the south , the us might ultimately be forced to fulfill that task itself .
as an alternative , american officials have aired a possible role for non-nato troops in afghanistan .
but whether such an expansion of the afghan mission is realistic and how it could work is still unclear .
explaining the mission at least for now then , the political turmoil over the future of dutch troops in afghanistan will merely increase the pressure on nato planners to sketch out possible scenarios for a dutch withdrawal and not lead to a domino effect in other countries .
however , argue experts , since public sentiment is already very pessimistic about the afghan mission , military events on the ground can always have a major impact on public opinion .
bildunterschrift : politicians must better explain the rationale behind the afghan mission , say experts " in most countries a a rather large attack with loss of life would probably push the public to reject military engagement , " said gross .
since that is always possible , governments can only do one thing : " they have to communicate the reasons why we are in afghanistan much better and much more carefully .
i think the dutch withdrawal and the collapse of the government definitely highlights that the european public is unconvinced of the value of the afghan mission and that european politicians have some explaining to do , " she said .

but it is unlikely to trigger a domino effect among other countries who have troops there . by the sheer number of troops , the dutch deployment does n't rank among top international contingents in afghanistan .
however , its force of 1,800 soldiers has not only been in charge of the uruzgan province in the dangerous southern part of the country , but has generally been seen as doing an excellent job there .
so the planned dutch pullout from afghanistan as a consequence of the governmen crisis in the hague will clearly have repercussions for nato 's military mission in the country at a time when most allies are already under pressure to justify their engagement at home .
this has already led to worries about a possible domino effect in the sense that other countries might also feel forced to reconsider their committments to afghanistan .
" it 's true that the afghanistan mission is very unpopular in many european countries , so it is definitely a cause for concern if the dutch withdraw on account of the collapsed government , " eva gross , who heads the eu foreign and security policy program at the institute for european studies at vrije universiteit brussel in belgium , told deutsche welle .
" but to speak of a domino effect may be overstating the case . "
each country in europe has its own dynamics and traditions , therefore gross does n't believe an automatic discussion about troop withdrawals in other eu states is likely .
german troop increase will go ahead for germany , where a parliamentary vote on the expansion of berlin 's afghan mission is scheduled for later this week , the dutch decision wo n't have an immediate effect either , argue experts .
public opinion in germany ca n't be swayed much by the dutch political crisis because a solid majority of germans is already against the military engagement in afghanistan , says klaus-peter schoeppner , head of tns emnid , a major german polling and reseach firm .
while germans are very skeptical about the afghan misson , schoeppner thinks that most of them can live with the exit scenario envisaged by the government .
" so , i do n't think that this topic will gain much traction in germany , " he told deutsche welle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany plans to send up to 850 additional troops to afghanistan what 's more , adds schoeppner , germans do n't view the mission in afghanistan as predominantly a military one .
" we regard ourselves as the number one humanitarian nation , " said schoeppner .
a fast withdrawal from afghanistan would not only end germany 's military , but also its humanitarian responsibilities .
currently there is no indication that this is a likely option for the government , he added .
" i am fairly confindent that the increase of troops will go through in parliament , mainly because the political elites have been in favor of a continuation of the mandate , " said gross .
exit strategies while the dutch withdrawal will not have any imminent effect on the committments of other allies , it will further increase the debate in many countries about timetables and exit strategies .
" we have seen this in discussions already in germany , britain or the united states that the focus is now already much more on finding ways of withdrawing their troops from afghanistan , " said gross .
that could make it hard for nato to find a replacement for dutch troops , if the new government in the hague does in fact decide to withdraw its soldiers .
australia already publicly dismissed a possible leadership role in uruzgan province and canada has said it wants to pull out its troops at the end of next year .
germany , which is currently in charge of the regional command in the north of afghanistan , has repeatedly rejected a german engagement in the south and is unlikely to change that position .
" i think it would be difficult for us to do more in afghanistan , because others leave , " said schoeppner .
if no other countries are willing to take over the dutch role in the south , the us might ultimately be forced to fulfill that task itself .
as an alternative , american officials have aired a possible role for non-nato troops in afghanistan .

a fast withdrawal from afghanistan would not only end germany 's military , but also its humanitarian responsibilities .
currently there is no indication that this is a likely option for the government , he added .
" i am fairly confindent that the increase of troops will go through in parliament , mainly because the political elites have been in favor of a continuation of the mandate , " said gross .
exit strategies while the dutch withdrawal will not have any imminent effect on the committments of other allies , it will further increase the debate in many countries about timetables and exit strategies .
" we have seen this in discussions already in germany , britain or the united states that the focus is now already much more on finding ways of withdrawing their troops from afghanistan , " said gross .
that could make it hard for nato to find a replacement for dutch troops , if the new government in the hague does in fact decide to withdraw its soldiers .
australia already publicly dismissed a possible leadership role in uruzgan province and canada has said it wants to pull out its troops at the end of next year .
germany , which is currently in charge of the regional command in the north of afghanistan , has repeatedly rejected a german engagement in the south and is unlikely to change that position .

explaining the mission at least for now then , the political turmoil over the future of dutch troops in afghanistan will merely increase the pressure on nato planners to sketch out possible scenarios for a dutch withdrawal and not lead to a domino effect in other countries .

bildunterschrift : politicians must better explain the rationale behind the afghan mission , say experts " in most countries a a rather large attack with loss of life would probably push the public to reject military engagement , " said gross .
since that is always possible , governments can only do one thing : " they have to communicate the reasons why we are in afghanistan much better and much more carefully .

but it is unlikely to trigger a domino effect among other countries who have troops there . by the sheer number of troops , the dutch deployment does n't rank among top international contingents in afghanistan .
however , its force of 1,800 soldiers has not only been in charge of the uruzgan province in the dangerous southern part of the country , but has generally been seen as doing an excellent job there .
so the planned dutch pullout from afghanistan as a consequence of the governmen crisis in the hague will clearly have repercussions for nato 's military mission in the country at a time when most allies are already under pressure to justify their engagement at home .
this has already led to worries about a possible domino effect in the sense that other countries might also feel forced to reconsider their committments to afghanistan .
" it 's true that the afghanistan mission is very unpopular in many european countries , so it is definitely a cause for concern if the dutch withdraw on account of the collapsed government , " eva gross , who heads the eu foreign and security policy program at the institute for european studies at vrije universiteit brussel in belgium , told deutsche welle .
" but to speak of a domino effect may be overstating the case . "
each country in europe has its own dynamics and traditions , therefore gross does n't believe an automatic discussion about troop withdrawals in other eu states is likely .
german troop increase will go ahead for germany , where a parliamentary vote on the expansion of berlin 's afghan mission is scheduled for later this week , the dutch decision wo n't have an immediate effect either , argue experts .
public opinion in germany ca n't be swayed much by the dutch political crisis because a solid majority of germans is already against the military engagement in afghanistan , says klaus-peter schoeppner , head of tns emnid , a major german polling and reseach firm .

yet berlin insists there are concerns that the technology could breach privacy laws . google , which wants to extend its street view panoramic photos to germany later this year , has rejected strong privacy objections raised by the german government .
consumer affairs minister ilse aigner is demanding that the internet giant only displays its imagery after each affected german citizen has given his or her permission .
minister aigner said her staff were consulting with justice ministry officials , with the aim of tightening legislation .
she also demanded that google be ready to make people 's faces , car and house numbers , and even facades unrecognizable .
" a vague picture pixel change is not sufficient , " she said in berlin .
" i do not share the company 's assessment that all personal data concerns have been resolved . "
her ministry , she said , had been flooded with calls by citizens worried about protecting their privacy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a stroll in the internet , but is data privacy safeguarded ?
the head of google 's legal department , arnd haller said " we take personal data privacy very seriously .
we 've been discussing privacy issues all over europe , but here in germany the intensity of the questions is really impressive . "
a consultant hired by google , nikolas forgo , who is a hanover professor on informatics law , said a violation of personal rights was improbable .
google has already pledged to disguise car number plates and peoples ' faces .
berlin says google needs individual permission aigner had recently accused google 's service of being on the verge of violating the privacy of millions of citizens , each individually .
she demanded that google seek the permission from each person photographed on streets prior to publication .
street view photos are taken by camera cars which can capture all-round 360-degrees images .
these enable google users to simulate a stroll while sitting at their computers .
google has been gathering images of streets and public spaces in germany since 2008 .
the online service began in 2007 in four cities in the united states .
australia and japan soon followed .
in total google has initiated similar imaging projects in 19 countries , including many in europe .
satellites help pinpoint the panoramic scenes on maps using geo-data systems .
in a special exception for germany , haller said individuals would be able to file an objection with google to seek the removal of recognizable features .
" we 've a web site on-line with the relevant names and places where google street views are taken .
we also allow users to opt out in advance . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : street view is already available in several european countries " an immersive experience " google software developer raphael leiteritz said he believed street view was worth fighting for : " cards and maps have been two-dimensional for many years .
street view for the first time gives you an immersive experience .
you do n't look on a city from the top .
you can visit it and you can look around . "
that does not impress aigner .
she is demanding that google 's panoramic cameras be mounted no higher than 1.8 meters – instead of the current 2.5 meters on camera cars – so that views over fences and walls into residents ' gardens and courtyards are blocked .
other data privacy advocates also point out that potential burglars can use such internet imagery to recognize and target properties .
aigner told german public radio that google must act " definitively " on objections lodged by citizens , even to the point of making a building unrecognizable .
her ministry , she added , had placed a standardized complaint form on its website. ipj / apn / dpa / afp editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

yet berlin insists there are concerns that the technology could breach privacy laws . google , which wants to extend its street view panoramic photos to germany later this year , has rejected strong privacy objections raised by the german government .
consumer affairs minister ilse aigner is demanding that the internet giant only displays its imagery after each affected german citizen has given his or her permission .
minister aigner said her staff were consulting with justice ministry officials , with the aim of tightening legislation .
she also demanded that google be ready to make people 's faces , car and house numbers , and even facades unrecognizable .
" a vague picture pixel change is not sufficient , " she said in berlin .
" i do not share the company 's assessment that all personal data concerns have been resolved . "
her ministry , she said , had been flooded with calls by citizens worried about protecting their privacy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a stroll in the internet , but is data privacy safeguarded ?
the head of google 's legal department , arnd haller said " we take personal data privacy very seriously .
we 've been discussing privacy issues all over europe , but here in germany the intensity of the questions is really impressive . "
a consultant hired by google , nikolas forgo , who is a hanover professor on informatics law , said a violation of personal rights was improbable .
google has already pledged to disguise car number plates and peoples ' faces .
berlin says google needs individual permission aigner had recently accused google 's service of being on the verge of violating the privacy of millions of citizens , each individually .
she demanded that google seek the permission from each person photographed on streets prior to publication .
street view photos are taken by camera cars which can capture all-round 360-degrees images .
these enable google users to simulate a stroll while sitting at their computers .
google has been gathering images of streets and public spaces in germany since 2008 .
the online service began in 2007 in four cities in the united states .
australia and japan soon followed .
in total google has initiated similar imaging projects in 19 countries , including many in europe .
satellites help pinpoint the panoramic scenes on maps using geo-data systems .
in a special exception for germany , haller said individuals would be able to file an objection with google to seek the removal of recognizable features .
" we 've a web site on-line with the relevant names and places where google street views are taken .
we also allow users to opt out in advance . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : street view is already available in several european countries " an immersive experience " google software developer raphael leiteritz said he believed street view was worth fighting for : " cards and maps have been two-dimensional for many years .
street view for the first time gives you an immersive experience .
you do n't look on a city from the top .
you can visit it and you can look around . "
that does not impress aigner .
she is demanding that google 's panoramic cameras be mounted no higher than 1.8 meters – instead of the current 2.5 meters on camera cars – so that views over fences and walls into residents ' gardens and courtyards are blocked .
other data privacy advocates also point out that potential burglars can use such internet imagery to recognize and target properties .
aigner told german public radio that google must act " definitively " on objections lodged by citizens , even to the point of making a building unrecognizable .

the draft law , which both the german parliament and chancellor angela merkel 's cabinet are to consider in the coming weeks , would cut state-guaranteed prices by 15 percent for energy produced by solar panels on open ground .
it would also cut prices by 16 percent for solar panels on roofs , where 80 percent of solar panels in germany are , and eliminate subsidies for panels placed on arable land .
a previous plan by environment minister norbert roettgen was criticized for not going far enough .
" there must be no more panels installed on arable land , " said peter altmaier , a member of merkel 's christian democrat union -lrb- cdu -rrb- who follows the solar energy sector .
" the objective is to reduce excessive stimulation without hindering an expansion of green energy . "

germany remains the world leader in solar panel production , but manufacturers have lost billions of euros in recent years and have been forced to cut and outsource jobs .
german group q-cells grew significantly until posting a 1.36-billion euro -lrb- $ 1.84 billion -rrb- net loss in 2009 .
support and opposition the reduction would save german consumers some of the one billion euros they pay per month in fees that underwrite solar energy production , according to hans-peter friedrich , a leader in the cdu 's bavarian sister party , the christian social union .
the law is supported by farmers resentful of investors who bought up arable land only to " harvest the sunshine . "
but the solar panel manufacturing lobby staunchly opposes the cutbacks , and some companies gave employees the day off to protest the law in berlin .

the draft law , which both the german parliament and chancellor angela merkel 's cabinet are to consider in the coming weeks , would cut state-guaranteed prices by 15 percent for energy produced by solar panels on open ground .
it would also cut prices by 16 percent for solar panels on roofs , where 80 percent of solar panels in germany are , and eliminate subsidies for panels placed on arable land .
a previous plan by environment minister norbert roettgen was criticized for not going far enough .
" there must be no more panels installed on arable land , " said peter altmaier , a member of merkel 's christian democrat union -lrb- cdu -rrb- who follows the solar energy sector .

support and opposition the reduction would save german consumers some of the one billion euros they pay per month in fees that underwrite solar energy production , according to hans-peter friedrich , a leader in the cdu 's bavarian sister party , the christian social union .
the law is supported by farmers resentful of investors who bought up arable land only to " harvest the sunshine . "

soldiers tell of rituals with names like " fire dance " and the " jukebox " . germany 's parliamentary commissioner for the armed forces , reinhold robbe , said he had received 54 written accounts of abuse and degrading treatment since he submitted a report about hazing in the military .
several of the letters he received from soldiers corroborated previous allegations that mountain infantry troops at a camp in bavaria had been forced to drink alcohol and eat raw pork liver until they threw up .
robbe , a member of the social democratic party , demanded that the training curriculum be changed and said that the " dangerous , tasteless rituals must stop . "
fire dances and jukeboxes the new letters also bring to light other forms of hazing .
one former member of the marines said that new sailors were often subjected to harsh rituals during their first nights at sea .
he described the " fire dance , " in which a man was forced to strip off his pants and have a lighted wick placed in his anus ; another in which a floor polishing machine with rough bristles was held against a recruit 's naked bottom until the skin turned red .
a volunteer soldier stationed in southern germany between 1996 and 1998 told of soldiers being forced to play " jukebox , " during which they were shut into a locker , which was then stood upside down , and the occupant forced to sing certain songs .
defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg renewed his promise of a complete investigation .
he did not rule out the possibility of disciplinary action for those involved , although he warned against making an across-the-board judgment .

soldiers tell of rituals with names like " fire dance " and the " jukebox " . germany 's parliamentary commissioner for the armed forces , reinhold robbe , said he had received 54 written accounts of abuse and degrading treatment since he submitted a report about hazing in the military .
several of the letters he received from soldiers corroborated previous allegations that mountain infantry troops at a camp in bavaria had been forced to drink alcohol and eat raw pork liver until they threw up .
robbe , a member of the social democratic party , demanded that the training curriculum be changed and said that the " dangerous , tasteless rituals must stop . "
fire dances and jukeboxes the new letters also bring to light other forms of hazing .
one former member of the marines said that new sailors were often subjected to harsh rituals during their first nights at sea .
he described the " fire dance , " in which a man was forced to strip off his pants and have a lighted wick placed in his anus ; another in which a floor polishing machine with rough bristles was held against a recruit 's naked bottom until the skin turned red .
a volunteer soldier stationed in southern germany between 1996 and 1998 told of soldiers being forced to play " jukebox , " during which they were shut into a locker , which was then stood upside down , and the occupant forced to sing certain songs .
defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg renewed his promise of a complete investigation .
he did not rule out the possibility of disciplinary action for those involved , although he warned against making an across-the-board judgment .

the two clubs now await a second duel in spain in march . stuttgart made the most of the capacity home crowd at mercedes-benz arena , starting the match energetically and taking it to barcelona .
the early initiative paid dividends when brazilian forward cacau headed in a perfect timo gebhart center ball from the right on the 25-minute mark .
the germans continued to press barcelona 's defense and came close to snatching goals on three more occasions , in addition to an appeal for handball by barca defender gerard pique .
at the outset of the second half , barcelona came out a different team and pulled level within seven minutes through frontman zlatan ibrahimovic .
the opportunity came when stuttgart failed to clear a corner and the ball came back in for pique , who headed down for ibrahimovic to volley home .
the initial shot was parried by stuttgart keeper jens lehmann , but ibrahimovic was able to knock the rebound over the goal line .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cacau 's goal came midway through the first half the catalans dominated the remainder of the clash , a fact stuttgart coach christian gross seized upon .
" we should have scored a second goal in the first half , " gross said following the match .
" we had clear chances . "
barcelona midfielder andreas iniesta was upbeat about the result , saying he was confident the ball was now in barcelona 's court .
" we knew that it was going to be a difficult game , " said the spain international .
" and the truth is that they really made us suffer in the first half .
" now we have the tie in our favor , but there are still 90 minutes left to play . "

the two clubs now await a second duel in spain in march . stuttgart made the most of the capacity home crowd at mercedes-benz arena , starting the match energetically and taking it to barcelona .
the early initiative paid dividends when brazilian forward cacau headed in a perfect timo gebhart center ball from the right on the 25-minute mark .
the germans continued to press barcelona 's defense and came close to snatching goals on three more occasions , in addition to an appeal for handball by barca defender gerard pique .
at the outset of the second half , barcelona came out a different team and pulled level within seven minutes through frontman zlatan ibrahimovic .
the opportunity came when stuttgart failed to clear a corner and the ball came back in for pique , who headed down for ibrahimovic to volley home .
the initial shot was parried by stuttgart keeper jens lehmann , but ibrahimovic was able to knock the rebound over the goal line .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cacau 's goal came midway through the first half the catalans dominated the remainder of the clash , a fact stuttgart coach christian gross seized upon .
" we should have scored a second goal in the first half , " gross said following the match .
" we had clear chances . "
barcelona midfielder andreas iniesta was upbeat about the result , saying he was confident the ball was now in barcelona 's court .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de development policy -pipe- 23.02.2010 european think-tanks call for new beginning in eu development policy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : simon maxwell is an economist with odi , london leading european think-tanks propose new approaches in development policy to cope with future challenges .
the eu should take on more prominent role in the area , argue this week 's commenators sven grimm and simon maxwell . while the new eu commission in the process of constitution , the european think-tanks group has presented a memorandum entitled " new challenges , new beginnings – next steps in european development cooperation " . the group comprises the think tanks die -lrb- germany -rrb- , odi -lrb- uk -rrb- , fride -lrb- spain -rrb- , and the european centre for development policy management ecdpm .
the memorandum analyses both current european policy and emerging challenges in climate change , migration , trade policy as well as the coherence of and division of labor in development policy .
eu should become more prominent actor in development field based on this analysis , the think-tanks group has formulated a number of recommendations for national and european decision-makers .
europe has still not succeeded in carving out a place for itself as a player in the world of the ' big two ' - the us and china .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : activists were disappointed with the lack of results at the copenhagen climate talks this became evident not least at the failed climate negotiations in copenhagen , where , when it came to the pivotal rounds of the talks , the us and china constituted more or less a group of their own .
if we viewed the european union 's external relations as a chorus , what we would see is a group of inveterate soloists seeking to prepare a new piece without a conductor .
in adopting the treaty of lisbon the eu might be said to have struggled though one page of the score .
this deserves praise .
but at a point of time where the dilapidated state of the global concert hall is becoming only all too evident , the real concern is : at present the substance and emphases of world politics are shifting towards the pacific .
europe depends on international decisions while europe is a globally networked region , it does have a marked atlantic orientation .
peace and prosperity in europe are dependent in crucial ways on whether or not the decisions taken in international bodies are of a long-term nature .
one consequence of this is that the distinction between domestic and foreign policy is growing increasingly blurred .
there is no isle of the blessed in a global financial and economic crisis , neither in europe nor in africa nor anywhere else .
the global climate is changing , and our way of life is going to have to change .
this goes not only for the us or china , the new global polluter , but also for europe , and especially for it – as well as for africa , which has contributed as good as nothing to climate change .
in short : we have an enlightened self-interest in global development .
eu should offer global leadership the tenor of the eu memorandum 's authors : if europe is to continue to be taken seriously as a global actor on its own merits , both european and national leaders need to address five central points : bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu should take on a more a more prominent role in development policy first , development policy needs to be seen as an element of approaches to global problem-solving – which means that it needs to become one of the central areas of european foreign policy .
here europe must offer global leadership .
the world trade talks are set to continue in geneva this year .
in september the united nations will be hosting a summit on the state of the un millennium development goals -lrb- mdgs -rrb- .
in june canada is to host the g8 / g20 for a conference on the financial crisis .
in addition , the climate talks will be returning to bonn in june .
how far will europe 's voice carry in these concerts ?
effectiveness of development aid impacts on european credibility the second point concerns commitments on the volume and effectiveness of global development assistance .
this is a matter of europe 's own credibility .
not enough that the donors operating in africa often trip over one another for lack of coordination , the eu countries are currently offering 20 billion euros less in aid than they had originally pledged .
and there are fears that commitments on climate protection finance could come at the expense of other fields , with europe , in effect , pursuing a zero-sum policy – taking , as it were , funds from its right pocket and putting them into its left .
coordinating different fields third , development assistance must not be allowed simply to make up for what european policy has taken away elsewhere .
trade , climate protection , and immigration policy are key fields that need to be coordinated with the objectives of development policy .
this is a permanent task for which there can and will be no quick fixes .
investing in international partnerships bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sven grimm , researcher with bonn-based think-tank die fourth , it is essential to invest in global partnerships .
these are investments in a shared future .
partners need to be able act on equal terms – in order then to seek , on an equal footing , solutions to common problems .
in view of the fact that reforms of the bretton woods institutions are on the immediate agenda , the international decisions that need to be taken in the near future will put europe to the test .
international power shifts are already becoming evident .
measured in terms of its economic power , which is declining in relation to asia , europe is overrepresented in imf and world bank .
when it comes to international bodies , europe often seems to confuse quantity with quality , and having a large number of representatives in the g20 or the imf does not necessarily mean more influence if efforts to coordinate such steps have not been successfully coordinated in advance .
only as a chorus will europe prove able to make its voice heard .
potential role of eu foreign service and finally , fifth , the memorandum points to the potentials of the new european foreign service .
its mix of personnel drawn from member states and eu institutions may be seen as an opportunity .
at present , though , there are more questions than answers concerning this matter .
agreements – including the reform-oriented lisbon treaty – will be doomed to lead a life on paper unless europe 's responsible institutions and leaders prove able to improve their cooperation .
in other words , the question is : does europe now need to opt for more centralization ?
this is , in fact , not a realistic option , as the protracted wrangling in recent years over eu reforms has shown .
taking lisbon treaty as framework to improve policies the treaty of lisbon is certainly not the big bang for european global power .
but it does provide a good framework for improved coordination .
it is essential that efforts to improve the eu 's division of labor actually bear fruit if europe 's diversity is to be orchestrated to form a good chorus .
otherwise europe 's voice is likely to turn out to be little more than world-political background noise .
but one thing that can be said with certainty is that for the european countries global acoustics would be far worse in a world dominated by the big two . " sven grimm is a researcher at the department bi- and multilateral development cooperation with the german development institute / deutsches institut für entwicklungspolitik -lrb- die -rrb- , a think tank based in bonn . simon maxwell is a senior research associate with leading british think tank , the overseas development institute -lrb- odi -rrb- . the german development institute / deutsches institut für entwicklungspolitik -lrb- die -rrb- is one of the leading think tanks for development policy world-wide .

the eu should take on more prominent role in the area , argue this week 's commenators sven grimm and simon maxwell . while the new eu commission in the process of constitution , the european think-tanks group has presented a memorandum entitled " new challenges , new beginnings – next steps in european development cooperation " . the group comprises the think tanks die -lrb- germany -rrb- , odi -lrb- uk -rrb- , fride -lrb- spain -rrb- , and the european centre for development policy management ecdpm .
the memorandum analyses both current european policy and emerging challenges in climate change , migration , trade policy as well as the coherence of and division of labor in development policy .
eu should become more prominent actor in development field based on this analysis , the think-tanks group has formulated a number of recommendations for national and european decision-makers .
europe has still not succeeded in carving out a place for itself as a player in the world of the ' big two ' - the us and china .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : activists were disappointed with the lack of results at the copenhagen climate talks this became evident not least at the failed climate negotiations in copenhagen , where , when it came to the pivotal rounds of the talks , the us and china constituted more or less a group of their own .
if we viewed the european union 's external relations as a chorus , what we would see is a group of inveterate soloists seeking to prepare a new piece without a conductor .
in adopting the treaty of lisbon the eu might be said to have struggled though one page of the score .
this deserves praise .
but at a point of time where the dilapidated state of the global concert hall is becoming only all too evident , the real concern is : at present the substance and emphases of world politics are shifting towards the pacific .
europe depends on international decisions while europe is a globally networked region , it does have a marked atlantic orientation .
peace and prosperity in europe are dependent in crucial ways on whether or not the decisions taken in international bodies are of a long-term nature .
one consequence of this is that the distinction between domestic and foreign policy is growing increasingly blurred .
there is no isle of the blessed in a global financial and economic crisis , neither in europe nor in africa nor anywhere else .
the global climate is changing , and our way of life is going to have to change .
this goes not only for the us or china , the new global polluter , but also for europe , and especially for it – as well as for africa , which has contributed as good as nothing to climate change .
in short : we have an enlightened self-interest in global development .
eu should offer global leadership the tenor of the eu memorandum 's authors : if europe is to continue to be taken seriously as a global actor on its own merits , both european and national leaders need to address five central points : bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu should take on a more a more prominent role in development policy first , development policy needs to be seen as an element of approaches to global problem-solving – which means that it needs to become one of the central areas of european foreign policy .
here europe must offer global leadership .
the world trade talks are set to continue in geneva this year .
in september the united nations will be hosting a summit on the state of the un millennium development goals -lrb- mdgs -rrb- .
in june canada is to host the g8 / g20 for a conference on the financial crisis .
in addition , the climate talks will be returning to bonn in june .
how far will europe 's voice carry in these concerts ?
effectiveness of development aid impacts on european credibility the second point concerns commitments on the volume and effectiveness of global development assistance .
this is a matter of europe 's own credibility .
not enough that the donors operating in africa often trip over one another for lack of coordination , the eu countries are currently offering 20 billion euros less in aid than they had originally pledged .
and there are fears that commitments on climate protection finance could come at the expense of other fields , with europe , in effect , pursuing a zero-sum policy – taking , as it were , funds from its right pocket and putting them into its left .
coordinating different fields third , development assistance must not be allowed simply to make up for what european policy has taken away elsewhere .
trade , climate protection , and immigration policy are key fields that need to be coordinated with the objectives of development policy .
this is a permanent task for which there can and will be no quick fixes .
investing in international partnerships bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sven grimm , researcher with bonn-based think-tank die fourth , it is essential to invest in global partnerships .
these are investments in a shared future .
partners need to be able act on equal terms – in order then to seek , on an equal footing , solutions to common problems .
in view of the fact that reforms of the bretton woods institutions are on the immediate agenda , the international decisions that need to be taken in the near future will put europe to the test .
international power shifts are already becoming evident .
measured in terms of its economic power , which is declining in relation to asia , europe is overrepresented in imf and world bank .
when it comes to international bodies , europe often seems to confuse quantity with quality , and having a large number of representatives in the g20 or the imf does not necessarily mean more influence if efforts to coordinate such steps have not been successfully coordinated in advance .
only as a chorus will europe prove able to make its voice heard .
potential role of eu foreign service and finally , fifth , the memorandum points to the potentials of the new european foreign service .
its mix of personnel drawn from member states and eu institutions may be seen as an opportunity .
at present , though , there are more questions than answers concerning this matter .
agreements – including the reform-oriented lisbon treaty – will be doomed to lead a life on paper unless europe 's responsible institutions and leaders prove able to improve their cooperation .
in other words , the question is : does europe now need to opt for more centralization ?
this is , in fact , not a realistic option , as the protracted wrangling in recent years over eu reforms has shown .
taking lisbon treaty as framework to improve policies the treaty of lisbon is certainly not the big bang for european global power .
but it does provide a good framework for improved coordination .
it is essential that efforts to improve the eu 's division of labor actually bear fruit if europe 's diversity is to be orchestrated to form a good chorus .
otherwise europe 's voice is likely to turn out to be little more than world-political background noise .
but one thing that can be said with certainty is that for the european countries global acoustics would be far worse in a world dominated by the big two .

but at a point of time where the dilapidated state of the global concert hall is becoming only all too evident , the real concern is : at present the substance and emphases of world politics are shifting towards the pacific .
europe depends on international decisions while europe is a globally networked region , it does have a marked atlantic orientation .
peace and prosperity in europe are dependent in crucial ways on whether or not the decisions taken in international bodies are of a long-term nature .
one consequence of this is that the distinction between domestic and foreign policy is growing increasingly blurred .
there is no isle of the blessed in a global financial and economic crisis , neither in europe nor in africa nor anywhere else .
the global climate is changing , and our way of life is going to have to change .
this goes not only for the us or china , the new global polluter , but also for europe , and especially for it – as well as for africa , which has contributed as good as nothing to climate change .
in short : we have an enlightened self-interest in global development .
eu should offer global leadership the tenor of the eu memorandum 's authors : if europe is to continue to be taken seriously as a global actor on its own merits , both european and national leaders need to address five central points : bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu should take on a more a more prominent role in development policy first , development policy needs to be seen as an element of approaches to global problem-solving – which means that it needs to become one of the central areas of european foreign policy .
here europe must offer global leadership .
the world trade talks are set to continue in geneva this year .
in september the united nations will be hosting a summit on the state of the un millennium development goals -lrb- mdgs -rrb- .
in june canada is to host the g8 / g20 for a conference on the financial crisis .
in addition , the climate talks will be returning to bonn in june .
how far will europe 's voice carry in these concerts ?
effectiveness of development aid impacts on european credibility the second point concerns commitments on the volume and effectiveness of global development assistance .
this is a matter of europe 's own credibility .
not enough that the donors operating in africa often trip over one another for lack of coordination , the eu countries are currently offering 20 billion euros less in aid than they had originally pledged .
and there are fears that commitments on climate protection finance could come at the expense of other fields , with europe , in effect , pursuing a zero-sum policy – taking , as it were , funds from its right pocket and putting them into its left .
coordinating different fields third , development assistance must not be allowed simply to make up for what european policy has taken away elsewhere .
trade , climate protection , and immigration policy are key fields that need to be coordinated with the objectives of development policy .
this is a permanent task for which there can and will be no quick fixes .
investing in international partnerships bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sven grimm , researcher with bonn-based think-tank die fourth , it is essential to invest in global partnerships .
these are investments in a shared future .
partners need to be able act on equal terms – in order then to seek , on an equal footing , solutions to common problems .
in view of the fact that reforms of the bretton woods institutions are on the immediate agenda , the international decisions that need to be taken in the near future will put europe to the test .
international power shifts are already becoming evident .
measured in terms of its economic power , which is declining in relation to asia , europe is overrepresented in imf and world bank .
when it comes to international bodies , europe often seems to confuse quantity with quality , and having a large number of representatives in the g20 or the imf does not necessarily mean more influence if efforts to coordinate such steps have not been successfully coordinated in advance .
only as a chorus will europe prove able to make its voice heard .
potential role of eu foreign service and finally , fifth , the memorandum points to the potentials of the new european foreign service .
its mix of personnel drawn from member states and eu institutions may be seen as an opportunity .
at present , though , there are more questions than answers concerning this matter .
agreements – including the reform-oriented lisbon treaty – will be doomed to lead a life on paper unless europe 's responsible institutions and leaders prove able to improve their cooperation .
in other words , the question is : does europe now need to opt for more centralization ?
this is , in fact , not a realistic option , as the protracted wrangling in recent years over eu reforms has shown .
taking lisbon treaty as framework to improve policies the treaty of lisbon is certainly not the big bang for european global power .
but it does provide a good framework for improved coordination .
it is essential that efforts to improve the eu 's division of labor actually bear fruit if europe 's diversity is to be orchestrated to form a good chorus .
otherwise europe 's voice is likely to turn out to be little more than world-political background noise .
but one thing that can be said with certainty is that for the european countries global acoustics would be far worse in a world dominated by the big two .

the eu should take on more prominent role in the area , argue this week 's commenators sven grimm and simon maxwell . while the new eu commission in the process of constitution , the european think-tanks group has presented a memorandum entitled " new challenges , new beginnings – next steps in european development cooperation " . the group comprises the think tanks die -lrb- germany -rrb- , odi -lrb- uk -rrb- , fride -lrb- spain -rrb- , and the european centre for development policy management ecdpm .
the memorandum analyses both current european policy and emerging challenges in climate change , migration , trade policy as well as the coherence of and division of labor in development policy .
eu should become more prominent actor in development field based on this analysis , the think-tanks group has formulated a number of recommendations for national and european decision-makers .
europe has still not succeeded in carving out a place for itself as a player in the world of the ' big two ' - the us and china .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : activists were disappointed with the lack of results at the copenhagen climate talks this became evident not least at the failed climate negotiations in copenhagen , where , when it came to the pivotal rounds of the talks , the us and china constituted more or less a group of their own .

this is , in fact , not a realistic option , as the protracted wrangling in recent years over eu reforms has shown .
taking lisbon treaty as framework to improve policies the treaty of lisbon is certainly not the big bang for european global power .
but it does provide a good framework for improved coordination .
it is essential that efforts to improve the eu 's division of labor actually bear fruit if europe 's diversity is to be orchestrated to form a good chorus .
otherwise europe 's voice is likely to turn out to be little more than world-political background noise .
but one thing that can be said with certainty is that for the european countries global acoustics would be far worse in a world dominated by the big two .

indeed , education is considered so crucial that when the united nations released its millennium development goals for 2015 , universal primary education was slated as the number two priority , second only to eradicating extreme poverty and hunger .
but a report released by berlin-based anti-corruption organisation transparency international suggests that endemic corruption in african schooling systems is still seeing large numbers of primary-aged african children denied their right to an education .
" basically all issues around resourcing had a dimension of corruption , with resources being exploited or embezzled by someone for private gain , but sometimes also just plain mismanagement , " said stephane stassen , who co-authored the report .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : giving children an education is crucial in post-war sierra leone the transparency international study " good governance lessons for primary education " was produced as part of the organisation 's africa education watch initiative and examined the impact of corruption on education quality and availability in seven african countries , interviewing over 8500 educators and parents in ghana , madagascar , morocco , niger , senegal , sierra leone and uganda .
change coming too slow to the continent the data collected paints a troubling picture of education in africa : despite two decades of reforms designed to allow greater levels of management at the local level and improve accountability , school administration is still not , for the most part , a genuinely corruption-free and participatory governance system .
" despite all these measures , there were still many governance challenges , " said stephane stassen , who heads transparency international 's africa education watch program .
one of the most striking examples is that of so-called registration fees , which parents from every country surveyed reported paying , although by law primary schooling is free .
the number of parents forced to pay these illegal accounting fees ranged from 9 % in ghana , to 90 % in morocco , the report found .
" similarly , in some countries where they had also abolished exam fees , they were still being charged , " said stassen .
he added that in many countries , textbooks were often not available .
and even if they were dispatched to schools , they were often not distributed for free .
the problems were also identified at higher levels , for example when schools receiving grants with which to run themselves were not receiving the full amount , or it was coming with a delay .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most parents can not afford high school fees the average cost of enrolling a primary-aged child in an african school for one year is three euros .
by comparison , the average per capita income in sierra leone is just us $ 260 -lrb- 190 euros -rrb- per year .
the costs charged for " free " textbooks as well as the fees of illegal " compulsory tutoring " - charged by some teachers to supplement their meagre incomes - puts an additional strain on african families .
crucial learning years missed these prohibitively high costs can lead to higher school dropout rates at a crucial time in children 's lives . " primary education is really the place where you get the basics for your life later on .
this is where you learn to read and write , this is where you learn to count , and if , for example if in africa you want to have a chance in trade or to go beyond your village , these are really skills you need to acquire . "
stassen said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : illiteracy among older people is high in many parts of africa he added that without a basic education , it would be nearly impossible to go on to high school or college .
" it 's really hard to get people back to school later on , and this is why we have to get things right now " .
literacy remains low in many parts of africa .
in senegal , for instance , just 43 percent of adults were considered literate in 2007 , compared to 72 percent in madagascar .
despite the obstacles , enrolment figures for primary-aged children in africa are on the increase .
according to 2009 figures from the un , net enrolment in sub-saharan africa went from 58 percent in 2000 to 74 percent in 2007 and from 91 percent to 96 percent over the same period of time in northern africa .
but enrolment figures do not tell the whole story : not only may corrupt practices prevent children from attending school , but they also lower the quality of education for students once they get there .
" even if you are in class , it might mean that you do n't learn much , because you have one textbook for ten learners if not more , " stassen said mismanagement partly to blame in many schools , the report found resources were being wasted or lost , not wilfully , but because those responsible for their management were simply ill-equipped for the job .
overall , 85 percent of schools across all countries had either deficient accounting systems or none at all , and in morocco , just 23 percent of head teachers received training in financial management , despite being responsible for budgets .
in niger that figure drops to just 8 percent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stephane stassen heads transparency international 's africa education watch program " schools where the head teacher had been trained and prepared to do his job in terms of managing the resources of the schools were … the schools where less of these corrupt practices were appearing , " said stassen .
" in a sense , what we found was that head teachers and teachers themselves were really feeling that they had been abandoned by the system . "
a way forward universal schooling for primary-aged children may be untenable by 2015 , but transparency international 's report suggests the reforms that have been made to date are in fact helping african schoolchildren .
the report found that schools that were more frequently audited tended to perform better : education outcomes were better and parents reported paying fewer illegal fees .
training in financial management for head teachers and school management committees could be strengthened , said stassen , to improve accountability .
stassen added that helping african parents to understand more about their rights within the schooling system was a crucial step in increasing engagement and accountability .
" i think that by combining inspections , grassroots accountability and better transparency in the system , you could really have an education system which is more efficient and better-resourced . "

it expects normal service to be restored by friday . lufthansa says only half of its normally scheduled flights will operate on tuesday and it will take until friday to get its worldwide network completely back up to speed .
on monday evening lufthansa and the pilots ' trade union cockpit agreed during mediation in a frankfurt labour court to resume negotiations , with cockpit suspending its work stoppage until march 8 .
lufthansa had gone to court seeking an injunction against the strike .
cockpit called the walkout to press its demands for job security guarantees and pay rises for 4,500 pilots the work stoppage , which had begun early on monday , led to the cancellation of 900 flights .
it was meant to continue until thursday .
also affected were lufthhansa 's subsidiary germanwings and lufthansa 's cargo division .
aircraft parked , crews displaced that left most aircraft parked at lufthansa 's hubs in frankfurt and munich , with crews and planes displaced from normal departure points .
a lufthansa spokesman said the airline was working at top speed to reinstate its global flight schedule .
lufthansa spokesman klaus walther told zdf german public television that extra flights would be provided on germany 's main routes - frankfurt-munich , frankfurt-berlin and frankfurt-hamburg .
" but it will take some time before the complete network is functioning again , " he said .
germanwings said that 120 of its 160 scheduled flights would operate on tuesday , despite the aftermath of the industrial action .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some 4,000 pilots were briefly on strike transport minister relieved german transport minister peter raumsauer told zdf he was relieved that resolution efforts and suggestions he had made since last weekend had been adopted by all sides .
" i now hope and demand that the negotiating parties reach a sustainable , amicable agreement and that no aircraft remains grounded , " he said . travel clouded by controllers ' strike meanwhile , european travellers can expect more disruption on tuesday , due to a work stoppage by french air traffic controllers .
that stoppage is expected to hamper half the flights at paris ' orly airport and a quarter of flights from the main charles de gaulle airport , according to france 's aviation authority dgac .
air france has vowed to maintain most long-haul services .
some french provincial airports also expect cancellations .
four french unions have called the five-day strike , from tuesday until saturday , to protest against government plans to merge france 's air traffic control activities with those of neighbouring countries .
controllers fear the merger will end their role as french state employees .
dgac insists their status will not change .
meanwhile , the british union unite says 81 percent of its cabin crew members working for british airways have voted in favour of strike action .
that creates the prospect of a strike within the next 28 days , although the easter holiday period is reported to have been ruled out. ipj / dpa / reuters / afp editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it expects normal service to be restored by friday . lufthansa says only half of its normally scheduled flights will operate on tuesday and it will take until friday to get its worldwide network completely back up to speed .
on monday evening lufthansa and the pilots ' trade union cockpit agreed during mediation in a frankfurt labour court to resume negotiations , with cockpit suspending its work stoppage until march 8 .
lufthansa had gone to court seeking an injunction against the strike .
cockpit called the walkout to press its demands for job security guarantees and pay rises for 4,500 pilots the work stoppage , which had begun early on monday , led to the cancellation of 900 flights .
it was meant to continue until thursday .
also affected were lufthhansa 's subsidiary germanwings and lufthansa 's cargo division .
aircraft parked , crews displaced that left most aircraft parked at lufthansa 's hubs in frankfurt and munich , with crews and planes displaced from normal departure points .
a lufthansa spokesman said the airline was working at top speed to reinstate its global flight schedule .
lufthansa spokesman klaus walther told zdf german public television that extra flights would be provided on germany 's main routes - frankfurt-munich , frankfurt-berlin and frankfurt-hamburg .
" but it will take some time before the complete network is functioning again , " he said .
germanwings said that 120 of its 160 scheduled flights would operate on tuesday , despite the aftermath of the industrial action .

some french provincial airports also expect cancellations .
four french unions have called the five-day strike , from tuesday until saturday , to protest against government plans to merge france 's air traffic control activities with those of neighbouring countries .
controllers fear the merger will end their role as french state employees .
dgac insists their status will not change .
meanwhile , the british union unite says 81 percent of its cabin crew members working for british airways have voted in favour of strike action .

istanbul police were questioning 29 of them at their headquarters , news broadcaster ntv reported .
police also brought 10 of the arrested officers to an istanbul court early on tuesday , according to the state-run anatolian news agency .
the court is to decide whether to hold them in custody .
the series of arrests is one of the biggest against the military , which has ousted four governments since 1960 and considers itself to be the guardian of turkey 's secular tradition .
turkish prime minister tayyip erdogan commented on the arrests during an official visit to madrid .
" after the security forces have finished this process , the judiciary will make its assessment , " erdogan said .
coup plot bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ruling ak party has support from voters and the european union the crackdown relates to the 2003 " sledgehammer " plot to overthrow the government , led by the islam-rooted ak party .
media reports have said the military planned to provoke an attack from neighboring greece and plant bombs inside istanbul mosques and museums to incite chaos and justify a military coup .
military leaders have denied the accusations and claim the plot was only a hypothetical training scenario .
more than 200 people have been arrested since the story broke in 2007 , including military officers , politicians , lawyers and writers .
critics of the government claim prime minister erdogan has used the investigation to silence opposition .
governmental power struggle the ak party , or justice and development party , came to power only a year after its founding when it won a parliamentary majority in 2002 and ended decades of secularist rule .
the party brands itself as pro-market and pro-western , favoring turkey 's bid for membership of the european union .
but the staunchly secular institutions of the military and judiciary have been in a deep power struggle with the government , which has solid electoral support .
erdogan has sought parliamentary support to curb the power of judges and prosecutors , and has said he would call a referendum on a constitutional reform to the judicial system if plans in parliament fail .
his government has also moved to curb the military 's influence in state affairs as part of a democratic reform plan aimed at eventual eu membership. acb / dpa / ap / reuters editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

they questioned an upcoming concert in minsk , saying letting it go on would be a " costly mistake " for the country . rammstein 's music could " destroy the belarusian state system , " said the country 's council for morality on monday . the council described the band 's songs as propaganda for " violence , masochism , homosexuality and other abnormalities " and said " permitting a rammstein concert would be a costly mistake .

pilot union cockpit agreed not to call any further strikes before march 8 .
it welcomed monday 's court decision to resume wage talks . the pilot 's union also withdrew variable compensation , or profit sharing , from its list of key demands , which had been misinterpreted .
both sides agreed to return to the negotiating table without setting any preconditions .
germany 's national carrier confirmed that both parties would resume talks immediately .
" the parties agreed in front of the court that the strike is to be suspended through the 8th of march " , lufthansa spokesman andreas bartels told ap news agency . lufthansa said the 4,000 pilots will return to work tuesday though it would take some time for normal operations to resume .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : normal operations to resume after striking pilots agree to suspend strike the walkout began midnight monday and caused the cancellation of hundreds of flights on germany 's largest airline , disrupting travel for thousands of people .
lufthansa had asked a frankfurt labor court for an injunction against the strike , which had threatened to drag on until thursday .
representatives from the union and lufthansa agreed to resume talks as they met before a judge monday evening .
travel chaos averted the airline had earlier predicted that the strike would cause about 800 flights per day to be canceled , totaling 3,200 flights for the week .
international routes were hardest hit by the strike , while most domestic service remained intact , lufthansa said .
cockpit spokesman joerg handwerg told the afp news agency that the strike was " a great success . "
outsourcing to partners the four-day strike could have cost lufthansa more than 65 million euros -lrb- $ 88.4 million -rrb- and up to 100 million euros if all flights were grounded , according to estimates by the airline .
lufthansa pilots are demanding a 6.4 percent pay raise , more influence in company decisions and a commitment that pilots will keep their jobs if lufthansa shifts routes to affiliate airlines like austrian airlines or lufthansa italia , where pilots come cheaper .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de africa -pipe- 23.02.2010 corruption stifles learning in africa , report finds großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : corruption is still keeping some african children out of the classroom a new report from anti-corruption organisation transparency international has found that systematic corruption and mismanagement are keeping many african children from a decent education , despite years of reform . when it comes to tackling poverty , poor health or limited opportunities for growth , a good education is widely seen as a magic bullet for developing countries .
indeed , education is considered so crucial that when the united nations released its millennium development goals for 2015 , universal primary education was slated as the number two priority , second only to eradicating extreme poverty and hunger .
but a report released by berlin-based anti-corruption organisation transparency international suggests that endemic corruption in african schooling systems is still seeing large numbers of primary-aged african children denied their right to an education .
" basically all issues around resourcing had a dimension of corruption , with resources being exploited or embezzled by someone for private gain , but sometimes also just plain mismanagement , " said stephane stassen , who co-authored the report .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : giving children an education is crucial in post-war sierra leone the transparency international study " good governance lessons for primary education " was produced as part of the organisation 's africa education watch initiative and examined the impact of corruption on education quality and availability in seven african countries , interviewing over 8500 educators and parents in ghana , madagascar , morocco , niger , senegal , sierra leone and uganda .
change coming too slow to the continent the data collected paints a troubling picture of education in africa : despite two decades of reforms designed to allow greater levels of management at the local level and improve accountability , school administration is still not , for the most part , a genuinely corruption-free and participatory governance system .
" despite all these measures , there were still many governance challenges , " said stephane stassen , who heads transparency international 's africa education watch program .
one of the most striking examples is that of so-called registration fees , which parents from every country surveyed reported paying , although by law primary schooling is free .
the number of parents forced to pay these illegal accounting fees ranged from 9 % in ghana , to 90 % in morocco , the report found .
" similarly , in some countries where they had also abolished exam fees , they were still being charged , " said stassen .
he added that in many countries , textbooks were often not available .
and even if they were dispatched to schools , they were often not distributed for free .
the problems were also identified at higher levels , for example when schools receiving grants with which to run themselves were not receiving the full amount , or it was coming with a delay .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most parents can not afford high school fees the average cost of enrolling a primary-aged child in an african school for one year is three euros .
by comparison , the average per capita income in sierra leone is just us $ 260 -lrb- 190 euros -rrb- per year .
the costs charged for " free " textbooks as well as the fees of illegal " compulsory tutoring " - charged by some teachers to supplement their meagre incomes - puts an additional strain on african families .
crucial learning years missed these prohibitively high costs can lead to higher school dropout rates at a crucial time in children 's lives . " primary education is really the place where you get the basics for your life later on .
this is where you learn to read and write , this is where you learn to count , and if , for example if in africa you want to have a chance in trade or to go beyond your village , these are really skills you need to acquire . "
stassen said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : illiteracy among older people is high in many parts of africa he added that without a basic education , it would be nearly impossible to go on to high school or college .
" it 's really hard to get people back to school later on , and this is why we have to get things right now " .
literacy remains low in many parts of africa .
in senegal , for instance , just 43 percent of adults were considered literate in 2007 , compared to 72 percent in madagascar .
despite the obstacles , enrolment figures for primary-aged children in africa are on the increase .
according to 2009 figures from the un , net enrolment in sub-saharan africa went from 58 percent in 2000 to 74 percent in 2007 and from 91 percent to 96 percent over the same period of time in northern africa .
but enrolment figures do not tell the whole story : not only may corrupt practices prevent children from attending school , but they also lower the quality of education for students once they get there .
" even if you are in class , it might mean that you do n't learn much , because you have one textbook for ten learners if not more , " stassen said mismanagement partly to blame in many schools , the report found resources were being wasted or lost , not wilfully , but because those responsible for their management were simply ill-equipped for the job .
overall , 85 percent of schools across all countries had either deficient accounting systems or none at all , and in morocco , just 23 percent of head teachers received training in financial management , despite being responsible for budgets .
in niger that figure drops to just 8 percent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stephane stassen heads transparency international 's africa education watch program " schools where the head teacher had been trained and prepared to do his job in terms of managing the resources of the schools were … the schools where less of these corrupt practices were appearing , " said stassen .
" in a sense , what we found was that head teachers and teachers themselves were really feeling that they had been abandoned by the system . "
a way forward universal schooling for primary-aged children may be untenable by 2015 , but transparency international 's report suggests the reforms that have been made to date are in fact helping african schoolchildren .
the report found that schools that were more frequently audited tended to perform better : education outcomes were better and parents reported paying fewer illegal fees .
training in financial management for head teachers and school management committees could be strengthened , said stassen , to improve accountability .
stassen added that helping african parents to understand more about their rights within the schooling system was a crucial step in increasing engagement and accountability .
" i think that by combining inspections , grassroots accountability and better transparency in the system , you could really have an education system which is more efficient and better-resourced . "

the early initiative paid dividends when brazilian forward cacau headed in a perfect timo gebhart center ball from the right on the 25-minute mark .
the germans continued to press barcelona 's defense and came close to snatching goals on three more occasions , in addition to an appeal for handball by barca defender gerard pique .
at the outset of the second half , barcelona came out a different team and pulled level within seven minutes through frontman zlatan ibrahimovic .
the opportunity came when stuttgart failed to clear a corner and the ball came back in for pique , who headed down for ibrahimovic to volley home .
the initial shot was parried by stuttgart keeper jens lehmann , but ibrahimovic was able to knock the rebound over the goal line .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cacau 's goal came midway through the first half the catalans dominated the remainder of the clash , a fact stuttgart coach christian gross seized upon .
" we should have scored a second goal in the first half , " gross said following the match .
" we had clear chances . "
barcelona midfielder andreas iniesta was upbeat about the result , saying he was confident the ball was now in barcelona 's court .
" we knew that it was going to be a difficult game , " said the spain international .
" and the truth is that they really made us suffer in the first half .
" now we have the tie in our favor , but there are still 90 minutes left to play . "

but in the face of criticism and protests , the law wo n't be enforced , says the government . a new law to curb child pornography has come into force in germany , but , in a legal curiosity , it is not going to be used by the courts .
the salient point is that instead of blocking child porn websites , the government now thinks it would better to erase them . the controversial legislation was drafted in 2009 by the former conservative family minister , ursula von der leyen , who said that she was willing to act against " a massive spread of child pornography on the internet . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ursula von der leyen is eager to stop child abuse material on the internet " we are no longer going to tolerate the fact that pictures of children being raped are massively accessed and distributed on the internet in germany , " she said , shortly before introducing the bill to parliament last year . mere symbolism under the new law , the german federal criminal office -lrb- bka -rrb- is supposed to provide a regularly updated list of websites , which they 've found to contain child pornographic pictures and images . german internet providers must then post a red " stop " sign on them , but are not allowed to erase them .
the german law also does n't extend to providers based abroad . christian bahls from the organisation " abuse victims against internet access blocking " accused the government of pursuing " a policy of symbolism , " which he described as " a slap in the face of the victims of child pornography . " " the victims of abuse are being abused again , namely as symbols in a questionable government campaign , " he said . freedom vs crime fighting since last summer , there 's been a groundswell of protests by germans who see the law as a first step on the path towards government censorship of the internet . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protestors demanding internet freedom did n't want to listen to the government 's arguments franziska heine has been spearheading a public pressure campaign called " expedition against internet blocking , " which is aimed at forcing parliament to re-introduce the law . about 134.000 germans have signed on to an official petition to parliament pressed by the group . mrs heine claimed that the law was based on " entirely false information " about the distribution of child pornography . " the law has huge repercussion for the freedom of information , but does little to help the victims , " she said . mrs heine 's opinion is supported by police specialists investigating cases of child pornography . frank federau , a member of a special unit at the regional police office in the federal state of lower saxony , believes child abuse material is not primarily exchanged using the internet . " the internet is a channel of communication for paedophiles , but the material as such is distributed on cds and dvds via ordinary mail . " legal doubts wolfgang hoffmann-riem , an expert on constitutional law , even believed that the new law was not in line with the german constitution . " the fact that the federal criminal office has been made responsible for providing the list of websites to be banned , is a clear breach of power-sharing laws in germany . " hoffman-riem pointed out that police in the 16 german federal states were in charge of crime fighting and investigating criminal content on the internet , and that the law infringed upon their duties . in the face of so much criticism , the government has decided to amend the law in the course of the next few months . the new legislation , the government said , would then allow providers to erase child pornography websites . author : uwe hessler editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but it is unlikely to trigger a domino effect among other countries who have troops there . by the sheer number of troops , the dutch deployment does n't rank among top international contingents in afghanistan .
however , its force of 1,800 soldiers has not only been in charge of the uruzgan province in the dangerous southern part of the country , but has generally been seen as doing an excellent job there .
so the planned dutch pullout from afghanistan as a consequence of the governmen crisis in the hague will clearly have repercussions for nato 's military mission in the country at a time when most allies are already under pressure to justify their engagement at home .
this has already led to worries about a possible domino effect in the sense that other countries might also feel forced to reconsider their committments to afghanistan .
" it 's true that the afghanistan mission is very unpopular in many european countries , so it is definitely a cause for concern if the dutch withdraw on account of the collapsed government , " eva gross , who heads the eu foreign and security policy program at the institute for european studies at vrije universiteit brussel in belgium , told deutsche welle .
" but to speak of a domino effect may be overstating the case . "
each country in europe has its own dynamics and traditions , therefore gross does n't believe an automatic discussion about troop withdrawals in other eu states is likely .
german troop increase will go ahead for germany , where a parliamentary vote on the expansion of berlin 's afghan mission is scheduled for later this week , the dutch decision wo n't have an immediate effect either , argue experts .
public opinion in germany ca n't be swayed much by the dutch political crisis because a solid majority of germans is already against the military engagement in afghanistan , says klaus-peter schoeppner , head of tns emnid , a major german polling and reseach firm .
while germans are very skeptical about the afghan misson , schoeppner thinks that most of them can live with the exit scenario envisaged by the government .
" so , i do n't think that this topic will gain much traction in germany , " he told deutsche welle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany plans to send up to 850 additional troops to afghanistan what 's more , adds schoeppner , germans do n't view the mission in afghanistan as predominantly a military one .
" we regard ourselves as the number one humanitarian nation , " said schoeppner .
a fast withdrawal from afghanistan would not only end germany 's military , but also its humanitarian responsibilities .
currently there is no indication that this is a likely option for the government , he added .
" i am fairly confindent that the increase of troops will go through in parliament , mainly because the political elites have been in favor of a continuation of the mandate , " said gross .
exit strategies while the dutch withdrawal will not have any imminent effect on the committments of other allies , it will further increase the debate in many countries about timetables and exit strategies .
" we have seen this in discussions already in germany , britain or the united states that the focus is now already much more on finding ways of withdrawing their troops from afghanistan , " said gross .
that could make it hard for nato to find a replacement for dutch troops , if the new government in the hague does in fact decide to withdraw its soldiers .
australia already publicly dismissed a possible leadership role in uruzgan province and canada has said it wants to pull out its troops at the end of next year .
germany , which is currently in charge of the regional command in the north of afghanistan , has repeatedly rejected a german engagement in the south and is unlikely to change that position .
" i think it would be difficult for us to do more in afghanistan , because others leave , " said schoeppner .
if no other countries are willing to take over the dutch role in the south , the us might ultimately be forced to fulfill that task itself .
as an alternative , american officials have aired a possible role for non-nato troops in afghanistan .
but whether such an expansion of the afghan mission is realistic and how it could work is still unclear .
explaining the mission at least for now then , the political turmoil over the future of dutch troops in afghanistan will merely increase the pressure on nato planners to sketch out possible scenarios for a dutch withdrawal and not lead to a domino effect in other countries .
however , argue experts , since public sentiment is already very pessimistic about the afghan mission , military events on the ground can always have a major impact on public opinion .
bildunterschrift : politicians must better explain the rationale behind the afghan mission , say experts " in most countries a a rather large attack with loss of life would probably push the public to reject military engagement , " said gross .
since that is always possible , governments can only do one thing : " they have to communicate the reasons why we are in afghanistan much better and much more carefully .
i think the dutch withdrawal and the collapse of the government definitely highlights that the european public is unconvinced of the value of the afghan mission and that european politicians have some explaining to do , " she said .

but it is unlikely to trigger a domino effect among other countries who have troops there . by the sheer number of troops , the dutch deployment does n't rank among top international contingents in afghanistan .
however , its force of 1,800 soldiers has not only been in charge of the uruzgan province in the dangerous southern part of the country , but has generally been seen as doing an excellent job there .
so the planned dutch pullout from afghanistan as a consequence of the governmen crisis in the hague will clearly have repercussions for nato 's military mission in the country at a time when most allies are already under pressure to justify their engagement at home .
this has already led to worries about a possible domino effect in the sense that other countries might also feel forced to reconsider their committments to afghanistan .
" it 's true that the afghanistan mission is very unpopular in many european countries , so it is definitely a cause for concern if the dutch withdraw on account of the collapsed government , " eva gross , who heads the eu foreign and security policy program at the institute for european studies at vrije universiteit brussel in belgium , told deutsche welle .
" but to speak of a domino effect may be overstating the case . "
each country in europe has its own dynamics and traditions , therefore gross does n't believe an automatic discussion about troop withdrawals in other eu states is likely .
german troop increase will go ahead for germany , where a parliamentary vote on the expansion of berlin 's afghan mission is scheduled for later this week , the dutch decision wo n't have an immediate effect either , argue experts .
public opinion in germany ca n't be swayed much by the dutch political crisis because a solid majority of germans is already against the military engagement in afghanistan , says klaus-peter schoeppner , head of tns emnid , a major german polling and reseach firm .
while germans are very skeptical about the afghan misson , schoeppner thinks that most of them can live with the exit scenario envisaged by the government .
" so , i do n't think that this topic will gain much traction in germany , " he told deutsche welle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany plans to send up to 850 additional troops to afghanistan what 's more , adds schoeppner , germans do n't view the mission in afghanistan as predominantly a military one .
" we regard ourselves as the number one humanitarian nation , " said schoeppner .
a fast withdrawal from afghanistan would not only end germany 's military , but also its humanitarian responsibilities .
currently there is no indication that this is a likely option for the government , he added .
" i am fairly confindent that the increase of troops will go through in parliament , mainly because the political elites have been in favor of a continuation of the mandate , " said gross .
exit strategies while the dutch withdrawal will not have any imminent effect on the committments of other allies , it will further increase the debate in many countries about timetables and exit strategies .
" we have seen this in discussions already in germany , britain or the united states that the focus is now already much more on finding ways of withdrawing their troops from afghanistan , " said gross .
that could make it hard for nato to find a replacement for dutch troops , if the new government in the hague does in fact decide to withdraw its soldiers .
australia already publicly dismissed a possible leadership role in uruzgan province and canada has said it wants to pull out its troops at the end of next year .
germany , which is currently in charge of the regional command in the north of afghanistan , has repeatedly rejected a german engagement in the south and is unlikely to change that position .
" i think it would be difficult for us to do more in afghanistan , because others leave , " said schoeppner .
if no other countries are willing to take over the dutch role in the south , the us might ultimately be forced to fulfill that task itself .
as an alternative , american officials have aired a possible role for non-nato troops in afghanistan .
but whether such an expansion of the afghan mission is realistic and how it could work is still unclear .
explaining the mission at least for now then , the political turmoil over the future of dutch troops in afghanistan will merely increase the pressure on nato planners to sketch out possible scenarios for a dutch withdrawal and not lead to a domino effect in other countries .
however , argue experts , since public sentiment is already very pessimistic about the afghan mission , military events on the ground can always have a major impact on public opinion .
bildunterschrift : politicians must better explain the rationale behind the afghan mission , say experts " in most countries a a rather large attack with loss of life would probably push the public to reject military engagement , " said gross .
since that is always possible , governments can only do one thing : " they have to communicate the reasons why we are in afghanistan much better and much more carefully .
i think the dutch withdrawal and the collapse of the government definitely highlights that the european public is unconvinced of the value of the afghan mission and that european politicians have some explaining to do , " she said .

" we have seen this in discussions already in germany , britain or the united states that the focus is now already much more on finding ways of withdrawing their troops from afghanistan , " said gross .
that could make it hard for nato to find a replacement for dutch troops , if the new government in the hague does in fact decide to withdraw its soldiers .
australia already publicly dismissed a possible leadership role in uruzgan province and canada has said it wants to pull out its troops at the end of next year .
germany , which is currently in charge of the regional command in the north of afghanistan , has repeatedly rejected a german engagement in the south and is unlikely to change that position .
" i think it would be difficult for us to do more in afghanistan , because others leave , " said schoeppner .
if no other countries are willing to take over the dutch role in the south , the us might ultimately be forced to fulfill that task itself .
as an alternative , american officials have aired a possible role for non-nato troops in afghanistan .
but whether such an expansion of the afghan mission is realistic and how it could work is still unclear .
explaining the mission at least for now then , the political turmoil over the future of dutch troops in afghanistan will merely increase the pressure on nato planners to sketch out possible scenarios for a dutch withdrawal and not lead to a domino effect in other countries .
however , argue experts , since public sentiment is already very pessimistic about the afghan mission , military events on the ground can always have a major impact on public opinion .
bildunterschrift : politicians must better explain the rationale behind the afghan mission , say experts " in most countries a a rather large attack with loss of life would probably push the public to reject military engagement , " said gross .
since that is always possible , governments can only do one thing : " they have to communicate the reasons why we are in afghanistan much better and much more carefully .
i think the dutch withdrawal and the collapse of the government definitely highlights that the european public is unconvinced of the value of the afghan mission and that european politicians have some explaining to do , " she said .

lufthansa had asked a frankfurt labor court for an injunction against the strike , which had threatened to drag on until thursday .
representatives from the union and lufthansa agreed to resume talks as they met before a judge monday evening .
travel chaos averted the airline had earlier predicted that the strike would cause about 800 flights per day to be canceled , totaling 3,200 flights for the week .
international routes were hardest hit by the strike , while most domestic service remained intact , lufthansa said .
cockpit spokesman joerg handwerg told the afp news agency that the strike was " a great success . "
outsourcing to partners the four-day strike could have cost lufthansa more than 65 million euros -lrb- $ 88.4 million -rrb- and up to 100 million euros if all flights were grounded , according to estimates by the airline .
lufthansa pilots are demanding a 6.4 percent pay raise , more influence in company decisions and a commitment that pilots will keep their jobs if lufthansa shifts routes to affiliate airlines like austrian airlines or lufthansa italia , where pilots come cheaper .

the two clubs now await a second duel in spain in march . stuttgart made the most of the capacity home crowd at mercedes-benz arena , starting the match energetically and taking it to barcelona .
the early initiative paid dividends when brazilian forward cacau headed in a perfect timo gebhart center ball from the right on the 25-minute mark .
the germans continued to press barcelona 's defense and came close to snatching goals on three more occasions , in addition to an appeal for handball by barca defender gerard pique .
at the outset of the second half , barcelona came out a different team and pulled level within seven minutes through frontman zlatan ibrahimovic .
the opportunity came when stuttgart failed to clear a corner and the ball came back in for pique , who headed down for ibrahimovic to volley home .
the initial shot was parried by stuttgart keeper jens lehmann , but ibrahimovic was able to knock the rebound over the goal line .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cacau 's goal came midway through the first half the catalans dominated the remainder of the clash , a fact stuttgart coach christian gross seized upon .
" we should have scored a second goal in the first half , " gross said following the match .
" we had clear chances . "
barcelona midfielder andreas iniesta was upbeat about the result , saying he was confident the ball was now in barcelona 's court .
" we knew that it was going to be a difficult game , " said the spain international .
" and the truth is that they really made us suffer in the first half .
" now we have the tie in our favor , but there are still 90 minutes left to play . "

yet berlin insists there are concerns that the technology could breach privacy laws . google , which wants to extend its street view panoramic photos to germany later this year , has rejected strong privacy objections raised by the german government .
consumer affairs minister ilse aigner is demanding that the internet giant only displays its imagery after each affected german citizen has given his or her permission .
minister aigner said her staff were consulting with justice ministry officials , with the aim of tightening legislation .
she also demanded that google be ready to make people 's faces , car and house numbers , and even facades unrecognizable .
" a vague picture pixel change is not sufficient , " she said in berlin .
" i do not share the company 's assessment that all personal data concerns have been resolved . "
her ministry , she said , had been flooded with calls by citizens worried about protecting their privacy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a stroll in the internet , but is data privacy safeguarded ?
the head of google 's legal department , arnd haller said " we take personal data privacy very seriously .
we 've been discussing privacy issues all over europe , but here in germany the intensity of the questions is really impressive . "
a consultant hired by google , nikolas forgo , who is a hanover professor on informatics law , said a violation of personal rights was improbable .
google has already pledged to disguise car number plates and peoples ' faces .
berlin says google needs individual permission aigner had recently accused google 's service of being on the verge of violating the privacy of millions of citizens , each individually .
she demanded that google seek the permission from each person photographed on streets prior to publication .
street view photos are taken by camera cars which can capture all-round 360-degrees images .
these enable google users to simulate a stroll while sitting at their computers .
google has been gathering images of streets and public spaces in germany since 2008 .
the online service began in 2007 in four cities in the united states .
australia and japan soon followed .
in total google has initiated similar imaging projects in 19 countries , including many in europe .
satellites help pinpoint the panoramic scenes on maps using geo-data systems .
in a special exception for germany , haller said individuals would be able to file an objection with google to seek the removal of recognizable features .
" we 've a web site on-line with the relevant names and places where google street views are taken .
we also allow users to opt out in advance . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : street view is already available in several european countries " an immersive experience " google software developer raphael leiteritz said he believed street view was worth fighting for : " cards and maps have been two-dimensional for many years .
street view for the first time gives you an immersive experience .
you do n't look on a city from the top .
you can visit it and you can look around . "
that does not impress aigner .
she is demanding that google 's panoramic cameras be mounted no higher than 1.8 meters – instead of the current 2.5 meters on camera cars – so that views over fences and walls into residents ' gardens and courtyards are blocked .
other data privacy advocates also point out that potential burglars can use such internet imagery to recognize and target properties .

she also demanded that google be ready to make people 's faces , car and house numbers , and even facades unrecognizable .
" a vague picture pixel change is not sufficient , " she said in berlin .
" i do not share the company 's assessment that all personal data concerns have been resolved . "
her ministry , she said , had been flooded with calls by citizens worried about protecting their privacy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a stroll in the internet , but is data privacy safeguarded ?
the head of google 's legal department , arnd haller said " we take personal data privacy very seriously .
we 've been discussing privacy issues all over europe , but here in germany the intensity of the questions is really impressive . "
a consultant hired by google , nikolas forgo , who is a hanover professor on informatics law , said a violation of personal rights was improbable .
google has already pledged to disguise car number plates and peoples ' faces .
berlin says google needs individual permission aigner had recently accused google 's service of being on the verge of violating the privacy of millions of citizens , each individually .
she demanded that google seek the permission from each person photographed on streets prior to publication .
street view photos are taken by camera cars which can capture all-round 360-degrees images .
these enable google users to simulate a stroll while sitting at their computers .
google has been gathering images of streets and public spaces in germany since 2008 .
the online service began in 2007 in four cities in the united states .
australia and japan soon followed .
in total google has initiated similar imaging projects in 19 countries , including many in europe .
satellites help pinpoint the panoramic scenes on maps using geo-data systems .
in a special exception for germany , haller said individuals would be able to file an objection with google to seek the removal of recognizable features .
" we 've a web site on-line with the relevant names and places where google street views are taken .
we also allow users to opt out in advance . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : street view is already available in several european countries " an immersive experience " google software developer raphael leiteritz said he believed street view was worth fighting for : " cards and maps have been two-dimensional for many years .
street view for the first time gives you an immersive experience .
you do n't look on a city from the top .
you can visit it and you can look around . "
that does not impress aigner .
she is demanding that google 's panoramic cameras be mounted no higher than 1.8 meters – instead of the current 2.5 meters on camera cars – so that views over fences and walls into residents ' gardens and courtyards are blocked .
other data privacy advocates also point out that potential burglars can use such internet imagery to recognize and target properties .
aigner told german public radio that google must act " definitively " on objections lodged by citizens , even to the point of making a building unrecognizable .
her ministry , she added , had placed a standardized complaint form on its website. ipj / apn / dpa / afp editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the draft law , which both the german parliament and chancellor angela merkel 's cabinet are to consider in the coming weeks , would cut state-guaranteed prices by 15 percent for energy produced by solar panels on open ground .
it would also cut prices by 16 percent for solar panels on roofs , where 80 percent of solar panels in germany are , and eliminate subsidies for panels placed on arable land .
a previous plan by environment minister norbert roettgen was criticized for not going far enough .
" there must be no more panels installed on arable land , " said peter altmaier , a member of merkel 's christian democrat union -lrb- cdu -rrb- who follows the solar energy sector .

support and opposition the reduction would save german consumers some of the one billion euros they pay per month in fees that underwrite solar energy production , according to hans-peter friedrich , a leader in the cdu 's bavarian sister party , the christian social union .
the law is supported by farmers resentful of investors who bought up arable land only to " harvest the sunshine . "

it would also cut prices by 16 percent for solar panels on roofs , where 80 percent of solar panels in germany are , and eliminate subsidies for panels placed on arable land .
a previous plan by environment minister norbert roettgen was criticized for not going far enough .
" there must be no more panels installed on arable land , " said peter altmaier , a member of merkel 's christian democrat union -lrb- cdu -rrb- who follows the solar energy sector .
" the objective is to reduce excessive stimulation without hindering an expansion of green energy . "
unintended consequences experts have criticized solar energy subsidies in germany for failing to spur competition in the industry , which accounts for less than one percent of all german electricity production .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : environmental groups have called the law a betrayal of renewable energy the subsidies have also had several unintended consequences : farmers have installed solar panels on their arable fields ; also , the global market has greatly increased , helping manufacturers in china , where labor is cheaper .
germany remains the world leader in solar panel production , but manufacturers have lost billions of euros in recent years and have been forced to cut and outsource jobs .
german group q-cells grew significantly until posting a 1.36-billion euro -lrb- $ 1.84 billion -rrb- net loss in 2009 .
support and opposition the reduction would save german consumers some of the one billion euros they pay per month in fees that underwrite solar energy production , according to hans-peter friedrich , a leader in the cdu 's bavarian sister party , the christian social union .
the law is supported by farmers resentful of investors who bought up arable land only to " harvest the sunshine . "
but the solar panel manufacturing lobby staunchly opposes the cutbacks , and some companies gave employees the day off to protest the law in berlin .

soldiers tell of rituals with names like " fire dance " and the " jukebox " . germany 's parliamentary commissioner for the armed forces , reinhold robbe , said he had received 54 written accounts of abuse and degrading treatment since he submitted a report about hazing in the military .
several of the letters he received from soldiers corroborated previous allegations that mountain infantry troops at a camp in bavaria had been forced to drink alcohol and eat raw pork liver until they threw up .
robbe , a member of the social democratic party , demanded that the training curriculum be changed and said that the " dangerous , tasteless rituals must stop . "
fire dances and jukeboxes the new letters also bring to light other forms of hazing .
one former member of the marines said that new sailors were often subjected to harsh rituals during their first nights at sea .
he described the " fire dance , " in which a man was forced to strip off his pants and have a lighted wick placed in his anus ; another in which a floor polishing machine with rough bristles was held against a recruit 's naked bottom until the skin turned red .
a volunteer soldier stationed in southern germany between 1996 and 1998 told of soldiers being forced to play " jukebox , " during which they were shut into a locker , which was then stood upside down , and the occupant forced to sing certain songs .
defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg renewed his promise of a complete investigation .
he did not rule out the possibility of disciplinary action for those involved , although he warned against making an across-the-board judgment .

soldiers tell of rituals with names like " fire dance " and the " jukebox " . germany 's parliamentary commissioner for the armed forces , reinhold robbe , said he had received 54 written accounts of abuse and degrading treatment since he submitted a report about hazing in the military .
several of the letters he received from soldiers corroborated previous allegations that mountain infantry troops at a camp in bavaria had been forced to drink alcohol and eat raw pork liver until they threw up .
robbe , a member of the social democratic party , demanded that the training curriculum be changed and said that the " dangerous , tasteless rituals must stop . "
fire dances and jukeboxes the new letters also bring to light other forms of hazing .
one former member of the marines said that new sailors were often subjected to harsh rituals during their first nights at sea .
he described the " fire dance , " in which a man was forced to strip off his pants and have a lighted wick placed in his anus ; another in which a floor polishing machine with rough bristles was held against a recruit 's naked bottom until the skin turned red .
a volunteer soldier stationed in southern germany between 1996 and 1998 told of soldiers being forced to play " jukebox , " during which they were shut into a locker , which was then stood upside down , and the occupant forced to sing certain songs .
defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg renewed his promise of a complete investigation .
he did not rule out the possibility of disciplinary action for those involved , although he warned against making an across-the-board judgment .
" every case must be pursued judiciously and emphatically , " guttenberg told fellow christian democrat politicians in berlin on tuesday. svs / dpa / apn editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de africa -pipe- 23.02.2010 corruption stifles learning in africa , report finds großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : corruption is still keeping some african children out of the classroom a new report from anti-corruption organisation transparency international has found that systematic corruption and mismanagement are keeping many african children from a decent education , despite years of reform . when it comes to tackling poverty , poor health or limited opportunities for growth , a good education is widely seen as a magic bullet for developing countries .
indeed , education is considered so crucial that when the united nations released its millennium development goals for 2015 , universal primary education was slated as the number two priority , second only to eradicating extreme poverty and hunger .
but a report released by berlin-based anti-corruption organisation transparency international suggests that endemic corruption in african schooling systems is still seeing large numbers of primary-aged african children denied their right to an education .
" basically all issues around resourcing had a dimension of corruption , with resources being exploited or embezzled by someone for private gain , but sometimes also just plain mismanagement , " said stephane stassen , who co-authored the report .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : giving children an education is crucial in post-war sierra leone the transparency international study " good governance lessons for primary education " was produced as part of the organisation 's africa education watch initiative and examined the impact of corruption on education quality and availability in seven african countries , interviewing over 8500 educators and parents in ghana , madagascar , morocco , niger , senegal , sierra leone and uganda .
change coming too slow to the continent the data collected paints a troubling picture of education in africa : despite two decades of reforms designed to allow greater levels of management at the local level and improve accountability , school administration is still not , for the most part , a genuinely corruption-free and participatory governance system .
" despite all these measures , there were still many governance challenges , " said stephane stassen , who heads transparency international 's africa education watch program .
one of the most striking examples is that of so-called registration fees , which parents from every country surveyed reported paying , although by law primary schooling is free .
the number of parents forced to pay these illegal accounting fees ranged from 9 % in ghana , to 90 % in morocco , the report found .
" similarly , in some countries where they had also abolished exam fees , they were still being charged , " said stassen .
he added that in many countries , textbooks were often not available .
and even if they were dispatched to schools , they were often not distributed for free .
the problems were also identified at higher levels , for example when schools receiving grants with which to run themselves were not receiving the full amount , or it was coming with a delay .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most parents can not afford high school fees the average cost of enrolling a primary-aged child in an african school for one year is three euros .
by comparison , the average per capita income in sierra leone is just us $ 260 -lrb- 190 euros -rrb- per year .
the costs charged for " free " textbooks as well as the fees of illegal " compulsory tutoring " - charged by some teachers to supplement their meagre incomes - puts an additional strain on african families .
crucial learning years missed these prohibitively high costs can lead to higher school dropout rates at a crucial time in children 's lives . " primary education is really the place where you get the basics for your life later on .
this is where you learn to read and write , this is where you learn to count , and if , for example if in africa you want to have a chance in trade or to go beyond your village , these are really skills you need to acquire . "
stassen said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : illiteracy among older people is high in many parts of africa he added that without a basic education , it would be nearly impossible to go on to high school or college .
" it 's really hard to get people back to school later on , and this is why we have to get things right now " .
literacy remains low in many parts of africa .
in senegal , for instance , just 43 percent of adults were considered literate in 2007 , compared to 72 percent in madagascar .
despite the obstacles , enrolment figures for primary-aged children in africa are on the increase .
according to 2009 figures from the un , net enrolment in sub-saharan africa went from 58 percent in 2000 to 74 percent in 2007 and from 91 percent to 96 percent over the same period of time in northern africa .
but enrolment figures do not tell the whole story : not only may corrupt practices prevent children from attending school , but they also lower the quality of education for students once they get there .
" even if you are in class , it might mean that you do n't learn much , because you have one textbook for ten learners if not more , " stassen said mismanagement partly to blame in many schools , the report found resources were being wasted or lost , not wilfully , but because those responsible for their management were simply ill-equipped for the job .
overall , 85 percent of schools across all countries had either deficient accounting systems or none at all , and in morocco , just 23 percent of head teachers received training in financial management , despite being responsible for budgets .
in niger that figure drops to just 8 percent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stephane stassen heads transparency international 's africa education watch program " schools where the head teacher had been trained and prepared to do his job in terms of managing the resources of the schools were … the schools where less of these corrupt practices were appearing , " said stassen .
" in a sense , what we found was that head teachers and teachers themselves were really feeling that they had been abandoned by the system . "
a way forward universal schooling for primary-aged children may be untenable by 2015 , but transparency international 's report suggests the reforms that have been made to date are in fact helping african schoolchildren .
the report found that schools that were more frequently audited tended to perform better : education outcomes were better and parents reported paying fewer illegal fees .
training in financial management for head teachers and school management committees could be strengthened , said stassen , to improve accountability .
stassen added that helping african parents to understand more about their rights within the schooling system was a crucial step in increasing engagement and accountability .
" i think that by combining inspections , grassroots accountability and better transparency in the system , you could really have an education system which is more efficient and better-resourced . "

overall , 85 percent of schools across all countries had either deficient accounting systems or none at all , and in morocco , just 23 percent of head teachers received training in financial management , despite being responsible for budgets .
in niger that figure drops to just 8 percent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stephane stassen heads transparency international 's africa education watch program " schools where the head teacher had been trained and prepared to do his job in terms of managing the resources of the schools were … the schools where less of these corrupt practices were appearing , " said stassen .
" in a sense , what we found was that head teachers and teachers themselves were really feeling that they had been abandoned by the system . "
a way forward universal schooling for primary-aged children may be untenable by 2015 , but transparency international 's report suggests the reforms that have been made to date are in fact helping african schoolchildren .
the report found that schools that were more frequently audited tended to perform better : education outcomes were better and parents reported paying fewer illegal fees .
training in financial management for head teachers and school management committees could be strengthened , said stassen , to improve accountability .
stassen added that helping african parents to understand more about their rights within the schooling system was a crucial step in increasing engagement and accountability .
" i think that by combining inspections , grassroots accountability and better transparency in the system , you could really have an education system which is more efficient and better-resourced . "

but in the face of criticism and protests , the law wo n't be enforced , says the government . a new law to curb child pornography has come into force in germany , but , in a legal curiosity , it is not going to be used by the courts .
the salient point is that instead of blocking child porn websites , the government now thinks it would better to erase them . the controversial legislation was drafted in 2009 by the former conservative family minister , ursula von der leyen , who said that she was willing to act against " a massive spread of child pornography on the internet . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ursula von der leyen is eager to stop child abuse material on the internet " we are no longer going to tolerate the fact that pictures of children being raped are massively accessed and distributed on the internet in germany , " she said , shortly before introducing the bill to parliament last year . mere symbolism under the new law , the german federal criminal office -lrb- bka -rrb- is supposed to provide a regularly updated list of websites , which they 've found to contain child pornographic pictures and images . german internet providers must then post a red " stop " sign on them , but are not allowed to erase them .
the german law also does n't extend to providers based abroad . christian bahls from the organisation " abuse victims against internet access blocking " accused the government of pursuing " a policy of symbolism , " which he described as " a slap in the face of the victims of child pornography . " " the victims of abuse are being abused again , namely as symbols in a questionable government campaign , " he said . freedom vs crime fighting since last summer , there 's been a groundswell of protests by germans who see the law as a first step on the path towards government censorship of the internet . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protestors demanding internet freedom did n't want to listen to the government 's arguments franziska heine has been spearheading a public pressure campaign called " expedition against internet blocking , " which is aimed at forcing parliament to re-introduce the law . about 134.000 germans have signed on to an official petition to parliament pressed by the group . mrs heine claimed that the law was based on " entirely false information " about the distribution of child pornography . " the law has huge repercussion for the freedom of information , but does little to help the victims , " she said . mrs heine 's opinion is supported by police specialists investigating cases of child pornography . frank federau , a member of a special unit at the regional police office in the federal state of lower saxony , believes child abuse material is not primarily exchanged using the internet .

" the fact that the federal criminal office has been made responsible for providing the list of websites to be banned , is a clear breach of power-sharing laws in germany . " hoffman-riem pointed out that police in the 16 german federal states were in charge of crime fighting and investigating criminal content on the internet , and that the law infringed upon their duties . in the face of so much criticism , the government has decided to amend the law in the course of the next few months . the new legislation , the government said , would then allow providers to erase child pornography websites . author : uwe hessler editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de afghanistan -pipe- 23.02.2010 dutch pullout will give nato headaches , but wo n't lead to domino effect großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it could be hard for nato to find a replacement for dutch troops a withdrawal of dutch troops from afghanistan would certainly increase the pressure on its allies to take their place .
but it is unlikely to trigger a domino effect among other countries who have troops there . by the sheer number of troops , the dutch deployment does n't rank among top international contingents in afghanistan .
however , its force of 1,800 soldiers has not only been in charge of the uruzgan province in the dangerous southern part of the country , but has generally been seen as doing an excellent job there .
so the planned dutch pullout from afghanistan as a consequence of the governmen crisis in the hague will clearly have repercussions for nato 's military mission in the country at a time when most allies are already under pressure to justify their engagement at home .
this has already led to worries about a possible domino effect in the sense that other countries might also feel forced to reconsider their committments to afghanistan .
" it 's true that the afghanistan mission is very unpopular in many european countries , so it is definitely a cause for concern if the dutch withdraw on account of the collapsed government , " eva gross , who heads the eu foreign and security policy program at the institute for european studies at vrije universiteit brussel in belgium , told deutsche welle .
" but to speak of a domino effect may be overstating the case . "
each country in europe has its own dynamics and traditions , therefore gross does n't believe an automatic discussion about troop withdrawals in other eu states is likely .
german troop increase will go ahead for germany , where a parliamentary vote on the expansion of berlin 's afghan mission is scheduled for later this week , the dutch decision wo n't have an immediate effect either , argue experts .
public opinion in germany ca n't be swayed much by the dutch political crisis because a solid majority of germans is already against the military engagement in afghanistan , says klaus-peter schoeppner , head of tns emnid , a major german polling and reseach firm .
while germans are very skeptical about the afghan misson , schoeppner thinks that most of them can live with the exit scenario envisaged by the government .
" so , i do n't think that this topic will gain much traction in germany , " he told deutsche welle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany plans to send up to 850 additional troops to afghanistan what 's more , adds schoeppner , germans do n't view the mission in afghanistan as predominantly a military one .
" we regard ourselves as the number one humanitarian nation , " said schoeppner .
a fast withdrawal from afghanistan would not only end germany 's military , but also its humanitarian responsibilities .
currently there is no indication that this is a likely option for the government , he added .
" i am fairly confindent that the increase of troops will go through in parliament , mainly because the political elites have been in favor of a continuation of the mandate , " said gross .
exit strategies while the dutch withdrawal will not have any imminent effect on the committments of other allies , it will further increase the debate in many countries about timetables and exit strategies .
" we have seen this in discussions already in germany , britain or the united states that the focus is now already much more on finding ways of withdrawing their troops from afghanistan , " said gross .
that could make it hard for nato to find a replacement for dutch troops , if the new government in the hague does in fact decide to withdraw its soldiers .
australia already publicly dismissed a possible leadership role in uruzgan province and canada has said it wants to pull out its troops at the end of next year .
germany , which is currently in charge of the regional command in the north of afghanistan , has repeatedly rejected a german engagement in the south and is unlikely to change that position .
" i think it would be difficult for us to do more in afghanistan , because others leave , " said schoeppner .
if no other countries are willing to take over the dutch role in the south , the us might ultimately be forced to fulfill that task itself .
as an alternative , american officials have aired a possible role for non-nato troops in afghanistan .
but whether such an expansion of the afghan mission is realistic and how it could work is still unclear .
explaining the mission at least for now then , the political turmoil over the future of dutch troops in afghanistan will merely increase the pressure on nato planners to sketch out possible scenarios for a dutch withdrawal and not lead to a domino effect in other countries .
however , argue experts , since public sentiment is already very pessimistic about the afghan mission , military events on the ground can always have a major impact on public opinion .
bildunterschrift : politicians must better explain the rationale behind the afghan mission , say experts " in most countries a a rather large attack with loss of life would probably push the public to reject military engagement , " said gross .
since that is always possible , governments can only do one thing : " they have to communicate the reasons why we are in afghanistan much better and much more carefully .
i think the dutch withdrawal and the collapse of the government definitely highlights that the european public is unconvinced of the value of the afghan mission and that european politicians have some explaining to do , " she said .

but it is unlikely to trigger a domino effect among other countries who have troops there . by the sheer number of troops , the dutch deployment does n't rank among top international contingents in afghanistan .
however , its force of 1,800 soldiers has not only been in charge of the uruzgan province in the dangerous southern part of the country , but has generally been seen as doing an excellent job there .
so the planned dutch pullout from afghanistan as a consequence of the governmen crisis in the hague will clearly have repercussions for nato 's military mission in the country at a time when most allies are already under pressure to justify their engagement at home .
this has already led to worries about a possible domino effect in the sense that other countries might also feel forced to reconsider their committments to afghanistan .
" it 's true that the afghanistan mission is very unpopular in many european countries , so it is definitely a cause for concern if the dutch withdraw on account of the collapsed government , " eva gross , who heads the eu foreign and security policy program at the institute for european studies at vrije universiteit brussel in belgium , told deutsche welle .
" but to speak of a domino effect may be overstating the case . "
each country in europe has its own dynamics and traditions , therefore gross does n't believe an automatic discussion about troop withdrawals in other eu states is likely .
german troop increase will go ahead for germany , where a parliamentary vote on the expansion of berlin 's afghan mission is scheduled for later this week , the dutch decision wo n't have an immediate effect either , argue experts .
public opinion in germany ca n't be swayed much by the dutch political crisis because a solid majority of germans is already against the military engagement in afghanistan , says klaus-peter schoeppner , head of tns emnid , a major german polling and reseach firm .
while germans are very skeptical about the afghan misson , schoeppner thinks that most of them can live with the exit scenario envisaged by the government .
" so , i do n't think that this topic will gain much traction in germany , " he told deutsche welle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany plans to send up to 850 additional troops to afghanistan what 's more , adds schoeppner , germans do n't view the mission in afghanistan as predominantly a military one .
" we regard ourselves as the number one humanitarian nation , " said schoeppner .
a fast withdrawal from afghanistan would not only end germany 's military , but also its humanitarian responsibilities .
currently there is no indication that this is a likely option for the government , he added .
" i am fairly confindent that the increase of troops will go through in parliament , mainly because the political elites have been in favor of a continuation of the mandate , " said gross .
exit strategies while the dutch withdrawal will not have any imminent effect on the committments of other allies , it will further increase the debate in many countries about timetables and exit strategies .
" we have seen this in discussions already in germany , britain or the united states that the focus is now already much more on finding ways of withdrawing their troops from afghanistan , " said gross .
that could make it hard for nato to find a replacement for dutch troops , if the new government in the hague does in fact decide to withdraw its soldiers .
australia already publicly dismissed a possible leadership role in uruzgan province and canada has said it wants to pull out its troops at the end of next year .
germany , which is currently in charge of the regional command in the north of afghanistan , has repeatedly rejected a german engagement in the south and is unlikely to change that position .
" i think it would be difficult for us to do more in afghanistan , because others leave , " said schoeppner .
if no other countries are willing to take over the dutch role in the south , the us might ultimately be forced to fulfill that task itself .
as an alternative , american officials have aired a possible role for non-nato troops in afghanistan .
but whether such an expansion of the afghan mission is realistic and how it could work is still unclear .
explaining the mission at least for now then , the political turmoil over the future of dutch troops in afghanistan will merely increase the pressure on nato planners to sketch out possible scenarios for a dutch withdrawal and not lead to a domino effect in other countries .
however , argue experts , since public sentiment is already very pessimistic about the afghan mission , military events on the ground can always have a major impact on public opinion .
bildunterschrift : politicians must better explain the rationale behind the afghan mission , say experts " in most countries a a rather large attack with loss of life would probably push the public to reject military engagement , " said gross .
since that is always possible , governments can only do one thing : " they have to communicate the reasons why we are in afghanistan much better and much more carefully .
i think the dutch withdrawal and the collapse of the government definitely highlights that the european public is unconvinced of the value of the afghan mission and that european politicians have some explaining to do , " she said .

yet berlin insists there are concerns that the technology could breach privacy laws . google , which wants to extend its street view panoramic photos to germany later this year , has rejected strong privacy objections raised by the german government .
consumer affairs minister ilse aigner is demanding that the internet giant only displays its imagery after each affected german citizen has given his or her permission .
minister aigner said her staff were consulting with justice ministry officials , with the aim of tightening legislation .
she also demanded that google be ready to make people 's faces , car and house numbers , and even facades unrecognizable .
" a vague picture pixel change is not sufficient , " she said in berlin .

the head of google 's legal department , arnd haller said " we take personal data privacy very seriously .
we 've been discussing privacy issues all over europe , but here in germany the intensity of the questions is really impressive . "
a consultant hired by google , nikolas forgo , who is a hanover professor on informatics law , said a violation of personal rights was improbable .
google has already pledged to disguise car number plates and peoples ' faces .
berlin says google needs individual permission aigner had recently accused google 's service of being on the verge of violating the privacy of millions of citizens , each individually .
she demanded that google seek the permission from each person photographed on streets prior to publication .
street view photos are taken by camera cars which can capture all-round 360-degrees images .
these enable google users to simulate a stroll while sitting at their computers .
google has been gathering images of streets and public spaces in germany since 2008 .
the online service began in 2007 in four cities in the united states .
australia and japan soon followed .
in total google has initiated similar imaging projects in 19 countries , including many in europe .
satellites help pinpoint the panoramic scenes on maps using geo-data systems .
in a special exception for germany , haller said individuals would be able to file an objection with google to seek the removal of recognizable features .

street view for the first time gives you an immersive experience .
you do n't look on a city from the top .
you can visit it and you can look around . "
that does not impress aigner .
she is demanding that google 's panoramic cameras be mounted no higher than 1.8 meters – instead of the current 2.5 meters on camera cars – so that views over fences and walls into residents ' gardens and courtyards are blocked .
other data privacy advocates also point out that potential burglars can use such internet imagery to recognize and target properties .

yet berlin insists there are concerns that the technology could breach privacy laws . google , which wants to extend its street view panoramic photos to germany later this year , has rejected strong privacy objections raised by the german government .
consumer affairs minister ilse aigner is demanding that the internet giant only displays its imagery after each affected german citizen has given his or her permission .
minister aigner said her staff were consulting with justice ministry officials , with the aim of tightening legislation .
she also demanded that google be ready to make people 's faces , car and house numbers , and even facades unrecognizable .
" a vague picture pixel change is not sufficient , " she said in berlin .
" i do not share the company 's assessment that all personal data concerns have been resolved . "
her ministry , she said , had been flooded with calls by citizens worried about protecting their privacy .

the head of google 's legal department , arnd haller said " we take personal data privacy very seriously .

a consultant hired by google , nikolas forgo , who is a hanover professor on informatics law , said a violation of personal rights was improbable .
google has already pledged to disguise car number plates and peoples ' faces .
berlin says google needs individual permission aigner had recently accused google 's service of being on the verge of violating the privacy of millions of citizens , each individually .

street view for the first time gives you an immersive experience .
you do n't look on a city from the top .
you can visit it and you can look around . "
that does not impress aigner .
she is demanding that google 's panoramic cameras be mounted no higher than 1.8 meters – instead of the current 2.5 meters on camera cars – so that views over fences and walls into residents ' gardens and courtyards are blocked .
other data privacy advocates also point out that potential burglars can use such internet imagery to recognize and target properties .

the draft law , which both the german parliament and chancellor angela merkel 's cabinet are to consider in the coming weeks , would cut state-guaranteed prices by 15 percent for energy produced by solar panels on open ground .
it would also cut prices by 16 percent for solar panels on roofs , where 80 percent of solar panels in germany are , and eliminate subsidies for panels placed on arable land .
a previous plan by environment minister norbert roettgen was criticized for not going far enough .
" there must be no more panels installed on arable land , " said peter altmaier , a member of merkel 's christian democrat union -lrb- cdu -rrb- who follows the solar energy sector .
" the objective is to reduce excessive stimulation without hindering an expansion of green energy . "
unintended consequences experts have criticized solar energy subsidies in germany for failing to spur competition in the industry , which accounts for less than one percent of all german electricity production .

germany remains the world leader in solar panel production , but manufacturers have lost billions of euros in recent years and have been forced to cut and outsource jobs .
german group q-cells grew significantly until posting a 1.36-billion euro -lrb- $ 1.84 billion -rrb- net loss in 2009 .
support and opposition the reduction would save german consumers some of the one billion euros they pay per month in fees that underwrite solar energy production , according to hans-peter friedrich , a leader in the cdu 's bavarian sister party , the christian social union .
the law is supported by farmers resentful of investors who bought up arable land only to " harvest the sunshine . "
but the solar panel manufacturing lobby staunchly opposes the cutbacks , and some companies gave employees the day off to protest the law in berlin .

the draft law , which both the german parliament and chancellor angela merkel 's cabinet are to consider in the coming weeks , would cut state-guaranteed prices by 15 percent for energy produced by solar panels on open ground .
it would also cut prices by 16 percent for solar panels on roofs , where 80 percent of solar panels in germany are , and eliminate subsidies for panels placed on arable land .
a previous plan by environment minister norbert roettgen was criticized for not going far enough .
" there must be no more panels installed on arable land , " said peter altmaier , a member of merkel 's christian democrat union -lrb- cdu -rrb- who follows the solar energy sector .
" the objective is to reduce excessive stimulation without hindering an expansion of green energy . "
unintended consequences experts have criticized solar energy subsidies in germany for failing to spur competition in the industry , which accounts for less than one percent of all german electricity production .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : environmental groups have called the law a betrayal of renewable energy the subsidies have also had several unintended consequences : farmers have installed solar panels on their arable fields ; also , the global market has greatly increased , helping manufacturers in china , where labor is cheaper .
germany remains the world leader in solar panel production , but manufacturers have lost billions of euros in recent years and have been forced to cut and outsource jobs .
german group q-cells grew significantly until posting a 1.36-billion euro -lrb- $ 1.84 billion -rrb- net loss in 2009 .
support and opposition the reduction would save german consumers some of the one billion euros they pay per month in fees that underwrite solar energy production , according to hans-peter friedrich , a leader in the cdu 's bavarian sister party , the christian social union .
the law is supported by farmers resentful of investors who bought up arable land only to " harvest the sunshine . "
but the solar panel manufacturing lobby staunchly opposes the cutbacks , and some companies gave employees the day off to protest the law in berlin .

but in the face of criticism and protests , the law wo n't be enforced , says the government . a new law to curb child pornography has come into force in germany , but , in a legal curiosity , it is not going to be used by the courts .
the salient point is that instead of blocking child porn websites , the government now thinks it would better to erase them . the controversial legislation was drafted in 2009 by the former conservative family minister , ursula von der leyen , who said that she was willing to act against " a massive spread of child pornography on the internet . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ursula von der leyen is eager to stop child abuse material on the internet " we are no longer going to tolerate the fact that pictures of children being raped are massively accessed and distributed on the internet in germany , " she said , shortly before introducing the bill to parliament last year . mere symbolism under the new law , the german federal criminal office -lrb- bka -rrb- is supposed to provide a regularly updated list of websites , which they 've found to contain child pornographic pictures and images . german internet providers must then post a red " stop " sign on them , but are not allowed to erase them .
the german law also does n't extend to providers based abroad . christian bahls from the organisation " abuse victims against internet access blocking " accused the government of pursuing " a policy of symbolism , " which he described as " a slap in the face of the victims of child pornography .

the salient point is that instead of blocking child porn websites , the government now thinks it would better to erase them . the controversial legislation was drafted in 2009 by the former conservative family minister , ursula von der leyen , who said that she was willing to act against " a massive spread of child pornography on the internet . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ursula von der leyen is eager to stop child abuse material on the internet " we are no longer going to tolerate the fact that pictures of children being raped are massively accessed and distributed on the internet in germany , " she said , shortly before introducing the bill to parliament last year . mere symbolism under the new law , the german federal criminal office -lrb- bka -rrb- is supposed to provide a regularly updated list of websites , which they 've found to contain child pornographic pictures and images . german internet providers must then post a red " stop " sign on them , but are not allowed to erase them .
the german law also does n't extend to providers based abroad . christian bahls from the organisation " abuse victims against internet access blocking " accused the government of pursuing " a policy of symbolism , " which he described as " a slap in the face of the victims of child pornography . " " the victims of abuse are being abused again , namely as symbols in a questionable government campaign , " he said . freedom vs crime fighting since last summer , there 's been a groundswell of protests by germans who see the law as a first step on the path towards government censorship of the internet . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protestors demanding internet freedom did n't want to listen to the government 's arguments franziska heine has been spearheading a public pressure campaign called " expedition against internet blocking , " which is aimed at forcing parliament to re-introduce the law . about 134.000 germans have signed on to an official petition to parliament pressed by the group . mrs heine claimed that the law was based on " entirely false information " about the distribution of child pornography . " the law has huge repercussion for the freedom of information , but does little to help the victims , " she said . mrs heine 's opinion is supported by police specialists investigating cases of child pornography . frank federau , a member of a special unit at the regional police office in the federal state of lower saxony , believes child abuse material is not primarily exchanged using the internet . " the internet is a channel of communication for paedophiles , but the material as such is distributed on cds and dvds via ordinary mail . " legal doubts wolfgang hoffmann-riem , an expert on constitutional law , even believed that the new law was not in line with the german constitution . " the fact that the federal criminal office has been made responsible for providing the list of websites to be banned , is a clear breach of power-sharing laws in germany . " hoffman-riem pointed out that police in the 16 german federal states were in charge of crime fighting and investigating criminal content on the internet , and that the law infringed upon their duties . in the face of so much criticism , the government has decided to amend the law in the course of the next few months . the new legislation , the government said , would then allow providers to erase child pornography websites . author : uwe hessler editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

soldiers tell of rituals with names like " fire dance " and the " jukebox " . germany 's parliamentary commissioner for the armed forces , reinhold robbe , said he had received 54 written accounts of abuse and degrading treatment since he submitted a report about hazing in the military .
several of the letters he received from soldiers corroborated previous allegations that mountain infantry troops at a camp in bavaria had been forced to drink alcohol and eat raw pork liver until they threw up .
robbe , a member of the social democratic party , demanded that the training curriculum be changed and said that the " dangerous , tasteless rituals must stop . "
fire dances and jukeboxes the new letters also bring to light other forms of hazing .
one former member of the marines said that new sailors were often subjected to harsh rituals during their first nights at sea .
he described the " fire dance , " in which a man was forced to strip off his pants and have a lighted wick placed in his anus ; another in which a floor polishing machine with rough bristles was held against a recruit 's naked bottom until the skin turned red .
a volunteer soldier stationed in southern germany between 1996 and 1998 told of soldiers being forced to play " jukebox , " during which they were shut into a locker , which was then stood upside down , and the occupant forced to sing certain songs .
defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg renewed his promise of a complete investigation .
he did not rule out the possibility of disciplinary action for those involved , although he warned against making an across-the-board judgment .

the two clubs now await a second duel in spain in march . stuttgart made the most of the capacity home crowd at mercedes-benz arena , starting the match energetically and taking it to barcelona .
the early initiative paid dividends when brazilian forward cacau headed in a perfect timo gebhart center ball from the right on the 25-minute mark .
the germans continued to press barcelona 's defense and came close to snatching goals on three more occasions , in addition to an appeal for handball by barca defender gerard pique .
at the outset of the second half , barcelona came out a different team and pulled level within seven minutes through frontman zlatan ibrahimovic .
the opportunity came when stuttgart failed to clear a corner and the ball came back in for pique , who headed down for ibrahimovic to volley home .
the initial shot was parried by stuttgart keeper jens lehmann , but ibrahimovic was able to knock the rebound over the goal line .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cacau 's goal came midway through the first half the catalans dominated the remainder of the clash , a fact stuttgart coach christian gross seized upon .
" we should have scored a second goal in the first half , " gross said following the match .
" we had clear chances . "
barcelona midfielder andreas iniesta was upbeat about the result , saying he was confident the ball was now in barcelona 's court .
" we knew that it was going to be a difficult game , " said the spain international .
" and the truth is that they really made us suffer in the first half .
" now we have the tie in our favor , but there are still 90 minutes left to play . "
