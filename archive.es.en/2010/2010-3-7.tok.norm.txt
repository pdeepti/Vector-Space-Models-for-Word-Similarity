today , the fate of cologne 's most famous landmark lies in her hands . being responsible for the state of a gigantic , 762-year-old building is no easy feat , but for barbara schock-werner it is a day job .
as the master builder of the cologne cathedral , she needs to make executive decisions about all the repair and restoration work that is needed to keep this imposing gothic structure - the world 's third-tallest church - in top form . she divides her work time between her office and the cathedral itself , where she does regular inspections and gives instructions to the workers , ranging from painters and electricians to carpenters and bricklayers .
and managing an annual budget of over six million euros -lrb- $ 8.1 million -rrb- also keeps this energetic 62-year-old on her toes . a woman who made it in the context of this year 's international women 's day , which aims to draw attention to equal rights and equal opportunities , women like schock-werner can be seen as a unique success story in a male-dominated society .
due to a persisting image of traditional gender roles , germany 's women still find it difficult to juggle work and motherhood , let alone rise to the top ranks of corporate hierarchies . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schock-werner is responsible for 80 staff members and a multi-million-euro budget " in the heart , i think we are an old-fashioned society - because people looked at me like i was a miracle , " said schock-werner .
" but do n't think i 'm a miracle .
i 'm only a working woman . " schock-werner believes that the secret to her success was a good education , self-discipline and confidence .
born into family of manual workers in ludwigsburg in southern germany , she was always interested in mathematics and art .
although tertiary education was not considered as an option for women in her family , she managed to get into university and pursued studies in architecture and art history . " i think my father never really understood why i 'm doing all of this , " recalled schock-werner .
" but i still had his support and he helped me in any way he could .
that was important for me . " during her long period of studies , schock-werner got married and managed to finish her phd after giving birth to her son , " working on the thesis while the baby was sleeping . "
three years later , when her daughter was born , she was invited to lecture at a university and with the help of a nanny she managed work on a part-time basis .
she was appointed master builder of the cologne cathedral in 1999 - the first woman ever to hold this position . not a typical case bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : juggling work and motherhood is not easy in germany for a german woman , schock-werner has an unusually successful career .
according to christina klenner - a gender politics expert at the hans boeckler foundation in dusseldorf - germany is a rather conservative country in the field of gender politics , despite the fact that today 's young german women often outperform their male counterparts academically . " behind this is the image of the male breadwinner and the woman who is responsible for the home , " said klenner . this mentality makes juggling motherhood and work a difficult or impossible task for many german women .
childcare facilities are limited and often expensive , while women who leave their children in the care of strangers are often stigmatized and branded as bad mothers .
these are the main reasons why most german women do not resume full-time work after having children . however , it must be noted that that this situation is not the same across the whole country .
in the states that made up the former east germany , child supervision facilities are far more widespread , which is the legacy of the region 's former socialist structures .
not surprisingly , the amount of women between the ages of 20 and 55 with full-time employment is almost two times higher in eastern germany . glass ceiling german-style but even childless women in germany find it harder to reach top positions in the corporate world compared to women in many other western countries .
according to the german institute for economic research -lrb- diw -rrb- , women make up only 2.5 percent of executive board members in germany 's 200 biggest companies .
according to christina klenner , this has something to do with the long-established structures in germany 's corporate world . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : few german women become top executives " this has little to do with women having children or lacking the necessary will or abilities , " explained christina klenner .
" when it 's already an established boys ' club , then it 's very difficult for women to get in .
we 're talking here about male insider relationships at work : one man pulls another man in .
there need to be women there in the first place to support other women . " germany has long been reported to hold a low rank on the european scale of women holding executive positions , lagging far behind countries like norway . klenner believes that women need to show extra courage in order to begin to change these corporate structures .
some need to enter the " lion 's dens , " as she calls them , and set up a base for recruiting more women .
however , she also emphasizes that they should not feel responsible for the discrimination that exists in their society . confidence is important despite her success , barbara schock-werner also recalls cases of discrimination on her way to the top - for example , the time an annual university award went to the best male student in her year , despite the fact that she was the top candidate .
but schock-werner never let incidents like this get her down .
" in the end , it was n't really important , " she said self-assuredly . she believes that confidence is an important factor in getting what you want in life , regardless of circumstances .
young women , she thinks , are often not courageous enough to stand up for themselves . " my female students do n't have enough self-confidence to say , ' here i am .
i want to have a good job .
i want to have a career , " ' said schock-werner .

according to christina klenner - a gender politics expert at the hans boeckler foundation in dusseldorf - germany is a rather conservative country in the field of gender politics , despite the fact that today 's young german women often outperform their male counterparts academically . " behind this is the image of the male breadwinner and the woman who is responsible for the home , " said klenner . this mentality makes juggling motherhood and work a difficult or impossible task for many german women .
childcare facilities are limited and often expensive , while women who leave their children in the care of strangers are often stigmatized and branded as bad mothers .
these are the main reasons why most german women do not resume full-time work after having children . however , it must be noted that that this situation is not the same across the whole country .
in the states that made up the former east germany , child supervision facilities are far more widespread , which is the legacy of the region 's former socialist structures .

we 're talking here about male insider relationships at work : one man pulls another man in .
there need to be women there in the first place to support other women . " germany has long been reported to hold a low rank on the european scale of women holding executive positions , lagging far behind countries like norway . klenner believes that women need to show extra courage in order to begin to change these corporate structures .
some need to enter the " lion 's dens , " as she calls them , and set up a base for recruiting more women .

today , the fate of cologne 's most famous landmark lies in her hands . being responsible for the state of a gigantic , 762-year-old building is no easy feat , but for barbara schock-werner it is a day job .
as the master builder of the cologne cathedral , she needs to make executive decisions about all the repair and restoration work that is needed to keep this imposing gothic structure - the world 's third-tallest church - in top form . she divides her work time between her office and the cathedral itself , where she does regular inspections and gives instructions to the workers , ranging from painters and electricians to carpenters and bricklayers .
and managing an annual budget of over six million euros -lrb- $ 8.1 million -rrb- also keeps this energetic 62-year-old on her toes . a woman who made it in the context of this year 's international women 's day , which aims to draw attention to equal rights and equal opportunities , women like schock-werner can be seen as a unique success story in a male-dominated society .
due to a persisting image of traditional gender roles , germany 's women still find it difficult to juggle work and motherhood , let alone rise to the top ranks of corporate hierarchies . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schock-werner is responsible for 80 staff members and a multi-million-euro budget " in the heart , i think we are an old-fashioned society - because people looked at me like i was a miracle , " said schock-werner .
" but do n't think i 'm a miracle .
i 'm only a working woman . " schock-werner believes that the secret to her success was a good education , self-discipline and confidence .
born into family of manual workers in ludwigsburg in southern germany , she was always interested in mathematics and art .
although tertiary education was not considered as an option for women in her family , she managed to get into university and pursued studies in architecture and art history . " i think my father never really understood why i 'm doing all of this , " recalled schock-werner .
" but i still had his support and he helped me in any way he could .
that was important for me . " during her long period of studies , schock-werner got married and managed to finish her phd after giving birth to her son , " working on the thesis while the baby was sleeping . "
three years later , when her daughter was born , she was invited to lecture at a university and with the help of a nanny she managed work on a part-time basis .
she was appointed master builder of the cologne cathedral in 1999 - the first woman ever to hold this position . not a typical case bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : juggling work and motherhood is not easy in germany for a german woman , schock-werner has an unusually successful career .
according to christina klenner - a gender politics expert at the hans boeckler foundation in dusseldorf - germany is a rather conservative country in the field of gender politics , despite the fact that today 's young german women often outperform their male counterparts academically . " behind this is the image of the male breadwinner and the woman who is responsible for the home , " said klenner . this mentality makes juggling motherhood and work a difficult or impossible task for many german women .
childcare facilities are limited and often expensive , while women who leave their children in the care of strangers are often stigmatized and branded as bad mothers .
these are the main reasons why most german women do not resume full-time work after having children . however , it must be noted that that this situation is not the same across the whole country .
in the states that made up the former east germany , child supervision facilities are far more widespread , which is the legacy of the region 's former socialist structures .
not surprisingly , the amount of women between the ages of 20 and 55 with full-time employment is almost two times higher in eastern germany . glass ceiling german-style but even childless women in germany find it harder to reach top positions in the corporate world compared to women in many other western countries .
according to the german institute for economic research -lrb- diw -rrb- , women make up only 2.5 percent of executive board members in germany 's 200 biggest companies .
according to christina klenner , this has something to do with the long-established structures in germany 's corporate world . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : few german women become top executives " this has little to do with women having children or lacking the necessary will or abilities , " explained christina klenner .
" when it 's already an established boys ' club , then it 's very difficult for women to get in .
we 're talking here about male insider relationships at work : one man pulls another man in .
there need to be women there in the first place to support other women . " germany has long been reported to hold a low rank on the european scale of women holding executive positions , lagging far behind countries like norway . klenner believes that women need to show extra courage in order to begin to change these corporate structures .
some need to enter the " lion 's dens , " as she calls them , and set up a base for recruiting more women .
however , she also emphasizes that they should not feel responsible for the discrimination that exists in their society . confidence is important despite her success , barbara schock-werner also recalls cases of discrimination on her way to the top - for example , the time an annual university award went to the best male student in her year , despite the fact that she was the top candidate .
but schock-werner never let incidents like this get her down .
" in the end , it was n't really important , " she said self-assuredly . she believes that confidence is an important factor in getting what you want in life , regardless of circumstances .
young women , she thinks , are often not courageous enough to stand up for themselves . " my female students do n't have enough self-confidence to say , ' here i am .
i want to have a good job .
i want to have a career , " ' said schock-werner .
" and i 'm always telling them , ' ask for it - do n't be afraid !
you are good enough . " ' author : eva wutke editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the defeat was the first time this season that leverkusen had lost in 25 bundesliga matches .
they remain in third place on 50 points behind schalke and bayern munich , who were held to a 1-1 draw on saturday .
nuremberg 's surprise win puts them in 15th place and out of the relegation zone .
coach dieter hecking praised his team 's outstanding performance .
" it was a wonderful match from my side .
they really fought very hard and deserved the victory , even if they lost the rhythm towards the end .
" choupo-moting really played well .
i was hoping that he would have a match like that at some stage and i am glad it happened , " said hecking .
nuremberg scored three goals before leverkusen mounted a comeback in the last 30 minutes .
eric maxim choupo-moting gave nuremberg the lead three minutes from the break and then scored again from close range on the stroke of half-time .
" i knew they had very good defenders , but i was 100 percent determined to put the ball in the back of the net , " said the 20-year-old striker who is on loan from hamburg .
" it was an important win , but every game is important for us from now on , " said choupo-moting .
nuremberg continued dominating early in the second half and were rewarded for their efforts 10 minutes after the restart when tavares beat germany goalkeeper rene adler with a shot from a marcel risse cross .
germany international stefan kiesling pulled one back for leverkusen in the 66th minute and patrick helmes made it 3-2 seven minutes later with his first goal of the season .
but nuremberg held on and ended leverkusen 's unbeaten run .

aristide bance scored a spectacular goal in the 69th minute after a breakaway , showing off his speed and precision shooting skills .
the burkina faso striker robbed a hoffenheim player of the ball in their half and ran more than half the length of the field before beating hoffenheim 's goalkeeper timo hildebrand .
mainz are now in ninth position with 35 points , while hoffenheim are 11th with 32 points. nrt / ap / afp / dpa editor : tony dunham send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

today , the fate of cologne 's most famous landmark lies in her hands . being responsible for the state of a gigantic , 762-year-old building is no easy feat , but for barbara schock-werner it is a day job .
as the master builder of the cologne cathedral , she needs to make executive decisions about all the repair and restoration work that is needed to keep this imposing gothic structure - the world 's third-tallest church - in top form . she divides her work time between her office and the cathedral itself , where she does regular inspections and gives instructions to the workers , ranging from painters and electricians to carpenters and bricklayers .
and managing an annual budget of over six million euros -lrb- $ 8.1 million -rrb- also keeps this energetic 62-year-old on her toes . a woman who made it in the context of this year 's international women 's day , which aims to draw attention to equal rights and equal opportunities , women like schock-werner can be seen as a unique success story in a male-dominated society .
due to a persisting image of traditional gender roles , germany 's women still find it difficult to juggle work and motherhood , let alone rise to the top ranks of corporate hierarchies . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schock-werner is responsible for 80 staff members and a multi-million-euro budget " in the heart , i think we are an old-fashioned society - because people looked at me like i was a miracle , " said schock-werner .
" but do n't think i 'm a miracle .
i 'm only a working woman . " schock-werner believes that the secret to her success was a good education , self-discipline and confidence .
born into family of manual workers in ludwigsburg in southern germany , she was always interested in mathematics and art .
although tertiary education was not considered as an option for women in her family , she managed to get into university and pursued studies in architecture and art history . " i think my father never really understood why i 'm doing all of this , " recalled schock-werner .
" but i still had his support and he helped me in any way he could .
that was important for me . " during her long period of studies , schock-werner got married and managed to finish her phd after giving birth to her son , " working on the thesis while the baby was sleeping . "
three years later , when her daughter was born , she was invited to lecture at a university and with the help of a nanny she managed work on a part-time basis .
she was appointed master builder of the cologne cathedral in 1999 - the first woman ever to hold this position . not a typical case bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : juggling work and motherhood is not easy in germany for a german woman , schock-werner has an unusually successful career .
according to christina klenner - a gender politics expert at the hans boeckler foundation in dusseldorf - germany is a rather conservative country in the field of gender politics , despite the fact that today 's young german women often outperform their male counterparts academically . " behind this is the image of the male breadwinner and the woman who is responsible for the home , " said klenner . this mentality makes juggling motherhood and work a difficult or impossible task for many german women .
childcare facilities are limited and often expensive , while women who leave their children in the care of strangers are often stigmatized and branded as bad mothers .
these are the main reasons why most german women do not resume full-time work after having children . however , it must be noted that that this situation is not the same across the whole country .
in the states that made up the former east germany , child supervision facilities are far more widespread , which is the legacy of the region 's former socialist structures .
not surprisingly , the amount of women between the ages of 20 and 55 with full-time employment is almost two times higher in eastern germany . glass ceiling german-style but even childless women in germany find it harder to reach top positions in the corporate world compared to women in many other western countries .
according to the german institute for economic research -lrb- diw -rrb- , women make up only 2.5 percent of executive board members in germany 's 200 biggest companies .
according to christina klenner , this has something to do with the long-established structures in germany 's corporate world . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : few german women become top executives " this has little to do with women having children or lacking the necessary will or abilities , " explained christina klenner .
" when it 's already an established boys ' club , then it 's very difficult for women to get in .
we 're talking here about male insider relationships at work : one man pulls another man in .
there need to be women there in the first place to support other women . " germany has long been reported to hold a low rank on the european scale of women holding executive positions , lagging far behind countries like norway . klenner believes that women need to show extra courage in order to begin to change these corporate structures .
some need to enter the " lion 's dens , " as she calls them , and set up a base for recruiting more women .
however , she also emphasizes that they should not feel responsible for the discrimination that exists in their society . confidence is important despite her success , barbara schock-werner also recalls cases of discrimination on her way to the top - for example , the time an annual university award went to the best male student in her year , despite the fact that she was the top candidate .
but schock-werner never let incidents like this get her down .
" in the end , it was n't really important , " she said self-assuredly . she believes that confidence is an important factor in getting what you want in life , regardless of circumstances .
young women , she thinks , are often not courageous enough to stand up for themselves . " my female students do n't have enough self-confidence to say , ' here i am .
i want to have a good job .
i want to have a career , " ' said schock-werner .
" and i 'm always telling them , ' ask for it - do n't be afraid !
you are good enough . " ' author : eva wutke editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

today , the fate of cologne 's most famous landmark lies in her hands . being responsible for the state of a gigantic , 762-year-old building is no easy feat , but for barbara schock-werner it is a day job .
as the master builder of the cologne cathedral , she needs to make executive decisions about all the repair and restoration work that is needed to keep this imposing gothic structure - the world 's third-tallest church - in top form . she divides her work time between her office and the cathedral itself , where she does regular inspections and gives instructions to the workers , ranging from painters and electricians to carpenters and bricklayers .
and managing an annual budget of over six million euros -lrb- $ 8.1 million -rrb- also keeps this energetic 62-year-old on her toes . a woman who made it in the context of this year 's international women 's day , which aims to draw attention to equal rights and equal opportunities , women like schock-werner can be seen as a unique success story in a male-dominated society .
due to a persisting image of traditional gender roles , germany 's women still find it difficult to juggle work and motherhood , let alone rise to the top ranks of corporate hierarchies . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schock-werner is responsible for 80 staff members and a multi-million-euro budget " in the heart , i think we are an old-fashioned society - because people looked at me like i was a miracle , " said schock-werner .
" but do n't think i 'm a miracle .
i 'm only a working woman . " schock-werner believes that the secret to her success was a good education , self-discipline and confidence .
born into family of manual workers in ludwigsburg in southern germany , she was always interested in mathematics and art .
although tertiary education was not considered as an option for women in her family , she managed to get into university and pursued studies in architecture and art history . " i think my father never really understood why i 'm doing all of this , " recalled schock-werner .
" but i still had his support and he helped me in any way he could .
that was important for me . " during her long period of studies , schock-werner got married and managed to finish her phd after giving birth to her son , " working on the thesis while the baby was sleeping . "
three years later , when her daughter was born , she was invited to lecture at a university and with the help of a nanny she managed work on a part-time basis .
she was appointed master builder of the cologne cathedral in 1999 - the first woman ever to hold this position . not a typical case bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : juggling work and motherhood is not easy in germany for a german woman , schock-werner has an unusually successful career .
according to christina klenner - a gender politics expert at the hans boeckler foundation in dusseldorf - germany is a rather conservative country in the field of gender politics , despite the fact that today 's young german women often outperform their male counterparts academically . " behind this is the image of the male breadwinner and the woman who is responsible for the home , " said klenner . this mentality makes juggling motherhood and work a difficult or impossible task for many german women .
childcare facilities are limited and often expensive , while women who leave their children in the care of strangers are often stigmatized and branded as bad mothers .
these are the main reasons why most german women do not resume full-time work after having children . however , it must be noted that that this situation is not the same across the whole country .
in the states that made up the former east germany , child supervision facilities are far more widespread , which is the legacy of the region 's former socialist structures .
not surprisingly , the amount of women between the ages of 20 and 55 with full-time employment is almost two times higher in eastern germany . glass ceiling german-style but even childless women in germany find it harder to reach top positions in the corporate world compared to women in many other western countries .
according to the german institute for economic research -lrb- diw -rrb- , women make up only 2.5 percent of executive board members in germany 's 200 biggest companies .
according to christina klenner , this has something to do with the long-established structures in germany 's corporate world . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : few german women become top executives " this has little to do with women having children or lacking the necessary will or abilities , " explained christina klenner .
" when it 's already an established boys ' club , then it 's very difficult for women to get in .
we 're talking here about male insider relationships at work : one man pulls another man in .
there need to be women there in the first place to support other women . " germany has long been reported to hold a low rank on the european scale of women holding executive positions , lagging far behind countries like norway . klenner believes that women need to show extra courage in order to begin to change these corporate structures .
some need to enter the " lion 's dens , " as she calls them , and set up a base for recruiting more women .
however , she also emphasizes that they should not feel responsible for the discrimination that exists in their society . confidence is important despite her success , barbara schock-werner also recalls cases of discrimination on her way to the top - for example , the time an annual university award went to the best male student in her year , despite the fact that she was the top candidate .
but schock-werner never let incidents like this get her down .
" in the end , it was n't really important , " she said self-assuredly . she believes that confidence is an important factor in getting what you want in life , regardless of circumstances .
young women , she thinks , are often not courageous enough to stand up for themselves . " my female students do n't have enough self-confidence to say , ' here i am .
i want to have a good job .
i want to have a career , " ' said schock-werner .
" and i 'm always telling them , ' ask for it - do n't be afraid !
you are good enough . " ' author : eva wutke editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

today , the fate of cologne 's most famous landmark lies in her hands . being responsible for the state of a gigantic , 762-year-old building is no easy feat , but for barbara schock-werner it is a day job .
as the master builder of the cologne cathedral , she needs to make executive decisions about all the repair and restoration work that is needed to keep this imposing gothic structure - the world 's third-tallest church - in top form . she divides her work time between her office and the cathedral itself , where she does regular inspections and gives instructions to the workers , ranging from painters and electricians to carpenters and bricklayers .
and managing an annual budget of over six million euros -lrb- $ 8.1 million -rrb- also keeps this energetic 62-year-old on her toes . a woman who made it in the context of this year 's international women 's day , which aims to draw attention to equal rights and equal opportunities , women like schock-werner can be seen as a unique success story in a male-dominated society .
due to a persisting image of traditional gender roles , germany 's women still find it difficult to juggle work and motherhood , let alone rise to the top ranks of corporate hierarchies . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schock-werner is responsible for 80 staff members and a multi-million-euro budget " in the heart , i think we are an old-fashioned society - because people looked at me like i was a miracle , " said schock-werner .
" but do n't think i 'm a miracle .
i 'm only a working woman . " schock-werner believes that the secret to her success was a good education , self-discipline and confidence .
born into family of manual workers in ludwigsburg in southern germany , she was always interested in mathematics and art .
although tertiary education was not considered as an option for women in her family , she managed to get into university and pursued studies in architecture and art history . " i think my father never really understood why i 'm doing all of this , " recalled schock-werner .
" but i still had his support and he helped me in any way he could .
that was important for me . " during her long period of studies , schock-werner got married and managed to finish her phd after giving birth to her son , " working on the thesis while the baby was sleeping . "
three years later , when her daughter was born , she was invited to lecture at a university and with the help of a nanny she managed work on a part-time basis .
she was appointed master builder of the cologne cathedral in 1999 - the first woman ever to hold this position . not a typical case bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : juggling work and motherhood is not easy in germany for a german woman , schock-werner has an unusually successful career .
according to christina klenner - a gender politics expert at the hans boeckler foundation in dusseldorf - germany is a rather conservative country in the field of gender politics , despite the fact that today 's young german women often outperform their male counterparts academically . " behind this is the image of the male breadwinner and the woman who is responsible for the home , " said klenner . this mentality makes juggling motherhood and work a difficult or impossible task for many german women .
childcare facilities are limited and often expensive , while women who leave their children in the care of strangers are often stigmatized and branded as bad mothers .
these are the main reasons why most german women do not resume full-time work after having children . however , it must be noted that that this situation is not the same across the whole country .
in the states that made up the former east germany , child supervision facilities are far more widespread , which is the legacy of the region 's former socialist structures .
not surprisingly , the amount of women between the ages of 20 and 55 with full-time employment is almost two times higher in eastern germany . glass ceiling german-style but even childless women in germany find it harder to reach top positions in the corporate world compared to women in many other western countries .
according to the german institute for economic research -lrb- diw -rrb- , women make up only 2.5 percent of executive board members in germany 's 200 biggest companies .
according to christina klenner , this has something to do with the long-established structures in germany 's corporate world . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : few german women become top executives " this has little to do with women having children or lacking the necessary will or abilities , " explained christina klenner .
" when it 's already an established boys ' club , then it 's very difficult for women to get in .
we 're talking here about male insider relationships at work : one man pulls another man in .
there need to be women there in the first place to support other women . " germany has long been reported to hold a low rank on the european scale of women holding executive positions , lagging far behind countries like norway . klenner believes that women need to show extra courage in order to begin to change these corporate structures .
some need to enter the " lion 's dens , " as she calls them , and set up a base for recruiting more women .
however , she also emphasizes that they should not feel responsible for the discrimination that exists in their society . confidence is important despite her success , barbara schock-werner also recalls cases of discrimination on her way to the top - for example , the time an annual university award went to the best male student in her year , despite the fact that she was the top candidate .
but schock-werner never let incidents like this get her down .
" in the end , it was n't really important , " she said self-assuredly . she believes that confidence is an important factor in getting what you want in life , regardless of circumstances .
young women , she thinks , are often not courageous enough to stand up for themselves . " my female students do n't have enough self-confidence to say , ' here i am .
i want to have a good job .
i want to have a career , " ' said schock-werner .

today , the fate of cologne 's most famous landmark lies in her hands . being responsible for the state of a gigantic , 762-year-old building is no easy feat , but for barbara schock-werner it is a day job .
as the master builder of the cologne cathedral , she needs to make executive decisions about all the repair and restoration work that is needed to keep this imposing gothic structure - the world 's third-tallest church - in top form . she divides her work time between her office and the cathedral itself , where she does regular inspections and gives instructions to the workers , ranging from painters and electricians to carpenters and bricklayers .
and managing an annual budget of over six million euros -lrb- $ 8.1 million -rrb- also keeps this energetic 62-year-old on her toes . a woman who made it in the context of this year 's international women 's day , which aims to draw attention to equal rights and equal opportunities , women like schock-werner can be seen as a unique success story in a male-dominated society .
due to a persisting image of traditional gender roles , germany 's women still find it difficult to juggle work and motherhood , let alone rise to the top ranks of corporate hierarchies . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schock-werner is responsible for 80 staff members and a multi-million-euro budget " in the heart , i think we are an old-fashioned society - because people looked at me like i was a miracle , " said schock-werner .
" but do n't think i 'm a miracle .
i 'm only a working woman . " schock-werner believes that the secret to her success was a good education , self-discipline and confidence .
born into family of manual workers in ludwigsburg in southern germany , she was always interested in mathematics and art .
although tertiary education was not considered as an option for women in her family , she managed to get into university and pursued studies in architecture and art history . " i think my father never really understood why i 'm doing all of this , " recalled schock-werner .
" but i still had his support and he helped me in any way he could .
that was important for me . " during her long period of studies , schock-werner got married and managed to finish her phd after giving birth to her son , " working on the thesis while the baby was sleeping . "
three years later , when her daughter was born , she was invited to lecture at a university and with the help of a nanny she managed work on a part-time basis .
she was appointed master builder of the cologne cathedral in 1999 - the first woman ever to hold this position . not a typical case bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : juggling work and motherhood is not easy in germany for a german woman , schock-werner has an unusually successful career .
according to christina klenner - a gender politics expert at the hans boeckler foundation in dusseldorf - germany is a rather conservative country in the field of gender politics , despite the fact that today 's young german women often outperform their male counterparts academically . " behind this is the image of the male breadwinner and the woman who is responsible for the home , " said klenner . this mentality makes juggling motherhood and work a difficult or impossible task for many german women .
childcare facilities are limited and often expensive , while women who leave their children in the care of strangers are often stigmatized and branded as bad mothers .
these are the main reasons why most german women do not resume full-time work after having children . however , it must be noted that that this situation is not the same across the whole country .

' " there must be ' no tolerance ' wherever there was reason to suspect abuse , " german education minister annette schavan told the bild am sonntag newspaper .
the education minister said she would be meeting with ministers and educators in the coming days to discuss preventative measures . schavan 's comments follow allegations by 20 victims that they were sexually violated at the elite odenwald private school in hessen and other recent revelations of child sex abuse by priests in the roman catholic church .
justice minister sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger on sunday repeated her calls for a roundtable discussion with the catholic church .
for the past two weeks she had requested a discussion to address what she described were the " legitimate grievances " of victims and discuss causes and impact of the scandal .

" if more and more people were able to earn their own income , then we might one day no longer need development aid , " niebel said .

icelandic voters have rejected a government proposal to repay 3.9 billion euro to britain and the netherlands after the collapse of the icesave online bank . early referendum results showed that 98 percent of iceland 's 230,000 voters had voted " no " against the deal to repay the uk and dutch governments who compensated icesave 340,000 customers in 2008 - the outcome came as no surprise to the reykjavik government .
" initial figures indicate clearly that the december amendment to the icesave legislation of august 2009 will be repealed , " the government said in a statement just minutes after polling stations closed at 2200 utc .
the online bank icesave , run by the icelandic bank landsbanki , collapsed at the height of the global financial crisis in 2008 . the so-called " icesave bill " was passed by a wafer-thin majority in 2009 .
iceland 's president olafur grimsson then used his power of veto to block the legislation and called a national referendum .
iceland 's " no " vote could hold up payment of the remaining half of a 2.1-billion dollar international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- rescue package .
it could also have a negative impact on the reykjavik government 's bid to join the european union and destabilize prime minister johanna sigurdardottir 's leftwing government .
it could also affect the country 's credit rating .
" this is nothing that comes as a surprise , " sigurdardottir told public broadcaster ruv .
" the result is not a shock for the government , considering the state of affairs , " she added .
ms. sigurdaddottir has ruled out standing down as iceland 's premier and said her government would continue negotiations with britain and the netherlands .

they remain in third place on 50 points behind schalke and bayern munich , who were held to a 1-1 draw on saturday .
nuremberg 's surprise win puts them in 15th place and out of the relegation zone .
coach dieter hecking praised his team 's outstanding performance .
" it was a wonderful match from my side .
they really fought very hard and deserved the victory , even if they lost the rhythm towards the end .
" choupo-moting really played well .
i was hoping that he would have a match like that at some stage and i am glad it happened , " said hecking .
nuremberg scored three goals before leverkusen mounted a comeback in the last 30 minutes .
eric maxim choupo-moting gave nuremberg the lead three minutes from the break and then scored again from close range on the stroke of half-time .
" i knew they had very good defenders , but i was 100 percent determined to put the ball in the back of the net , " said the 20-year-old striker who is on loan from hamburg .
" it was an important win , but every game is important for us from now on , " said choupo-moting .
nuremberg continued dominating early in the second half and were rewarded for their efforts 10 minutes after the restart when tavares beat germany goalkeeper rene adler with a shot from a marcel risse cross .
germany international stefan kiesling pulled one back for leverkusen in the 66th minute and patrick helmes made it 3-2 seven minutes later with his first goal of the season .
but nuremberg held on and ended leverkusen 's unbeaten run .

today , the fate of cologne 's most famous landmark lies in her hands . being responsible for the state of a gigantic , 762-year-old building is no easy feat , but for barbara schock-werner it is a day job .
as the master builder of the cologne cathedral , she needs to make executive decisions about all the repair and restoration work that is needed to keep this imposing gothic structure - the world 's third-tallest church - in top form . she divides her work time between her office and the cathedral itself , where she does regular inspections and gives instructions to the workers , ranging from painters and electricians to carpenters and bricklayers .
and managing an annual budget of over six million euros -lrb- $ 8.1 million -rrb- also keeps this energetic 62-year-old on her toes . a woman who made it in the context of this year 's international women 's day , which aims to draw attention to equal rights and equal opportunities , women like schock-werner can be seen as a unique success story in a male-dominated society .
due to a persisting image of traditional gender roles , germany 's women still find it difficult to juggle work and motherhood , let alone rise to the top ranks of corporate hierarchies . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schock-werner is responsible for 80 staff members and a multi-million-euro budget " in the heart , i think we are an old-fashioned society - because people looked at me like i was a miracle , " said schock-werner .
" but do n't think i 'm a miracle .
i 'm only a working woman . " schock-werner believes that the secret to her success was a good education , self-discipline and confidence .
born into family of manual workers in ludwigsburg in southern germany , she was always interested in mathematics and art .
although tertiary education was not considered as an option for women in her family , she managed to get into university and pursued studies in architecture and art history . " i think my father never really understood why i 'm doing all of this , " recalled schock-werner .
" but i still had his support and he helped me in any way he could .
that was important for me . " during her long period of studies , schock-werner got married and managed to finish her phd after giving birth to her son , " working on the thesis while the baby was sleeping . "
three years later , when her daughter was born , she was invited to lecture at a university and with the help of a nanny she managed work on a part-time basis .
she was appointed master builder of the cologne cathedral in 1999 - the first woman ever to hold this position . not a typical case bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : juggling work and motherhood is not easy in germany for a german woman , schock-werner has an unusually successful career .
according to christina klenner - a gender politics expert at the hans boeckler foundation in dusseldorf - germany is a rather conservative country in the field of gender politics , despite the fact that today 's young german women often outperform their male counterparts academically . " behind this is the image of the male breadwinner and the woman who is responsible for the home , " said klenner . this mentality makes juggling motherhood and work a difficult or impossible task for many german women .
childcare facilities are limited and often expensive , while women who leave their children in the care of strangers are often stigmatized and branded as bad mothers .
these are the main reasons why most german women do not resume full-time work after having children . however , it must be noted that that this situation is not the same across the whole country .
in the states that made up the former east germany , child supervision facilities are far more widespread , which is the legacy of the region 's former socialist structures .
not surprisingly , the amount of women between the ages of 20 and 55 with full-time employment is almost two times higher in eastern germany . glass ceiling german-style but even childless women in germany find it harder to reach top positions in the corporate world compared to women in many other western countries .
according to the german institute for economic research -lrb- diw -rrb- , women make up only 2.5 percent of executive board members in germany 's 200 biggest companies .
according to christina klenner , this has something to do with the long-established structures in germany 's corporate world . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : few german women become top executives " this has little to do with women having children or lacking the necessary will or abilities , " explained christina klenner .
" when it 's already an established boys ' club , then it 's very difficult for women to get in .
we 're talking here about male insider relationships at work : one man pulls another man in .
there need to be women there in the first place to support other women . " germany has long been reported to hold a low rank on the european scale of women holding executive positions , lagging far behind countries like norway . klenner believes that women need to show extra courage in order to begin to change these corporate structures .
some need to enter the " lion 's dens , " as she calls them , and set up a base for recruiting more women .
however , she also emphasizes that they should not feel responsible for the discrimination that exists in their society . confidence is important despite her success , barbara schock-werner also recalls cases of discrimination on her way to the top - for example , the time an annual university award went to the best male student in her year , despite the fact that she was the top candidate .
but schock-werner never let incidents like this get her down .
" in the end , it was n't really important , " she said self-assuredly . she believes that confidence is an important factor in getting what you want in life , regardless of circumstances .
young women , she thinks , are often not courageous enough to stand up for themselves . " my female students do n't have enough self-confidence to say , ' here i am .
i want to have a good job .

today , the fate of cologne 's most famous landmark lies in her hands . being responsible for the state of a gigantic , 762-year-old building is no easy feat , but for barbara schock-werner it is a day job .
as the master builder of the cologne cathedral , she needs to make executive decisions about all the repair and restoration work that is needed to keep this imposing gothic structure - the world 's third-tallest church - in top form . she divides her work time between her office and the cathedral itself , where she does regular inspections and gives instructions to the workers , ranging from painters and electricians to carpenters and bricklayers .
and managing an annual budget of over six million euros -lrb- $ 8.1 million -rrb- also keeps this energetic 62-year-old on her toes . a woman who made it in the context of this year 's international women 's day , which aims to draw attention to equal rights and equal opportunities , women like schock-werner can be seen as a unique success story in a male-dominated society .
due to a persisting image of traditional gender roles , germany 's women still find it difficult to juggle work and motherhood , let alone rise to the top ranks of corporate hierarchies . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schock-werner is responsible for 80 staff members and a multi-million-euro budget " in the heart , i think we are an old-fashioned society - because people looked at me like i was a miracle , " said schock-werner .
" but do n't think i 'm a miracle .
i 'm only a working woman . " schock-werner believes that the secret to her success was a good education , self-discipline and confidence .
born into family of manual workers in ludwigsburg in southern germany , she was always interested in mathematics and art .
although tertiary education was not considered as an option for women in her family , she managed to get into university and pursued studies in architecture and art history . " i think my father never really understood why i 'm doing all of this , " recalled schock-werner .
" but i still had his support and he helped me in any way he could .
that was important for me . " during her long period of studies , schock-werner got married and managed to finish her phd after giving birth to her son , " working on the thesis while the baby was sleeping . "
three years later , when her daughter was born , she was invited to lecture at a university and with the help of a nanny she managed work on a part-time basis .
she was appointed master builder of the cologne cathedral in 1999 - the first woman ever to hold this position . not a typical case bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : juggling work and motherhood is not easy in germany for a german woman , schock-werner has an unusually successful career .
according to christina klenner - a gender politics expert at the hans boeckler foundation in dusseldorf - germany is a rather conservative country in the field of gender politics , despite the fact that today 's young german women often outperform their male counterparts academically . " behind this is the image of the male breadwinner and the woman who is responsible for the home , " said klenner . this mentality makes juggling motherhood and work a difficult or impossible task for many german women .
childcare facilities are limited and often expensive , while women who leave their children in the care of strangers are often stigmatized and branded as bad mothers .
these are the main reasons why most german women do not resume full-time work after having children . however , it must be noted that that this situation is not the same across the whole country .
in the states that made up the former east germany , child supervision facilities are far more widespread , which is the legacy of the region 's former socialist structures .
not surprisingly , the amount of women between the ages of 20 and 55 with full-time employment is almost two times higher in eastern germany . glass ceiling german-style but even childless women in germany find it harder to reach top positions in the corporate world compared to women in many other western countries .
according to the german institute for economic research -lrb- diw -rrb- , women make up only 2.5 percent of executive board members in germany 's 200 biggest companies .
according to christina klenner , this has something to do with the long-established structures in germany 's corporate world . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : few german women become top executives " this has little to do with women having children or lacking the necessary will or abilities , " explained christina klenner .
" when it 's already an established boys ' club , then it 's very difficult for women to get in .
we 're talking here about male insider relationships at work : one man pulls another man in .
there need to be women there in the first place to support other women . " germany has long been reported to hold a low rank on the european scale of women holding executive positions , lagging far behind countries like norway . klenner believes that women need to show extra courage in order to begin to change these corporate structures .
some need to enter the " lion 's dens , " as she calls them , and set up a base for recruiting more women .
however , she also emphasizes that they should not feel responsible for the discrimination that exists in their society . confidence is important despite her success , barbara schock-werner also recalls cases of discrimination on her way to the top - for example , the time an annual university award went to the best male student in her year , despite the fact that she was the top candidate .

today , the fate of cologne 's most famous landmark lies in her hands . being responsible for the state of a gigantic , 762-year-old building is no easy feat , but for barbara schock-werner it is a day job .
as the master builder of the cologne cathedral , she needs to make executive decisions about all the repair and restoration work that is needed to keep this imposing gothic structure - the world 's third-tallest church - in top form . she divides her work time between her office and the cathedral itself , where she does regular inspections and gives instructions to the workers , ranging from painters and electricians to carpenters and bricklayers .
and managing an annual budget of over six million euros -lrb- $ 8.1 million -rrb- also keeps this energetic 62-year-old on her toes . a woman who made it in the context of this year 's international women 's day , which aims to draw attention to equal rights and equal opportunities , women like schock-werner can be seen as a unique success story in a male-dominated society .
due to a persisting image of traditional gender roles , germany 's women still find it difficult to juggle work and motherhood , let alone rise to the top ranks of corporate hierarchies . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schock-werner is responsible for 80 staff members and a multi-million-euro budget " in the heart , i think we are an old-fashioned society - because people looked at me like i was a miracle , " said schock-werner .
" but do n't think i 'm a miracle .
i 'm only a working woman . " schock-werner believes that the secret to her success was a good education , self-discipline and confidence .
born into family of manual workers in ludwigsburg in southern germany , she was always interested in mathematics and art .
although tertiary education was not considered as an option for women in her family , she managed to get into university and pursued studies in architecture and art history . " i think my father never really understood why i 'm doing all of this , " recalled schock-werner .
" but i still had his support and he helped me in any way he could .
that was important for me . " during her long period of studies , schock-werner got married and managed to finish her phd after giving birth to her son , " working on the thesis while the baby was sleeping . "
three years later , when her daughter was born , she was invited to lecture at a university and with the help of a nanny she managed work on a part-time basis .
she was appointed master builder of the cologne cathedral in 1999 - the first woman ever to hold this position . not a typical case bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : juggling work and motherhood is not easy in germany for a german woman , schock-werner has an unusually successful career .
according to christina klenner - a gender politics expert at the hans boeckler foundation in dusseldorf - germany is a rather conservative country in the field of gender politics , despite the fact that today 's young german women often outperform their male counterparts academically . " behind this is the image of the male breadwinner and the woman who is responsible for the home , " said klenner . this mentality makes juggling motherhood and work a difficult or impossible task for many german women .
childcare facilities are limited and often expensive , while women who leave their children in the care of strangers are often stigmatized and branded as bad mothers .
these are the main reasons why most german women do not resume full-time work after having children . however , it must be noted that that this situation is not the same across the whole country .
in the states that made up the former east germany , child supervision facilities are far more widespread , which is the legacy of the region 's former socialist structures .
not surprisingly , the amount of women between the ages of 20 and 55 with full-time employment is almost two times higher in eastern germany . glass ceiling german-style but even childless women in germany find it harder to reach top positions in the corporate world compared to women in many other western countries .
according to the german institute for economic research -lrb- diw -rrb- , women make up only 2.5 percent of executive board members in germany 's 200 biggest companies .
according to christina klenner , this has something to do with the long-established structures in germany 's corporate world . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : few german women become top executives " this has little to do with women having children or lacking the necessary will or abilities , " explained christina klenner .
" when it 's already an established boys ' club , then it 's very difficult for women to get in .
we 're talking here about male insider relationships at work : one man pulls another man in .
there need to be women there in the first place to support other women . " germany has long been reported to hold a low rank on the european scale of women holding executive positions , lagging far behind countries like norway . klenner believes that women need to show extra courage in order to begin to change these corporate structures .
some need to enter the " lion 's dens , " as she calls them , and set up a base for recruiting more women .
however , she also emphasizes that they should not feel responsible for the discrimination that exists in their society . confidence is important despite her success , barbara schock-werner also recalls cases of discrimination on her way to the top - for example , the time an annual university award went to the best male student in her year , despite the fact that she was the top candidate .
but schock-werner never let incidents like this get her down .
" in the end , it was n't really important , " she said self-assuredly . she believes that confidence is an important factor in getting what you want in life , regardless of circumstances .
young women , she thinks , are often not courageous enough to stand up for themselves . " my female students do n't have enough self-confidence to say , ' here i am .
i want to have a good job .
i want to have a career , " ' said schock-werner .

that 's an increase of 250 million euros on 2009 .
germany 's ruling coalition of christian democrats and free democrats passed its first budget last friday .
it sees berlin taking on a record 80.2 billion euros in new debt .

niebel will visit vietnam and cambodia to discuss how they dealing with the financial and economic crisis . he will also discuss climate protection and development aid .
" if more and more people were able to earn their own income , then we might one day no longer need development aid , " niebel said .

he also expressed doubt whether germany would be able to increase aid to 0.7 percent of gdp by 2015 . dirk niebel said the recently presented 2010 federal budget was 3.5 billion euros short of meeting the country 's commitments of providing 0.51 percent of gdp for development aid .
6.1 billion euros have been allocated towards development aid this year .
that 's an increase of 250 million euros on 2009 .
germany 's ruling coalition of christian democrats and free democrats passed its first budget last friday .
it sees berlin taking on a record 80.2 billion euros in new debt .

niebel will visit vietnam and cambodia to discuss how they dealing with the financial and economic crisis . he will also discuss climate protection and development aid .
" if more and more people were able to earn their own income , then we might one day no longer need development aid , " niebel said .
his comments sparked strong reactions from the minor parties .
" he is simply throwing overboard hard-won promises of minimum levels of aid commitments , without any opposition , " said claudia roth , the chairwoman of the green party. wl / epd / apn / dpa / afp editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the more that we try to repress symbols of other religions in public life , the more the danger grows that there will be successful attacks on christian symbols in public , everyday life , " thomas de maiziere told germany 's bild am sonntag newspaper .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : interior minister thomas de maiziere urged caution the minister , who is a member of angela merkel 's christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- , said that he would have no problem with a female worker in his ministry wearing a headscarf as an expression of religious belief .
but if the headscarf was being used to express an aggressive stance " that sets itself against what a federal interior ministry represents , " maiziere said it should be forbidden .
according to the cdu politician , the decisions should be based on whether the behavior and appearance of an employee was " appropriate . "
he added that the same principles on what is correct should be applied as they would be to the wearing of flip-flops or hawaiian shirts .
in germany , most states have passed laws that ban teachers from wearing headscarves in schools .
prohibition across europe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : de maiziere says he is against a repression of religious symbols maiziere 's comments came as several european countries were considering imposing bans on the head-to-toe islamic veil .
a french ban on the wearing of full-body coverings in public is already being sought by prime minister francois fillon , who wrote to the country 's highest administrative court asking it to " study the legal solutions enabling us to reach a ban . "
in the netherlands , the anti-immigration freedom party -lrb- pw -rrb- and its controversial leader , geer wilders , have called for such veils to be banned in many public buildings .
even though the pw scored gains in local elections last week , there are doubts about whether a proposed ban in city council buildings would be legal .
denmark has rejected an outright ban but schools , businesses and other organizations have been allowed to put their own restrictions in place. rc / kna / afp / reuters editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the 54-year-old has made more than 20 movies to date , and won all of the country 's most important film prizes .
she also stages operas , writes novels , short stories and children 's books and works as a professor at the university of television and film in munich .
doris dörrie was born in 1955 in hanover , the capital of the state of lower saxony .
after studying film and theater in the us for two years , she returned to germany in 1975 .
her first projects were documentary films , but she also began making feature films in 1981 .
she represented germany at the venice film festival with her first film for cinema , " mitten ins herz " , or " straight through the heart " .
her international breakthrough came in 1986 with the movie " männer " , or " men " .
five million people went to see it germany alone , and its success brought dörrie to the attention of hollywood .
but the director prefers to work in germany and not expose her work to the constraints of large-scale us productions .
the complex relationships between affluent members of german society is a subject dörrie returns to time and time again .
when her first husband died on the film set in 1996 , she sensed her interest in buddhism grow , and the subjects of death , grieving and parting appeared more frequently in her work .
she is also fascinated by japan , and three of her films are set there .
today , dörrie lives in the allgäu region of bavaria , a place the woman from northern germany now calls her adoptive home . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

icelandic voters have rejected a government proposal to repay 3.9 billion euro to britain and the netherlands after the collapse of the icesave online bank . early referendum results showed that 98 percent of iceland 's 230,000 voters had voted " no " against the deal to repay the uk and dutch governments who compensated icesave 340,000 customers in 2008 - the outcome came as no surprise to the reykjavik government .
" initial figures indicate clearly that the december amendment to the icesave legislation of august 2009 will be repealed , " the government said in a statement just minutes after polling stations closed at 2200 utc .
the online bank icesave , run by the icelandic bank landsbanki , collapsed at the height of the global financial crisis in 2008 . the so-called " icesave bill " was passed by a wafer-thin majority in 2009 .
iceland 's president olafur grimsson then used his power of veto to block the legislation and called a national referendum .

it could also affect the country 's credit rating .
" this is nothing that comes as a surprise , " sigurdardottir told public broadcaster ruv .

the defeat was the first time this season that leverkusen had lost in 25 bundesliga matches .
they remain in third place on 50 points behind schalke and bayern munich , who were held to a 1-1 draw on saturday .
nuremberg 's surprise win puts them in 15th place and out of the relegation zone .
coach dieter hecking praised his team 's outstanding performance .
" it was a wonderful match from my side .
they really fought very hard and deserved the victory , even if they lost the rhythm towards the end .
" choupo-moting really played well .
i was hoping that he would have a match like that at some stage and i am glad it happened , " said hecking .
nuremberg scored three goals before leverkusen mounted a comeback in the last 30 minutes .
eric maxim choupo-moting gave nuremberg the lead three minutes from the break and then scored again from close range on the stroke of half-time .
" i knew they had very good defenders , but i was 100 percent determined to put the ball in the back of the net , " said the 20-year-old striker who is on loan from hamburg .
" it was an important win , but every game is important for us from now on , " said choupo-moting .
nuremberg continued dominating early in the second half and were rewarded for their efforts 10 minutes after the restart when tavares beat germany goalkeeper rene adler with a shot from a marcel risse cross .
germany international stefan kiesling pulled one back for leverkusen in the 66th minute and patrick helmes made it 3-2 seven minutes later with his first goal of the season .
but nuremberg held on and ended leverkusen 's unbeaten run .

' " there must be ' no tolerance ' wherever there was reason to suspect abuse , " german education minister annette schavan told the bild am sonntag newspaper .
the education minister said she would be meeting with ministers and educators in the coming days to discuss preventative measures . schavan 's comments follow allegations by 20 victims that they were sexually violated at the elite odenwald private school in hessen and other recent revelations of child sex abuse by priests in the roman catholic church .
justice minister sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger on sunday repeated her calls for a roundtable discussion with the catholic church .
for the past two weeks she had requested a discussion to address what she described were the " legitimate grievances " of victims and discuss causes and impact of the scandal .
the catholic church has so far repeatedly rejected the justice minister 's request , which she issued two week ago , to attend any such a panel meeting .
the chairman of the german bishops ' conference , robert zollitsch , said last sunday that such a discussion would only be appropriate if all relevant parties attended. wl / dpa / afp editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

today , the fate of cologne 's most famous landmark lies in her hands . being responsible for the state of a gigantic , 762-year-old building is no easy feat , but for barbara schock-werner it is a day job .
as the master builder of the cologne cathedral , she needs to make executive decisions about all the repair and restoration work that is needed to keep this imposing gothic structure - the world 's third-tallest church - in top form . she divides her work time between her office and the cathedral itself , where she does regular inspections and gives instructions to the workers , ranging from painters and electricians to carpenters and bricklayers .
and managing an annual budget of over six million euros -lrb- $ 8.1 million -rrb- also keeps this energetic 62-year-old on her toes . a woman who made it in the context of this year 's international women 's day , which aims to draw attention to equal rights and equal opportunities , women like schock-werner can be seen as a unique success story in a male-dominated society .
due to a persisting image of traditional gender roles , germany 's women still find it difficult to juggle work and motherhood , let alone rise to the top ranks of corporate hierarchies . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schock-werner is responsible for 80 staff members and a multi-million-euro budget " in the heart , i think we are an old-fashioned society - because people looked at me like i was a miracle , " said schock-werner .
" but do n't think i 'm a miracle .
i 'm only a working woman . " schock-werner believes that the secret to her success was a good education , self-discipline and confidence .
born into family of manual workers in ludwigsburg in southern germany , she was always interested in mathematics and art .
although tertiary education was not considered as an option for women in her family , she managed to get into university and pursued studies in architecture and art history . " i think my father never really understood why i 'm doing all of this , " recalled schock-werner .
" but i still had his support and he helped me in any way he could .
that was important for me . " during her long period of studies , schock-werner got married and managed to finish her phd after giving birth to her son , " working on the thesis while the baby was sleeping . "
three years later , when her daughter was born , she was invited to lecture at a university and with the help of a nanny she managed work on a part-time basis .
she was appointed master builder of the cologne cathedral in 1999 - the first woman ever to hold this position . not a typical case bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : juggling work and motherhood is not easy in germany for a german woman , schock-werner has an unusually successful career .
according to christina klenner - a gender politics expert at the hans boeckler foundation in dusseldorf - germany is a rather conservative country in the field of gender politics , despite the fact that today 's young german women often outperform their male counterparts academically . " behind this is the image of the male breadwinner and the woman who is responsible for the home , " said klenner . this mentality makes juggling motherhood and work a difficult or impossible task for many german women .
childcare facilities are limited and often expensive , while women who leave their children in the care of strangers are often stigmatized and branded as bad mothers .
these are the main reasons why most german women do not resume full-time work after having children . however , it must be noted that that this situation is not the same across the whole country .
in the states that made up the former east germany , child supervision facilities are far more widespread , which is the legacy of the region 's former socialist structures .
not surprisingly , the amount of women between the ages of 20 and 55 with full-time employment is almost two times higher in eastern germany . glass ceiling german-style but even childless women in germany find it harder to reach top positions in the corporate world compared to women in many other western countries .
according to the german institute for economic research -lrb- diw -rrb- , women make up only 2.5 percent of executive board members in germany 's 200 biggest companies .
according to christina klenner , this has something to do with the long-established structures in germany 's corporate world . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : few german women become top executives " this has little to do with women having children or lacking the necessary will or abilities , " explained christina klenner .
" when it 's already an established boys ' club , then it 's very difficult for women to get in .
we 're talking here about male insider relationships at work : one man pulls another man in .
there need to be women there in the first place to support other women . " germany has long been reported to hold a low rank on the european scale of women holding executive positions , lagging far behind countries like norway . klenner believes that women need to show extra courage in order to begin to change these corporate structures .
some need to enter the " lion 's dens , " as she calls them , and set up a base for recruiting more women .
however , she also emphasizes that they should not feel responsible for the discrimination that exists in their society . confidence is important despite her success , barbara schock-werner also recalls cases of discrimination on her way to the top - for example , the time an annual university award went to the best male student in her year , despite the fact that she was the top candidate .

i want to have a good job .
i want to have a career , " ' said schock-werner .
" and i 'm always telling them , ' ask for it - do n't be afraid !
you are good enough . " ' author : eva wutke editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

' " there must be ' no tolerance ' wherever there was reason to suspect abuse , " german education minister annette schavan told the bild am sonntag newspaper .
the education minister said she would be meeting with ministers and educators in the coming days to discuss preventative measures . schavan 's comments follow allegations by 20 victims that they were sexually violated at the elite odenwald private school in hessen and other recent revelations of child sex abuse by priests in the roman catholic church .
justice minister sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger on sunday repeated her calls for a roundtable discussion with the catholic church .
for the past two weeks she had requested a discussion to address what she described were the " legitimate grievances " of victims and discuss causes and impact of the scandal .
the catholic church has so far repeatedly rejected the justice minister 's request , which she issued two week ago , to attend any such a panel meeting .
the chairman of the german bishops ' conference , robert zollitsch , said last sunday that such a discussion would only be appropriate if all relevant parties attended. wl / dpa / afp editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he also expressed doubt whether germany would be able to increase aid to 0.7 percent of gdp by 2015 . dirk niebel said the recently presented 2010 federal budget was 3.5 billion euros short of meeting the country 's commitments of providing 0.51 percent of gdp for development aid .
6.1 billion euros have been allocated towards development aid this year .
that 's an increase of 250 million euros on 2009 .
germany 's ruling coalition of christian democrats and free democrats passed its first budget last friday .
it sees berlin taking on a record 80.2 billion euros in new debt .
given the massive borrowings , any subsequent increases for development aid programs are unlikely .
" we will have to talk with our partners about what is more important : aid volume or its effectiveness , " niebel told the " hamburger abendblatt " newspaper .

before departing on a six-day trip to southeast asia this sunday , niebel said that he would rather make it easier for german companies to invest in countries in the region .
niebel will visit vietnam and cambodia to discuss how they dealing with the financial and economic crisis . he will also discuss climate protection and development aid .
" if more and more people were able to earn their own income , then we might one day no longer need development aid , " niebel said .

today , the fate of cologne 's most famous landmark lies in her hands . being responsible for the state of a gigantic , 762-year-old building is no easy feat , but for barbara schock-werner it is a day job .
as the master builder of the cologne cathedral , she needs to make executive decisions about all the repair and restoration work that is needed to keep this imposing gothic structure - the world 's third-tallest church - in top form . she divides her work time between her office and the cathedral itself , where she does regular inspections and gives instructions to the workers , ranging from painters and electricians to carpenters and bricklayers .
and managing an annual budget of over six million euros -lrb- $ 8.1 million -rrb- also keeps this energetic 62-year-old on her toes . a woman who made it in the context of this year 's international women 's day , which aims to draw attention to equal rights and equal opportunities , women like schock-werner can be seen as a unique success story in a male-dominated society .
due to a persisting image of traditional gender roles , germany 's women still find it difficult to juggle work and motherhood , let alone rise to the top ranks of corporate hierarchies . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schock-werner is responsible for 80 staff members and a multi-million-euro budget " in the heart , i think we are an old-fashioned society - because people looked at me like i was a miracle , " said schock-werner .
" but do n't think i 'm a miracle .
i 'm only a working woman . " schock-werner believes that the secret to her success was a good education , self-discipline and confidence .
born into family of manual workers in ludwigsburg in southern germany , she was always interested in mathematics and art .
although tertiary education was not considered as an option for women in her family , she managed to get into university and pursued studies in architecture and art history . " i think my father never really understood why i 'm doing all of this , " recalled schock-werner .
" but i still had his support and he helped me in any way he could .
that was important for me . " during her long period of studies , schock-werner got married and managed to finish her phd after giving birth to her son , " working on the thesis while the baby was sleeping . "
three years later , when her daughter was born , she was invited to lecture at a university and with the help of a nanny she managed work on a part-time basis .
she was appointed master builder of the cologne cathedral in 1999 - the first woman ever to hold this position . not a typical case bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : juggling work and motherhood is not easy in germany for a german woman , schock-werner has an unusually successful career .
according to christina klenner - a gender politics expert at the hans boeckler foundation in dusseldorf - germany is a rather conservative country in the field of gender politics , despite the fact that today 's young german women often outperform their male counterparts academically . " behind this is the image of the male breadwinner and the woman who is responsible for the home , " said klenner . this mentality makes juggling motherhood and work a difficult or impossible task for many german women .
childcare facilities are limited and often expensive , while women who leave their children in the care of strangers are often stigmatized and branded as bad mothers .
these are the main reasons why most german women do not resume full-time work after having children . however , it must be noted that that this situation is not the same across the whole country .
in the states that made up the former east germany , child supervision facilities are far more widespread , which is the legacy of the region 's former socialist structures .
not surprisingly , the amount of women between the ages of 20 and 55 with full-time employment is almost two times higher in eastern germany . glass ceiling german-style but even childless women in germany find it harder to reach top positions in the corporate world compared to women in many other western countries .
according to the german institute for economic research -lrb- diw -rrb- , women make up only 2.5 percent of executive board members in germany 's 200 biggest companies .
according to christina klenner , this has something to do with the long-established structures in germany 's corporate world . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : few german women become top executives " this has little to do with women having children or lacking the necessary will or abilities , " explained christina klenner .
" when it 's already an established boys ' club , then it 's very difficult for women to get in .
we 're talking here about male insider relationships at work : one man pulls another man in .
there need to be women there in the first place to support other women . " germany has long been reported to hold a low rank on the european scale of women holding executive positions , lagging far behind countries like norway . klenner believes that women need to show extra courage in order to begin to change these corporate structures .
some need to enter the " lion 's dens , " as she calls them , and set up a base for recruiting more women .
however , she also emphasizes that they should not feel responsible for the discrimination that exists in their society . confidence is important despite her success , barbara schock-werner also recalls cases of discrimination on her way to the top - for example , the time an annual university award went to the best male student in her year , despite the fact that she was the top candidate .
but schock-werner never let incidents like this get her down .
" in the end , it was n't really important , " she said self-assuredly . she believes that confidence is an important factor in getting what you want in life , regardless of circumstances .
young women , she thinks , are often not courageous enough to stand up for themselves . " my female students do n't have enough self-confidence to say , ' here i am .
i want to have a good job .
i want to have a career , " ' said schock-werner .
" and i 'm always telling them , ' ask for it - do n't be afraid !
you are good enough . " ' author : eva wutke editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

' " there must be ' no tolerance ' wherever there was reason to suspect abuse , " german education minister annette schavan told the bild am sonntag newspaper .
the education minister said she would be meeting with ministers and educators in the coming days to discuss preventative measures . schavan 's comments follow allegations by 20 victims that they were sexually violated at the elite odenwald private school in hessen and other recent revelations of child sex abuse by priests in the roman catholic church .
justice minister sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger on sunday repeated her calls for a roundtable discussion with the catholic church .
for the past two weeks she had requested a discussion to address what she described were the " legitimate grievances " of victims and discuss causes and impact of the scandal .
the catholic church has so far repeatedly rejected the justice minister 's request , which she issued two week ago , to attend any such a panel meeting .
the chairman of the german bishops ' conference , robert zollitsch , said last sunday that such a discussion would only be appropriate if all relevant parties attended. wl / dpa / afp editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

today , the fate of cologne 's most famous landmark lies in her hands . being responsible for the state of a gigantic , 762-year-old building is no easy feat , but for barbara schock-werner it is a day job .
as the master builder of the cologne cathedral , she needs to make executive decisions about all the repair and restoration work that is needed to keep this imposing gothic structure - the world 's third-tallest church - in top form . she divides her work time between her office and the cathedral itself , where she does regular inspections and gives instructions to the workers , ranging from painters and electricians to carpenters and bricklayers .
and managing an annual budget of over six million euros -lrb- $ 8.1 million -rrb- also keeps this energetic 62-year-old on her toes . a woman who made it in the context of this year 's international women 's day , which aims to draw attention to equal rights and equal opportunities , women like schock-werner can be seen as a unique success story in a male-dominated society .
due to a persisting image of traditional gender roles , germany 's women still find it difficult to juggle work and motherhood , let alone rise to the top ranks of corporate hierarchies . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schock-werner is responsible for 80 staff members and a multi-million-euro budget " in the heart , i think we are an old-fashioned society - because people looked at me like i was a miracle , " said schock-werner .
" but do n't think i 'm a miracle .
i 'm only a working woman . " schock-werner believes that the secret to her success was a good education , self-discipline and confidence .
born into family of manual workers in ludwigsburg in southern germany , she was always interested in mathematics and art .
although tertiary education was not considered as an option for women in her family , she managed to get into university and pursued studies in architecture and art history . " i think my father never really understood why i 'm doing all of this , " recalled schock-werner .
" but i still had his support and he helped me in any way he could .
that was important for me . " during her long period of studies , schock-werner got married and managed to finish her phd after giving birth to her son , " working on the thesis while the baby was sleeping . "
three years later , when her daughter was born , she was invited to lecture at a university and with the help of a nanny she managed work on a part-time basis .
she was appointed master builder of the cologne cathedral in 1999 - the first woman ever to hold this position . not a typical case bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : juggling work and motherhood is not easy in germany for a german woman , schock-werner has an unusually successful career .
according to christina klenner - a gender politics expert at the hans boeckler foundation in dusseldorf - germany is a rather conservative country in the field of gender politics , despite the fact that today 's young german women often outperform their male counterparts academically . " behind this is the image of the male breadwinner and the woman who is responsible for the home , " said klenner . this mentality makes juggling motherhood and work a difficult or impossible task for many german women .
childcare facilities are limited and often expensive , while women who leave their children in the care of strangers are often stigmatized and branded as bad mothers .
these are the main reasons why most german women do not resume full-time work after having children . however , it must be noted that that this situation is not the same across the whole country .
in the states that made up the former east germany , child supervision facilities are far more widespread , which is the legacy of the region 's former socialist structures .
not surprisingly , the amount of women between the ages of 20 and 55 with full-time employment is almost two times higher in eastern germany . glass ceiling german-style but even childless women in germany find it harder to reach top positions in the corporate world compared to women in many other western countries .
according to the german institute for economic research -lrb- diw -rrb- , women make up only 2.5 percent of executive board members in germany 's 200 biggest companies .
according to christina klenner , this has something to do with the long-established structures in germany 's corporate world . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : few german women become top executives " this has little to do with women having children or lacking the necessary will or abilities , " explained christina klenner .
" when it 's already an established boys ' club , then it 's very difficult for women to get in .
we 're talking here about male insider relationships at work : one man pulls another man in .
there need to be women there in the first place to support other women . " germany has long been reported to hold a low rank on the european scale of women holding executive positions , lagging far behind countries like norway . klenner believes that women need to show extra courage in order to begin to change these corporate structures .
some need to enter the " lion 's dens , " as she calls them , and set up a base for recruiting more women .
however , she also emphasizes that they should not feel responsible for the discrimination that exists in their society . confidence is important despite her success , barbara schock-werner also recalls cases of discrimination on her way to the top - for example , the time an annual university award went to the best male student in her year , despite the fact that she was the top candidate .
but schock-werner never let incidents like this get her down .
" in the end , it was n't really important , " she said self-assuredly . she believes that confidence is an important factor in getting what you want in life , regardless of circumstances .
young women , she thinks , are often not courageous enough to stand up for themselves . " my female students do n't have enough self-confidence to say , ' here i am .
i want to have a good job .
i want to have a career , " ' said schock-werner .

today , the fate of cologne 's most famous landmark lies in her hands . being responsible for the state of a gigantic , 762-year-old building is no easy feat , but for barbara schock-werner it is a day job .
as the master builder of the cologne cathedral , she needs to make executive decisions about all the repair and restoration work that is needed to keep this imposing gothic structure - the world 's third-tallest church - in top form . she divides her work time between her office and the cathedral itself , where she does regular inspections and gives instructions to the workers , ranging from painters and electricians to carpenters and bricklayers .
and managing an annual budget of over six million euros -lrb- $ 8.1 million -rrb- also keeps this energetic 62-year-old on her toes . a woman who made it in the context of this year 's international women 's day , which aims to draw attention to equal rights and equal opportunities , women like schock-werner can be seen as a unique success story in a male-dominated society .
due to a persisting image of traditional gender roles , germany 's women still find it difficult to juggle work and motherhood , let alone rise to the top ranks of corporate hierarchies . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schock-werner is responsible for 80 staff members and a multi-million-euro budget " in the heart , i think we are an old-fashioned society - because people looked at me like i was a miracle , " said schock-werner .
" but do n't think i 'm a miracle .
i 'm only a working woman . " schock-werner believes that the secret to her success was a good education , self-discipline and confidence .
born into family of manual workers in ludwigsburg in southern germany , she was always interested in mathematics and art .
although tertiary education was not considered as an option for women in her family , she managed to get into university and pursued studies in architecture and art history . " i think my father never really understood why i 'm doing all of this , " recalled schock-werner .
" but i still had his support and he helped me in any way he could .
that was important for me . " during her long period of studies , schock-werner got married and managed to finish her phd after giving birth to her son , " working on the thesis while the baby was sleeping . "
three years later , when her daughter was born , she was invited to lecture at a university and with the help of a nanny she managed work on a part-time basis .
she was appointed master builder of the cologne cathedral in 1999 - the first woman ever to hold this position . not a typical case bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : juggling work and motherhood is not easy in germany for a german woman , schock-werner has an unusually successful career .
according to christina klenner - a gender politics expert at the hans boeckler foundation in dusseldorf - germany is a rather conservative country in the field of gender politics , despite the fact that today 's young german women often outperform their male counterparts academically . " behind this is the image of the male breadwinner and the woman who is responsible for the home , " said klenner . this mentality makes juggling motherhood and work a difficult or impossible task for many german women .
childcare facilities are limited and often expensive , while women who leave their children in the care of strangers are often stigmatized and branded as bad mothers .
these are the main reasons why most german women do not resume full-time work after having children . however , it must be noted that that this situation is not the same across the whole country .
in the states that made up the former east germany , child supervision facilities are far more widespread , which is the legacy of the region 's former socialist structures .
not surprisingly , the amount of women between the ages of 20 and 55 with full-time employment is almost two times higher in eastern germany . glass ceiling german-style but even childless women in germany find it harder to reach top positions in the corporate world compared to women in many other western countries .
according to the german institute for economic research -lrb- diw -rrb- , women make up only 2.5 percent of executive board members in germany 's 200 biggest companies .
according to christina klenner , this has something to do with the long-established structures in germany 's corporate world . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : few german women become top executives " this has little to do with women having children or lacking the necessary will or abilities , " explained christina klenner .
" when it 's already an established boys ' club , then it 's very difficult for women to get in .
we 're talking here about male insider relationships at work : one man pulls another man in .
there need to be women there in the first place to support other women . " germany has long been reported to hold a low rank on the european scale of women holding executive positions , lagging far behind countries like norway . klenner believes that women need to show extra courage in order to begin to change these corporate structures .
some need to enter the " lion 's dens , " as she calls them , and set up a base for recruiting more women .
however , she also emphasizes that they should not feel responsible for the discrimination that exists in their society . confidence is important despite her success , barbara schock-werner also recalls cases of discrimination on her way to the top - for example , the time an annual university award went to the best male student in her year , despite the fact that she was the top candidate .
but schock-werner never let incidents like this get her down .
" in the end , it was n't really important , " she said self-assuredly . she believes that confidence is an important factor in getting what you want in life , regardless of circumstances .
young women , she thinks , are often not courageous enough to stand up for themselves . " my female students do n't have enough self-confidence to say , ' here i am .
i want to have a good job .
i want to have a career , " ' said schock-werner .

today , the fate of cologne 's most famous landmark lies in her hands . being responsible for the state of a gigantic , 762-year-old building is no easy feat , but for barbara schock-werner it is a day job .
as the master builder of the cologne cathedral , she needs to make executive decisions about all the repair and restoration work that is needed to keep this imposing gothic structure - the world 's third-tallest church - in top form . she divides her work time between her office and the cathedral itself , where she does regular inspections and gives instructions to the workers , ranging from painters and electricians to carpenters and bricklayers .
and managing an annual budget of over six million euros -lrb- $ 8.1 million -rrb- also keeps this energetic 62-year-old on her toes . a woman who made it in the context of this year 's international women 's day , which aims to draw attention to equal rights and equal opportunities , women like schock-werner can be seen as a unique success story in a male-dominated society .
due to a persisting image of traditional gender roles , germany 's women still find it difficult to juggle work and motherhood , let alone rise to the top ranks of corporate hierarchies . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schock-werner is responsible for 80 staff members and a multi-million-euro budget " in the heart , i think we are an old-fashioned society - because people looked at me like i was a miracle , " said schock-werner .
" but do n't think i 'm a miracle .
i 'm only a working woman . " schock-werner believes that the secret to her success was a good education , self-discipline and confidence .
born into family of manual workers in ludwigsburg in southern germany , she was always interested in mathematics and art .
although tertiary education was not considered as an option for women in her family , she managed to get into university and pursued studies in architecture and art history . " i think my father never really understood why i 'm doing all of this , " recalled schock-werner .
" but i still had his support and he helped me in any way he could .
that was important for me . " during her long period of studies , schock-werner got married and managed to finish her phd after giving birth to her son , " working on the thesis while the baby was sleeping . "
three years later , when her daughter was born , she was invited to lecture at a university and with the help of a nanny she managed work on a part-time basis .
she was appointed master builder of the cologne cathedral in 1999 - the first woman ever to hold this position . not a typical case bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : juggling work and motherhood is not easy in germany for a german woman , schock-werner has an unusually successful career .
according to christina klenner - a gender politics expert at the hans boeckler foundation in dusseldorf - germany is a rather conservative country in the field of gender politics , despite the fact that today 's young german women often outperform their male counterparts academically . " behind this is the image of the male breadwinner and the woman who is responsible for the home , " said klenner . this mentality makes juggling motherhood and work a difficult or impossible task for many german women .
childcare facilities are limited and often expensive , while women who leave their children in the care of strangers are often stigmatized and branded as bad mothers .
these are the main reasons why most german women do not resume full-time work after having children . however , it must be noted that that this situation is not the same across the whole country .
in the states that made up the former east germany , child supervision facilities are far more widespread , which is the legacy of the region 's former socialist structures .
not surprisingly , the amount of women between the ages of 20 and 55 with full-time employment is almost two times higher in eastern germany . glass ceiling german-style but even childless women in germany find it harder to reach top positions in the corporate world compared to women in many other western countries .
according to the german institute for economic research -lrb- diw -rrb- , women make up only 2.5 percent of executive board members in germany 's 200 biggest companies .
according to christina klenner , this has something to do with the long-established structures in germany 's corporate world . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : few german women become top executives " this has little to do with women having children or lacking the necessary will or abilities , " explained christina klenner .
" when it 's already an established boys ' club , then it 's very difficult for women to get in .
we 're talking here about male insider relationships at work : one man pulls another man in .
there need to be women there in the first place to support other women . " germany has long been reported to hold a low rank on the european scale of women holding executive positions , lagging far behind countries like norway . klenner believes that women need to show extra courage in order to begin to change these corporate structures .
some need to enter the " lion 's dens , " as she calls them , and set up a base for recruiting more women .
however , she also emphasizes that they should not feel responsible for the discrimination that exists in their society . confidence is important despite her success , barbara schock-werner also recalls cases of discrimination on her way to the top - for example , the time an annual university award went to the best male student in her year , despite the fact that she was the top candidate .
but schock-werner never let incidents like this get her down .
" in the end , it was n't really important , " she said self-assuredly . she believes that confidence is an important factor in getting what you want in life , regardless of circumstances .
young women , she thinks , are often not courageous enough to stand up for themselves . " my female students do n't have enough self-confidence to say , ' here i am .
i want to have a good job .
i want to have a career , " ' said schock-werner .

' " there must be ' no tolerance ' wherever there was reason to suspect abuse , " german education minister annette schavan told the bild am sonntag newspaper .
the education minister said she would be meeting with ministers and educators in the coming days to discuss preventative measures . schavan 's comments follow allegations by 20 victims that they were sexually violated at the elite odenwald private school in hessen and other recent revelations of child sex abuse by priests in the roman catholic church .
justice minister sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger on sunday repeated her calls for a roundtable discussion with the catholic church .
for the past two weeks she had requested a discussion to address what she described were the " legitimate grievances " of victims and discuss causes and impact of the scandal .
the catholic church has so far repeatedly rejected the justice minister 's request , which she issued two week ago , to attend any such a panel meeting .

' " there must be ' no tolerance ' wherever there was reason to suspect abuse , " german education minister annette schavan told the bild am sonntag newspaper .
the education minister said she would be meeting with ministers and educators in the coming days to discuss preventative measures . schavan 's comments follow allegations by 20 victims that they were sexually violated at the elite odenwald private school in hessen and other recent revelations of child sex abuse by priests in the roman catholic church .
justice minister sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger on sunday repeated her calls for a roundtable discussion with the catholic church .
for the past two weeks she had requested a discussion to address what she described were the " legitimate grievances " of victims and discuss causes and impact of the scandal .
the catholic church has so far repeatedly rejected the justice minister 's request , which she issued two week ago , to attend any such a panel meeting .
the chairman of the german bishops ' conference , robert zollitsch , said last sunday that such a discussion would only be appropriate if all relevant parties attended. wl / dpa / afp editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" if more and more people were able to earn their own income , then we might one day no longer need development aid , " niebel said .

today , the fate of cologne 's most famous landmark lies in her hands . being responsible for the state of a gigantic , 762-year-old building is no easy feat , but for barbara schock-werner it is a day job .
as the master builder of the cologne cathedral , she needs to make executive decisions about all the repair and restoration work that is needed to keep this imposing gothic structure - the world 's third-tallest church - in top form . she divides her work time between her office and the cathedral itself , where she does regular inspections and gives instructions to the workers , ranging from painters and electricians to carpenters and bricklayers .
and managing an annual budget of over six million euros -lrb- $ 8.1 million -rrb- also keeps this energetic 62-year-old on her toes . a woman who made it in the context of this year 's international women 's day , which aims to draw attention to equal rights and equal opportunities , women like schock-werner can be seen as a unique success story in a male-dominated society .
due to a persisting image of traditional gender roles , germany 's women still find it difficult to juggle work and motherhood , let alone rise to the top ranks of corporate hierarchies . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schock-werner is responsible for 80 staff members and a multi-million-euro budget " in the heart , i think we are an old-fashioned society - because people looked at me like i was a miracle , " said schock-werner .
" but do n't think i 'm a miracle .
i 'm only a working woman . " schock-werner believes that the secret to her success was a good education , self-discipline and confidence .
born into family of manual workers in ludwigsburg in southern germany , she was always interested in mathematics and art .
although tertiary education was not considered as an option for women in her family , she managed to get into university and pursued studies in architecture and art history . " i think my father never really understood why i 'm doing all of this , " recalled schock-werner .
" but i still had his support and he helped me in any way he could .
that was important for me . " during her long period of studies , schock-werner got married and managed to finish her phd after giving birth to her son , " working on the thesis while the baby was sleeping . "
three years later , when her daughter was born , she was invited to lecture at a university and with the help of a nanny she managed work on a part-time basis .
she was appointed master builder of the cologne cathedral in 1999 - the first woman ever to hold this position . not a typical case bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : juggling work and motherhood is not easy in germany for a german woman , schock-werner has an unusually successful career .
according to christina klenner - a gender politics expert at the hans boeckler foundation in dusseldorf - germany is a rather conservative country in the field of gender politics , despite the fact that today 's young german women often outperform their male counterparts academically . " behind this is the image of the male breadwinner and the woman who is responsible for the home , " said klenner . this mentality makes juggling motherhood and work a difficult or impossible task for many german women .
childcare facilities are limited and often expensive , while women who leave their children in the care of strangers are often stigmatized and branded as bad mothers .
these are the main reasons why most german women do not resume full-time work after having children . however , it must be noted that that this situation is not the same across the whole country .
in the states that made up the former east germany , child supervision facilities are far more widespread , which is the legacy of the region 's former socialist structures .
not surprisingly , the amount of women between the ages of 20 and 55 with full-time employment is almost two times higher in eastern germany . glass ceiling german-style but even childless women in germany find it harder to reach top positions in the corporate world compared to women in many other western countries .
according to the german institute for economic research -lrb- diw -rrb- , women make up only 2.5 percent of executive board members in germany 's 200 biggest companies .
according to christina klenner , this has something to do with the long-established structures in germany 's corporate world . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : few german women become top executives " this has little to do with women having children or lacking the necessary will or abilities , " explained christina klenner .
" when it 's already an established boys ' club , then it 's very difficult for women to get in .
we 're talking here about male insider relationships at work : one man pulls another man in .
there need to be women there in the first place to support other women . " germany has long been reported to hold a low rank on the european scale of women holding executive positions , lagging far behind countries like norway . klenner believes that women need to show extra courage in order to begin to change these corporate structures .
some need to enter the " lion 's dens , " as she calls them , and set up a base for recruiting more women .
however , she also emphasizes that they should not feel responsible for the discrimination that exists in their society . confidence is important despite her success , barbara schock-werner also recalls cases of discrimination on her way to the top - for example , the time an annual university award went to the best male student in her year , despite the fact that she was the top candidate .
but schock-werner never let incidents like this get her down .
" in the end , it was n't really important , " she said self-assuredly . she believes that confidence is an important factor in getting what you want in life , regardless of circumstances .
young women , she thinks , are often not courageous enough to stand up for themselves . " my female students do n't have enough self-confidence to say , ' here i am .
i want to have a good job .
i want to have a career , " ' said schock-werner .

i 'm only a working woman . " schock-werner believes that the secret to her success was a good education , self-discipline and confidence .
born into family of manual workers in ludwigsburg in southern germany , she was always interested in mathematics and art .
although tertiary education was not considered as an option for women in her family , she managed to get into university and pursued studies in architecture and art history . " i think my father never really understood why i 'm doing all of this , " recalled schock-werner .
" but i still had his support and he helped me in any way he could .
that was important for me . " during her long period of studies , schock-werner got married and managed to finish her phd after giving birth to her son , " working on the thesis while the baby was sleeping . "
three years later , when her daughter was born , she was invited to lecture at a university and with the help of a nanny she managed work on a part-time basis .
she was appointed master builder of the cologne cathedral in 1999 - the first woman ever to hold this position . not a typical case bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : juggling work and motherhood is not easy in germany for a german woman , schock-werner has an unusually successful career .
according to christina klenner - a gender politics expert at the hans boeckler foundation in dusseldorf - germany is a rather conservative country in the field of gender politics , despite the fact that today 's young german women often outperform their male counterparts academically . " behind this is the image of the male breadwinner and the woman who is responsible for the home , " said klenner . this mentality makes juggling motherhood and work a difficult or impossible task for many german women .
childcare facilities are limited and often expensive , while women who leave their children in the care of strangers are often stigmatized and branded as bad mothers .
these are the main reasons why most german women do not resume full-time work after having children . however , it must be noted that that this situation is not the same across the whole country .
in the states that made up the former east germany , child supervision facilities are far more widespread , which is the legacy of the region 's former socialist structures .
not surprisingly , the amount of women between the ages of 20 and 55 with full-time employment is almost two times higher in eastern germany . glass ceiling german-style but even childless women in germany find it harder to reach top positions in the corporate world compared to women in many other western countries .
according to the german institute for economic research -lrb- diw -rrb- , women make up only 2.5 percent of executive board members in germany 's 200 biggest companies .
according to christina klenner , this has something to do with the long-established structures in germany 's corporate world . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : few german women become top executives " this has little to do with women having children or lacking the necessary will or abilities , " explained christina klenner .
" when it 's already an established boys ' club , then it 's very difficult for women to get in .
we 're talking here about male insider relationships at work : one man pulls another man in .
there need to be women there in the first place to support other women . " germany has long been reported to hold a low rank on the european scale of women holding executive positions , lagging far behind countries like norway . klenner believes that women need to show extra courage in order to begin to change these corporate structures .
some need to enter the " lion 's dens , " as she calls them , and set up a base for recruiting more women .
however , she also emphasizes that they should not feel responsible for the discrimination that exists in their society . confidence is important despite her success , barbara schock-werner also recalls cases of discrimination on her way to the top - for example , the time an annual university award went to the best male student in her year , despite the fact that she was the top candidate .
but schock-werner never let incidents like this get her down .
" in the end , it was n't really important , " she said self-assuredly . she believes that confidence is an important factor in getting what you want in life , regardless of circumstances .
young women , she thinks , are often not courageous enough to stand up for themselves . " my female students do n't have enough self-confidence to say , ' here i am .
i want to have a good job .

" the more that we try to repress symbols of other religions in public life , the more the danger grows that there will be successful attacks on christian symbols in public , everyday life , " thomas de maiziere told germany 's bild am sonntag newspaper .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : interior minister thomas de maiziere urged caution the minister , who is a member of angela merkel 's christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- , said that he would have no problem with a female worker in his ministry wearing a headscarf as an expression of religious belief .
but if the headscarf was being used to express an aggressive stance " that sets itself against what a federal interior ministry represents , " maiziere said it should be forbidden .
according to the cdu politician , the decisions should be based on whether the behavior and appearance of an employee was " appropriate . "
he added that the same principles on what is correct should be applied as they would be to the wearing of flip-flops or hawaiian shirts .
in germany , most states have passed laws that ban teachers from wearing headscarves in schools .
prohibition across europe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : de maiziere says he is against a repression of religious symbols maiziere 's comments came as several european countries were considering imposing bans on the head-to-toe islamic veil .
a french ban on the wearing of full-body coverings in public is already being sought by prime minister francois fillon , who wrote to the country 's highest administrative court asking it to " study the legal solutions enabling us to reach a ban . "
in the netherlands , the anti-immigration freedom party -lrb- pw -rrb- and its controversial leader , geer wilders , have called for such veils to be banned in many public buildings .
even though the pw scored gains in local elections last week , there are doubts about whether a proposed ban in city council buildings would be legal .
denmark has rejected an outright ban but schools , businesses and other organizations have been allowed to put their own restrictions in place. rc / kna / afp / reuters editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

today , the fate of cologne 's most famous landmark lies in her hands . being responsible for the state of a gigantic , 762-year-old building is no easy feat , but for barbara schock-werner it is a day job .
as the master builder of the cologne cathedral , she needs to make executive decisions about all the repair and restoration work that is needed to keep this imposing gothic structure - the world 's third-tallest church - in top form . she divides her work time between her office and the cathedral itself , where she does regular inspections and gives instructions to the workers , ranging from painters and electricians to carpenters and bricklayers .
and managing an annual budget of over six million euros -lrb- $ 8.1 million -rrb- also keeps this energetic 62-year-old on her toes . a woman who made it in the context of this year 's international women 's day , which aims to draw attention to equal rights and equal opportunities , women like schock-werner can be seen as a unique success story in a male-dominated society .
due to a persisting image of traditional gender roles , germany 's women still find it difficult to juggle work and motherhood , let alone rise to the top ranks of corporate hierarchies . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schock-werner is responsible for 80 staff members and a multi-million-euro budget " in the heart , i think we are an old-fashioned society - because people looked at me like i was a miracle , " said schock-werner .
" but do n't think i 'm a miracle .
i 'm only a working woman . " schock-werner believes that the secret to her success was a good education , self-discipline and confidence .
born into family of manual workers in ludwigsburg in southern germany , she was always interested in mathematics and art .
although tertiary education was not considered as an option for women in her family , she managed to get into university and pursued studies in architecture and art history . " i think my father never really understood why i 'm doing all of this , " recalled schock-werner .
" but i still had his support and he helped me in any way he could .
that was important for me . " during her long period of studies , schock-werner got married and managed to finish her phd after giving birth to her son , " working on the thesis while the baby was sleeping . "
three years later , when her daughter was born , she was invited to lecture at a university and with the help of a nanny she managed work on a part-time basis .
she was appointed master builder of the cologne cathedral in 1999 - the first woman ever to hold this position . not a typical case bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : juggling work and motherhood is not easy in germany for a german woman , schock-werner has an unusually successful career .
according to christina klenner - a gender politics expert at the hans boeckler foundation in dusseldorf - germany is a rather conservative country in the field of gender politics , despite the fact that today 's young german women often outperform their male counterparts academically . " behind this is the image of the male breadwinner and the woman who is responsible for the home , " said klenner . this mentality makes juggling motherhood and work a difficult or impossible task for many german women .
childcare facilities are limited and often expensive , while women who leave their children in the care of strangers are often stigmatized and branded as bad mothers .
these are the main reasons why most german women do not resume full-time work after having children . however , it must be noted that that this situation is not the same across the whole country .
in the states that made up the former east germany , child supervision facilities are far more widespread , which is the legacy of the region 's former socialist structures .
not surprisingly , the amount of women between the ages of 20 and 55 with full-time employment is almost two times higher in eastern germany . glass ceiling german-style but even childless women in germany find it harder to reach top positions in the corporate world compared to women in many other western countries .
according to the german institute for economic research -lrb- diw -rrb- , women make up only 2.5 percent of executive board members in germany 's 200 biggest companies .
according to christina klenner , this has something to do with the long-established structures in germany 's corporate world . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : few german women become top executives " this has little to do with women having children or lacking the necessary will or abilities , " explained christina klenner .
" when it 's already an established boys ' club , then it 's very difficult for women to get in .
we 're talking here about male insider relationships at work : one man pulls another man in .
there need to be women there in the first place to support other women . " germany has long been reported to hold a low rank on the european scale of women holding executive positions , lagging far behind countries like norway . klenner believes that women need to show extra courage in order to begin to change these corporate structures .
some need to enter the " lion 's dens , " as she calls them , and set up a base for recruiting more women .
however , she also emphasizes that they should not feel responsible for the discrimination that exists in their society . confidence is important despite her success , barbara schock-werner also recalls cases of discrimination on her way to the top - for example , the time an annual university award went to the best male student in her year , despite the fact that she was the top candidate .
but schock-werner never let incidents like this get her down .
" in the end , it was n't really important , " she said self-assuredly . she believes that confidence is an important factor in getting what you want in life , regardless of circumstances .
young women , she thinks , are often not courageous enough to stand up for themselves . " my female students do n't have enough self-confidence to say , ' here i am .
i want to have a good job .
i want to have a career , " ' said schock-werner .
" and i 'm always telling them , ' ask for it - do n't be afraid !

according to christina klenner - a gender politics expert at the hans boeckler foundation in dusseldorf - germany is a rather conservative country in the field of gender politics , despite the fact that today 's young german women often outperform their male counterparts academically . " behind this is the image of the male breadwinner and the woman who is responsible for the home , " said klenner . this mentality makes juggling motherhood and work a difficult or impossible task for many german women .
childcare facilities are limited and often expensive , while women who leave their children in the care of strangers are often stigmatized and branded as bad mothers .
these are the main reasons why most german women do not resume full-time work after having children . however , it must be noted that that this situation is not the same across the whole country .
in the states that made up the former east germany , child supervision facilities are far more widespread , which is the legacy of the region 's former socialist structures .
not surprisingly , the amount of women between the ages of 20 and 55 with full-time employment is almost two times higher in eastern germany . glass ceiling german-style but even childless women in germany find it harder to reach top positions in the corporate world compared to women in many other western countries .
according to the german institute for economic research -lrb- diw -rrb- , women make up only 2.5 percent of executive board members in germany 's 200 biggest companies .
according to christina klenner , this has something to do with the long-established structures in germany 's corporate world . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : few german women become top executives " this has little to do with women having children or lacking the necessary will or abilities , " explained christina klenner .
" when it 's already an established boys ' club , then it 's very difficult for women to get in .
we 're talking here about male insider relationships at work : one man pulls another man in .
there need to be women there in the first place to support other women . " germany has long been reported to hold a low rank on the european scale of women holding executive positions , lagging far behind countries like norway . klenner believes that women need to show extra courage in order to begin to change these corporate structures .
some need to enter the " lion 's dens , " as she calls them , and set up a base for recruiting more women .
however , she also emphasizes that they should not feel responsible for the discrimination that exists in their society . confidence is important despite her success , barbara schock-werner also recalls cases of discrimination on her way to the top - for example , the time an annual university award went to the best male student in her year , despite the fact that she was the top candidate .
but schock-werner never let incidents like this get her down .
" in the end , it was n't really important , " she said self-assuredly . she believes that confidence is an important factor in getting what you want in life , regardless of circumstances .
young women , she thinks , are often not courageous enough to stand up for themselves . " my female students do n't have enough self-confidence to say , ' here i am .
i want to have a good job .
i want to have a career , " ' said schock-werner .
" and i 'm always telling them , ' ask for it - do n't be afraid !
you are good enough . " ' author : eva wutke editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but if the headscarf was being used to express an aggressive stance " that sets itself against what a federal interior ministry represents , " maiziere said it should be forbidden .
according to the cdu politician , the decisions should be based on whether the behavior and appearance of an employee was " appropriate . "

today , the fate of cologne 's most famous landmark lies in her hands . being responsible for the state of a gigantic , 762-year-old building is no easy feat , but for barbara schock-werner it is a day job .
as the master builder of the cologne cathedral , she needs to make executive decisions about all the repair and restoration work that is needed to keep this imposing gothic structure - the world 's third-tallest church - in top form . she divides her work time between her office and the cathedral itself , where she does regular inspections and gives instructions to the workers , ranging from painters and electricians to carpenters and bricklayers .
and managing an annual budget of over six million euros -lrb- $ 8.1 million -rrb- also keeps this energetic 62-year-old on her toes . a woman who made it in the context of this year 's international women 's day , which aims to draw attention to equal rights and equal opportunities , women like schock-werner can be seen as a unique success story in a male-dominated society .
due to a persisting image of traditional gender roles , germany 's women still find it difficult to juggle work and motherhood , let alone rise to the top ranks of corporate hierarchies . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schock-werner is responsible for 80 staff members and a multi-million-euro budget " in the heart , i think we are an old-fashioned society - because people looked at me like i was a miracle , " said schock-werner .
" but do n't think i 'm a miracle .
i 'm only a working woman . " schock-werner believes that the secret to her success was a good education , self-discipline and confidence .
born into family of manual workers in ludwigsburg in southern germany , she was always interested in mathematics and art .
although tertiary education was not considered as an option for women in her family , she managed to get into university and pursued studies in architecture and art history . " i think my father never really understood why i 'm doing all of this , " recalled schock-werner .
" but i still had his support and he helped me in any way he could .
that was important for me . " during her long period of studies , schock-werner got married and managed to finish her phd after giving birth to her son , " working on the thesis while the baby was sleeping . "
three years later , when her daughter was born , she was invited to lecture at a university and with the help of a nanny she managed work on a part-time basis .
she was appointed master builder of the cologne cathedral in 1999 - the first woman ever to hold this position . not a typical case bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : juggling work and motherhood is not easy in germany for a german woman , schock-werner has an unusually successful career .
according to christina klenner - a gender politics expert at the hans boeckler foundation in dusseldorf - germany is a rather conservative country in the field of gender politics , despite the fact that today 's young german women often outperform their male counterparts academically . " behind this is the image of the male breadwinner and the woman who is responsible for the home , " said klenner . this mentality makes juggling motherhood and work a difficult or impossible task for many german women .
childcare facilities are limited and often expensive , while women who leave their children in the care of strangers are often stigmatized and branded as bad mothers .
these are the main reasons why most german women do not resume full-time work after having children . however , it must be noted that that this situation is not the same across the whole country .
in the states that made up the former east germany , child supervision facilities are far more widespread , which is the legacy of the region 's former socialist structures .
not surprisingly , the amount of women between the ages of 20 and 55 with full-time employment is almost two times higher in eastern germany . glass ceiling german-style but even childless women in germany find it harder to reach top positions in the corporate world compared to women in many other western countries .
according to the german institute for economic research -lrb- diw -rrb- , women make up only 2.5 percent of executive board members in germany 's 200 biggest companies .
according to christina klenner , this has something to do with the long-established structures in germany 's corporate world . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : few german women become top executives " this has little to do with women having children or lacking the necessary will or abilities , " explained christina klenner .
" when it 's already an established boys ' club , then it 's very difficult for women to get in .
we 're talking here about male insider relationships at work : one man pulls another man in .
there need to be women there in the first place to support other women . " germany has long been reported to hold a low rank on the european scale of women holding executive positions , lagging far behind countries like norway . klenner believes that women need to show extra courage in order to begin to change these corporate structures .
some need to enter the " lion 's dens , " as she calls them , and set up a base for recruiting more women .
however , she also emphasizes that they should not feel responsible for the discrimination that exists in their society . confidence is important despite her success , barbara schock-werner also recalls cases of discrimination on her way to the top - for example , the time an annual university award went to the best male student in her year , despite the fact that she was the top candidate .
but schock-werner never let incidents like this get her down .
" in the end , it was n't really important , " she said self-assuredly . she believes that confidence is an important factor in getting what you want in life , regardless of circumstances .
young women , she thinks , are often not courageous enough to stand up for themselves . " my female students do n't have enough self-confidence to say , ' here i am .
i want to have a good job .
i want to have a career , " ' said schock-werner .
" and i 'm always telling them , ' ask for it - do n't be afraid !
you are good enough . " ' author : eva wutke editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" choupo-moting really played well .
i was hoping that he would have a match like that at some stage and i am glad it happened , " said hecking .
nuremberg scored three goals before leverkusen mounted a comeback in the last 30 minutes .
eric maxim choupo-moting gave nuremberg the lead three minutes from the break and then scored again from close range on the stroke of half-time .
" i knew they had very good defenders , but i was 100 percent determined to put the ball in the back of the net , " said the 20-year-old striker who is on loan from hamburg .
" it was an important win , but every game is important for us from now on , " said choupo-moting .

germany international stefan kiesling pulled one back for leverkusen in the 66th minute and patrick helmes made it 3-2 seven minutes later with his first goal of the season .

today , the fate of cologne 's most famous landmark lies in her hands . being responsible for the state of a gigantic , 762-year-old building is no easy feat , but for barbara schock-werner it is a day job .
as the master builder of the cologne cathedral , she needs to make executive decisions about all the repair and restoration work that is needed to keep this imposing gothic structure - the world 's third-tallest church - in top form . she divides her work time between her office and the cathedral itself , where she does regular inspections and gives instructions to the workers , ranging from painters and electricians to carpenters and bricklayers .
and managing an annual budget of over six million euros -lrb- $ 8.1 million -rrb- also keeps this energetic 62-year-old on her toes . a woman who made it in the context of this year 's international women 's day , which aims to draw attention to equal rights and equal opportunities , women like schock-werner can be seen as a unique success story in a male-dominated society .
due to a persisting image of traditional gender roles , germany 's women still find it difficult to juggle work and motherhood , let alone rise to the top ranks of corporate hierarchies . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schock-werner is responsible for 80 staff members and a multi-million-euro budget " in the heart , i think we are an old-fashioned society - because people looked at me like i was a miracle , " said schock-werner .
" but do n't think i 'm a miracle .
i 'm only a working woman . " schock-werner believes that the secret to her success was a good education , self-discipline and confidence .
born into family of manual workers in ludwigsburg in southern germany , she was always interested in mathematics and art .
although tertiary education was not considered as an option for women in her family , she managed to get into university and pursued studies in architecture and art history . " i think my father never really understood why i 'm doing all of this , " recalled schock-werner .
" but i still had his support and he helped me in any way he could .
that was important for me . " during her long period of studies , schock-werner got married and managed to finish her phd after giving birth to her son , " working on the thesis while the baby was sleeping . "
three years later , when her daughter was born , she was invited to lecture at a university and with the help of a nanny she managed work on a part-time basis .
she was appointed master builder of the cologne cathedral in 1999 - the first woman ever to hold this position . not a typical case bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : juggling work and motherhood is not easy in germany for a german woman , schock-werner has an unusually successful career .
according to christina klenner - a gender politics expert at the hans boeckler foundation in dusseldorf - germany is a rather conservative country in the field of gender politics , despite the fact that today 's young german women often outperform their male counterparts academically . " behind this is the image of the male breadwinner and the woman who is responsible for the home , " said klenner . this mentality makes juggling motherhood and work a difficult or impossible task for many german women .
childcare facilities are limited and often expensive , while women who leave their children in the care of strangers are often stigmatized and branded as bad mothers .
these are the main reasons why most german women do not resume full-time work after having children . however , it must be noted that that this situation is not the same across the whole country .
in the states that made up the former east germany , child supervision facilities are far more widespread , which is the legacy of the region 's former socialist structures .
not surprisingly , the amount of women between the ages of 20 and 55 with full-time employment is almost two times higher in eastern germany . glass ceiling german-style but even childless women in germany find it harder to reach top positions in the corporate world compared to women in many other western countries .
according to the german institute for economic research -lrb- diw -rrb- , women make up only 2.5 percent of executive board members in germany 's 200 biggest companies .
according to christina klenner , this has something to do with the long-established structures in germany 's corporate world . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : few german women become top executives " this has little to do with women having children or lacking the necessary will or abilities , " explained christina klenner .
" when it 's already an established boys ' club , then it 's very difficult for women to get in .
we 're talking here about male insider relationships at work : one man pulls another man in .
there need to be women there in the first place to support other women . " germany has long been reported to hold a low rank on the european scale of women holding executive positions , lagging far behind countries like norway . klenner believes that women need to show extra courage in order to begin to change these corporate structures .

today , the fate of cologne 's most famous landmark lies in her hands . being responsible for the state of a gigantic , 762-year-old building is no easy feat , but for barbara schock-werner it is a day job .
as the master builder of the cologne cathedral , she needs to make executive decisions about all the repair and restoration work that is needed to keep this imposing gothic structure - the world 's third-tallest church - in top form . she divides her work time between her office and the cathedral itself , where she does regular inspections and gives instructions to the workers , ranging from painters and electricians to carpenters and bricklayers .
and managing an annual budget of over six million euros -lrb- $ 8.1 million -rrb- also keeps this energetic 62-year-old on her toes . a woman who made it in the context of this year 's international women 's day , which aims to draw attention to equal rights and equal opportunities , women like schock-werner can be seen as a unique success story in a male-dominated society .
due to a persisting image of traditional gender roles , germany 's women still find it difficult to juggle work and motherhood , let alone rise to the top ranks of corporate hierarchies . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schock-werner is responsible for 80 staff members and a multi-million-euro budget " in the heart , i think we are an old-fashioned society - because people looked at me like i was a miracle , " said schock-werner .
" but do n't think i 'm a miracle .
i 'm only a working woman . " schock-werner believes that the secret to her success was a good education , self-discipline and confidence .
born into family of manual workers in ludwigsburg in southern germany , she was always interested in mathematics and art .
although tertiary education was not considered as an option for women in her family , she managed to get into university and pursued studies in architecture and art history . " i think my father never really understood why i 'm doing all of this , " recalled schock-werner .
" but i still had his support and he helped me in any way he could .
that was important for me . " during her long period of studies , schock-werner got married and managed to finish her phd after giving birth to her son , " working on the thesis while the baby was sleeping . "
three years later , when her daughter was born , she was invited to lecture at a university and with the help of a nanny she managed work on a part-time basis .
she was appointed master builder of the cologne cathedral in 1999 - the first woman ever to hold this position . not a typical case bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : juggling work and motherhood is not easy in germany for a german woman , schock-werner has an unusually successful career .
according to christina klenner - a gender politics expert at the hans boeckler foundation in dusseldorf - germany is a rather conservative country in the field of gender politics , despite the fact that today 's young german women often outperform their male counterparts academically . " behind this is the image of the male breadwinner and the woman who is responsible for the home , " said klenner . this mentality makes juggling motherhood and work a difficult or impossible task for many german women .
childcare facilities are limited and often expensive , while women who leave their children in the care of strangers are often stigmatized and branded as bad mothers .
these are the main reasons why most german women do not resume full-time work after having children . however , it must be noted that that this situation is not the same across the whole country .
in the states that made up the former east germany , child supervision facilities are far more widespread , which is the legacy of the region 's former socialist structures .
not surprisingly , the amount of women between the ages of 20 and 55 with full-time employment is almost two times higher in eastern germany . glass ceiling german-style but even childless women in germany find it harder to reach top positions in the corporate world compared to women in many other western countries .
according to the german institute for economic research -lrb- diw -rrb- , women make up only 2.5 percent of executive board members in germany 's 200 biggest companies .
according to christina klenner , this has something to do with the long-established structures in germany 's corporate world . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : few german women become top executives " this has little to do with women having children or lacking the necessary will or abilities , " explained christina klenner .
" when it 's already an established boys ' club , then it 's very difficult for women to get in .
we 're talking here about male insider relationships at work : one man pulls another man in .
there need to be women there in the first place to support other women . " germany has long been reported to hold a low rank on the european scale of women holding executive positions , lagging far behind countries like norway . klenner believes that women need to show extra courage in order to begin to change these corporate structures .
some need to enter the " lion 's dens , " as she calls them , and set up a base for recruiting more women .
however , she also emphasizes that they should not feel responsible for the discrimination that exists in their society . confidence is important despite her success , barbara schock-werner also recalls cases of discrimination on her way to the top - for example , the time an annual university award went to the best male student in her year , despite the fact that she was the top candidate .
but schock-werner never let incidents like this get her down .

icelandic voters have rejected a government proposal to repay 3.9 billion euro to britain and the netherlands after the collapse of the icesave online bank . early referendum results showed that 98 percent of iceland 's 230,000 voters had voted " no " against the deal to repay the uk and dutch governments who compensated icesave 340,000 customers in 2008 - the outcome came as no surprise to the reykjavik government .
" initial figures indicate clearly that the december amendment to the icesave legislation of august 2009 will be repealed , " the government said in a statement just minutes after polling stations closed at 2200 utc .
the online bank icesave , run by the icelandic bank landsbanki , collapsed at the height of the global financial crisis in 2008 . the so-called " icesave bill " was passed by a wafer-thin majority in 2009 .
iceland 's president olafur grimsson then used his power of veto to block the legislation and called a national referendum .
iceland 's " no " vote could hold up payment of the remaining half of a 2.1-billion dollar international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- rescue package .
it could also have a negative impact on the reykjavik government 's bid to join the european union and destabilize prime minister johanna sigurdardottir 's leftwing government .
it could also affect the country 's credit rating .
" this is nothing that comes as a surprise , " sigurdardottir told public broadcaster ruv .
" the result is not a shock for the government , considering the state of affairs , " she added .
ms. sigurdaddottir has ruled out standing down as iceland 's premier and said her government would continue negotiations with britain and the netherlands .
last-ditch talks on friday with representatives from the three countries failed to resolve the issue. nrt / ap / reuters / afp editor : tony dunham send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" it was an important win , but every game is important for us from now on , " said choupo-moting .

but if the headscarf was being used to express an aggressive stance " that sets itself against what a federal interior ministry represents , " maiziere said it should be forbidden .
according to the cdu politician , the decisions should be based on whether the behavior and appearance of an employee was " appropriate . "

he also expressed doubt whether germany would be able to increase aid to 0.7 percent of gdp by 2015 . dirk niebel said the recently presented 2010 federal budget was 3.5 billion euros short of meeting the country 's commitments of providing 0.51 percent of gdp for development aid .
6.1 billion euros have been allocated towards development aid this year .
that 's an increase of 250 million euros on 2009 .
germany 's ruling coalition of christian democrats and free democrats passed its first budget last friday .
it sees berlin taking on a record 80.2 billion euros in new debt .
given the massive borrowings , any subsequent increases for development aid programs are unlikely .
" we will have to talk with our partners about what is more important : aid volume or its effectiveness , " niebel told the " hamburger abendblatt " newspaper .

he also expressed doubt whether germany would be able to increase aid to 0.7 percent of gdp by 2015 . dirk niebel said the recently presented 2010 federal budget was 3.5 billion euros short of meeting the country 's commitments of providing 0.51 percent of gdp for development aid .
6.1 billion euros have been allocated towards development aid this year .
that 's an increase of 250 million euros on 2009 .
germany 's ruling coalition of christian democrats and free democrats passed its first budget last friday .
it sees berlin taking on a record 80.2 billion euros in new debt .

niebel will visit vietnam and cambodia to discuss how they dealing with the financial and economic crisis . he will also discuss climate protection and development aid .
" if more and more people were able to earn their own income , then we might one day no longer need development aid , " niebel said .

icelandic voters have rejected a government proposal to repay 3.9 billion euro to britain and the netherlands after the collapse of the icesave online bank . early referendum results showed that 98 percent of iceland 's 230,000 voters had voted " no " against the deal to repay the uk and dutch governments who compensated icesave 340,000 customers in 2008 - the outcome came as no surprise to the reykjavik government .
" initial figures indicate clearly that the december amendment to the icesave legislation of august 2009 will be repealed , " the government said in a statement just minutes after polling stations closed at 2200 utc .
the online bank icesave , run by the icelandic bank landsbanki , collapsed at the height of the global financial crisis in 2008 . the so-called " icesave bill " was passed by a wafer-thin majority in 2009 .
iceland 's president olafur grimsson then used his power of veto to block the legislation and called a national referendum .
iceland 's " no " vote could hold up payment of the remaining half of a 2.1-billion dollar international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- rescue package .
it could also have a negative impact on the reykjavik government 's bid to join the european union and destabilize prime minister johanna sigurdardottir 's leftwing government .
it could also affect the country 's credit rating .
" this is nothing that comes as a surprise , " sigurdardottir told public broadcaster ruv .
" the result is not a shock for the government , considering the state of affairs , " she added .

icelandic voters have rejected a government proposal to repay 3.9 billion euro to britain and the netherlands after the collapse of the icesave online bank . early referendum results showed that 98 percent of iceland 's 230,000 voters had voted " no " against the deal to repay the uk and dutch governments who compensated icesave 340,000 customers in 2008 - the outcome came as no surprise to the reykjavik government .
" initial figures indicate clearly that the december amendment to the icesave legislation of august 2009 will be repealed , " the government said in a statement just minutes after polling stations closed at 2200 utc .
the online bank icesave , run by the icelandic bank landsbanki , collapsed at the height of the global financial crisis in 2008 . the so-called " icesave bill " was passed by a wafer-thin majority in 2009 .
iceland 's president olafur grimsson then used his power of veto to block the legislation and called a national referendum .
iceland 's " no " vote could hold up payment of the remaining half of a 2.1-billion dollar international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- rescue package .
it could also have a negative impact on the reykjavik government 's bid to join the european union and destabilize prime minister johanna sigurdardottir 's leftwing government .
it could also affect the country 's credit rating .
" this is nothing that comes as a surprise , " sigurdardottir told public broadcaster ruv .
" the result is not a shock for the government , considering the state of affairs , " she added .

icelandic voters have rejected a government proposal to repay 3.9 billion euro to britain and the netherlands after the collapse of the icesave online bank . early referendum results showed that 98 percent of iceland 's 230,000 voters had voted " no " against the deal to repay the uk and dutch governments who compensated icesave 340,000 customers in 2008 - the outcome came as no surprise to the reykjavik government .
" initial figures indicate clearly that the december amendment to the icesave legislation of august 2009 will be repealed , " the government said in a statement just minutes after polling stations closed at 2200 utc .
the online bank icesave , run by the icelandic bank landsbanki , collapsed at the height of the global financial crisis in 2008 . the so-called " icesave bill " was passed by a wafer-thin majority in 2009 .
iceland 's president olafur grimsson then used his power of veto to block the legislation and called a national referendum .
iceland 's " no " vote could hold up payment of the remaining half of a 2.1-billion dollar international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- rescue package .
it could also have a negative impact on the reykjavik government 's bid to join the european union and destabilize prime minister johanna sigurdardottir 's leftwing government .
it could also affect the country 's credit rating .
" this is nothing that comes as a surprise , " sigurdardottir told public broadcaster ruv .
" the result is not a shock for the government , considering the state of affairs , " she added .
ms. sigurdaddottir has ruled out standing down as iceland 's premier and said her government would continue negotiations with britain and the netherlands .

today , the fate of cologne 's most famous landmark lies in her hands . being responsible for the state of a gigantic , 762-year-old building is no easy feat , but for barbara schock-werner it is a day job .
as the master builder of the cologne cathedral , she needs to make executive decisions about all the repair and restoration work that is needed to keep this imposing gothic structure - the world 's third-tallest church - in top form . she divides her work time between her office and the cathedral itself , where she does regular inspections and gives instructions to the workers , ranging from painters and electricians to carpenters and bricklayers .
and managing an annual budget of over six million euros -lrb- $ 8.1 million -rrb- also keeps this energetic 62-year-old on her toes . a woman who made it in the context of this year 's international women 's day , which aims to draw attention to equal rights and equal opportunities , women like schock-werner can be seen as a unique success story in a male-dominated society .
due to a persisting image of traditional gender roles , germany 's women still find it difficult to juggle work and motherhood , let alone rise to the top ranks of corporate hierarchies . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schock-werner is responsible for 80 staff members and a multi-million-euro budget " in the heart , i think we are an old-fashioned society - because people looked at me like i was a miracle , " said schock-werner .
" but do n't think i 'm a miracle .
i 'm only a working woman . " schock-werner believes that the secret to her success was a good education , self-discipline and confidence .
born into family of manual workers in ludwigsburg in southern germany , she was always interested in mathematics and art .
although tertiary education was not considered as an option for women in her family , she managed to get into university and pursued studies in architecture and art history . " i think my father never really understood why i 'm doing all of this , " recalled schock-werner .
" but i still had his support and he helped me in any way he could .
that was important for me . " during her long period of studies , schock-werner got married and managed to finish her phd after giving birth to her son , " working on the thesis while the baby was sleeping . "
three years later , when her daughter was born , she was invited to lecture at a university and with the help of a nanny she managed work on a part-time basis .
she was appointed master builder of the cologne cathedral in 1999 - the first woman ever to hold this position . not a typical case bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : juggling work and motherhood is not easy in germany for a german woman , schock-werner has an unusually successful career .
according to christina klenner - a gender politics expert at the hans boeckler foundation in dusseldorf - germany is a rather conservative country in the field of gender politics , despite the fact that today 's young german women often outperform their male counterparts academically . " behind this is the image of the male breadwinner and the woman who is responsible for the home , " said klenner . this mentality makes juggling motherhood and work a difficult or impossible task for many german women .
childcare facilities are limited and often expensive , while women who leave their children in the care of strangers are often stigmatized and branded as bad mothers .
these are the main reasons why most german women do not resume full-time work after having children . however , it must be noted that that this situation is not the same across the whole country .
in the states that made up the former east germany , child supervision facilities are far more widespread , which is the legacy of the region 's former socialist structures .
not surprisingly , the amount of women between the ages of 20 and 55 with full-time employment is almost two times higher in eastern germany . glass ceiling german-style but even childless women in germany find it harder to reach top positions in the corporate world compared to women in many other western countries .
according to the german institute for economic research -lrb- diw -rrb- , women make up only 2.5 percent of executive board members in germany 's 200 biggest companies .
according to christina klenner , this has something to do with the long-established structures in germany 's corporate world . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : few german women become top executives " this has little to do with women having children or lacking the necessary will or abilities , " explained christina klenner .
" when it 's already an established boys ' club , then it 's very difficult for women to get in .
we 're talking here about male insider relationships at work : one man pulls another man in .
there need to be women there in the first place to support other women . " germany has long been reported to hold a low rank on the european scale of women holding executive positions , lagging far behind countries like norway . klenner believes that women need to show extra courage in order to begin to change these corporate structures .
some need to enter the " lion 's dens , " as she calls them , and set up a base for recruiting more women .
however , she also emphasizes that they should not feel responsible for the discrimination that exists in their society . confidence is important despite her success , barbara schock-werner also recalls cases of discrimination on her way to the top - for example , the time an annual university award went to the best male student in her year , despite the fact that she was the top candidate .
but schock-werner never let incidents like this get her down .
" in the end , it was n't really important , " she said self-assuredly . she believes that confidence is an important factor in getting what you want in life , regardless of circumstances .
young women , she thinks , are often not courageous enough to stand up for themselves . " my female students do n't have enough self-confidence to say , ' here i am .
i want to have a good job .
i want to have a career , " ' said schock-werner .
" and i 'm always telling them , ' ask for it - do n't be afraid !
you are good enough . " ' author : eva wutke editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

as the master builder of the cologne cathedral , she needs to make executive decisions about all the repair and restoration work that is needed to keep this imposing gothic structure - the world 's third-tallest church - in top form . she divides her work time between her office and the cathedral itself , where she does regular inspections and gives instructions to the workers , ranging from painters and electricians to carpenters and bricklayers .
and managing an annual budget of over six million euros -lrb- $ 8.1 million -rrb- also keeps this energetic 62-year-old on her toes . a woman who made it in the context of this year 's international women 's day , which aims to draw attention to equal rights and equal opportunities , women like schock-werner can be seen as a unique success story in a male-dominated society .
due to a persisting image of traditional gender roles , germany 's women still find it difficult to juggle work and motherhood , let alone rise to the top ranks of corporate hierarchies . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schock-werner is responsible for 80 staff members and a multi-million-euro budget " in the heart , i think we are an old-fashioned society - because people looked at me like i was a miracle , " said schock-werner .
" but do n't think i 'm a miracle .
i 'm only a working woman . " schock-werner believes that the secret to her success was a good education , self-discipline and confidence .
born into family of manual workers in ludwigsburg in southern germany , she was always interested in mathematics and art .
although tertiary education was not considered as an option for women in her family , she managed to get into university and pursued studies in architecture and art history . " i think my father never really understood why i 'm doing all of this , " recalled schock-werner .
" but i still had his support and he helped me in any way he could .
that was important for me . " during her long period of studies , schock-werner got married and managed to finish her phd after giving birth to her son , " working on the thesis while the baby was sleeping . "
three years later , when her daughter was born , she was invited to lecture at a university and with the help of a nanny she managed work on a part-time basis .
she was appointed master builder of the cologne cathedral in 1999 - the first woman ever to hold this position . not a typical case bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : juggling work and motherhood is not easy in germany for a german woman , schock-werner has an unusually successful career .
according to christina klenner - a gender politics expert at the hans boeckler foundation in dusseldorf - germany is a rather conservative country in the field of gender politics , despite the fact that today 's young german women often outperform their male counterparts academically . " behind this is the image of the male breadwinner and the woman who is responsible for the home , " said klenner . this mentality makes juggling motherhood and work a difficult or impossible task for many german women .
childcare facilities are limited and often expensive , while women who leave their children in the care of strangers are often stigmatized and branded as bad mothers .
these are the main reasons why most german women do not resume full-time work after having children . however , it must be noted that that this situation is not the same across the whole country .
in the states that made up the former east germany , child supervision facilities are far more widespread , which is the legacy of the region 's former socialist structures .
not surprisingly , the amount of women between the ages of 20 and 55 with full-time employment is almost two times higher in eastern germany . glass ceiling german-style but even childless women in germany find it harder to reach top positions in the corporate world compared to women in many other western countries .
according to the german institute for economic research -lrb- diw -rrb- , women make up only 2.5 percent of executive board members in germany 's 200 biggest companies .
according to christina klenner , this has something to do with the long-established structures in germany 's corporate world . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : few german women become top executives " this has little to do with women having children or lacking the necessary will or abilities , " explained christina klenner .
" when it 's already an established boys ' club , then it 's very difficult for women to get in .
we 're talking here about male insider relationships at work : one man pulls another man in .
there need to be women there in the first place to support other women . " germany has long been reported to hold a low rank on the european scale of women holding executive positions , lagging far behind countries like norway . klenner believes that women need to show extra courage in order to begin to change these corporate structures .
some need to enter the " lion 's dens , " as she calls them , and set up a base for recruiting more women .
however , she also emphasizes that they should not feel responsible for the discrimination that exists in their society . confidence is important despite her success , barbara schock-werner also recalls cases of discrimination on her way to the top - for example , the time an annual university award went to the best male student in her year , despite the fact that she was the top candidate .
but schock-werner never let incidents like this get her down .
" in the end , it was n't really important , " she said self-assuredly . she believes that confidence is an important factor in getting what you want in life , regardless of circumstances .
young women , she thinks , are often not courageous enough to stand up for themselves . " my female students do n't have enough self-confidence to say , ' here i am .
i want to have a good job .

' " there must be ' no tolerance ' wherever there was reason to suspect abuse , " german education minister annette schavan told the bild am sonntag newspaper .
the education minister said she would be meeting with ministers and educators in the coming days to discuss preventative measures . schavan 's comments follow allegations by 20 victims that they were sexually violated at the elite odenwald private school in hessen and other recent revelations of child sex abuse by priests in the roman catholic church .
justice minister sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger on sunday repeated her calls for a roundtable discussion with the catholic church .
for the past two weeks she had requested a discussion to address what she described were the " legitimate grievances " of victims and discuss causes and impact of the scandal .
the catholic church has so far repeatedly rejected the justice minister 's request , which she issued two week ago , to attend any such a panel meeting .
the chairman of the german bishops ' conference , robert zollitsch , said last sunday that such a discussion would only be appropriate if all relevant parties attended. wl / dpa / afp editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the euro-zone aims at resolving its troubles on its own , " he was quoted in the paper 's sunday edition . coordinated effort schaeuble also called for more coordination among the 16 nations sharing the euro regarding financial and economic policy decisions .

last time iraq held parliamentary elections , in 2005 , the poll was largely boycotted by sunni arab voters , a fact which contributed to years of vicious sectarian fighting .
iraq is still plagued by almost daily violence but security has improved and resentment between sunni and shia communities has also eased .
i 'll vote for whoever will provide security first and foremost .
then jobs and public services khalid , shopkeeper on the days when khalid is n't working as a schoolteacher , to make ends meet , he runs a small electrical goods store in a predominantly shia neighbourhood of baghdad known as kadhamiya .
early in the morning he drags his supply of fridges , microwaves and air-conditioning units onto the pavement in front of his shop , hoping to attract customers .
" i 'll vote for whoever will provide security first and foremost .
then jobs and public services , " he said .
baghdad is still a city plagued by bombings , kidnappings and shootings .
but security has improved over the past two years .
as it does so , people in this neighbourhood are increasingly focusing on everyday problems such as unemployment and poor public services when deciding how to vote .
" how , " khalid asked , " am i supposed to run my business , when the electricity supply is so unreliable ? "
tale of two neighbourhoods across the tigris from kadhamiya is the sunni arab area of adhamiya .
the bridge between the two neighbourhoods is symbolic of baghdad 's sectarian divisions .
until two years ago the bridge was closed .
in any case , if a shia had strayed into adhamiya , they would most probably not have come out alive .
sunnis can find jobs only in their dreams khalil ibrahim , stallholder iraq : key facts and figures guide to groups in iraqi election q & a : iraqi parliamentary polls it is a mark of how much things have changed that today the traffic flows freely across the bridge and people from the two communities once again feel free to visit each other .
on the other side , we met khalil ibrahim , selling pickles , olives and cheese from a little stall .
but khalil was n't always a stallholder .
until 2003 he was an officer in saddam hussein 's army .
when it was disbanded by the americans , he had to find other work .
" since the fall of saddam , " he said , " there are no jobs .
three-quarters of our young people had to go to work as taxi drivers , or work in shops or . "
he cast his arm despondently over his own cart , to prove his point .
like many sunni arabs , khalil feels the new shia dominated state-sector does not afford him equal opportunities .
" people here have tried to get government jobs , but they were rejected just because they are from adhamiya .
" it has been like this since the invasion .
sunnis can find jobs only in their dreams , " he told me .
as we stood chatting to khalil , three young men were watching us intently from a discreet distance .
they were dressed in a motley mixture of different military uniforms .
each had a kalashnikov rifle slung over his shoulder .
there were the sahwa , members of the awakening councils , former insurgents who a few years ago were persuaded , with sums of money , to join forces with the government and us troops against al-qaeda .
the youngest of the three was mustafa khalid .
just 20 years old , he was barely a teenager at the time of the us-led invasion in 2003 .
now he and his fellow militia members are responsible for keeping the peace here in adhamiya .
we are here to protect our area , our families .
imagine if we pulled out .
imagine this street without us .
all these shops would be robbed mustafa khalid , awakening council member " about a month ago , someone threw a hand grenade at us from one of the alleyways here , " he said .
but in general , mustafa says security is much better now than it used to be .
the government wants to integrate these men into the regular army and police , but mustafa says he and his friends have n't been paid for two months .
the question is : how long will they continue to do their jobs without pay ?
" what else can we do ?

security in iraq is a relative concept .
