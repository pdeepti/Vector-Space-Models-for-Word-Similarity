in an interview with dw , journalist paul lendvai criticizes prime minister viktor orban for throwing around the weight of his two-thirds majority . in january 1 , 2011 , hungary is to take over the eu 's six-month rotating presidency , throwing into the spotlight a country of just under 10 million people .
a center-right government holds a two-thirds majority in the hungarian parliament , which is grappling with the fallout of the 2007 financial crisis , which hit the country hard .
austrian journalist paul lendvai is editor-in-chief of the vienna-based german-language publication die europaeische rundschau .
he splits his time between vienna and budapest , where he was born .
deutsche welle : you 've titled your latest book about hungary " mein verspieltes land " -lrb- my squandered country -rrb- . what does this mean ?
is hungary not a fully developed country , or do hungarians have a penchant for political games ?
paul lendvai : i believe it 's more the latter .
the title is ambiguous and equivocal .
but without a doubt it was my aim to show in this book that over the past 20 years hungary has often squandered the opportunities that came with the fall of communism in 1989 .
hungary was of course one of the first countries in the eastern bloc to free itself of the chains of communism - and without revolutionary upheaval . after that , there was a series of shifts in government between left- and right-of-center parties , bringing abrupt political changes .
hungary has been a member of nato since 1999 and a member of the european union since 2004 .
how european do hungarians feel at this point ?
unfortunately , renationalization is a stronger trend right now in hungary than europeanization .
what do i mean by that ?
i mean that european states , especially the 27 in the eu , have more or less overcome their differences and are trying to create a common market , common values and a common future - and look together towards the future .
that 's where hungary faces problems .
some of those problems are rooted in the country 's history , some in its geography and some in the bankruptcy or impotency of the country 's political elite , the political classes .
viktor orban was previously prime minister between 1998 and 2002 .
now he 's back in power .
he 's staunchly conservative , and many have even said he 's a nationalist .
what 's his agenda ?
no one knows , because , while orban 's party has regained power , it has no consistent economic strategy .
the government moves from one course of action to the next .
they already have made grave errors in their first 100 days in power , for instance by comparing hungary 's condition with greece 's .
the government is putting the nation and the church first , rather than civil liberties .
this type of politics creates tension with neighboring countries , with romania and especially with slovakia .
relations with serbia are also somewhat tense .
part of orban 's agenda is also about getting ethnic hungarians in the carpathian basin involved in a common policy . the introduction of dual citizenship is part of this agenda , and after hungary 's eu presidency , orban will probably give the vote to ethnic hungarians outside of hungary .
orban 's tax policies benefit the upper middle class .
his politics are aimed against the globalization of foreign capital , but he maintains at the same time a good relationship with local oligarchs .
it 's actually a very left-populist rhetoric , but at the same time the government is nationalist .
these contradictions probably work as long as one can blame everything on the mistakes and failures of the earlier , socialist-liberal government .
at present a majority of hungarians support viktor orban , this strong man .
there 's a longing for a strong man , and the whole media landscape is being reformed .
imagine a situation in which all public broadcasters are rolled into one government media authority , with a board of directors filled by the ruling party - and that for the next nine years .
in hungary there 's fear , and two liberal newspapers , one literary newspaper and another weekly for young readers printed editions with blank title pages in protest .
their intention was to demonstrate the threat of censorship - or the threat of media regulation .
you say that orban is throwing his weight around .
how do his politics fit with the eu and with the eu presidency ?
are n't there huge contradictions there ?
you ca n't have nationalist politics on the one hand and make european compromises on the other , can you ?
i believe that hungary will resolve that issue in these six months .
orban wants to make a good impression .
he is friendly toward angela merkel and silvio berlusconi , and he was recently in moscow to improve relations there .
i believe there will be a tightening of the reins at home , an absolute concentration of judicial , political and media power .
in its foreign relations orban 's government strikes a friendly , open tone .
he has a foreign minister who speaks excellent french , english and german .
he himself speaks english and was previously prime minister .
i do n't believe that one can expect major initiatives , but they will do all they can to ensure that all of the conferences and events come off elegantly and in style .
i can say one thing : unlike the czech republic , where the government fell during the eu presidency , hungary does n't face that danger .
the government in hungary has a two-thirds majority in parliament .
and when it comes to the major issues , the government has the support of the extreme right opposition party jobbik . interview : bernd riegert -lrb- dl -rrb- editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

orban wants to make a good impression .
he is friendly toward angela merkel and silvio berlusconi , and he was recently in moscow to improve relations there .

the german press reacted with equal pessimism . a spotlight was shone on russia this week with the sentencing on fraud charges of fallen oligarch mikhail khodorkovsky , formerly the country 's richest man .
europe and the united states have blasted the trial as politically motivated and a step backward for the rule of law .
khodorkovsky , 47 , was sentenced to six more years in prison , with a release date of 2017 .
german national daily newspaper die welt wrote that the russian court responsible for hearing khodorkovsky 's case bent terribly in favor of russian prosecutors : " judge viktor danilkin has followed the predetermined path to the very end .
in the case of former oil mogul mikhail khodorkovsky and his business partner platon lebedev , he has followed to a tee the petitions of the public prosecutor 's office , which had asked for six-year sentences for the pair .
with a total incarceration of 14 years , including the time already served , the two men will not be freed until 2017 .
the court has stuck to public and direct statements on the matter of prime minister vladimir putin . "
the berliner zeitung newspaper wrote of the single-mindedness of the russian justice system : " the process showed how russian justice functions : the authorities are the ones who decide who the thief is … to position khodorkovsky as a moral rolemodel in russian consciousness will be difficult .
despite all sympathy afforded him due to his dealings with the repressive measures of the russian justice system , the former oligarch will nevertheless remain for many russians as a fraudster who was infinitely rich when many had hardly anything . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : khodorkovsky and his co-defendant lebedev both received six more years the sueddeutsche zeitung , wrote that president dmitry medvedev did not do enough to influence the trial , and that putin was the eventual victor over his long-time crititc khodorkovsky : " president dmitry medvedev has not fulfilled expectations , some of which may have been misplaced .
though , the fact that the verdict was seemingly still up in the air until the end may have been down to the legal expert medvedev .
whether or not he had the power to push for a milder sentence for khodorkovsky , nothing changes the fact he has acted like an accomplice in revenge .
this judicial ruling , which few in russia hold to be independent , has worked according to the calculations of prime minister vladimir putin against one of his long-time foes . "
the nuernberger nachrichten daily attempted to put khodorkovsky 's sentencing into a wider context of rights violations among some of europe 's key partners : " the strongman of russia has moved with full rigor against his critics .
critics of the belarusian regime have also ended up in prison .
hungary , which soon takes over the rotating eu presidency , has from the new year implemented a restrictive media law that reeks of democratic mockery .
these are troubling times for fundamental human rights - particularly when the west reacts purely with words of little consequence , reluctant to exert pressure on important trading partners . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de balkans -pipe- 31.12.2010 high number of serbian asylum seekers linked to travel scam großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bus-loads of serbians have applied for asylum in germany serbians make up the highest number of asylum seekers to germany , followed by their macedonian neighbors .
a sudden jump in applications could be linked to a balkan travel scam seen elsewhere in europe . a sudden spurt in applications for asylum in germany has been linked to an alleged travel scam taking place in the balkans .
according to the head of the german government 's asylum department , people from serbia and macedonia are being encouraged to buy one-way bus tickets to germany and given " empty promises " that they will find work and money once they get there .
" we suspect there has been an organized abuse of the asylum procedure , whereby people in macedonia and serbia have organized bus trips into germany , " said michael kleinhans , head of the asylum department at the federal office for migration and refugees .
" they tell people that in germany you can earn money and it 's worth making the trip as they 'll easily cover their costs , " kleinhans told deutsche welle .
a bus ticket costs between 200 and 400 euros -lrb- $ 267- $ 534 -rrb- , but unscrupulous travel agents sell the tickets claiming the passengers can get a free return journey from the german government once in germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : asylum seekers must prove they fled persecution to stay in germany instead , their applications are swiftly rejected and the applicants are bussed back to the balkans .
' a stark increase ' the federal office for migration and refugees keeps monthly records of the number of asylum seekers and their countries of origin .
for most of 2010 , the majority of refugees came from afghanistan and iraq .
however , from september through to november there was a sharp rise in asylum applicants from the balkans .
in november the highest number of applications came from serbians - 1,159 - followed by macedonians , with 512 .
the two groups made up over a third of the total applicants that month , " a stark increase , " kleinhans said .
serbia , macedonian and montenegran passport holders have been able to travel into the eu without a visa since december 2009 .
but the rules only allow them to come as tourists and do not allow them to work legally in the bloc .
similar scheme in belgium and sweden it 's not the first time a scam like this has been attempted .
following the change to the visa rules , several hundred serbs , macedonians and montenegrins tried to leave their countries in search of greener pastures in the eu earlier in 2010 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : to travel to the eu , serbians need a new biometric passport deutsche welle 's balkans correspondent , mark lowen , said that belgium and sweden " bore the brunt of the exodus " at the time , with 700 to 800 people arriving in each country .
the applications were rejected , and busloads of failed asylum seekers were sent back to the balkans .
" those attempting to leave were predominantly ethnic albanians - who tend to come from the poorer areas of serbia and macedonia , " he explained .
" those who tried to make the journey painted a very desperate picture of poverty , and many feel discriminated against . "
no tolerance eu officials have made it clear that they will not tolerate this so-called ' phoney asylum . '
kleinhans from the interior ministry 's asylum department said it was important to let people know that it " really is n't worth making the trip to germany . "
eu visa restrictions have recently been lifted for citizens of bosnia and albania , however , they have been strongly warned against falsely applying for asylum in the bloc .
officials from the european commission have threatened that if similar attempts are made , visa-free travel will be revoked .

follow along as he learns about new year traditions , including the wonders and occasional perils of fireworks in germany . i 've been told to keep my wits about me , to prepare for bombs and rockets fired into crowds of people , and i 've heard grisly tales of burns and maiming .
but i did n't just sign up for the army ; i 'm just trying to celebrate new year 's eve - or as they call it here in germany - silvester .
the roots of this chaotic tradition , scaring off evil spirits with loud noises and commotion , can be traced back to the germanic teuton tribes .
it 's difficult to pinpoint exactly when rockets and fireworks became an integral part of celebrating silvester in germany , but there 's no denying the tradition is well entrenched .
" well , the fireworks are definitely the most important part of new year 's eve , " berlin resident jutta tischendorf said .
" when i was a little child i was always really excited that i was allowed to stay up that late .
you 'd wait until 12 o 'clock , and everyone would storm out , then we 'd do the countdown , and we 'd line up all those bottles and put the rockets in it , and then count down until it was 12 o 'clock , and then boom , the whole city would explode … it 's so magic , the dark sky and all of a sudden everything 's exploding in a thousand different colors . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people take to the streets with fireworks sold commercially sky rockets in flight it 's not all just fun and games though .
after all you 're dealing with copious amounts of explosives .
" it 's pretty much like a warzone , " tischendorf said .
" depending on where you go in berlin , it would be pretty mad .
there would be rockets going everywhere , you 'd have to be careful not to be hit by anything . "
fuelling the chaos is the fact that , for most germans , new year 's eve is the only time that they can buy and use class ii fireworks , which are almost anything bigger than a hand-held sparkler .
hansi zinn is a professional pyrotechnician , one of the privileged and licensed few that can buy and operate class ii fireworks whenever he pleases .
he 's coordinated fireworks displays and pyrotechnics for bonn 's klangwelle festival and cologne 's lanxess arena .
but the beginnings of his pyrotechnics career began out of self-preservation .
" when i ran a restaurant in bonn , i did n't want my guests to use fireworks during the new year eve parties , " zinn said .
instead , zinn began organizing his own fireworks shows .
" i started doing it rather amateurishly .
i constructed a rack with about 100 little bottles , filled them with rockets and other fireworks .
there was great cheer when i launched them , because it was n't common yet at that time . "
his reticence for allowing a fireworks free-for-all was born out of previous bad experience when a firecracker exploded in his hand when he was a student .
" at that time , i was not as careful and prudent as i am today , " zinn said .
" we had had some beer already .
and then i held the first cracker in my hand for too long , which ended with a bloody hand . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's annual fireworks show draws hundreds of thousands of spectators busy night for fire department it 's easy to guess that silvester is not much of a party for emergency departments either .
all across germany , fire and ambulance crews bolster their forces and are on high alert for a rash of injuries and spot fires as midnight approaches .
carsten schneider , deputy chief fire officer for the city of bonn , said that the department is prepared for a high number of casualties and fires , which can sometimes be serious .
" we have a number of about 60 to 80 incidents , medical incidents , between about a quarter to midnight and about six o 'clock in the morning , " schneider said .
in spite of the risks , and increasing restrictions on the use of fireworks throughout the eu , it seems that it just would n't be a german silvester without them .
" i do n't think that will ever happen .
they have put restrictions on age with different kinds of fireworks , but it 's just really important that everyone does their own fireworks , " tischendorf said .
" you 're not just standing there watching something , you 're doing it yourself and you go to the shops the day before and you get prepared and everyone 's just excited about it .
i would n't be able to imagine silvester without the whole process . "

renewable energy projects in india are regarded as particularly green since they reduce the country 's dependence on coal . a 2,000-hectare -lrb- 5,000-acre -rrb- solar village , which will be the first in asia to produce 500 megawatts of power , was inaugurated in western india 's gujarat state on thursday by gujarat chief minister narendra modi . " by harnessing solar energy to generate 500 mw power , we will be able to cut carbon emission by a whopping 8 million tons , " he said . at a cost of 120 billion rupees -lrb- 2 billion euros -rrb- , the gujarat solar project will offer solar power manufacturing , assembly , as well as research and development-related facilities , modi said .
a training center has also been envisaged to train local people to work for corporations at the site . the indian government has committed to generating 20,000 megawatts of solar power by 2022 .
as part of this effort , the state of gujarat intends to harvest 500 megawatts of electricity from its solar power park . solar success while the goals are ambitious , they are not out of reach , according to gon chaudhuri , managing director of the west bengal green energy development corporation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : solar power projects have few downsides in india " any solar project will likely be successful in india , and gujarat has very good solar radiation , " he told deutsche welle .
" a solar village in europe gets about 1,000 kilowatt hours per square meter while in india it can be 1,700 . " in fact , gujarat 's government has said the charanka village , where the gujarat park is located , receives an average of 330 sunny days a year , with an average intensity of six kilowatts per square meter , making it an ideal location for solar power generation . solar and other renewable energy projects in india are particularly environmentally friendly because they decrease the use of coal-based power plants , which account for nearly 62 percent of energy production , chaudhuri said . " a lot of the coal in india is of poor quality and releases a lot of greenhouse gases , " he added .
" in that sense , indian solar energy programs , which have zero emissions , are very beneficial to the environment because they directly replace low-grade coal . " economic benefits in addition to the environmental benefits , the state government also said it hopes the village will result in 750 billion rupees -lrb- 12.5 billion euros -rrb- of investment in gujarat . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most electricity in india comes from coal-fired power plants the gujarat power corporation -lrb- gpcl -rrb- has been appointed the central agency to establish , operate and maintain the park and 15 companies have already been provided with plots .
the state government has also agreed to purchase 993 megawatts worth of power from the site to encourage development . the charanka village is leasing plots to companies on 30-year contracts and provides water , electricity , roads and power transmission services , according to a statement on the gujarat government website . as india 's largest trade partner in europe , german companies , which remain at the fore of solar power technology , are expected to participate in the gujarat solar park 's activities .
it is unclear if german firms are among the 80 companies in private talks with gpcl . the project 's first phase is expected to go online by december 2011 . author : sean sinico editor : saroja coelho send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

renewable energy projects in india are regarded as particularly green since they reduce the country 's dependence on coal . a 2,000-hectare -lrb- 5,000-acre -rrb- solar village , which will be the first in asia to produce 500 megawatts of power , was inaugurated in western india 's gujarat state on thursday by gujarat chief minister narendra modi . " by harnessing solar energy to generate 500 mw power , we will be able to cut carbon emission by a whopping 8 million tons , " he said . at a cost of 120 billion rupees -lrb- 2 billion euros -rrb- , the gujarat solar project will offer solar power manufacturing , assembly , as well as research and development-related facilities , modi said .
a training center has also been envisaged to train local people to work for corporations at the site . the indian government has committed to generating 20,000 megawatts of solar power by 2022 .
as part of this effort , the state of gujarat intends to harvest 500 megawatts of electricity from its solar power park . solar success while the goals are ambitious , they are not out of reach , according to gon chaudhuri , managing director of the west bengal green energy development corporation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : solar power projects have few downsides in india " any solar project will likely be successful in india , and gujarat has very good solar radiation , " he told deutsche welle .
" a solar village in europe gets about 1,000 kilowatt hours per square meter while in india it can be 1,700 . " in fact , gujarat 's government has said the charanka village , where the gujarat park is located , receives an average of 330 sunny days a year , with an average intensity of six kilowatts per square meter , making it an ideal location for solar power generation . solar and other renewable energy projects in india are particularly environmentally friendly because they decrease the use of coal-based power plants , which account for nearly 62 percent of energy production , chaudhuri said . " a lot of the coal in india is of poor quality and releases a lot of greenhouse gases , " he added .
" in that sense , indian solar energy programs , which have zero emissions , are very beneficial to the environment because they directly replace low-grade coal . " economic benefits in addition to the environmental benefits , the state government also said it hopes the village will result in 750 billion rupees -lrb- 12.5 billion euros -rrb- of investment in gujarat . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most electricity in india comes from coal-fired power plants the gujarat power corporation -lrb- gpcl -rrb- has been appointed the central agency to establish , operate and maintain the park and 15 companies have already been provided with plots .
the state government has also agreed to purchase 993 megawatts worth of power from the site to encourage development . the charanka village is leasing plots to companies on 30-year contracts and provides water , electricity , roads and power transmission services , according to a statement on the gujarat government website . as india 's largest trade partner in europe , german companies , which remain at the fore of solar power technology , are expected to participate in the gujarat solar park 's activities .
it is unclear if german firms are among the 80 companies in private talks with gpcl . the project 's first phase is expected to go online by december 2011 . author : sean sinico editor : saroja coelho send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

follow along as he learns about new year traditions , including the wonders and occasional perils of fireworks in germany . i 've been told to keep my wits about me , to prepare for bombs and rockets fired into crowds of people , and i 've heard grisly tales of burns and maiming .
but i did n't just sign up for the army ; i 'm just trying to celebrate new year 's eve - or as they call it here in germany - silvester .
the roots of this chaotic tradition , scaring off evil spirits with loud noises and commotion , can be traced back to the germanic teuton tribes .
it 's difficult to pinpoint exactly when rockets and fireworks became an integral part of celebrating silvester in germany , but there 's no denying the tradition is well entrenched .
" well , the fireworks are definitely the most important part of new year 's eve , " berlin resident jutta tischendorf said .
" when i was a little child i was always really excited that i was allowed to stay up that late .
you 'd wait until 12 o 'clock , and everyone would storm out , then we 'd do the countdown , and we 'd line up all those bottles and put the rockets in it , and then count down until it was 12 o 'clock , and then boom , the whole city would explode … it 's so magic , the dark sky and all of a sudden everything 's exploding in a thousand different colors . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people take to the streets with fireworks sold commercially sky rockets in flight it 's not all just fun and games though .
after all you 're dealing with copious amounts of explosives .
" it 's pretty much like a warzone , " tischendorf said .
" depending on where you go in berlin , it would be pretty mad .
there would be rockets going everywhere , you 'd have to be careful not to be hit by anything . "
fuelling the chaos is the fact that , for most germans , new year 's eve is the only time that they can buy and use class ii fireworks , which are almost anything bigger than a hand-held sparkler .
hansi zinn is a professional pyrotechnician , one of the privileged and licensed few that can buy and operate class ii fireworks whenever he pleases .
he 's coordinated fireworks displays and pyrotechnics for bonn 's klangwelle festival and cologne 's lanxess arena .
but the beginnings of his pyrotechnics career began out of self-preservation .
" when i ran a restaurant in bonn , i did n't want my guests to use fireworks during the new year eve parties , " zinn said .
instead , zinn began organizing his own fireworks shows .
" i started doing it rather amateurishly .
i constructed a rack with about 100 little bottles , filled them with rockets and other fireworks .
there was great cheer when i launched them , because it was n't common yet at that time . "
his reticence for allowing a fireworks free-for-all was born out of previous bad experience when a firecracker exploded in his hand when he was a student .
" at that time , i was not as careful and prudent as i am today , " zinn said .
" we had had some beer already .
and then i held the first cracker in my hand for too long , which ended with a bloody hand . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's annual fireworks show draws hundreds of thousands of spectators busy night for fire department it 's easy to guess that silvester is not much of a party for emergency departments either .
all across germany , fire and ambulance crews bolster their forces and are on high alert for a rash of injuries and spot fires as midnight approaches .
carsten schneider , deputy chief fire officer for the city of bonn , said that the department is prepared for a high number of casualties and fires , which can sometimes be serious .
" we have a number of about 60 to 80 incidents , medical incidents , between about a quarter to midnight and about six o 'clock in the morning , " schneider said .
in spite of the risks , and increasing restrictions on the use of fireworks throughout the eu , it seems that it just would n't be a german silvester without them .
" i do n't think that will ever happen .
they have put restrictions on age with different kinds of fireworks , but it 's just really important that everyone does their own fireworks , " tischendorf said .
" you 're not just standing there watching something , you 're doing it yourself and you go to the shops the day before and you get prepared and everyone 's just excited about it .
i would n't be able to imagine silvester without the whole process . "

the german press reacted with equal pessimism . a spotlight was shone on russia this week with the sentencing on fraud charges of fallen oligarch mikhail khodorkovsky , formerly the country 's richest man .
europe and the united states have blasted the trial as politically motivated and a step backward for the rule of law .
khodorkovsky , 47 , was sentenced to six more years in prison , with a release date of 2017 .
german national daily newspaper die welt wrote that the russian court responsible for hearing khodorkovsky 's case bent terribly in favor of russian prosecutors : " judge viktor danilkin has followed the predetermined path to the very end .
in the case of former oil mogul mikhail khodorkovsky and his business partner platon lebedev , he has followed to a tee the petitions of the public prosecutor 's office , which had asked for six-year sentences for the pair .
with a total incarceration of 14 years , including the time already served , the two men will not be freed until 2017 .
the court has stuck to public and direct statements on the matter of prime minister vladimir putin . "
the berliner zeitung newspaper wrote of the single-mindedness of the russian justice system : " the process showed how russian justice functions : the authorities are the ones who decide who the thief is … to position khodorkovsky as a moral rolemodel in russian consciousness will be difficult .
despite all sympathy afforded him due to his dealings with the repressive measures of the russian justice system , the former oligarch will nevertheless remain for many russians as a fraudster who was infinitely rich when many had hardly anything . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : khodorkovsky and his co-defendant lebedev both received six more years the sueddeutsche zeitung , wrote that president dmitry medvedev did not do enough to influence the trial , and that putin was the eventual victor over his long-time crititc khodorkovsky : " president dmitry medvedev has not fulfilled expectations , some of which may have been misplaced .
though , the fact that the verdict was seemingly still up in the air until the end may have been down to the legal expert medvedev .
whether or not he had the power to push for a milder sentence for khodorkovsky , nothing changes the fact he has acted like an accomplice in revenge .
this judicial ruling , which few in russia hold to be independent , has worked according to the calculations of prime minister vladimir putin against one of his long-time foes . "
the nuernberger nachrichten daily attempted to put khodorkovsky 's sentencing into a wider context of rights violations among some of europe 's key partners : " the strongman of russia has moved with full rigor against his critics .
critics of the belarusian regime have also ended up in prison .
hungary , which soon takes over the rotating eu presidency , has from the new year implemented a restrictive media law that reeks of democratic mockery .
these are troubling times for fundamental human rights - particularly when the west reacts purely with words of little consequence , reluctant to exert pressure on important trading partners . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de balkans -pipe- 31.12.2010 high number of serbian asylum seekers linked to travel scam großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bus-loads of serbians have applied for asylum in germany serbians make up the highest number of asylum seekers to germany , followed by their macedonian neighbors .
a sudden jump in applications could be linked to a balkan travel scam seen elsewhere in europe . a sudden spurt in applications for asylum in germany has been linked to an alleged travel scam taking place in the balkans .
according to the head of the german government 's asylum department , people from serbia and macedonia are being encouraged to buy one-way bus tickets to germany and given " empty promises " that they will find work and money once they get there .
" we suspect there has been an organized abuse of the asylum procedure , whereby people in macedonia and serbia have organized bus trips into germany , " said michael kleinhans , head of the asylum department at the federal office for migration and refugees .
" they tell people that in germany you can earn money and it 's worth making the trip as they 'll easily cover their costs , " kleinhans told deutsche welle .
a bus ticket costs between 200 and 400 euros -lrb- $ 267- $ 534 -rrb- , but unscrupulous travel agents sell the tickets claiming the passengers can get a free return journey from the german government once in germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : asylum seekers must prove they fled persecution to stay in germany instead , their applications are swiftly rejected and the applicants are bussed back to the balkans .
' a stark increase ' the federal office for migration and refugees keeps monthly records of the number of asylum seekers and their countries of origin .
for most of 2010 , the majority of refugees came from afghanistan and iraq .
however , from september through to november there was a sharp rise in asylum applicants from the balkans .
in november the highest number of applications came from serbians - 1,159 - followed by macedonians , with 512 .
the two groups made up over a third of the total applicants that month , " a stark increase , " kleinhans said .
serbia , macedonian and montenegran passport holders have been able to travel into the eu without a visa since december 2009 .
but the rules only allow them to come as tourists and do not allow them to work legally in the bloc .
similar scheme in belgium and sweden it 's not the first time a scam like this has been attempted .
following the change to the visa rules , several hundred serbs , macedonians and montenegrins tried to leave their countries in search of greener pastures in the eu earlier in 2010 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : to travel to the eu , serbians need a new biometric passport deutsche welle 's balkans correspondent , mark lowen , said that belgium and sweden " bore the brunt of the exodus " at the time , with 700 to 800 people arriving in each country .
the applications were rejected , and busloads of failed asylum seekers were sent back to the balkans .
" those attempting to leave were predominantly ethnic albanians - who tend to come from the poorer areas of serbia and macedonia , " he explained .
" those who tried to make the journey painted a very desperate picture of poverty , and many feel discriminated against . "
no tolerance eu officials have made it clear that they will not tolerate this so-called ' phoney asylum . '
kleinhans from the interior ministry 's asylum department said it was important to let people know that it " really is n't worth making the trip to germany . "
eu visa restrictions have recently been lifted for citizens of bosnia and albania , however , they have been strongly warned against falsely applying for asylum in the bloc .
officials from the european commission have threatened that if similar attempts are made , visa-free travel will be revoked .

follow along as he learns about new year traditions , including the wonders and occasional perils of fireworks in germany . i 've been told to keep my wits about me , to prepare for bombs and rockets fired into crowds of people , and i 've heard grisly tales of burns and maiming .
but i did n't just sign up for the army ; i 'm just trying to celebrate new year 's eve - or as they call it here in germany - silvester .
the roots of this chaotic tradition , scaring off evil spirits with loud noises and commotion , can be traced back to the germanic teuton tribes .
it 's difficult to pinpoint exactly when rockets and fireworks became an integral part of celebrating silvester in germany , but there 's no denying the tradition is well entrenched .
" well , the fireworks are definitely the most important part of new year 's eve , " berlin resident jutta tischendorf said .
" when i was a little child i was always really excited that i was allowed to stay up that late .
you 'd wait until 12 o 'clock , and everyone would storm out , then we 'd do the countdown , and we 'd line up all those bottles and put the rockets in it , and then count down until it was 12 o 'clock , and then boom , the whole city would explode … it 's so magic , the dark sky and all of a sudden everything 's exploding in a thousand different colors . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people take to the streets with fireworks sold commercially sky rockets in flight it 's not all just fun and games though .
after all you 're dealing with copious amounts of explosives .
" it 's pretty much like a warzone , " tischendorf said .
" depending on where you go in berlin , it would be pretty mad .
there would be rockets going everywhere , you 'd have to be careful not to be hit by anything . "
fuelling the chaos is the fact that , for most germans , new year 's eve is the only time that they can buy and use class ii fireworks , which are almost anything bigger than a hand-held sparkler .
hansi zinn is a professional pyrotechnician , one of the privileged and licensed few that can buy and operate class ii fireworks whenever he pleases .
he 's coordinated fireworks displays and pyrotechnics for bonn 's klangwelle festival and cologne 's lanxess arena .
but the beginnings of his pyrotechnics career began out of self-preservation .
" when i ran a restaurant in bonn , i did n't want my guests to use fireworks during the new year eve parties , " zinn said .
instead , zinn began organizing his own fireworks shows .
" i started doing it rather amateurishly .
i constructed a rack with about 100 little bottles , filled them with rockets and other fireworks .
there was great cheer when i launched them , because it was n't common yet at that time . "
his reticence for allowing a fireworks free-for-all was born out of previous bad experience when a firecracker exploded in his hand when he was a student .
" at that time , i was not as careful and prudent as i am today , " zinn said .
" we had had some beer already .
and then i held the first cracker in my hand for too long , which ended with a bloody hand . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's annual fireworks show draws hundreds of thousands of spectators busy night for fire department it 's easy to guess that silvester is not much of a party for emergency departments either .
all across germany , fire and ambulance crews bolster their forces and are on high alert for a rash of injuries and spot fires as midnight approaches .
carsten schneider , deputy chief fire officer for the city of bonn , said that the department is prepared for a high number of casualties and fires , which can sometimes be serious .
" we have a number of about 60 to 80 incidents , medical incidents , between about a quarter to midnight and about six o 'clock in the morning , " schneider said .
in spite of the risks , and increasing restrictions on the use of fireworks throughout the eu , it seems that it just would n't be a german silvester without them .
" i do n't think that will ever happen .

a sudden jump in applications could be linked to a balkan travel scam seen elsewhere in europe . a sudden spurt in applications for asylum in germany has been linked to an alleged travel scam taking place in the balkans .
according to the head of the german government 's asylum department , people from serbia and macedonia are being encouraged to buy one-way bus tickets to germany and given " empty promises " that they will find work and money once they get there .
" we suspect there has been an organized abuse of the asylum procedure , whereby people in macedonia and serbia have organized bus trips into germany , " said michael kleinhans , head of the asylum department at the federal office for migration and refugees .
" they tell people that in germany you can earn money and it 's worth making the trip as they 'll easily cover their costs , " kleinhans told deutsche welle .
a bus ticket costs between 200 and 400 euros -lrb- $ 267- $ 534 -rrb- , but unscrupulous travel agents sell the tickets claiming the passengers can get a free return journey from the german government once in germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : asylum seekers must prove they fled persecution to stay in germany instead , their applications are swiftly rejected and the applicants are bussed back to the balkans .
' a stark increase ' the federal office for migration and refugees keeps monthly records of the number of asylum seekers and their countries of origin .
for most of 2010 , the majority of refugees came from afghanistan and iraq .
however , from september through to november there was a sharp rise in asylum applicants from the balkans .
in november the highest number of applications came from serbians - 1,159 - followed by macedonians , with 512 .
the two groups made up over a third of the total applicants that month , " a stark increase , " kleinhans said .
serbia , macedonian and montenegran passport holders have been able to travel into the eu without a visa since december 2009 .
but the rules only allow them to come as tourists and do not allow them to work legally in the bloc .
similar scheme in belgium and sweden it 's not the first time a scam like this has been attempted .
following the change to the visa rules , several hundred serbs , macedonians and montenegrins tried to leave their countries in search of greener pastures in the eu earlier in 2010 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : to travel to the eu , serbians need a new biometric passport deutsche welle 's balkans correspondent , mark lowen , said that belgium and sweden " bore the brunt of the exodus " at the time , with 700 to 800 people arriving in each country .
the applications were rejected , and busloads of failed asylum seekers were sent back to the balkans .
" those attempting to leave were predominantly ethnic albanians - who tend to come from the poorer areas of serbia and macedonia , " he explained .
" those who tried to make the journey painted a very desperate picture of poverty , and many feel discriminated against . "
no tolerance eu officials have made it clear that they will not tolerate this so-called ' phoney asylum . '
kleinhans from the interior ministry 's asylum department said it was important to let people know that it " really is n't worth making the trip to germany . "
eu visa restrictions have recently been lifted for citizens of bosnia and albania , however , they have been strongly warned against falsely applying for asylum in the bloc .
officials from the european commission have threatened that if similar attempts are made , visa-free travel will be revoked .

follow along as he learns about new year traditions , including the wonders and occasional perils of fireworks in germany . i 've been told to keep my wits about me , to prepare for bombs and rockets fired into crowds of people , and i 've heard grisly tales of burns and maiming .
but i did n't just sign up for the army ; i 'm just trying to celebrate new year 's eve - or as they call it here in germany - silvester .
the roots of this chaotic tradition , scaring off evil spirits with loud noises and commotion , can be traced back to the germanic teuton tribes .
it 's difficult to pinpoint exactly when rockets and fireworks became an integral part of celebrating silvester in germany , but there 's no denying the tradition is well entrenched .
" well , the fireworks are definitely the most important part of new year 's eve , " berlin resident jutta tischendorf said .
" when i was a little child i was always really excited that i was allowed to stay up that late .
you 'd wait until 12 o 'clock , and everyone would storm out , then we 'd do the countdown , and we 'd line up all those bottles and put the rockets in it , and then count down until it was 12 o 'clock , and then boom , the whole city would explode … it 's so magic , the dark sky and all of a sudden everything 's exploding in a thousand different colors . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people take to the streets with fireworks sold commercially sky rockets in flight it 's not all just fun and games though .
after all you 're dealing with copious amounts of explosives .
" it 's pretty much like a warzone , " tischendorf said .
" depending on where you go in berlin , it would be pretty mad .
there would be rockets going everywhere , you 'd have to be careful not to be hit by anything . "
fuelling the chaos is the fact that , for most germans , new year 's eve is the only time that they can buy and use class ii fireworks , which are almost anything bigger than a hand-held sparkler .
hansi zinn is a professional pyrotechnician , one of the privileged and licensed few that can buy and operate class ii fireworks whenever he pleases .
he 's coordinated fireworks displays and pyrotechnics for bonn 's klangwelle festival and cologne 's lanxess arena .
but the beginnings of his pyrotechnics career began out of self-preservation .
" when i ran a restaurant in bonn , i did n't want my guests to use fireworks during the new year eve parties , " zinn said .
instead , zinn began organizing his own fireworks shows .
" i started doing it rather amateurishly .
i constructed a rack with about 100 little bottles , filled them with rockets and other fireworks .
there was great cheer when i launched them , because it was n't common yet at that time . "
his reticence for allowing a fireworks free-for-all was born out of previous bad experience when a firecracker exploded in his hand when he was a student .
" at that time , i was not as careful and prudent as i am today , " zinn said .
" we had had some beer already .
and then i held the first cracker in my hand for too long , which ended with a bloody hand . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's annual fireworks show draws hundreds of thousands of spectators busy night for fire department it 's easy to guess that silvester is not much of a party for emergency departments either .
all across germany , fire and ambulance crews bolster their forces and are on high alert for a rash of injuries and spot fires as midnight approaches .
carsten schneider , deputy chief fire officer for the city of bonn , said that the department is prepared for a high number of casualties and fires , which can sometimes be serious .
" we have a number of about 60 to 80 incidents , medical incidents , between about a quarter to midnight and about six o 'clock in the morning , " schneider said .
in spite of the risks , and increasing restrictions on the use of fireworks throughout the eu , it seems that it just would n't be a german silvester without them .
" i do n't think that will ever happen .
they have put restrictions on age with different kinds of fireworks , but it 's just really important that everyone does their own fireworks , " tischendorf said .
" you 're not just standing there watching something , you 're doing it yourself and you go to the shops the day before and you get prepared and everyone 's just excited about it .
i would n't be able to imagine silvester without the whole process . "

the german press reacted with equal pessimism . a spotlight was shone on russia this week with the sentencing on fraud charges of fallen oligarch mikhail khodorkovsky , formerly the country 's richest man .
europe and the united states have blasted the trial as politically motivated and a step backward for the rule of law .
khodorkovsky , 47 , was sentenced to six more years in prison , with a release date of 2017 .
german national daily newspaper die welt wrote that the russian court responsible for hearing khodorkovsky 's case bent terribly in favor of russian prosecutors : " judge viktor danilkin has followed the predetermined path to the very end .
in the case of former oil mogul mikhail khodorkovsky and his business partner platon lebedev , he has followed to a tee the petitions of the public prosecutor 's office , which had asked for six-year sentences for the pair .
with a total incarceration of 14 years , including the time already served , the two men will not be freed until 2017 .
the court has stuck to public and direct statements on the matter of prime minister vladimir putin . "
the berliner zeitung newspaper wrote of the single-mindedness of the russian justice system : " the process showed how russian justice functions : the authorities are the ones who decide who the thief is … to position khodorkovsky as a moral rolemodel in russian consciousness will be difficult .
despite all sympathy afforded him due to his dealings with the repressive measures of the russian justice system , the former oligarch will nevertheless remain for many russians as a fraudster who was infinitely rich when many had hardly anything . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : khodorkovsky and his co-defendant lebedev both received six more years the sueddeutsche zeitung , wrote that president dmitry medvedev did not do enough to influence the trial , and that putin was the eventual victor over his long-time crititc khodorkovsky : " president dmitry medvedev has not fulfilled expectations , some of which may have been misplaced .
though , the fact that the verdict was seemingly still up in the air until the end may have been down to the legal expert medvedev .
whether or not he had the power to push for a milder sentence for khodorkovsky , nothing changes the fact he has acted like an accomplice in revenge .
this judicial ruling , which few in russia hold to be independent , has worked according to the calculations of prime minister vladimir putin against one of his long-time foes . "
the nuernberger nachrichten daily attempted to put khodorkovsky 's sentencing into a wider context of rights violations among some of europe 's key partners : " the strongman of russia has moved with full rigor against his critics .
critics of the belarusian regime have also ended up in prison .
hungary , which soon takes over the rotating eu presidency , has from the new year implemented a restrictive media law that reeks of democratic mockery .
these are troubling times for fundamental human rights - particularly when the west reacts purely with words of little consequence , reluctant to exert pressure on important trading partners . "

renewable energy projects in india are regarded as particularly green since they reduce the country 's dependence on coal . a 2,000-hectare -lrb- 5,000-acre -rrb- solar village , which will be the first in asia to produce 500 megawatts of power , was inaugurated in western india 's gujarat state on thursday by gujarat chief minister narendra modi . " by harnessing solar energy to generate 500 mw power , we will be able to cut carbon emission by a whopping 8 million tons , " he said . at a cost of 120 billion rupees -lrb- 2 billion euros -rrb- , the gujarat solar project will offer solar power manufacturing , assembly , as well as research and development-related facilities , modi said .
a training center has also been envisaged to train local people to work for corporations at the site . the indian government has committed to generating 20,000 megawatts of solar power by 2022 .
as part of this effort , the state of gujarat intends to harvest 500 megawatts of electricity from its solar power park . solar success while the goals are ambitious , they are not out of reach , according to gon chaudhuri , managing director of the west bengal green energy development corporation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : solar power projects have few downsides in india " any solar project will likely be successful in india , and gujarat has very good solar radiation , " he told deutsche welle .
" a solar village in europe gets about 1,000 kilowatt hours per square meter while in india it can be 1,700 . " in fact , gujarat 's government has said the charanka village , where the gujarat park is located , receives an average of 330 sunny days a year , with an average intensity of six kilowatts per square meter , making it an ideal location for solar power generation . solar and other renewable energy projects in india are particularly environmentally friendly because they decrease the use of coal-based power plants , which account for nearly 62 percent of energy production , chaudhuri said . " a lot of the coal in india is of poor quality and releases a lot of greenhouse gases , " he added .
" in that sense , indian solar energy programs , which have zero emissions , are very beneficial to the environment because they directly replace low-grade coal . " economic benefits in addition to the environmental benefits , the state government also said it hopes the village will result in 750 billion rupees -lrb- 12.5 billion euros -rrb- of investment in gujarat . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most electricity in india comes from coal-fired power plants the gujarat power corporation -lrb- gpcl -rrb- has been appointed the central agency to establish , operate and maintain the park and 15 companies have already been provided with plots .
the state government has also agreed to purchase 993 megawatts worth of power from the site to encourage development . the charanka village is leasing plots to companies on 30-year contracts and provides water , electricity , roads and power transmission services , according to a statement on the gujarat government website . as india 's largest trade partner in europe , german companies , which remain at the fore of solar power technology , are expected to participate in the gujarat solar park 's activities .
it is unclear if german firms are among the 80 companies in private talks with gpcl . the project 's first phase is expected to go online by december 2011 . author : sean sinico editor : saroja coelho send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" although foreign nationals are not at present threatened , the french authorities renew their advice ... to all french citizens who can , in particular families with children , to temporarily leave ivory coast , " a foreign ministry spokesman said .
tension in ivory coast has been high in the weeks following the country 's presidential election on november 28 .
although alassane ouattara is widely recognized internationally as the winner of the election , incumbent president laurent gbagbo refuses to give up power .
a delegation from the economic community for west african states -lrb- ecowas -rrb- that traveled to ivory coast on tuesday was unsuccessful in its attempt to persuade gbagbo to step now .
prior to the visit of the presidents of three ecowas nations , the west african bloc had indicated that it would use military force if necessary .
international support on friday , british foreign secretary william hague said in an interview with bbc that gbagbo should not underestimate the determination of the international community , and that the uk would be supportive of a military intervention that was sanctioned by the united nations .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gbagbo refuses to step down this did not mean he was suggesting that british troops would be sent to help , hague said .
the united nations has peacekeeping troops stationed at the golf hotel in abidjan , which is housing ouattara 's government .
un secretary general ban ki-moon issued a statement on thursday warning against attacks on the peacekeepers , and that un forces were authorized to use " all necessary means to protect its personnel , as well as the government officials and other civilians at these premises of the hotel . "
the un reports that at least 173 people have been killed in post-election violence .

in an interview with dw , journalist paul lendvai criticizes prime minister viktor orban for throwing around the weight of his two-thirds majority . in january 1 , 2011 , hungary is to take over the eu 's six-month rotating presidency , throwing into the spotlight a country of just under 10 million people .
a center-right government holds a two-thirds majority in the hungarian parliament , which is grappling with the fallout of the 2007 financial crisis , which hit the country hard .
austrian journalist paul lendvai is editor-in-chief of the vienna-based german-language publication die europaeische rundschau .
he splits his time between vienna and budapest , where he was born .
deutsche welle : you 've titled your latest book about hungary " mein verspieltes land " -lrb- my squandered country -rrb- . what does this mean ?
is hungary not a fully developed country , or do hungarians have a penchant for political games ?
paul lendvai : i believe it 's more the latter .
the title is ambiguous and equivocal .
but without a doubt it was my aim to show in this book that over the past 20 years hungary has often squandered the opportunities that came with the fall of communism in 1989 .
hungary was of course one of the first countries in the eastern bloc to free itself of the chains of communism - and without revolutionary upheaval . after that , there was a series of shifts in government between left- and right-of-center parties , bringing abrupt political changes .
hungary has been a member of nato since 1999 and a member of the european union since 2004 .
how european do hungarians feel at this point ?
unfortunately , renationalization is a stronger trend right now in hungary than europeanization .
what do i mean by that ?
i mean that european states , especially the 27 in the eu , have more or less overcome their differences and are trying to create a common market , common values and a common future - and look together towards the future .
that 's where hungary faces problems .
some of those problems are rooted in the country 's history , some in its geography and some in the bankruptcy or impotency of the country 's political elite , the political classes .
viktor orban was previously prime minister between 1998 and 2002 .
now he 's back in power .
he 's staunchly conservative , and many have even said he 's a nationalist .
what 's his agenda ?
no one knows , because , while orban 's party has regained power , it has no consistent economic strategy .
the government moves from one course of action to the next .
they already have made grave errors in their first 100 days in power , for instance by comparing hungary 's condition with greece 's .
the government is putting the nation and the church first , rather than civil liberties .
this type of politics creates tension with neighboring countries , with romania and especially with slovakia .
relations with serbia are also somewhat tense .
part of orban 's agenda is also about getting ethnic hungarians in the carpathian basin involved in a common policy . the introduction of dual citizenship is part of this agenda , and after hungary 's eu presidency , orban will probably give the vote to ethnic hungarians outside of hungary .
orban 's tax policies benefit the upper middle class .
his politics are aimed against the globalization of foreign capital , but he maintains at the same time a good relationship with local oligarchs .
it 's actually a very left-populist rhetoric , but at the same time the government is nationalist .
these contradictions probably work as long as one can blame everything on the mistakes and failures of the earlier , socialist-liberal government .
at present a majority of hungarians support viktor orban , this strong man .
there 's a longing for a strong man , and the whole media landscape is being reformed .
imagine a situation in which all public broadcasters are rolled into one government media authority , with a board of directors filled by the ruling party - and that for the next nine years .
in hungary there 's fear , and two liberal newspapers , one literary newspaper and another weekly for young readers printed editions with blank title pages in protest .
their intention was to demonstrate the threat of censorship - or the threat of media regulation .
you say that orban is throwing his weight around .
how do his politics fit with the eu and with the eu presidency ?
are n't there huge contradictions there ?
you ca n't have nationalist politics on the one hand and make european compromises on the other , can you ?
i believe that hungary will resolve that issue in these six months .
orban wants to make a good impression .
he is friendly toward angela merkel and silvio berlusconi , and he was recently in moscow to improve relations there .
i believe there will be a tightening of the reins at home , an absolute concentration of judicial , political and media power .
in its foreign relations orban 's government strikes a friendly , open tone .
he has a foreign minister who speaks excellent french , english and german .
he himself speaks english and was previously prime minister .
i do n't believe that one can expect major initiatives , but they will do all they can to ensure that all of the conferences and events come off elegantly and in style .
i can say one thing : unlike the czech republic , where the government fell during the eu presidency , hungary does n't face that danger .
the government in hungary has a two-thirds majority in parliament .
and when it comes to the major issues , the government has the support of the extreme right opposition party jobbik . interview : bernd riegert -lrb- dl -rrb- editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a sudden jump in applications could be linked to a balkan travel scam seen elsewhere in europe . a sudden spurt in applications for asylum in germany has been linked to an alleged travel scam taking place in the balkans .
according to the head of the german government 's asylum department , people from serbia and macedonia are being encouraged to buy one-way bus tickets to germany and given " empty promises " that they will find work and money once they get there .
" we suspect there has been an organized abuse of the asylum procedure , whereby people in macedonia and serbia have organized bus trips into germany , " said michael kleinhans , head of the asylum department at the federal office for migration and refugees .
" they tell people that in germany you can earn money and it 's worth making the trip as they 'll easily cover their costs , " kleinhans told deutsche welle .
a bus ticket costs between 200 and 400 euros -lrb- $ 267- $ 534 -rrb- , but unscrupulous travel agents sell the tickets claiming the passengers can get a free return journey from the german government once in germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : asylum seekers must prove they fled persecution to stay in germany instead , their applications are swiftly rejected and the applicants are bussed back to the balkans .
' a stark increase ' the federal office for migration and refugees keeps monthly records of the number of asylum seekers and their countries of origin .
for most of 2010 , the majority of refugees came from afghanistan and iraq .
however , from september through to november there was a sharp rise in asylum applicants from the balkans .
in november the highest number of applications came from serbians - 1,159 - followed by macedonians , with 512 .
the two groups made up over a third of the total applicants that month , " a stark increase , " kleinhans said .
serbia , macedonian and montenegran passport holders have been able to travel into the eu without a visa since december 2009 .
but the rules only allow them to come as tourists and do not allow them to work legally in the bloc .
similar scheme in belgium and sweden it 's not the first time a scam like this has been attempted .
following the change to the visa rules , several hundred serbs , macedonians and montenegrins tried to leave their countries in search of greener pastures in the eu earlier in 2010 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : to travel to the eu , serbians need a new biometric passport deutsche welle 's balkans correspondent , mark lowen , said that belgium and sweden " bore the brunt of the exodus " at the time , with 700 to 800 people arriving in each country .
the applications were rejected , and busloads of failed asylum seekers were sent back to the balkans .
" those attempting to leave were predominantly ethnic albanians - who tend to come from the poorer areas of serbia and macedonia , " he explained .
" those who tried to make the journey painted a very desperate picture of poverty , and many feel discriminated against . "
no tolerance eu officials have made it clear that they will not tolerate this so-called ' phoney asylum . '
kleinhans from the interior ministry 's asylum department said it was important to let people know that it " really is n't worth making the trip to germany . "
eu visa restrictions have recently been lifted for citizens of bosnia and albania , however , they have been strongly warned against falsely applying for asylum in the bloc .
officials from the european commission have threatened that if similar attempts are made , visa-free travel will be revoked .

in an interview with dw , journalist paul lendvai criticizes prime minister viktor orban for throwing around the weight of his two-thirds majority . in january 1 , 2011 , hungary is to take over the eu 's six-month rotating presidency , throwing into the spotlight a country of just under 10 million people .
a center-right government holds a two-thirds majority in the hungarian parliament , which is grappling with the fallout of the 2007 financial crisis , which hit the country hard .
austrian journalist paul lendvai is editor-in-chief of the vienna-based german-language publication die europaeische rundschau .
he splits his time between vienna and budapest , where he was born .
deutsche welle : you 've titled your latest book about hungary " mein verspieltes land " -lrb- my squandered country -rrb- . what does this mean ?
is hungary not a fully developed country , or do hungarians have a penchant for political games ?
paul lendvai : i believe it 's more the latter .
the title is ambiguous and equivocal .
but without a doubt it was my aim to show in this book that over the past 20 years hungary has often squandered the opportunities that came with the fall of communism in 1989 .
hungary was of course one of the first countries in the eastern bloc to free itself of the chains of communism - and without revolutionary upheaval . after that , there was a series of shifts in government between left- and right-of-center parties , bringing abrupt political changes .
hungary has been a member of nato since 1999 and a member of the european union since 2004 .
how european do hungarians feel at this point ?
unfortunately , renationalization is a stronger trend right now in hungary than europeanization .
what do i mean by that ?
i mean that european states , especially the 27 in the eu , have more or less overcome their differences and are trying to create a common market , common values and a common future - and look together towards the future .
that 's where hungary faces problems .
some of those problems are rooted in the country 's history , some in its geography and some in the bankruptcy or impotency of the country 's political elite , the political classes .
viktor orban was previously prime minister between 1998 and 2002 .
now he 's back in power .
he 's staunchly conservative , and many have even said he 's a nationalist .
what 's his agenda ?
no one knows , because , while orban 's party has regained power , it has no consistent economic strategy .
the government moves from one course of action to the next .
they already have made grave errors in their first 100 days in power , for instance by comparing hungary 's condition with greece 's .
the government is putting the nation and the church first , rather than civil liberties .
this type of politics creates tension with neighboring countries , with romania and especially with slovakia .
relations with serbia are also somewhat tense .
part of orban 's agenda is also about getting ethnic hungarians in the carpathian basin involved in a common policy . the introduction of dual citizenship is part of this agenda , and after hungary 's eu presidency , orban will probably give the vote to ethnic hungarians outside of hungary .
orban 's tax policies benefit the upper middle class .
his politics are aimed against the globalization of foreign capital , but he maintains at the same time a good relationship with local oligarchs .
it 's actually a very left-populist rhetoric , but at the same time the government is nationalist .
these contradictions probably work as long as one can blame everything on the mistakes and failures of the earlier , socialist-liberal government .
at present a majority of hungarians support viktor orban , this strong man .
there 's a longing for a strong man , and the whole media landscape is being reformed .
imagine a situation in which all public broadcasters are rolled into one government media authority , with a board of directors filled by the ruling party - and that for the next nine years .
in hungary there 's fear , and two liberal newspapers , one literary newspaper and another weekly for young readers printed editions with blank title pages in protest .
their intention was to demonstrate the threat of censorship - or the threat of media regulation .
you say that orban is throwing his weight around .
how do his politics fit with the eu and with the eu presidency ?
are n't there huge contradictions there ?
you ca n't have nationalist politics on the one hand and make european compromises on the other , can you ?
i believe that hungary will resolve that issue in these six months .
orban wants to make a good impression .
he is friendly toward angela merkel and silvio berlusconi , and he was recently in moscow to improve relations there .
i believe there will be a tightening of the reins at home , an absolute concentration of judicial , political and media power .
in its foreign relations orban 's government strikes a friendly , open tone .
he has a foreign minister who speaks excellent french , english and german .
he himself speaks english and was previously prime minister .
i do n't believe that one can expect major initiatives , but they will do all they can to ensure that all of the conferences and events come off elegantly and in style .
i can say one thing : unlike the czech republic , where the government fell during the eu presidency , hungary does n't face that danger .
the government in hungary has a two-thirds majority in parliament .
and when it comes to the major issues , the government has the support of the extreme right opposition party jobbik . interview : bernd riegert -lrb- dl -rrb- editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

renewable energy projects in india are regarded as particularly green since they reduce the country 's dependence on coal . a 2,000-hectare -lrb- 5,000-acre -rrb- solar village , which will be the first in asia to produce 500 megawatts of power , was inaugurated in western india 's gujarat state on thursday by gujarat chief minister narendra modi .

a training center has also been envisaged to train local people to work for corporations at the site . the indian government has committed to generating 20,000 megawatts of solar power by 2022 .
as part of this effort , the state of gujarat intends to harvest 500 megawatts of electricity from its solar power park . solar success while the goals are ambitious , they are not out of reach , according to gon chaudhuri , managing director of the west bengal green energy development corporation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : solar power projects have few downsides in india " any solar project will likely be successful in india , and gujarat has very good solar radiation , " he told deutsche welle .

a sudden jump in applications could be linked to a balkan travel scam seen elsewhere in europe . a sudden spurt in applications for asylum in germany has been linked to an alleged travel scam taking place in the balkans .
according to the head of the german government 's asylum department , people from serbia and macedonia are being encouraged to buy one-way bus tickets to germany and given " empty promises " that they will find work and money once they get there .
" we suspect there has been an organized abuse of the asylum procedure , whereby people in macedonia and serbia have organized bus trips into germany , " said michael kleinhans , head of the asylum department at the federal office for migration and refugees .
" they tell people that in germany you can earn money and it 's worth making the trip as they 'll easily cover their costs , " kleinhans told deutsche welle .

serbia , macedonian and montenegran passport holders have been able to travel into the eu without a visa since december 2009 .
but the rules only allow them to come as tourists and do not allow them to work legally in the bloc .
similar scheme in belgium and sweden it 's not the first time a scam like this has been attempted .
following the change to the visa rules , several hundred serbs , macedonians and montenegrins tried to leave their countries in search of greener pastures in the eu earlier in 2010 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : to travel to the eu , serbians need a new biometric passport deutsche welle 's balkans correspondent , mark lowen , said that belgium and sweden " bore the brunt of the exodus " at the time , with 700 to 800 people arriving in each country .
the applications were rejected , and busloads of failed asylum seekers were sent back to the balkans .
" those attempting to leave were predominantly ethnic albanians - who tend to come from the poorer areas of serbia and macedonia , " he explained .
" those who tried to make the journey painted a very desperate picture of poverty , and many feel discriminated against . "
no tolerance eu officials have made it clear that they will not tolerate this so-called ' phoney asylum . '
kleinhans from the interior ministry 's asylum department said it was important to let people know that it " really is n't worth making the trip to germany . "

the german press reacted with equal pessimism . a spotlight was shone on russia this week with the sentencing on fraud charges of fallen oligarch mikhail khodorkovsky , formerly the country 's richest man .
europe and the united states have blasted the trial as politically motivated and a step backward for the rule of law .
khodorkovsky , 47 , was sentenced to six more years in prison , with a release date of 2017 .
german national daily newspaper die welt wrote that the russian court responsible for hearing khodorkovsky 's case bent terribly in favor of russian prosecutors : " judge viktor danilkin has followed the predetermined path to the very end .
in the case of former oil mogul mikhail khodorkovsky and his business partner platon lebedev , he has followed to a tee the petitions of the public prosecutor 's office , which had asked for six-year sentences for the pair .
with a total incarceration of 14 years , including the time already served , the two men will not be freed until 2017 .
the court has stuck to public and direct statements on the matter of prime minister vladimir putin . "
the berliner zeitung newspaper wrote of the single-mindedness of the russian justice system : " the process showed how russian justice functions : the authorities are the ones who decide who the thief is … to position khodorkovsky as a moral rolemodel in russian consciousness will be difficult .
despite all sympathy afforded him due to his dealings with the repressive measures of the russian justice system , the former oligarch will nevertheless remain for many russians as a fraudster who was infinitely rich when many had hardly anything . "

this judicial ruling , which few in russia hold to be independent , has worked according to the calculations of prime minister vladimir putin against one of his long-time foes . "
the nuernberger nachrichten daily attempted to put khodorkovsky 's sentencing into a wider context of rights violations among some of europe 's key partners : " the strongman of russia has moved with full rigor against his critics .
critics of the belarusian regime have also ended up in prison .
hungary , which soon takes over the rotating eu presidency , has from the new year implemented a restrictive media law that reeks of democratic mockery .

renewable energy projects in india are regarded as particularly green since they reduce the country 's dependence on coal . a 2,000-hectare -lrb- 5,000-acre -rrb- solar village , which will be the first in asia to produce 500 megawatts of power , was inaugurated in western india 's gujarat state on thursday by gujarat chief minister narendra modi .

a training center has also been envisaged to train local people to work for corporations at the site . the indian government has committed to generating 20,000 megawatts of solar power by 2022 .

" a solar village in europe gets about 1,000 kilowatt hours per square meter while in india it can be 1,700 .

" a lot of the coal in india is of poor quality and releases a lot of greenhouse gases , " he added .
" in that sense , indian solar energy programs , which have zero emissions , are very beneficial to the environment because they directly replace low-grade coal . " economic benefits in addition to the environmental benefits , the state government also said it hopes the village will result in 750 billion rupees -lrb- 12.5 billion euros -rrb- of investment in gujarat . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most electricity in india comes from coal-fired power plants the gujarat power corporation -lrb- gpcl -rrb- has been appointed the central agency to establish , operate and maintain the park and 15 companies have already been provided with plots .
the state government has also agreed to purchase 993 megawatts worth of power from the site to encourage development . the charanka village is leasing plots to companies on 30-year contracts and provides water , electricity , roads and power transmission services , according to a statement on the gujarat government website . as india 's largest trade partner in europe , german companies , which remain at the fore of solar power technology , are expected to participate in the gujarat solar park 's activities .

families with children in particular are encouraged to quit the country . the french foreign ministry has urged its citizens living in ivory coast to temporarily leave the country as the threat of violence due to the country 's political crisis continues .
" although foreign nationals are not at present threatened , the french authorities renew their advice ... to all french citizens who can , in particular families with children , to temporarily leave ivory coast , " a foreign ministry spokesman said .
tension in ivory coast has been high in the weeks following the country 's presidential election on november 28 .
although alassane ouattara is widely recognized internationally as the winner of the election , incumbent president laurent gbagbo refuses to give up power .
a delegation from the economic community for west african states -lrb- ecowas -rrb- that traveled to ivory coast on tuesday was unsuccessful in its attempt to persuade gbagbo to step now .
prior to the visit of the presidents of three ecowas nations , the west african bloc had indicated that it would use military force if necessary .

un secretary general ban ki-moon issued a statement on thursday warning against attacks on the peacekeepers , and that un forces were authorized to use " all necessary means to protect its personnel , as well as the government officials and other civilians at these premises of the hotel . "
the un reports that at least 173 people have been killed in post-election violence .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de balkans -pipe- 31.12.2010 high number of serbian asylum seekers linked to travel scam großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bus-loads of serbians have applied for asylum in germany serbians make up the highest number of asylum seekers to germany , followed by their macedonian neighbors .
a sudden jump in applications could be linked to a balkan travel scam seen elsewhere in europe . a sudden spurt in applications for asylum in germany has been linked to an alleged travel scam taking place in the balkans .
according to the head of the german government 's asylum department , people from serbia and macedonia are being encouraged to buy one-way bus tickets to germany and given " empty promises " that they will find work and money once they get there .
" we suspect there has been an organized abuse of the asylum procedure , whereby people in macedonia and serbia have organized bus trips into germany , " said michael kleinhans , head of the asylum department at the federal office for migration and refugees .
" they tell people that in germany you can earn money and it 's worth making the trip as they 'll easily cover their costs , " kleinhans told deutsche welle .
a bus ticket costs between 200 and 400 euros -lrb- $ 267- $ 534 -rrb- , but unscrupulous travel agents sell the tickets claiming the passengers can get a free return journey from the german government once in germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : asylum seekers must prove they fled persecution to stay in germany instead , their applications are swiftly rejected and the applicants are bussed back to the balkans .
' a stark increase ' the federal office for migration and refugees keeps monthly records of the number of asylum seekers and their countries of origin .
for most of 2010 , the majority of refugees came from afghanistan and iraq .
however , from september through to november there was a sharp rise in asylum applicants from the balkans .
in november the highest number of applications came from serbians - 1,159 - followed by macedonians , with 512 .
the two groups made up over a third of the total applicants that month , " a stark increase , " kleinhans said .
serbia , macedonian and montenegran passport holders have been able to travel into the eu without a visa since december 2009 .
but the rules only allow them to come as tourists and do not allow them to work legally in the bloc .
similar scheme in belgium and sweden it 's not the first time a scam like this has been attempted .
following the change to the visa rules , several hundred serbs , macedonians and montenegrins tried to leave their countries in search of greener pastures in the eu earlier in 2010 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : to travel to the eu , serbians need a new biometric passport deutsche welle 's balkans correspondent , mark lowen , said that belgium and sweden " bore the brunt of the exodus " at the time , with 700 to 800 people arriving in each country .
the applications were rejected , and busloads of failed asylum seekers were sent back to the balkans .
" those attempting to leave were predominantly ethnic albanians - who tend to come from the poorer areas of serbia and macedonia , " he explained .
" those who tried to make the journey painted a very desperate picture of poverty , and many feel discriminated against . "
no tolerance eu officials have made it clear that they will not tolerate this so-called ' phoney asylum . '
kleinhans from the interior ministry 's asylum department said it was important to let people know that it " really is n't worth making the trip to germany . "
eu visa restrictions have recently been lifted for citizens of bosnia and albania , however , they have been strongly warned against falsely applying for asylum in the bloc .
officials from the european commission have threatened that if similar attempts are made , visa-free travel will be revoked .

beijing ’ s economic and political weight is becoming mightier by the day . for some time now , there has been a sense among sinophiles and sinophobes that the only thing growing faster than the chinese economy is chinese self-confidence .
this year , it reached even greater peaks .
in the summer , china put on the biggest world expo ever , attracting a record 73 million visitors .
the country now has the world ’ s biggest high-speed train network , and no computer is faster than the " tianhe 1a " in china ’ s northern port of tianjin .
not only has china promised to come to the rescue of the eu , as it goes from one financial crisis to the next , it has also invested billions into its scramble for " soft power " .
confucius institutes have been set up all over the world to promote chinese language and culture , and china ’ s international media are expanding .
the idea is to assure the world that china ’ s rise will be a peaceful one .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : japan was forced to release a chinese fishing boat captain involved in a collision near disputed islands tensions with japan but in september , beijing showed its less friendly side when japan seized a chinese fishing boat and its captain , after they supposedly strayed into disputed waters and rammed a japanese coastguard boat .
that beijing would protest was clear , but its reaction was harsher than expected .
beijing broke off all governmental contact with tokyo and put a stop on the export of rare earths to japan .
even when japan finally released the captain , beijing called for an apology .
china practically has a monopoly on the world ’ s rare earths , which are indispensable in many high-tech products .
hu xingdou , an economist at beijing ’ s university of science and technology , explains what this potentially means for the future .
" obviously it ’ s good for china that it has raw materials , which it can use as a strategic instrument .
china could decide to sell rare earths only to countries that behave as it wants – and exclude others . "
meeting the dalai lama is bad for business a study published by goettingen university this fall indicated how china is using its economic strength for its political aims .
it found that when countries receive the tibetans ’ spiritual leader , the dalai lama , their exports to china decrease by an average 8 percent .
especially exports of ships and planes , one of the study 's co-authors nils-hendrik klann explains , " such goods are not usually bought by normal consumers but by trade delegations for example .
such trade delegations are less likely to visit a country which has received the dalai lama . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nobel laureate liu xiaobo remains in jail in future , this might be considered the " liu xiaobo effect . "
beijing exercised enormous diplomatic pressure earlier this year to prevent chinese dissident liu xiaobo from being awarded the nobel peace prize , and embassies from attending the awards ceremony in oslo .
ma zhaoxu from the chinese foreign ministry avoided mentioning liu ’ s name at press conferences .
" the person you are talking about broke chinese laws and is a sentenced criminal .
we have made our position clear many times .
we refuse that a lot of fuss be made and we refuse all interference in our matters . "
all the eu states , which china sometimes tries to play against each other , showed unity in december and turned up to the ceremony .

beijing ’ s economic and political weight is becoming mightier by the day . for some time now , there has been a sense among sinophiles and sinophobes that the only thing growing faster than the chinese economy is chinese self-confidence .
this year , it reached even greater peaks .
in the summer , china put on the biggest world expo ever , attracting a record 73 million visitors .
the country now has the world ’ s biggest high-speed train network , and no computer is faster than the " tianhe 1a " in china ’ s northern port of tianjin .
not only has china promised to come to the rescue of the eu , as it goes from one financial crisis to the next , it has also invested billions into its scramble for " soft power " .
confucius institutes have been set up all over the world to promote chinese language and culture , and china ’ s international media are expanding .
the idea is to assure the world that china ’ s rise will be a peaceful one .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : japan was forced to release a chinese fishing boat captain involved in a collision near disputed islands tensions with japan but in september , beijing showed its less friendly side when japan seized a chinese fishing boat and its captain , after they supposedly strayed into disputed waters and rammed a japanese coastguard boat .
that beijing would protest was clear , but its reaction was harsher than expected .
beijing broke off all governmental contact with tokyo and put a stop on the export of rare earths to japan .
even when japan finally released the captain , beijing called for an apology .
china practically has a monopoly on the world ’ s rare earths , which are indispensable in many high-tech products .
hu xingdou , an economist at beijing ’ s university of science and technology , explains what this potentially means for the future .
" obviously it ’ s good for china that it has raw materials , which it can use as a strategic instrument .
china could decide to sell rare earths only to countries that behave as it wants – and exclude others . "
meeting the dalai lama is bad for business a study published by goettingen university this fall indicated how china is using its economic strength for its political aims .
it found that when countries receive the tibetans ’ spiritual leader , the dalai lama , their exports to china decrease by an average 8 percent .
especially exports of ships and planes , one of the study 's co-authors nils-hendrik klann explains , " such goods are not usually bought by normal consumers but by trade delegations for example .
such trade delegations are less likely to visit a country which has received the dalai lama . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nobel laureate liu xiaobo remains in jail in future , this might be considered the " liu xiaobo effect . "
beijing exercised enormous diplomatic pressure earlier this year to prevent chinese dissident liu xiaobo from being awarded the nobel peace prize , and embassies from attending the awards ceremony in oslo .
ma zhaoxu from the chinese foreign ministry avoided mentioning liu ’ s name at press conferences .
" the person you are talking about broke chinese laws and is a sentenced criminal .
we have made our position clear many times .
we refuse that a lot of fuss be made and we refuse all interference in our matters . "
all the eu states , which china sometimes tries to play against each other , showed unity in december and turned up to the ceremony .

two decades after reunification , they 've been transformed .
but can their local economies survive in the long run ? newsreels from the communist german democratic republic regularly praised factory workers in the towns of wolfen and bitterfeld , which formed the core of east germany 's chemical and mining industries .
what they did n't mention was that those workers were toiling in one of the dirtiest corners of europe - a region so polluted that clothes hung out to dry used to change color depending on which factory the ever-present chemical clouds were coming from that day . today , it 's a different story .
instead of a ruined industrial landscape covered in ash , the towns , now merged into one entity called bitterfeld-wolfen , are marketed as a tourist destination , complete with a sparkling lake and large forests , as well as a center for germany 's burgeoning solar energy sector . for those who have lived here for decades , the change is overwhelming .
matthias gabriel remembers sitting on a park bench one day in the 1960s .
when he stood up , he noticed stains on his trousers . " the stains would n't come out and after a few weeks , they turned into holes , " gabriel said .
" the place just stank , it was always foggy with chemical fumes .
if you could imagine what hell looked like , that was it . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chemicals giant bayer is has set up shop in bitterfeld-wolfen bitterfeld and wolfen epitomized a failed east germany .
tens of thousands of people in the region lost their jobs as uncompetitive factories were shuttered after the berlin wall fell .
almost half of the population left for greener pastures elsewhere . even now , if you mention bitterfeld almost anywhere in germany , a certain look comes across people 's faces .
it is not one of fond remembrance . transformation but a visit to the region today is not marked by ecological horror , rather by a strong sense of a town seeking to overcome its past and reinvent itself in an environmentally , economically sustainable community .
bitterfeld-wolfen wants to be a vacation spot . one of the attractions aiming to draw visitors is the bitterfeld arch , a steel sculpture with a 30-meter-high observation deck , designed to recall an old mining excavator .
from the top , a landscape of water and woods , quaint houses and small factories stretches out to the horizon . " i think we are a town which is the best example for change , " said katrin kuhnt , the town 's press spokeswoman .
" change from a destroyed environment to a tourism attraction . " the town still has smokestacks , but overall , it 's largely been scrubbed clean of the notorious ash and soot from the bad old days . " we have a well-functioning environment and we have a lot of tourists here .
we have industry too , but it 's clean industry , " kuhnt said .
" it 's a huge change . " new and improved industries the chemicals sector has n't disappeared from the town , but the plants today meet modern environmental standards .
solar companies have set up shop in the region , which is now referred to as germany 's " solar valley . " " we have an industry and a branch proceeding at a pace you would not have imagined when the wall came down 20 years ago , " said konrad sell , the head of corporate communication for sovello , a solar manufacturer that employs 1,200 people . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : goitzsche lake was created from an old mining pit from almost any perspective , the turnaround from industrial nightmare to renewable energy center and vacation destination is remarkable .
it has been made possible by a large infusion of taxpayer money to the former east , at least 1.3 trillion euros -lrb- $ 1.7 trillion -rrb- , largely from western germany . the money , raised from a so-called " solidarity tax " that all germans pay , has been invested in roads , environmental clean-up projects and other infrastructure projects .
it also subsidizes the region 's budding solar industry . still , beneath the shiny surface , real problems remain . long-term challenges many of the town 's buildings have been lovingly renovated , but at 6 pm , downtown bitterfeld is almost devoid of shoppers .
those who are still out and about are mostly retirees , not the highly skilled employees of the solar and high-tech firms .
most young professionals prefer to live in bigger cities nearby , like leipzig . that absence , as well as the competitive pressures on the town 's newer industries , has raised real concerns about the long-term economic outlook of bitterfeld-wolfen . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bitterfeld-wolfen has transformed itself , but still faces economic problems " in modern factories , you do n't need as many people , " said mayor petra wust .
" we will never have as many industrial jobs as we once did here .
it 's just not going to happen . " today , bitterfeld-wolfen 's factories only employ about half the number of people they did in the 1980s .
unemployment remains high , and young people continue to leave for jobs in other parts of germany , particularly large cities . like many towns in the former east , bitterfeld-wolfen is shrinking .
large apartment buildings are being torn down because there 's no one left to live in them .
twenty years ago , chancellor helmut kohl promised eastern germany would become a " blooming landscape " of economic development .
but according to most indicators , it is still dragging behind , which has led to a sense of disillusionment . " in the smaller towns you can feel a kind of anger in the people .
they usually say they feel disappointed by the politicians , " said miriam mueller , a researcher at berlin 's free university who studies eastern germany . " what they had expected from western germany was utopia . " instead , they got capitalism .
and even two decades later , many people are still having a hard time coming to terms with it . author : kyle james editor : sam edmonds send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but in 2005 an affirmative action law was passed guaranteeing that over one fourth of seats in parliament and over 30 provincial councils be reserved for women . in afghanistan ’ s parliament , 68 of the 249 seats are reserved for women .
during the elections of september 2010 , 69 women were elected to parliament – one more than the minimum .
siddiqua mobarez from wardak province in central afghanistan has been elected for the second time .
she believes the last elections were a victory for women .
" if a woman can be the head of a family , then she can also be the head of a state , " says mobarez . " if you look at the election results , it is easy to see that most of the women have been re-elected .
that shows that women are capable of working in politics and that the public has confidence in them .
we are very capable and we want to see change . "
change bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women and girls still face inequality the word change was a slogan on many election posters of female candidates .
in the last elections there were over 400 female candidates running for office .
that is close to 70 percent more than five years ago .
fauzia kofi is a young women ’ s rights activist and is considered to be a progressive star among afghan politicians .
she is active against the sexual abuse of women and discrimination and dreams of " living in a society in which there are no first and second class citizens .
i want equality .
and i want to eliminate all forms of discrimination based on sex , ethnicity and native language . "
the heinrich boell foundation carried out a study on women in politics .
for the study , afghanistan expert andrea fleschenberg talked to 91 female parliamentarians .
she believes the fight for equality is still not easy as she recalls talking to the women .
" some women are told they do not have the qualifications to hold their elected positions .
but at the same time , they are working in an area where the rules are constantly changing , where there is little transparency and there is a lot of patronage .
of course it is difficult for them to stand up for their own interests in such a climate . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in a society dominated by men , some believe women have no business going into politics the hurdles of traditional society it doesn ’ t help that only few of the female politicians work together .
and many other women can not get over the hurdles of traditional society .
conservative afghans still think that women have no place in politics.fauzia kofi says many women in parliament complain they are not taken seriously by their male colleagues .
and some women are even pointedly bullied .
" we don ’ t have enough time to speak on the floor of the house .
people try to ruin our reputations and some women have even received threats . "
threats is sometimes an understatement .
fauzia kofi herself was recently the victim of an attack which she barely survived .
the taliban had planted explosives in her car .
but despite all the obstacles , there are now more women in afghan politics than there ever have been .
and with any luck , the quota system will continue to help .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de berlin -pipe- 31.12.2010 waving a fond farewell to 2010 in berlin großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as yet another year draws to a close , it 's time to sit down with a glass of hot mulled wine , draw the curtains on all that awful snow and look back at some of berlin 's highlights from 2010 . no sooner had all the carcasses from the new year 's fireworks been cleared away - in itself worthy of a mention , given that by noon on january 1st you 'd never believe " silvester " had happened in the first place - than berlin was bracing itself for " business as usual . "
arguably the first cultural highlight of the year was the berlinale film festival , one of europe 's most highly regarded for those in the industry who allegedly move and / or shake -lrb- depending on personal taste , i assume -rrb- .
the jewel in the crown of this year 's event was the premiere of the complete version of fritz lang 's 1927 silent classic " metropolis . "
the film , which partly tells the story of class division and the struggle of the good worker against the exploitative overlord , was nicely mirrored in real life ; the glitterati sat in the warmth of the friedrichstadtpalast to watch the film while the proles shivered in sub-zero temperatures and took in the film on an outdoor screen at the brandenburg gate .
nice .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fashion in berlin is a diy affair : no one on the streets looks like this fashion clashes fashion week also rolled into the city once more , an event which is truly baffling to those who do n't really care about clothes . all of the established and up-and-coming designers were present and correct , but the one thing about this event that really sticks out is how utterly out of place the whole thing is in a city like berlin .
sure , berliners are a fashion-conscious lot , but they express their individuality in a diy , thrifty way , sporting eye-catching outfits cobbled together for 50 cents from the local charity store or flea market .
the sight of all of those rail-thin stepford wives models being chauffeured around the city in bmws with blacked out windows was enough to have your fashion-savvy but utterly broke mitte hipster on the verge of pelting the car with eggs .
popkomm berlin has music in its heart ; it 's a city where you can barely walk five paces without tripping over a record store or hidden club - or perhaps even worse , some oddball busking on the street .
popkomm , europe 's biggest music industry trade fair , rolled into town in summer bringing with it absolutely no music whatsoever .
it did look nice but was a rather silent affair .
major labels were in attendance , but , sadly , berlin 's varied and extremely interesting network of indie labels -lrb- not to mention the army of freaks who run them -rrb- were nowhere to be seen .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin festival 2010 : tainted by the shadow of the duisburg love parade tempelhof revival popkomm culminated with yet another musical highlight , the now well-established berlin festival featuring performances from caribou , atari teenage riot , fever ray and robyn , among others .
the event , however , ended on a sour note .
as arguably the first major music event since the love parade tragedy in duisburg , which saw 21 people lose their lives and a further 150 injured in a tunnel crush , organizers were clearly expecting trouble and responded with a knee-jerk reaction of questionable proportions .
the collosal apron of tempelhof airport - a space big enough to allow the free flow of a herd of wildebeest - was fenced off and control points to both of the hangars erected .
once one of the hangars was officially full enough , the barriers were closed off .
the poor kids who had parted with 70 euros -lrb- $ 94 -rrb- could n't get in to see their favorite bands play .
but at least everyone can be pleased that the festival took place in berlin 's now-defunct tempelhof airport .
it was nice to see the spectacular piece of architecture repeatedly pressed into service during 2010 rather than left to rot .
it 's a shame the city of berlin could n't come up with something more imaginative to do with the acres of land attached to the terminal .
berlin now boasts the only park in the world with two huge runways cutting through it .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : believe it or not , karaoke 's popularity soared during 2010 in other news ...
2010 has been the year of the revival with a number of age-old pasttimes resurfacing and being repackaged by ever-inventive berliners .
surprise number one saw a favorite embarrassment - karoke - enjoy an enormous resurgence in popularity with bars like monster ronson 's doing roaring trade and the now legendary bear pit karaoke on sundays in mauerpark attracting around 10,000 visitors weekly .
more niche , but still on the up , are rollerdiscos : a craze from the 70s , which is being rediscovered by berlin 's latest generation of clubbers .
in an ironic twist , while people like me who choose not to trundle around a club on wheels slowly lose the use of their legs as the night progresses , those crazy kids on rollerboots increasingly find their feet .
2010 was also the year where the district of neukoelln suddenly became the place to be .
once upon a time , your average berliner would sooner move to basra than neukoelln ; now , it 's hotter than , well , rollerdiscos .
westward expansion as the wave of gentrification forcec fashion-conscious and broke berliners further southwest through mitte and kreuzberg , there was nowhere else to go but neukoelln .
once regarded as an off-limits ghetto , the area - particularly around weserstrasse - has been transformed into a never-ending row of galleries , cool bars and trendy shops .
i am sure the people who have lived there for years are thrilled .
as 2010 draws to a close , and the city is crippled by 50 foot snow drifts and a public transport system in meltdown - yes , berliners may have learned to smile this year but seemingly at the expense of their efficiency - we can all look back on another year packed with highs and lows .
bildunterschrift : new year 's eve in berlin : always a subtle , low-key affair and while the city gears up for another wild new year 's eve followed by the traditional january first snowball fight , we can all brace ourselves for much more of the same in 2011 .
it 's just marvellous living here !
neale lytollis has indeed been to all of the events listed above ... but has no intention of moving to neukoelln .

he is the author of five collections of short stories : mirror to the sun -lrb- 1993 -rrb- , this other salt -lrb- 1999 -rrb- , turquoise -lrb- 2002 -rrb- , cactus town : selected stories -lrb- 2003 -rrb- and insomnia -lrb- 2007 -rrb- .
his novella , another gulmohar tree , was published in may 2009 .
his latest work is a novel called ' the cloud messenger ' , which will be released in march 2011 .
its italian version ' il nuvolo messaggero ' is already out in the market .
hussein , in an interview with deutsche welle , talks about how the year 2010 went for asian english writers in general , and the south asian writers in particular .
deutsche welle : what kind of previews has your novel ' the cloud messenger ' got so far ?
aamer hussein : it has got very favorable previews .
i think it is a complex book so every reader will have his own impression of it .
but the italian reviews in particular were very positive .
how was the year 2010 for the asian english fiction writers in general ?
which particular books did you like in 2010 ?
i think in terms of south asian literature , the year was much about the pakistani writers coming to the fore .
it was a good year in terms of what has gone before .
i have read some new books and really liked them .
there was a book from india by anjali joseph , saraswati park , which i enjoyed .
it was a good first book by the writer .
and there was a book by chandrahas choudhry , arzee the dwarf , which was noticed in 2010 and won several prizes .
at the moment i am reading a book by tabish khair , who is an indian writer from bihar , which is called the thing about thugs .
it is a very intelligent historical novel .
some literary critics are of the view that the recent fame acquired by the pakistani english writers is more because of the global limelight pakistan has got post-9/11 , and it is not purely a literary recognition .
do you agree with this view ?
i do , and i am very sad about it .
i think those who have been praised for these reasons have much more talent than this kind of praise allows .
those writers who have emerged into the limelight during the last five years have been read largely this way .
but i do n't think it is only coming from the west .
it is coming from india to a large extent .
many of these reputations are made first in india across the border because of what the indians call their hunger for knowledge about their neighbors .
so i think it is quite unfair to say that these writers are necessarily aiming for this kind of attention .
and sadly , those of us who do n't write about these particular subjects are perhaps sidelined at the moment .
india has produced many great writers in recent times : salman rushdie , arundhati roy and vikram seth being some of the examples .
where do you place them in international literature ?
though arundhati roy has written just one novel , the god of small things , i think that is a really fine book , and i think it is one of the finest first novels that came out at the end of the last century .
salman rushdie has a great cosmopolitan reputation .
it is now probably fallacious to limit that reputation to a particular country because he has lived in so many countries , and lived away from his roots .
he has a lasting love for india , and to some extent has an understanding of pakistan as well .
are the asian storytellers writing in english bringing anything new to the english language and literature ?
they have certainly brought a sense of history into the english language .
for example , if you read what amitav ghosh wrote some years ago , the glass palace for instance , he was not only talking about south asia , he was talking about asia in general - there was burma , there was malaysia .
and there was an overturning of a particular colonial narrative .
bapsi sidhwa gave a very different view of the partition -lrb- of the indian subcontinent -rrb- .
she gave the pakistani view , and from the point of view of the minority parsi group .
so of course new things are happening .
and i do n't think you can be innovative about history without being innovative about the form as well .
are the asian english writers still treated by the english speaking world as an exclusive group , or are they now considered more in the mainstream ?
i think they are considered more in the mainstream .
the older writers such as salman rushdie and anita desai are very much seen as belonging to the cosmopolitan school of writers .

beijing ’ s economic and political weight is becoming mightier by the day . for some time now , there has been a sense among sinophiles and sinophobes that the only thing growing faster than the chinese economy is chinese self-confidence .
this year , it reached even greater peaks .
in the summer , china put on the biggest world expo ever , attracting a record 73 million visitors .
the country now has the world ’ s biggest high-speed train network , and no computer is faster than the " tianhe 1a " in china ’ s northern port of tianjin .
not only has china promised to come to the rescue of the eu , as it goes from one financial crisis to the next , it has also invested billions into its scramble for " soft power " .
confucius institutes have been set up all over the world to promote chinese language and culture , and china ’ s international media are expanding .
the idea is to assure the world that china ’ s rise will be a peaceful one .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : japan was forced to release a chinese fishing boat captain involved in a collision near disputed islands tensions with japan but in september , beijing showed its less friendly side when japan seized a chinese fishing boat and its captain , after they supposedly strayed into disputed waters and rammed a japanese coastguard boat .
that beijing would protest was clear , but its reaction was harsher than expected .
beijing broke off all governmental contact with tokyo and put a stop on the export of rare earths to japan .
even when japan finally released the captain , beijing called for an apology .
china practically has a monopoly on the world ’ s rare earths , which are indispensable in many high-tech products .
hu xingdou , an economist at beijing ’ s university of science and technology , explains what this potentially means for the future .
" obviously it ’ s good for china that it has raw materials , which it can use as a strategic instrument .
china could decide to sell rare earths only to countries that behave as it wants – and exclude others . "
meeting the dalai lama is bad for business a study published by goettingen university this fall indicated how china is using its economic strength for its political aims .
it found that when countries receive the tibetans ’ spiritual leader , the dalai lama , their exports to china decrease by an average 8 percent .
especially exports of ships and planes , one of the study 's co-authors nils-hendrik klann explains , " such goods are not usually bought by normal consumers but by trade delegations for example .
such trade delegations are less likely to visit a country which has received the dalai lama . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nobel laureate liu xiaobo remains in jail in future , this might be considered the " liu xiaobo effect . "
beijing exercised enormous diplomatic pressure earlier this year to prevent chinese dissident liu xiaobo from being awarded the nobel peace prize , and embassies from attending the awards ceremony in oslo .
ma zhaoxu from the chinese foreign ministry avoided mentioning liu ’ s name at press conferences .
" the person you are talking about broke chinese laws and is a sentenced criminal .
we have made our position clear many times .
we refuse that a lot of fuss be made and we refuse all interference in our matters . "
all the eu states , which china sometimes tries to play against each other , showed unity in december and turned up to the ceremony .

it is a very intelligent historical novel .
some literary critics are of the view that the recent fame acquired by the pakistani english writers is more because of the global limelight pakistan has got post-9/11 , and it is not purely a literary recognition .
do you agree with this view ?
i do , and i am very sad about it .
i think those who have been praised for these reasons have much more talent than this kind of praise allows .
those writers who have emerged into the limelight during the last five years have been read largely this way .
but i do n't think it is only coming from the west .
it is coming from india to a large extent .
many of these reputations are made first in india across the border because of what the indians call their hunger for knowledge about their neighbors .
so i think it is quite unfair to say that these writers are necessarily aiming for this kind of attention .
and sadly , those of us who do n't write about these particular subjects are perhaps sidelined at the moment .
india has produced many great writers in recent times : salman rushdie , arundhati roy and vikram seth being some of the examples .
where do you place them in international literature ?
though arundhati roy has written just one novel , the god of small things , i think that is a really fine book , and i think it is one of the finest first novels that came out at the end of the last century .
salman rushdie has a great cosmopolitan reputation .
it is now probably fallacious to limit that reputation to a particular country because he has lived in so many countries , and lived away from his roots .
he has a lasting love for india , and to some extent has an understanding of pakistan as well .
are the asian storytellers writing in english bringing anything new to the english language and literature ?
they have certainly brought a sense of history into the english language .
for example , if you read what amitav ghosh wrote some years ago , the glass palace for instance , he was not only talking about south asia , he was talking about asia in general - there was burma , there was malaysia .
and there was an overturning of a particular colonial narrative .
bapsi sidhwa gave a very different view of the partition -lrb- of the indian subcontinent -rrb- .
she gave the pakistani view , and from the point of view of the minority parsi group .
so of course new things are happening .
and i do n't think you can be innovative about history without being innovative about the form as well .
are the asian english writers still treated by the english speaking world as an exclusive group , or are they now considered more in the mainstream ?
i think they are considered more in the mainstream .
the older writers such as salman rushdie and anita desai are very much seen as belonging to the cosmopolitan school of writers .

"
arguably the first cultural highlight of the year was the berlinale film festival , one of europe 's most highly regarded for those in the industry who allegedly move and / or shake -lrb- depending on personal taste , i assume -rrb- .
the jewel in the crown of this year 's event was the premiere of the complete version of fritz lang 's 1927 silent classic " metropolis . "
the film , which partly tells the story of class division and the struggle of the good worker against the exploitative overlord , was nicely mirrored in real life ; the glitterati sat in the warmth of the friedrichstadtpalast to watch the film while the proles shivered in sub-zero temperatures and took in the film on an outdoor screen at the brandenburg gate .
nice .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fashion in berlin is a diy affair : no one on the streets looks like this fashion clashes fashion week also rolled into the city once more , an event which is truly baffling to those who do n't really care about clothes . all of the established and up-and-coming designers were present and correct , but the one thing about this event that really sticks out is how utterly out of place the whole thing is in a city like berlin .
sure , berliners are a fashion-conscious lot , but they express their individuality in a diy , thrifty way , sporting eye-catching outfits cobbled together for 50 cents from the local charity store or flea market .
the sight of all of those rail-thin stepford wives models being chauffeured around the city in bmws with blacked out windows was enough to have your fashion-savvy but utterly broke mitte hipster on the verge of pelting the car with eggs .
popkomm berlin has music in its heart ; it 's a city where you can barely walk five paces without tripping over a record store or hidden club - or perhaps even worse , some oddball busking on the street .
popkomm , europe 's biggest music industry trade fair , rolled into town in summer bringing with it absolutely no music whatsoever .
it did look nice but was a rather silent affair .
major labels were in attendance , but , sadly , berlin 's varied and extremely interesting network of indie labels -lrb- not to mention the army of freaks who run them -rrb- were nowhere to be seen .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin festival 2010 : tainted by the shadow of the duisburg love parade tempelhof revival popkomm culminated with yet another musical highlight , the now well-established berlin festival featuring performances from caribou , atari teenage riot , fever ray and robyn , among others .
the event , however , ended on a sour note .
as arguably the first major music event since the love parade tragedy in duisburg , which saw 21 people lose their lives and a further 150 injured in a tunnel crush , organizers were clearly expecting trouble and responded with a knee-jerk reaction of questionable proportions .
the collosal apron of tempelhof airport - a space big enough to allow the free flow of a herd of wildebeest - was fenced off and control points to both of the hangars erected .
once one of the hangars was officially full enough , the barriers were closed off .
the poor kids who had parted with 70 euros -lrb- $ 94 -rrb- could n't get in to see their favorite bands play .
but at least everyone can be pleased that the festival took place in berlin 's now-defunct tempelhof airport .
it was nice to see the spectacular piece of architecture repeatedly pressed into service during 2010 rather than left to rot .
it 's a shame the city of berlin could n't come up with something more imaginative to do with the acres of land attached to the terminal .
berlin now boasts the only park in the world with two huge runways cutting through it .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : believe it or not , karaoke 's popularity soared during 2010 in other news ...
2010 has been the year of the revival with a number of age-old pasttimes resurfacing and being repackaged by ever-inventive berliners .
surprise number one saw a favorite embarrassment - karoke - enjoy an enormous resurgence in popularity with bars like monster ronson 's doing roaring trade and the now legendary bear pit karaoke on sundays in mauerpark attracting around 10,000 visitors weekly .
more niche , but still on the up , are rollerdiscos : a craze from the 70s , which is being rediscovered by berlin 's latest generation of clubbers .
in an ironic twist , while people like me who choose not to trundle around a club on wheels slowly lose the use of their legs as the night progresses , those crazy kids on rollerboots increasingly find their feet .
2010 was also the year where the district of neukoelln suddenly became the place to be .
once upon a time , your average berliner would sooner move to basra than neukoelln ; now , it 's hotter than , well , rollerdiscos .
westward expansion as the wave of gentrification forcec fashion-conscious and broke berliners further southwest through mitte and kreuzberg , there was nowhere else to go but neukoelln .
once regarded as an off-limits ghetto , the area - particularly around weserstrasse - has been transformed into a never-ending row of galleries , cool bars and trendy shops .
i am sure the people who have lived there for years are thrilled .
as 2010 draws to a close , and the city is crippled by 50 foot snow drifts and a public transport system in meltdown - yes , berliners may have learned to smile this year but seemingly at the expense of their efficiency - we can all look back on another year packed with highs and lows .
bildunterschrift : new year 's eve in berlin : always a subtle , low-key affair and while the city gears up for another wild new year 's eve followed by the traditional january first snowball fight , we can all brace ourselves for much more of the same in 2011 .
it 's just marvellous living here !
gavin blackburn has indeed been to all of the events listed above ... but has no intention of moving to neukoelln .

two decades after reunification , they 've been transformed .
but can their local economies survive in the long run ? newsreels from the communist german democratic republic regularly praised factory workers in the towns of wolfen and bitterfeld , which formed the core of east germany 's chemical and mining industries .
what they did n't mention was that those workers were toiling in one of the dirtiest corners of europe - a region so polluted that clothes hung out to dry used to change color depending on which factory the ever-present chemical clouds were coming from that day . today , it 's a different story .
instead of a ruined industrial landscape covered in ash , the towns , now merged into one entity called bitterfeld-wolfen , are marketed as a tourist destination , complete with a sparkling lake and large forests , as well as a center for germany 's burgeoning solar energy sector . for those who have lived here for decades , the change is overwhelming .
matthias gabriel remembers sitting on a park bench one day in the 1960s .
when he stood up , he noticed stains on his trousers . " the stains would n't come out and after a few weeks , they turned into holes , " gabriel said .
" the place just stank , it was always foggy with chemical fumes .
if you could imagine what hell looked like , that was it . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chemicals giant bayer is has set up shop in bitterfeld-wolfen bitterfeld and wolfen epitomized a failed east germany .
tens of thousands of people in the region lost their jobs as uncompetitive factories were shuttered after the berlin wall fell .
almost half of the population left for greener pastures elsewhere . even now , if you mention bitterfeld almost anywhere in germany , a certain look comes across people 's faces .
it is not one of fond remembrance . transformation but a visit to the region today is not marked by ecological horror , rather by a strong sense of a town seeking to overcome its past and reinvent itself in an environmentally , economically sustainable community .
bitterfeld-wolfen wants to be a vacation spot . one of the attractions aiming to draw visitors is the bitterfeld arch , a steel sculpture with a 30-meter-high observation deck , designed to recall an old mining excavator .
from the top , a landscape of water and woods , quaint houses and small factories stretches out to the horizon . " i think we are a town which is the best example for change , " said katrin kuhnt , the town 's press spokeswoman .
" change from a destroyed environment to a tourism attraction . " the town still has smokestacks , but overall , it 's largely been scrubbed clean of the notorious ash and soot from the bad old days . " we have a well-functioning environment and we have a lot of tourists here .
we have industry too , but it 's clean industry , " kuhnt said .
" it 's a huge change . " new and improved industries the chemicals sector has n't disappeared from the town , but the plants today meet modern environmental standards .
solar companies have set up shop in the region , which is now referred to as germany 's " solar valley . " " we have an industry and a branch proceeding at a pace you would not have imagined when the wall came down 20 years ago , " said konrad sell , the head of corporate communication for sovello , a solar manufacturer that employs 1,200 people . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : goitzsche lake was created from an old mining pit from almost any perspective , the turnaround from industrial nightmare to renewable energy center and vacation destination is remarkable .
it has been made possible by a large infusion of taxpayer money to the former east , at least 1.3 trillion euros -lrb- $ 1.7 trillion -rrb- , largely from western germany . the money , raised from a so-called " solidarity tax " that all germans pay , has been invested in roads , environmental clean-up projects and other infrastructure projects .
it also subsidizes the region 's budding solar industry . still , beneath the shiny surface , real problems remain . long-term challenges many of the town 's buildings have been lovingly renovated , but at 6 pm , downtown bitterfeld is almost devoid of shoppers .
those who are still out and about are mostly retirees , not the highly skilled employees of the solar and high-tech firms .
most young professionals prefer to live in bigger cities nearby , like leipzig . that absence , as well as the competitive pressures on the town 's newer industries , has raised real concerns about the long-term economic outlook of bitterfeld-wolfen . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bitterfeld-wolfen has transformed itself , but still faces economic problems " in modern factories , you do n't need as many people , " said mayor petra wust .
" we will never have as many industrial jobs as we once did here .
it 's just not going to happen . " today , bitterfeld-wolfen 's factories only employ about half the number of people they did in the 1980s .
unemployment remains high , and young people continue to leave for jobs in other parts of germany , particularly large cities . like many towns in the former east , bitterfeld-wolfen is shrinking .
large apartment buildings are being torn down because there 's no one left to live in them .
twenty years ago , chancellor helmut kohl promised eastern germany would become a " blooming landscape " of economic development .
but according to most indicators , it is still dragging behind , which has led to a sense of disillusionment . " in the smaller towns you can feel a kind of anger in the people .
they usually say they feel disappointed by the politicians , " said miriam mueller , a researcher at berlin 's free university who studies eastern germany . " what they had expected from western germany was utopia . " instead , they got capitalism .
and even two decades later , many people are still having a hard time coming to terms with it . author : kyle james editor : sam edmonds send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

renewable energy projects in india are regarded as particularly green since they reduce the country 's dependence on coal . a 2,000-hectare -lrb- 5,000-acre -rrb- solar village , which will be the first in asia to produce 500 megawatts of power , was inaugurated in western india 's gujarat state on thursday by gujarat chief minister narendra modi . " by harnessing solar energy to generate 500 mw power , we will be able to cut carbon emission by a whopping 8 million tons , " he said . at a cost of 120 billion rupees -lrb- 2 billion euros -rrb- , the gujarat solar project will offer solar power manufacturing , assembly , as well as research and development-related facilities , modi said .
a training center has also been envisaged to train local people to work for corporations at the site . the indian government has committed to generating 20,000 megawatts of solar power by 2022 .
as part of this effort , the state of gujarat intends to harvest 500 megawatts of electricity from its solar power park . solar success while the goals are ambitious , they are not out of reach , according to gon chaudhuri , managing director of the west bengal green energy development corporation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : solar power projects have few downsides in india " any solar project will likely be successful in india , and gujarat has very good solar radiation , " he told deutsche welle .
" a solar village in europe gets about 1,000 kilowatt hours per square meter while in india it can be 1,700 . " in fact , gujarat 's government has said the charanka village , where the gujarat park is located , receives an average of 330 sunny days a year , with an average intensity of six kilowatts per square meter , making it an ideal location for solar power generation . solar and other renewable energy projects in india are particularly environmentally friendly because they decrease the use of coal-based power plants , which account for nearly 62 percent of energy production , chaudhuri said . " a lot of the coal in india is of poor quality and releases a lot of greenhouse gases , " he added .
" in that sense , indian solar energy programs , which have zero emissions , are very beneficial to the environment because they directly replace low-grade coal . " economic benefits in addition to the environmental benefits , the state government also said it hopes the village will result in 750 billion rupees -lrb- 12.5 billion euros -rrb- of investment in gujarat . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most electricity in india comes from coal-fired power plants the gujarat power corporation -lrb- gpcl -rrb- has been appointed the central agency to establish , operate and maintain the park and 15 companies have already been provided with plots .
the state government has also agreed to purchase 993 megawatts worth of power from the site to encourage development . the charanka village is leasing plots to companies on 30-year contracts and provides water , electricity , roads and power transmission services , according to a statement on the gujarat government website . as india 's largest trade partner in europe , german companies , which remain at the fore of solar power technology , are expected to participate in the gujarat solar park 's activities .
it is unclear if german firms are among the 80 companies in private talks with gpcl . the project 's first phase is expected to go online by december 2011 . author : sean sinico editor : saroja coelho send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

almost half of the population left for greener pastures elsewhere . even now , if you mention bitterfeld almost anywhere in germany , a certain look comes across people 's faces .
it is not one of fond remembrance . transformation but a visit to the region today is not marked by ecological horror , rather by a strong sense of a town seeking to overcome its past and reinvent itself in an environmentally , economically sustainable community .
bitterfeld-wolfen wants to be a vacation spot . one of the attractions aiming to draw visitors is the bitterfeld arch , a steel sculpture with a 30-meter-high observation deck , designed to recall an old mining excavator .
from the top , a landscape of water and woods , quaint houses and small factories stretches out to the horizon . " i think we are a town which is the best example for change , " said katrin kuhnt , the town 's press spokeswoman .
" change from a destroyed environment to a tourism attraction . " the town still has smokestacks , but overall , it 's largely been scrubbed clean of the notorious ash and soot from the bad old days . " we have a well-functioning environment and we have a lot of tourists here .
we have industry too , but it 's clean industry , " kuhnt said .
" it 's a huge change . " new and improved industries the chemicals sector has n't disappeared from the town , but the plants today meet modern environmental standards .
solar companies have set up shop in the region , which is now referred to as germany 's " solar valley . " " we have an industry and a branch proceeding at a pace you would not have imagined when the wall came down 20 years ago , " said konrad sell , the head of corporate communication for sovello , a solar manufacturer that employs 1,200 people . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : goitzsche lake was created from an old mining pit from almost any perspective , the turnaround from industrial nightmare to renewable energy center and vacation destination is remarkable .
it has been made possible by a large infusion of taxpayer money to the former east , at least 1.3 trillion euros -lrb- $ 1.7 trillion -rrb- , largely from western germany . the money , raised from a so-called " solidarity tax " that all germans pay , has been invested in roads , environmental clean-up projects and other infrastructure projects .
it also subsidizes the region 's budding solar industry . still , beneath the shiny surface , real problems remain . long-term challenges many of the town 's buildings have been lovingly renovated , but at 6 pm , downtown bitterfeld is almost devoid of shoppers .
those who are still out and about are mostly retirees , not the highly skilled employees of the solar and high-tech firms .
most young professionals prefer to live in bigger cities nearby , like leipzig . that absence , as well as the competitive pressures on the town 's newer industries , has raised real concerns about the long-term economic outlook of bitterfeld-wolfen . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bitterfeld-wolfen has transformed itself , but still faces economic problems " in modern factories , you do n't need as many people , " said mayor petra wust .
" we will never have as many industrial jobs as we once did here .
it 's just not going to happen . " today , bitterfeld-wolfen 's factories only employ about half the number of people they did in the 1980s .
unemployment remains high , and young people continue to leave for jobs in other parts of germany , particularly large cities . like many towns in the former east , bitterfeld-wolfen is shrinking .
large apartment buildings are being torn down because there 's no one left to live in them .
twenty years ago , chancellor helmut kohl promised eastern germany would become a " blooming landscape " of economic development .
but according to most indicators , it is still dragging behind , which has led to a sense of disillusionment . " in the smaller towns you can feel a kind of anger in the people .
they usually say they feel disappointed by the politicians , " said miriam mueller , a researcher at berlin 's free university who studies eastern germany . " what they had expected from western germany was utopia . " instead , they got capitalism .
and even two decades later , many people are still having a hard time coming to terms with it . author : kyle james editor : sam edmonds send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the jewel in the crown of this year 's event was the premiere of the complete version of fritz lang 's 1927 silent classic " metropolis . "

sure , berliners are a fashion-conscious lot , but they express their individuality in a diy , thrifty way , sporting eye-catching outfits cobbled together for 50 cents from the local charity store or flea market .
the sight of all of those rail-thin stepford wives models being chauffeured around the city in bmws with blacked out windows was enough to have your fashion-savvy but utterly broke mitte hipster on the verge of pelting the car with eggs .
popkomm berlin has music in its heart ; it 's a city where you can barely walk five paces without tripping over a record store or hidden club - or perhaps even worse , some oddball busking on the street .
popkomm , europe 's biggest music industry trade fair , rolled into town in summer bringing with it absolutely no music whatsoever .
it did look nice but was a rather silent affair .
major labels were in attendance , but , sadly , berlin 's varied and extremely interesting network of indie labels -lrb- not to mention the army of freaks who run them -rrb- were nowhere to be seen .

the event , however , ended on a sour note .
as arguably the first major music event since the love parade tragedy in duisburg , which saw 21 people lose their lives and a further 150 injured in a tunnel crush , organizers were clearly expecting trouble and responded with a knee-jerk reaction of questionable proportions .
the collosal apron of tempelhof airport - a space big enough to allow the free flow of a herd of wildebeest - was fenced off and control points to both of the hangars erected .
once one of the hangars was officially full enough , the barriers were closed off .
the poor kids who had parted with 70 euros -lrb- $ 94 -rrb- could n't get in to see their favorite bands play .
but at least everyone can be pleased that the festival took place in berlin 's now-defunct tempelhof airport .
it was nice to see the spectacular piece of architecture repeatedly pressed into service during 2010 rather than left to rot .
it 's a shame the city of berlin could n't come up with something more imaginative to do with the acres of land attached to the terminal .
berlin now boasts the only park in the world with two huge runways cutting through it .

in an ironic twist , while people like me who choose not to trundle around a club on wheels slowly lose the use of their legs as the night progresses , those crazy kids on rollerboots increasingly find their feet .
2010 was also the year where the district of neukoelln suddenly became the place to be .

two decades after reunification , they 've been transformed .
but can their local economies survive in the long run ? newsreels from the communist german democratic republic regularly praised factory workers in the towns of wolfen and bitterfeld , which formed the core of east germany 's chemical and mining industries .
what they did n't mention was that those workers were toiling in one of the dirtiest corners of europe - a region so polluted that clothes hung out to dry used to change color depending on which factory the ever-present chemical clouds were coming from that day . today , it 's a different story .
instead of a ruined industrial landscape covered in ash , the towns , now merged into one entity called bitterfeld-wolfen , are marketed as a tourist destination , complete with a sparkling lake and large forests , as well as a center for germany 's burgeoning solar energy sector . for those who have lived here for decades , the change is overwhelming .
matthias gabriel remembers sitting on a park bench one day in the 1960s .
when he stood up , he noticed stains on his trousers . " the stains would n't come out and after a few weeks , they turned into holes , " gabriel said .
" the place just stank , it was always foggy with chemical fumes .
if you could imagine what hell looked like , that was it . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chemicals giant bayer is has set up shop in bitterfeld-wolfen bitterfeld and wolfen epitomized a failed east germany .

bitterfeld-wolfen wants to be a vacation spot . one of the attractions aiming to draw visitors is the bitterfeld arch , a steel sculpture with a 30-meter-high observation deck , designed to recall an old mining excavator .
from the top , a landscape of water and woods , quaint houses and small factories stretches out to the horizon . " i think we are a town which is the best example for change , " said katrin kuhnt , the town 's press spokeswoman .
" change from a destroyed environment to a tourism attraction . " the town still has smokestacks , but overall , it 's largely been scrubbed clean of the notorious ash and soot from the bad old days . " we have a well-functioning environment and we have a lot of tourists here .

" it 's a huge change . " new and improved industries the chemicals sector has n't disappeared from the town , but the plants today meet modern environmental standards .

it has been made possible by a large infusion of taxpayer money to the former east , at least 1.3 trillion euros -lrb- $ 1.7 trillion -rrb- , largely from western germany . the money , raised from a so-called " solidarity tax " that all germans pay , has been invested in roads , environmental clean-up projects and other infrastructure projects .

unemployment remains high , and young people continue to leave for jobs in other parts of germany , particularly large cities . like many towns in the former east , bitterfeld-wolfen is shrinking .

he is the author of five collections of short stories : mirror to the sun -lrb- 1993 -rrb- , this other salt -lrb- 1999 -rrb- , turquoise -lrb- 2002 -rrb- , cactus town : selected stories -lrb- 2003 -rrb- and insomnia -lrb- 2007 -rrb- .
his novella , another gulmohar tree , was published in may 2009 .
his latest work is a novel called ' the cloud messenger ' , which will be released in march 2011 .
its italian version ' il nuvolo messaggero ' is already out in the market .
hussein , in an interview with deutsche welle , talks about how the year 2010 went for asian english writers in general , and the south asian writers in particular .
deutsche welle : what kind of previews has your novel ' the cloud messenger ' got so far ?
aamer hussein : it has got very favorable previews .
i think it is a complex book so every reader will have his own impression of it .
but the italian reviews in particular were very positive .
how was the year 2010 for the asian english fiction writers in general ?
which particular books did you like in 2010 ?
i think in terms of south asian literature , the year was much about the pakistani writers coming to the fore .
it was a good year in terms of what has gone before .
i have read some new books and really liked them .
there was a book from india by anjali joseph , saraswati park , which i enjoyed .
it was a good first book by the writer .
and there was a book by chandrahas choudhry , arzee the dwarf , which was noticed in 2010 and won several prizes .
at the moment i am reading a book by tabish khair , who is an indian writer from bihar , which is called the thing about thugs .
it is a very intelligent historical novel .
some literary critics are of the view that the recent fame acquired by the pakistani english writers is more because of the global limelight pakistan has got post-9/11 , and it is not purely a literary recognition .
do you agree with this view ?
i do , and i am very sad about it .
i think those who have been praised for these reasons have much more talent than this kind of praise allows .
those writers who have emerged into the limelight during the last five years have been read largely this way .
but i do n't think it is only coming from the west .
it is coming from india to a large extent .
many of these reputations are made first in india across the border because of what the indians call their hunger for knowledge about their neighbors .
so i think it is quite unfair to say that these writers are necessarily aiming for this kind of attention .
and sadly , those of us who do n't write about these particular subjects are perhaps sidelined at the moment .
india has produced many great writers in recent times : salman rushdie , arundhati roy and vikram seth being some of the examples .
where do you place them in international literature ?
though arundhati roy has written just one novel , the god of small things , i think that is a really fine book , and i think it is one of the finest first novels that came out at the end of the last century .
salman rushdie has a great cosmopolitan reputation .
it is now probably fallacious to limit that reputation to a particular country because he has lived in so many countries , and lived away from his roots .
he has a lasting love for india , and to some extent has an understanding of pakistan as well .
are the asian storytellers writing in english bringing anything new to the english language and literature ?
they have certainly brought a sense of history into the english language .
for example , if you read what amitav ghosh wrote some years ago , the glass palace for instance , he was not only talking about south asia , he was talking about asia in general - there was burma , there was malaysia .
and there was an overturning of a particular colonial narrative .
bapsi sidhwa gave a very different view of the partition -lrb- of the indian subcontinent -rrb- .
she gave the pakistani view , and from the point of view of the minority parsi group .
so of course new things are happening .
and i do n't think you can be innovative about history without being innovative about the form as well .
are the asian english writers still treated by the english speaking world as an exclusive group , or are they now considered more in the mainstream ?
i think they are considered more in the mainstream .
the older writers such as salman rushdie and anita desai are very much seen as belonging to the cosmopolitan school of writers .

but in 2005 an affirmative action law was passed guaranteeing that over one fourth of seats in parliament and over 30 provincial councils be reserved for women . in afghanistan ’ s parliament , 68 of the 249 seats are reserved for women .
during the elections of september 2010 , 69 women were elected to parliament – one more than the minimum .
siddiqua mobarez from wardak province in central afghanistan has been elected for the second time .
she believes the last elections were a victory for women .
" if a woman can be the head of a family , then she can also be the head of a state , " says mobarez . " if you look at the election results , it is easy to see that most of the women have been re-elected .
that shows that women are capable of working in politics and that the public has confidence in them .
we are very capable and we want to see change . "
change bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women and girls still face inequality the word change was a slogan on many election posters of female candidates .
in the last elections there were over 400 female candidates running for office .
that is close to 70 percent more than five years ago .
fauzia kofi is a young women ’ s rights activist and is considered to be a progressive star among afghan politicians .
she is active against the sexual abuse of women and discrimination and dreams of " living in a society in which there are no first and second class citizens .
i want equality .
and i want to eliminate all forms of discrimination based on sex , ethnicity and native language . "
the heinrich boell foundation carried out a study on women in politics .
for the study , afghanistan expert andrea fleschenberg talked to 91 female parliamentarians .
she believes the fight for equality is still not easy as she recalls talking to the women .
" some women are told they do not have the qualifications to hold their elected positions .
but at the same time , they are working in an area where the rules are constantly changing , where there is little transparency and there is a lot of patronage .
of course it is difficult for them to stand up for their own interests in such a climate . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in a society dominated by men , some believe women have no business going into politics the hurdles of traditional society it doesn ’ t help that only few of the female politicians work together .
and many other women can not get over the hurdles of traditional society .
conservative afghans still think that women have no place in politics.fauzia kofi says many women in parliament complain they are not taken seriously by their male colleagues .
and some women are even pointedly bullied .
" we don ’ t have enough time to speak on the floor of the house .
people try to ruin our reputations and some women have even received threats . "
threats is sometimes an understatement .
fauzia kofi herself was recently the victim of an attack which she barely survived .
the taliban had planted explosives in her car .
but despite all the obstacles , there are now more women in afghan politics than there ever have been .
and with any luck , the quota system will continue to help .

but in 2005 an affirmative action law was passed guaranteeing that over one fourth of seats in parliament and over 30 provincial councils be reserved for women . in afghanistan ’ s parliament , 68 of the 249 seats are reserved for women .
during the elections of september 2010 , 69 women were elected to parliament – one more than the minimum .
siddiqua mobarez from wardak province in central afghanistan has been elected for the second time .
she believes the last elections were a victory for women .
" if a woman can be the head of a family , then she can also be the head of a state , " says mobarez . " if you look at the election results , it is easy to see that most of the women have been re-elected .
that shows that women are capable of working in politics and that the public has confidence in them .
we are very capable and we want to see change . "
change bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women and girls still face inequality the word change was a slogan on many election posters of female candidates .
in the last elections there were over 400 female candidates running for office .
that is close to 70 percent more than five years ago .
fauzia kofi is a young women ’ s rights activist and is considered to be a progressive star among afghan politicians .
she is active against the sexual abuse of women and discrimination and dreams of " living in a society in which there are no first and second class citizens .
i want equality .
and i want to eliminate all forms of discrimination based on sex , ethnicity and native language . "
the heinrich boell foundation carried out a study on women in politics .
for the study , afghanistan expert andrea fleschenberg talked to 91 female parliamentarians .
she believes the fight for equality is still not easy as she recalls talking to the women .
" some women are told they do not have the qualifications to hold their elected positions .
but at the same time , they are working in an area where the rules are constantly changing , where there is little transparency and there is a lot of patronage .
of course it is difficult for them to stand up for their own interests in such a climate . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in a society dominated by men , some believe women have no business going into politics the hurdles of traditional society it doesn ’ t help that only few of the female politicians work together .
and many other women can not get over the hurdles of traditional society .
conservative afghans still think that women have no place in politics.fauzia kofi says many women in parliament complain they are not taken seriously by their male colleagues .
and some women are even pointedly bullied .
" we don ’ t have enough time to speak on the floor of the house .
people try to ruin our reputations and some women have even received threats . "
threats is sometimes an understatement .
fauzia kofi herself was recently the victim of an attack which she barely survived .
the taliban had planted explosives in her car .
but despite all the obstacles , there are now more women in afghan politics than there ever have been .
and with any luck , the quota system will continue to help .

he is the author of five collections of short stories : mirror to the sun -lrb- 1993 -rrb- , this other salt -lrb- 1999 -rrb- , turquoise -lrb- 2002 -rrb- , cactus town : selected stories -lrb- 2003 -rrb- and insomnia -lrb- 2007 -rrb- .
his novella , another gulmohar tree , was published in may 2009 .
his latest work is a novel called ' the cloud messenger ' , which will be released in march 2011 .
its italian version ' il nuvolo messaggero ' is already out in the market .
hussein , in an interview with deutsche welle , talks about how the year 2010 went for asian english writers in general , and the south asian writers in particular .
deutsche welle : what kind of previews has your novel ' the cloud messenger ' got so far ?
aamer hussein : it has got very favorable previews .
i think it is a complex book so every reader will have his own impression of it .
but the italian reviews in particular were very positive .
how was the year 2010 for the asian english fiction writers in general ?
which particular books did you like in 2010 ?
i think in terms of south asian literature , the year was much about the pakistani writers coming to the fore .
it was a good year in terms of what has gone before .
i have read some new books and really liked them .
there was a book from india by anjali joseph , saraswati park , which i enjoyed .
it was a good first book by the writer .
and there was a book by chandrahas choudhry , arzee the dwarf , which was noticed in 2010 and won several prizes .
at the moment i am reading a book by tabish khair , who is an indian writer from bihar , which is called the thing about thugs .
it is a very intelligent historical novel .
some literary critics are of the view that the recent fame acquired by the pakistani english writers is more because of the global limelight pakistan has got post-9/11 , and it is not purely a literary recognition .
do you agree with this view ?
i do , and i am very sad about it .
i think those who have been praised for these reasons have much more talent than this kind of praise allows .
those writers who have emerged into the limelight during the last five years have been read largely this way .
but i do n't think it is only coming from the west .
it is coming from india to a large extent .
many of these reputations are made first in india across the border because of what the indians call their hunger for knowledge about their neighbors .
so i think it is quite unfair to say that these writers are necessarily aiming for this kind of attention .
and sadly , those of us who do n't write about these particular subjects are perhaps sidelined at the moment .
india has produced many great writers in recent times : salman rushdie , arundhati roy and vikram seth being some of the examples .
where do you place them in international literature ?
though arundhati roy has written just one novel , the god of small things , i think that is a really fine book , and i think it is one of the finest first novels that came out at the end of the last century .
salman rushdie has a great cosmopolitan reputation .
it is now probably fallacious to limit that reputation to a particular country because he has lived in so many countries , and lived away from his roots .
he has a lasting love for india , and to some extent has an understanding of pakistan as well .
are the asian storytellers writing in english bringing anything new to the english language and literature ?
they have certainly brought a sense of history into the english language .
for example , if you read what amitav ghosh wrote some years ago , the glass palace for instance , he was not only talking about south asia , he was talking about asia in general - there was burma , there was malaysia .
and there was an overturning of a particular colonial narrative .
bapsi sidhwa gave a very different view of the partition -lrb- of the indian subcontinent -rrb- .
she gave the pakistani view , and from the point of view of the minority parsi group .
so of course new things are happening .
and i do n't think you can be innovative about history without being innovative about the form as well .
are the asian english writers still treated by the english speaking world as an exclusive group , or are they now considered more in the mainstream ?
i think they are considered more in the mainstream .
the older writers such as salman rushdie and anita desai are very much seen as belonging to the cosmopolitan school of writers .

he is the author of five collections of short stories : mirror to the sun -lrb- 1993 -rrb- , this other salt -lrb- 1999 -rrb- , turquoise -lrb- 2002 -rrb- , cactus town : selected stories -lrb- 2003 -rrb- and insomnia -lrb- 2007 -rrb- .
his novella , another gulmohar tree , was published in may 2009 .
his latest work is a novel called ' the cloud messenger ' , which will be released in march 2011 .
its italian version ' il nuvolo messaggero ' is already out in the market .
hussein , in an interview with deutsche welle , talks about how the year 2010 went for asian english writers in general , and the south asian writers in particular .
deutsche welle : what kind of previews has your novel ' the cloud messenger ' got so far ?
aamer hussein : it has got very favorable previews .
i think it is a complex book so every reader will have his own impression of it .
but the italian reviews in particular were very positive .
how was the year 2010 for the asian english fiction writers in general ?
which particular books did you like in 2010 ?
i think in terms of south asian literature , the year was much about the pakistani writers coming to the fore .
it was a good year in terms of what has gone before .
i have read some new books and really liked them .
there was a book from india by anjali joseph , saraswati park , which i enjoyed .
it was a good first book by the writer .
and there was a book by chandrahas choudhry , arzee the dwarf , which was noticed in 2010 and won several prizes .
at the moment i am reading a book by tabish khair , who is an indian writer from bihar , which is called the thing about thugs .
it is a very intelligent historical novel .
some literary critics are of the view that the recent fame acquired by the pakistani english writers is more because of the global limelight pakistan has got post-9/11 , and it is not purely a literary recognition .
do you agree with this view ?
i do , and i am very sad about it .
i think those who have been praised for these reasons have much more talent than this kind of praise allows .
those writers who have emerged into the limelight during the last five years have been read largely this way .
but i do n't think it is only coming from the west .
it is coming from india to a large extent .
many of these reputations are made first in india across the border because of what the indians call their hunger for knowledge about their neighbors .
so i think it is quite unfair to say that these writers are necessarily aiming for this kind of attention .
and sadly , those of us who do n't write about these particular subjects are perhaps sidelined at the moment .
india has produced many great writers in recent times : salman rushdie , arundhati roy and vikram seth being some of the examples .
where do you place them in international literature ?
though arundhati roy has written just one novel , the god of small things , i think that is a really fine book , and i think it is one of the finest first novels that came out at the end of the last century .
salman rushdie has a great cosmopolitan reputation .
it is now probably fallacious to limit that reputation to a particular country because he has lived in so many countries , and lived away from his roots .
he has a lasting love for india , and to some extent has an understanding of pakistan as well .
are the asian storytellers writing in english bringing anything new to the english language and literature ?
they have certainly brought a sense of history into the english language .
for example , if you read what amitav ghosh wrote some years ago , the glass palace for instance , he was not only talking about south asia , he was talking about asia in general - there was burma , there was malaysia .
and there was an overturning of a particular colonial narrative .
bapsi sidhwa gave a very different view of the partition -lrb- of the indian subcontinent -rrb- .
she gave the pakistani view , and from the point of view of the minority parsi group .
so of course new things are happening .
and i do n't think you can be innovative about history without being innovative about the form as well .
are the asian english writers still treated by the english speaking world as an exclusive group , or are they now considered more in the mainstream ?
i think they are considered more in the mainstream .
the older writers such as salman rushdie and anita desai are very much seen as belonging to the cosmopolitan school of writers .

but in 2005 an affirmative action law was passed guaranteeing that over one fourth of seats in parliament and over 30 provincial councils be reserved for women . in afghanistan ’ s parliament , 68 of the 249 seats are reserved for women .
during the elections of september 2010 , 69 women were elected to parliament – one more than the minimum .
siddiqua mobarez from wardak province in central afghanistan has been elected for the second time .
she believes the last elections were a victory for women .
" if a woman can be the head of a family , then she can also be the head of a state , " says mobarez . " if you look at the election results , it is easy to see that most of the women have been re-elected .
that shows that women are capable of working in politics and that the public has confidence in them .
we are very capable and we want to see change . "
change bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women and girls still face inequality the word change was a slogan on many election posters of female candidates .
in the last elections there were over 400 female candidates running for office .
that is close to 70 percent more than five years ago .
fauzia kofi is a young women ’ s rights activist and is considered to be a progressive star among afghan politicians .
she is active against the sexual abuse of women and discrimination and dreams of " living in a society in which there are no first and second class citizens .
i want equality .
and i want to eliminate all forms of discrimination based on sex , ethnicity and native language . "
the heinrich boell foundation carried out a study on women in politics .
for the study , afghanistan expert andrea fleschenberg talked to 91 female parliamentarians .
she believes the fight for equality is still not easy as she recalls talking to the women .
" some women are told they do not have the qualifications to hold their elected positions .
but at the same time , they are working in an area where the rules are constantly changing , where there is little transparency and there is a lot of patronage .
of course it is difficult for them to stand up for their own interests in such a climate . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in a society dominated by men , some believe women have no business going into politics the hurdles of traditional society it doesn ’ t help that only few of the female politicians work together .
and many other women can not get over the hurdles of traditional society .
conservative afghans still think that women have no place in politics.fauzia kofi says many women in parliament complain they are not taken seriously by their male colleagues .
and some women are even pointedly bullied .
" we don ’ t have enough time to speak on the floor of the house .
people try to ruin our reputations and some women have even received threats . "
threats is sometimes an understatement .
fauzia kofi herself was recently the victim of an attack which she barely survived .
the taliban had planted explosives in her car .
but despite all the obstacles , there are now more women in afghan politics than there ever have been .
and with any luck , the quota system will continue to help .

two decades after reunification , they 've been transformed .
but can their local economies survive in the long run ? newsreels from the communist german democratic republic regularly praised factory workers in the towns of wolfen and bitterfeld , which formed the core of east germany 's chemical and mining industries .
what they did n't mention was that those workers were toiling in one of the dirtiest corners of europe - a region so polluted that clothes hung out to dry used to change color depending on which factory the ever-present chemical clouds were coming from that day . today , it 's a different story .
instead of a ruined industrial landscape covered in ash , the towns , now merged into one entity called bitterfeld-wolfen , are marketed as a tourist destination , complete with a sparkling lake and large forests , as well as a center for germany 's burgeoning solar energy sector . for those who have lived here for decades , the change is overwhelming .
matthias gabriel remembers sitting on a park bench one day in the 1960s .
when he stood up , he noticed stains on his trousers . " the stains would n't come out and after a few weeks , they turned into holes , " gabriel said .
" the place just stank , it was always foggy with chemical fumes .
if you could imagine what hell looked like , that was it . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chemicals giant bayer is has set up shop in bitterfeld-wolfen bitterfeld and wolfen epitomized a failed east germany .
tens of thousands of people in the region lost their jobs as uncompetitive factories were shuttered after the berlin wall fell .
almost half of the population left for greener pastures elsewhere . even now , if you mention bitterfeld almost anywhere in germany , a certain look comes across people 's faces .
it is not one of fond remembrance . transformation but a visit to the region today is not marked by ecological horror , rather by a strong sense of a town seeking to overcome its past and reinvent itself in an environmentally , economically sustainable community .
bitterfeld-wolfen wants to be a vacation spot . one of the attractions aiming to draw visitors is the bitterfeld arch , a steel sculpture with a 30-meter-high observation deck , designed to recall an old mining excavator .
from the top , a landscape of water and woods , quaint houses and small factories stretches out to the horizon . " i think we are a town which is the best example for change , " said katrin kuhnt , the town 's press spokeswoman .
" change from a destroyed environment to a tourism attraction . " the town still has smokestacks , but overall , it 's largely been scrubbed clean of the notorious ash and soot from the bad old days . " we have a well-functioning environment and we have a lot of tourists here .
we have industry too , but it 's clean industry , " kuhnt said .
" it 's a huge change . " new and improved industries the chemicals sector has n't disappeared from the town , but the plants today meet modern environmental standards .
solar companies have set up shop in the region , which is now referred to as germany 's " solar valley . " " we have an industry and a branch proceeding at a pace you would not have imagined when the wall came down 20 years ago , " said konrad sell , the head of corporate communication for sovello , a solar manufacturer that employs 1,200 people . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : goitzsche lake was created from an old mining pit from almost any perspective , the turnaround from industrial nightmare to renewable energy center and vacation destination is remarkable .
it has been made possible by a large infusion of taxpayer money to the former east , at least 1.3 trillion euros -lrb- $ 1.7 trillion -rrb- , largely from western germany . the money , raised from a so-called " solidarity tax " that all germans pay , has been invested in roads , environmental clean-up projects and other infrastructure projects .
it also subsidizes the region 's budding solar industry . still , beneath the shiny surface , real problems remain . long-term challenges many of the town 's buildings have been lovingly renovated , but at 6 pm , downtown bitterfeld is almost devoid of shoppers .
those who are still out and about are mostly retirees , not the highly skilled employees of the solar and high-tech firms .
most young professionals prefer to live in bigger cities nearby , like leipzig . that absence , as well as the competitive pressures on the town 's newer industries , has raised real concerns about the long-term economic outlook of bitterfeld-wolfen . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bitterfeld-wolfen has transformed itself , but still faces economic problems " in modern factories , you do n't need as many people , " said mayor petra wust .
" we will never have as many industrial jobs as we once did here .
it 's just not going to happen . " today , bitterfeld-wolfen 's factories only employ about half the number of people they did in the 1980s .
unemployment remains high , and young people continue to leave for jobs in other parts of germany , particularly large cities . like many towns in the former east , bitterfeld-wolfen is shrinking .
large apartment buildings are being torn down because there 's no one left to live in them .
twenty years ago , chancellor helmut kohl promised eastern germany would become a " blooming landscape " of economic development .
but according to most indicators , it is still dragging behind , which has led to a sense of disillusionment . " in the smaller towns you can feel a kind of anger in the people .
they usually say they feel disappointed by the politicians , " said miriam mueller , a researcher at berlin 's free university who studies eastern germany . " what they had expected from western germany was utopia . " instead , they got capitalism .
and even two decades later , many people are still having a hard time coming to terms with it . author : kyle james editor : sam edmonds send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

beijing ’ s economic and political weight is becoming mightier by the day . for some time now , there has been a sense among sinophiles and sinophobes that the only thing growing faster than the chinese economy is chinese self-confidence .
this year , it reached even greater peaks .
in the summer , china put on the biggest world expo ever , attracting a record 73 million visitors .
the country now has the world ’ s biggest high-speed train network , and no computer is faster than the " tianhe 1a " in china ’ s northern port of tianjin .
not only has china promised to come to the rescue of the eu , as it goes from one financial crisis to the next , it has also invested billions into its scramble for " soft power " .
confucius institutes have been set up all over the world to promote chinese language and culture , and china ’ s international media are expanding .
the idea is to assure the world that china ’ s rise will be a peaceful one .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : japan was forced to release a chinese fishing boat captain involved in a collision near disputed islands tensions with japan but in september , beijing showed its less friendly side when japan seized a chinese fishing boat and its captain , after they supposedly strayed into disputed waters and rammed a japanese coastguard boat .
that beijing would protest was clear , but its reaction was harsher than expected .
beijing broke off all governmental contact with tokyo and put a stop on the export of rare earths to japan .
even when japan finally released the captain , beijing called for an apology .
china practically has a monopoly on the world ’ s rare earths , which are indispensable in many high-tech products .
hu xingdou , an economist at beijing ’ s university of science and technology , explains what this potentially means for the future .
" obviously it ’ s good for china that it has raw materials , which it can use as a strategic instrument .
china could decide to sell rare earths only to countries that behave as it wants – and exclude others . "
meeting the dalai lama is bad for business a study published by goettingen university this fall indicated how china is using its economic strength for its political aims .
it found that when countries receive the tibetans ’ spiritual leader , the dalai lama , their exports to china decrease by an average 8 percent .
especially exports of ships and planes , one of the study 's co-authors nils-hendrik klann explains , " such goods are not usually bought by normal consumers but by trade delegations for example .
such trade delegations are less likely to visit a country which has received the dalai lama . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nobel laureate liu xiaobo remains in jail in future , this might be considered the " liu xiaobo effect . "
beijing exercised enormous diplomatic pressure earlier this year to prevent chinese dissident liu xiaobo from being awarded the nobel peace prize , and embassies from attending the awards ceremony in oslo .
ma zhaoxu from the chinese foreign ministry avoided mentioning liu ’ s name at press conferences .
" the person you are talking about broke chinese laws and is a sentenced criminal .
we have made our position clear many times .
we refuse that a lot of fuss be made and we refuse all interference in our matters . "
all the eu states , which china sometimes tries to play against each other , showed unity in december and turned up to the ceremony .

beijing ’ s economic and political weight is becoming mightier by the day . for some time now , there has been a sense among sinophiles and sinophobes that the only thing growing faster than the chinese economy is chinese self-confidence .
this year , it reached even greater peaks .
in the summer , china put on the biggest world expo ever , attracting a record 73 million visitors .
the country now has the world ’ s biggest high-speed train network , and no computer is faster than the " tianhe 1a " in china ’ s northern port of tianjin .
not only has china promised to come to the rescue of the eu , as it goes from one financial crisis to the next , it has also invested billions into its scramble for " soft power " .
confucius institutes have been set up all over the world to promote chinese language and culture , and china ’ s international media are expanding .
the idea is to assure the world that china ’ s rise will be a peaceful one .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : japan was forced to release a chinese fishing boat captain involved in a collision near disputed islands tensions with japan but in september , beijing showed its less friendly side when japan seized a chinese fishing boat and its captain , after they supposedly strayed into disputed waters and rammed a japanese coastguard boat .
that beijing would protest was clear , but its reaction was harsher than expected .
beijing broke off all governmental contact with tokyo and put a stop on the export of rare earths to japan .
even when japan finally released the captain , beijing called for an apology .
china practically has a monopoly on the world ’ s rare earths , which are indispensable in many high-tech products .
hu xingdou , an economist at beijing ’ s university of science and technology , explains what this potentially means for the future .
" obviously it ’ s good for china that it has raw materials , which it can use as a strategic instrument .
china could decide to sell rare earths only to countries that behave as it wants – and exclude others . "
meeting the dalai lama is bad for business a study published by goettingen university this fall indicated how china is using its economic strength for its political aims .
it found that when countries receive the tibetans ’ spiritual leader , the dalai lama , their exports to china decrease by an average 8 percent .
especially exports of ships and planes , one of the study 's co-authors nils-hendrik klann explains , " such goods are not usually bought by normal consumers but by trade delegations for example .
such trade delegations are less likely to visit a country which has received the dalai lama . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nobel laureate liu xiaobo remains in jail in future , this might be considered the " liu xiaobo effect . "
beijing exercised enormous diplomatic pressure earlier this year to prevent chinese dissident liu xiaobo from being awarded the nobel peace prize , and embassies from attending the awards ceremony in oslo .
ma zhaoxu from the chinese foreign ministry avoided mentioning liu ’ s name at press conferences .
" the person you are talking about broke chinese laws and is a sentenced criminal .
we have made our position clear many times .
we refuse that a lot of fuss be made and we refuse all interference in our matters . "
all the eu states , which china sometimes tries to play against each other , showed unity in december and turned up to the ceremony .
