but free speech is still in danger from powerful organized crime syndicates intent on silencing reporters and the disturbing creep of monopolized media industries under the auspices of sovereign leaders . the country generating most concern is mexico , where a total of 68 journalists and media workers have been killed and a further 11 abducted since 2000 .
mexico has become one of the deadliest places in the world for journalists .
the rising power of drug cartels and the mexican government 's violent crackdown on narcotics gangs has turned areas of the country into battlegrounds . journalists there working on stories about the drug war live in constant fear of being kidnapped , tortured and murdered by cartels desperate to silence the media 's reporting on their activities and members .
these alliances are eager to gain control of the airwaves .
the international press freedom organization reporters without borders claims that drug gangs target journalists with impunity , as prosecutions relating to these crimes are very rarely completed . mexican government failing journalists , campaigners claim bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : journalists continue to die while reporting on mexico 's drug war reporters without borders also claims that mexico 's special federal attorney 's office for combating violence against the media has failed to make much of an impression since its creation in 2006 .
the myriad departments dedicated to press freedom in the executive , legislative and judicial branches of government often cancel each other out through passivity or negligence . " the mexican government has done almost nothing to protect journalists , " benoit hervieu , the americas expert at reporters without borders , told deutsche welle .
" the special attorney charged with following up the investigations into crimes against journalists has been given over 500 files , and maybe one percent of them have been looked into .
it is very hard to follow up investigations in mexico . " the mexican government has also been dogged by accusations that certain sectors of the state apparatus have been infiltrated by organized crime gangs .
it is alleged that the authorities are also complicit , if not entirely responsible , for serious human rights violations including the suppression of free speech . " some government officials are involved in the suppression of the media and the violence committed against journalists , so investigations get hindered at an official level , " hervieu said .
" it is very hard to pursue these cases .
plus bureaucracy is terrible in mexico .
it is one of the worst countries in latin america for this . " fear drives journalists to self-censor journalists in mexico are living in such fear that there is a concern that the constant threat to their lives is leading to a form of self-censorship in an attempt to protect themselves . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pressure from cartels force journalists to self-censorship only last week , el diario , a newspaper in the mexican border city of ciudad juárez , appealed directly in a front-page story to the drug cartels which have turned the city into a war zone and who have taken a number of journalists ' lives .
in the article , the paper asked for reporting and censorship guidelines . " gentlemen … please explain to us … what you would like us to publish or stop publishing , " the statement read .
" the last thing we want is for another one of our colleagues to fall victim to your gunshots . " " the cartels are obviously involved and responsible for attacks and media suppression but they also provide the government with a very convenient excuse , " said hervieu .
" it is so easy for the government to blame the cartels .
this is war , and in war confusion is high .
it is therefore easy to say that the enemy is responsible .
but in some of the most dangerous regions of mexico , it is the police and the army which is the most feared . " while mexico is considered the most dangerous place in latin america for press freedom , it is not the only country in the region where journalists ' lives are at risk .
in honduras , eight journalists have been killed so far this year by drug traffickers or in violent struggles with government forces in protests over land reform and the political situation in the country since the government was overthrown in 2009 . " in honduras , the violence came after the coup in 2009 and the attacks on journalists came as revenge for dissent during the unrest , " hervieu said .
" this political violence continues with no investigations .
honduras , along with mexico and colombia , is one of the most dangerous places for journalists in latin america . " democratically-elected leaders building media monopolies elsewhere , the rise of government-backed media monopolies and the election of leaders keen to suppress dissenting voices are having detrimental effects on press freedom in countries such as venezuela , ecuador , argentina and bolivia . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chavez forced a number of media outlets to close down dictatorships may be a thing of the past in most latin america countries , apart from cuba , but leaders like venezuelan president hugo chávez are exercising a level of control similar to that favored by the totalitarian regimes they were elected to replace .
chávez has closed down a television network , 32 radio stations and two local television channels allegedly because they criticized a political ally . rights groups accuse both president rafael correa of ecuador and argentina 's leader cristina fernández of increasing their governments ' grip on media institutions to an unhealthy degree . correa 's regime now controls some 20 media companies in ecuador and has brought in legislation which limits ownership of media outlets and what these outlets can broadcast in certain circumstances .
this legislation was cited during a period of unrest in september when correa ordered all television and radio stations to broadcast only government-supplied information . dismantling powerful opponent in argentina bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fernández has her eye on increasing favorable coverage meanwhile in argentina , fernández is allegedly engaged in a campaign to break up the country 's biggest media conglomerate , the clarín group , after it began broadcasting negative coverage of her and her recently deceased husband and former president néstor kirchner . by applying pressure to some of the group 's most influential contract partners , cancelling the company 's license to provide internet service , and sending tax officials to raid the group 's headquarters , fernández is determined to dismantle a powerful mouthpiece of dissent while increasing government advertising revenue in a bid to replace the clarín group 's negative content with more government-friendly coverage . " clarín , owner of newspapers , radio stations , broadcast and cable television outlets , and an internet service provider , has had an antagonistic relationship with fernandez-kirchner since a 2008 conflict with the farming sector over a tax raise , " according to carlos lauría , senior program coordinator for the americas at the committee to protect journalists -lrb- cpj -rrb- .
he said the government had accused clarín and other private media of biased coverage . " journalists at clarín and national newspaper la nación believe the government is engaged in an intimidating campaign to silence critics , " lauría said . meanwhile both bolivia and nicaragua have passed laws which allow their governments to close media outlets deemed disruptive while allegedly prosecuting and imprisoning critical reporters on trumped up charges such as money laundering . media campaigners have a pessimistic view of the state of press freedom in latin america and while there are efforts being made to turn things around , few have much hope of widespread change . " what is needed is open debate , " said hervieu .
" in argentina and uruguay , there was a debate among teachers and intellectuals about how the media could regain its full freedom .
that 's a start . " however , he said in mexico , it would take a massive institutional reform with the help of the united states to bring about change .

but free speech is still in danger from powerful organized crime syndicates intent on silencing reporters and the disturbing creep of monopolized media industries under the auspices of sovereign leaders . the country generating most concern is mexico , where a total of 68 journalists and media workers have been killed and a further 11 abducted since 2000 .
mexico has become one of the deadliest places in the world for journalists .
the rising power of drug cartels and the mexican government 's violent crackdown on narcotics gangs has turned areas of the country into battlegrounds . journalists there working on stories about the drug war live in constant fear of being kidnapped , tortured and murdered by cartels desperate to silence the media 's reporting on their activities and members .
these alliances are eager to gain control of the airwaves .
the international press freedom organization reporters without borders claims that drug gangs target journalists with impunity , as prosecutions relating to these crimes are very rarely completed . mexican government failing journalists , campaigners claim bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : journalists continue to die while reporting on mexico 's drug war reporters without borders also claims that mexico 's special federal attorney 's office for combating violence against the media has failed to make much of an impression since its creation in 2006 .
the myriad departments dedicated to press freedom in the executive , legislative and judicial branches of government often cancel each other out through passivity or negligence . " the mexican government has done almost nothing to protect journalists , " benoit hervieu , the americas expert at reporters without borders , told deutsche welle .
" the special attorney charged with following up the investigations into crimes against journalists has been given over 500 files , and maybe one percent of them have been looked into .
it is very hard to follow up investigations in mexico . " the mexican government has also been dogged by accusations that certain sectors of the state apparatus have been infiltrated by organized crime gangs .
it is alleged that the authorities are also complicit , if not entirely responsible , for serious human rights violations including the suppression of free speech . " some government officials are involved in the suppression of the media and the violence committed against journalists , so investigations get hindered at an official level , " hervieu said .
" it is very hard to pursue these cases .
plus bureaucracy is terrible in mexico .
it is one of the worst countries in latin america for this . " fear drives journalists to self-censor journalists in mexico are living in such fear that there is a concern that the constant threat to their lives is leading to a form of self-censorship in an attempt to protect themselves . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pressure from cartels force journalists to self-censorship only last week , el diario , a newspaper in the mexican border city of ciudad juárez , appealed directly in a front-page story to the drug cartels which have turned the city into a war zone and who have taken a number of journalists ' lives .
in the article , the paper asked for reporting and censorship guidelines . " gentlemen … please explain to us … what you would like us to publish or stop publishing , " the statement read .
" the last thing we want is for another one of our colleagues to fall victim to your gunshots . " " the cartels are obviously involved and responsible for attacks and media suppression but they also provide the government with a very convenient excuse , " said hervieu .
" it is so easy for the government to blame the cartels .
this is war , and in war confusion is high .
it is therefore easy to say that the enemy is responsible .
but in some of the most dangerous regions of mexico , it is the police and the army which is the most feared . " while mexico is considered the most dangerous place in latin america for press freedom , it is not the only country in the region where journalists ' lives are at risk .
in honduras , eight journalists have been killed so far this year by drug traffickers or in violent struggles with government forces in protests over land reform and the political situation in the country since the government was overthrown in 2009 . " in honduras , the violence came after the coup in 2009 and the attacks on journalists came as revenge for dissent during the unrest , " hervieu said .
" this political violence continues with no investigations .
honduras , along with mexico and colombia , is one of the most dangerous places for journalists in latin america . " democratically-elected leaders building media monopolies elsewhere , the rise of government-backed media monopolies and the election of leaders keen to suppress dissenting voices are having detrimental effects on press freedom in countries such as venezuela , ecuador , argentina and bolivia . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chavez forced a number of media outlets to close down dictatorships may be a thing of the past in most latin america countries , apart from cuba , but leaders like venezuelan president hugo chávez are exercising a level of control similar to that favored by the totalitarian regimes they were elected to replace .
chávez has closed down a television network , 32 radio stations and two local television channels allegedly because they criticized a political ally . rights groups accuse both president rafael correa of ecuador and argentina 's leader cristina fernández of increasing their governments ' grip on media institutions to an unhealthy degree . correa 's regime now controls some 20 media companies in ecuador and has brought in legislation which limits ownership of media outlets and what these outlets can broadcast in certain circumstances .
this legislation was cited during a period of unrest in september when correa ordered all television and radio stations to broadcast only government-supplied information . dismantling powerful opponent in argentina bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fernández has her eye on increasing favorable coverage meanwhile in argentina , fernández is allegedly engaged in a campaign to break up the country 's biggest media conglomerate , the clarín group , after it began broadcasting negative coverage of her and her recently deceased husband and former president néstor kirchner . by applying pressure to some of the group 's most influential contract partners , cancelling the company 's license to provide internet service , and sending tax officials to raid the group 's headquarters , fernández is determined to dismantle a powerful mouthpiece of dissent while increasing government advertising revenue in a bid to replace the clarín group 's negative content with more government-friendly coverage . " clarín , owner of newspapers , radio stations , broadcast and cable television outlets , and an internet service provider , has had an antagonistic relationship with fernandez-kirchner since a 2008 conflict with the farming sector over a tax raise , " according to carlos lauría , senior program coordinator for the americas at the committee to protect journalists -lrb- cpj -rrb- .
he said the government had accused clarín and other private media of biased coverage . " journalists at clarín and national newspaper la nación believe the government is engaged in an intimidating campaign to silence critics , " lauría said . meanwhile both bolivia and nicaragua have passed laws which allow their governments to close media outlets deemed disruptive while allegedly prosecuting and imprisoning critical reporters on trumped up charges such as money laundering . media campaigners have a pessimistic view of the state of press freedom in latin america and while there are efforts being made to turn things around , few have much hope of widespread change . " what is needed is open debate , " said hervieu .
" in argentina and uruguay , there was a debate among teachers and intellectuals about how the media could regain its full freedom .
that 's a start . " however , he said in mexico , it would take a massive institutional reform with the help of the united states to bring about change .

but free speech is still in danger from powerful organized crime syndicates intent on silencing reporters and the disturbing creep of monopolized media industries under the auspices of sovereign leaders . the country generating most concern is mexico , where a total of 68 journalists and media workers have been killed and a further 11 abducted since 2000 .
mexico has become one of the deadliest places in the world for journalists .
the rising power of drug cartels and the mexican government 's violent crackdown on narcotics gangs has turned areas of the country into battlegrounds . journalists there working on stories about the drug war live in constant fear of being kidnapped , tortured and murdered by cartels desperate to silence the media 's reporting on their activities and members .
these alliances are eager to gain control of the airwaves .
the international press freedom organization reporters without borders claims that drug gangs target journalists with impunity , as prosecutions relating to these crimes are very rarely completed . mexican government failing journalists , campaigners claim bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : journalists continue to die while reporting on mexico 's drug war reporters without borders also claims that mexico 's special federal attorney 's office for combating violence against the media has failed to make much of an impression since its creation in 2006 .
the myriad departments dedicated to press freedom in the executive , legislative and judicial branches of government often cancel each other out through passivity or negligence . " the mexican government has done almost nothing to protect journalists , " benoit hervieu , the americas expert at reporters without borders , told deutsche welle .
" the special attorney charged with following up the investigations into crimes against journalists has been given over 500 files , and maybe one percent of them have been looked into .
it is very hard to follow up investigations in mexico . " the mexican government has also been dogged by accusations that certain sectors of the state apparatus have been infiltrated by organized crime gangs .
it is alleged that the authorities are also complicit , if not entirely responsible , for serious human rights violations including the suppression of free speech . " some government officials are involved in the suppression of the media and the violence committed against journalists , so investigations get hindered at an official level , " hervieu said .
" it is very hard to pursue these cases .
plus bureaucracy is terrible in mexico .
it is one of the worst countries in latin america for this . " fear drives journalists to self-censor journalists in mexico are living in such fear that there is a concern that the constant threat to their lives is leading to a form of self-censorship in an attempt to protect themselves . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pressure from cartels force journalists to self-censorship only last week , el diario , a newspaper in the mexican border city of ciudad juárez , appealed directly in a front-page story to the drug cartels which have turned the city into a war zone and who have taken a number of journalists ' lives .
in the article , the paper asked for reporting and censorship guidelines . " gentlemen … please explain to us … what you would like us to publish or stop publishing , " the statement read .
" the last thing we want is for another one of our colleagues to fall victim to your gunshots . " " the cartels are obviously involved and responsible for attacks and media suppression but they also provide the government with a very convenient excuse , " said hervieu .
" it is so easy for the government to blame the cartels .
this is war , and in war confusion is high .
it is therefore easy to say that the enemy is responsible .
but in some of the most dangerous regions of mexico , it is the police and the army which is the most feared . " while mexico is considered the most dangerous place in latin america for press freedom , it is not the only country in the region where journalists ' lives are at risk .
in honduras , eight journalists have been killed so far this year by drug traffickers or in violent struggles with government forces in protests over land reform and the political situation in the country since the government was overthrown in 2009 . " in honduras , the violence came after the coup in 2009 and the attacks on journalists came as revenge for dissent during the unrest , " hervieu said .
" this political violence continues with no investigations .
honduras , along with mexico and colombia , is one of the most dangerous places for journalists in latin america . " democratically-elected leaders building media monopolies elsewhere , the rise of government-backed media monopolies and the election of leaders keen to suppress dissenting voices are having detrimental effects on press freedom in countries such as venezuela , ecuador , argentina and bolivia . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chavez forced a number of media outlets to close down dictatorships may be a thing of the past in most latin america countries , apart from cuba , but leaders like venezuelan president hugo chávez are exercising a level of control similar to that favored by the totalitarian regimes they were elected to replace .
chávez has closed down a television network , 32 radio stations and two local television channels allegedly because they criticized a political ally . rights groups accuse both president rafael correa of ecuador and argentina 's leader cristina fernández of increasing their governments ' grip on media institutions to an unhealthy degree . correa 's regime now controls some 20 media companies in ecuador and has brought in legislation which limits ownership of media outlets and what these outlets can broadcast in certain circumstances .
this legislation was cited during a period of unrest in september when correa ordered all television and radio stations to broadcast only government-supplied information . dismantling powerful opponent in argentina bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fernández has her eye on increasing favorable coverage meanwhile in argentina , fernández is allegedly engaged in a campaign to break up the country 's biggest media conglomerate , the clarín group , after it began broadcasting negative coverage of her and her recently deceased husband and former president néstor kirchner . by applying pressure to some of the group 's most influential contract partners , cancelling the company 's license to provide internet service , and sending tax officials to raid the group 's headquarters , fernández is determined to dismantle a powerful mouthpiece of dissent while increasing government advertising revenue in a bid to replace the clarín group 's negative content with more government-friendly coverage . " clarín , owner of newspapers , radio stations , broadcast and cable television outlets , and an internet service provider , has had an antagonistic relationship with fernandez-kirchner since a 2008 conflict with the farming sector over a tax raise , " according to carlos lauría , senior program coordinator for the americas at the committee to protect journalists -lrb- cpj -rrb- .
he said the government had accused clarín and other private media of biased coverage . " journalists at clarín and national newspaper la nación believe the government is engaged in an intimidating campaign to silence critics , " lauría said . meanwhile both bolivia and nicaragua have passed laws which allow their governments to close media outlets deemed disruptive while allegedly prosecuting and imprisoning critical reporters on trumped up charges such as money laundering . media campaigners have a pessimistic view of the state of press freedom in latin america and while there are efforts being made to turn things around , few have much hope of widespread change . " what is needed is open debate , " said hervieu .
" in argentina and uruguay , there was a debate among teachers and intellectuals about how the media could regain its full freedom .

but as china booms , there is concern human life is being left on the wayside by power-hungry and corrupt officials . as the world expo in shanghai wound down , there was one exhibit at the chile pavilion that continued to attract the masses .
the phoenix 2 capsule , which helped rescue 33 chilean miners last month , triggered a debate about mine safety in china . one visitor said that the rescue operation in chile showed a respect for human life that china could learn from .
just days after the chilean miners were rescued , some 30 of their chinese colleagues in a mine in henan province died in an explosion . " the mine was unsafe but they don ’ t care about worker safety .
all they care about is production , " the mother of one of the dead miners said angrily . safety laws often ignored federal safety laws and directives from beijing are often ignored .
former functionaries themselves say that china ’ s economic boom is partly based on blood . " all they care about is developing the economy , " says zhou xiaozheng , a sociologist at the people ’ s university in beijing .
" they just look at gdp in order to gauge development .
that ’ s how they are judged and that ’ s what their promotions are based upon . " in its rhetoric , the central government in beijing preaches about sustainable growth , about the environment and development without waste of resources .
prime minister wen jiabao often talks about people-oriented policies .
" the government acquired its power from the people , all power goes back to the people and we have to do everything for the people , " he recently said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many chinese are getting rich but some say the poor are being sacrificed however , for many these words are like a slap in the face .
only the ruling communist party is to blame for the fact that there are no controls over those in power , that there is no transparency , no checks and balances . officials and businessmen in cahoots environmental activist wu lihong , who has long campaigned against the pollution of lake taihu , says there is a tangled web of corruption and nepotism , with officials and factory owners working hand-in-hand . " they are in cahoots and they have the same interests .
that 's why the central government never finds out the truth and does not know about local issues .
the central government has no power – that ’ s one of our system 's problems . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : migrant workers are flocking to the cities to find work but they are often subject to abuse there is also corruption at the highest level .
at the beginning of the year , a former supreme court judge was sentenced to lifetime imprisonment for taking bribes and corruption charges .
last month , the former head of china ’ s nuclear agency was expelled from the party . " power creates corruption , " says zhou xiaozheng .
" and absolute power creates absolute corruption .
we humans are not saints .
anyone who is in power for a long time becomes corrupt .
that ’ s why we have to monitor those in power better . " but , he adds , this is what is currently not possible in china .
the media have restricted powers of control .
censorship in china is all-pervasive in china .
even though the media are allowed to report on accidents such as the one in henan , the deeper causes usually remain unexamined . author : ruth kirchner -lrb- act -rrb- editor : arun chowdhury send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

chancellor merkel pointed to successful examples of integration and said society should put more effort into working with immigrants . by 2015 german chancellor angela merkel wants to give every immigrant the opportunity to take part in integration courses .
the government estimates that by that time around 1.8 million people will have attended the courses since they were first introduced in 2005 .
" we 're catching up in 10 years on what we failed to do in the previous 30 years , " merkel said at the end of an integration summit in berlin on wednesday .
" we want to be more concrete . "
that was the message of german chancellor angela merkel at the berlin integration summit .
she wants to set clear standards to make it easier to assess what germany has achieved , and what is still to be done on the issue of integration .
' multiculturalism has failed ' merkel said the notion that integration could be achieved simply by different living next to one another was outdated .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : politicians , experts and minority groups took part merkel , who said in a speech last month that " multiculturalism has failed , " set out to prove that integration would not happen by itself .
she said that true integration required much more energy and engagement from all of society .
the chancellor praised the atmosphere at the summit as being " the right working environment . "
the 120 participants , including politicians , economists , and representatives of the police and the media apparently exchanged " controversial opinions " with one another .
merkel said they had spoken openly about " what had yet to be achieved . "
for example , she pointed out that there was a lot of work still to do on the issue of violence in schools .
" there 's still a long way to go on this journey , " merkel commented .
the government says it will spend about 400 million euros -lrb- 560 million dollars -rrb- by 2014 on improving german language skills among the children of immigrants so they can perform better at school .
it is also seeking to help immigrants get their foreign qualifications recognised in germany , and to have more people from immigrant backgrounds working in the civil service and in the police force .
success stories there were some impressive examples of successes in immigration policy , merkel said .
she cited sport as an example .
the 2010 german world cup team was the most multicultural ever , with a number of players from turkish and african immigrant families .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and boehmer have drawn up an action plan maria boehmer is the government minister responsible for the issue of integration .
she echoed the chancellor 's words , saying that " a lot of ground had been gained " in the last few years .
she said there were more positive stories of integration " than had been told in the last few weeks . "
germany has been embroiled in a debate about integration since a prominent member of the board of the state bank , the bundesbank , sparked outrage in germany and abroad when he published a book which claimed that muslims themselves were in part responsible for failing to integrate into german society .
he was forced to resign from his post , but the debate simmered on .
boehmer cited a new national action plan , which should make progress in integration easier to follow , and will complement the current national integration plan .
she said that police , care workers and teachers could play a " bridging role " in helping immigrants to integrate .
some participants , however , criticized the lack of real results at the summit .
aydan oezoguz , who is responsible for integration in the opposition spd parliamentary group , called the action plan a " hotch-potch of measures that had already been agreed on . "
the spokesperson on migration policy for the left party , sevim dagdelen , said it was merely a " symbolic summit " that would not change the daily reality for immigrants in germany . ´ the federal statistics office says about 16 million people in germany come from a " migrant background " - just under 20 percent of the population .
of these , an estimated 4 million are muslim , mostly of turkish origin .

she wants to set clear standards to make it easier to assess what germany has achieved , and what is still to be done on the issue of integration .
' multiculturalism has failed ' merkel said the notion that integration could be achieved simply by different living next to one another was outdated .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : politicians , experts and minority groups took part merkel , who said in a speech last month that " multiculturalism has failed , " set out to prove that integration would not happen by itself .
she said that true integration required much more energy and engagement from all of society .
the chancellor praised the atmosphere at the summit as being " the right working environment . "
the 120 participants , including politicians , economists , and representatives of the police and the media apparently exchanged " controversial opinions " with one another .
merkel said they had spoken openly about " what had yet to be achieved . "
for example , she pointed out that there was a lot of work still to do on the issue of violence in schools .
" there 's still a long way to go on this journey , " merkel commented .
the government says it will spend about 400 million euros -lrb- 560 million dollars -rrb- by 2014 on improving german language skills among the children of immigrants so they can perform better at school .
it is also seeking to help immigrants get their foreign qualifications recognised in germany , and to have more people from immigrant backgrounds working in the civil service and in the police force .
success stories there were some impressive examples of successes in immigration policy , merkel said .
she cited sport as an example .
the 2010 german world cup team was the most multicultural ever , with a number of players from turkish and african immigrant families .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and boehmer have drawn up an action plan maria boehmer is the government minister responsible for the issue of integration .
she echoed the chancellor 's words , saying that " a lot of ground had been gained " in the last few years .
she said there were more positive stories of integration " than had been told in the last few weeks . "
germany has been embroiled in a debate about integration since a prominent member of the board of the state bank , the bundesbank , sparked outrage in germany and abroad when he published a book which claimed that muslims themselves were in part responsible for failing to integrate into german society .
he was forced to resign from his post , but the debate simmered on .
boehmer cited a new national action plan , which should make progress in integration easier to follow , and will complement the current national integration plan .
she said that police , care workers and teachers could play a " bridging role " in helping immigrants to integrate .
some participants , however , criticized the lack of real results at the summit .
aydan oezoguz , who is responsible for integration in the opposition spd parliamentary group , called the action plan a " hotch-potch of measures that had already been agreed on . "
the spokesperson on migration policy for the left party , sevim dagdelen , said it was merely a " symbolic summit " that would not change the daily reality for immigrants in germany . ´ the federal statistics office says about 16 million people in germany come from a " migrant background " - just under 20 percent of the population .
of these , an estimated 4 million are muslim , mostly of turkish origin .

but as china booms , there is concern human life is being left on the wayside by power-hungry and corrupt officials . as the world expo in shanghai wound down , there was one exhibit at the chile pavilion that continued to attract the masses .
the phoenix 2 capsule , which helped rescue 33 chilean miners last month , triggered a debate about mine safety in china . one visitor said that the rescue operation in chile showed a respect for human life that china could learn from .
just days after the chilean miners were rescued , some 30 of their chinese colleagues in a mine in henan province died in an explosion . " the mine was unsafe but they don ’ t care about worker safety .
all they care about is production , " the mother of one of the dead miners said angrily . safety laws often ignored federal safety laws and directives from beijing are often ignored .
former functionaries themselves say that china ’ s economic boom is partly based on blood . " all they care about is developing the economy , " says zhou xiaozheng , a sociologist at the people ’ s university in beijing .
" they just look at gdp in order to gauge development .
that ’ s how they are judged and that ’ s what their promotions are based upon . " in its rhetoric , the central government in beijing preaches about sustainable growth , about the environment and development without waste of resources .
prime minister wen jiabao often talks about people-oriented policies .
" the government acquired its power from the people , all power goes back to the people and we have to do everything for the people , " he recently said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many chinese are getting rich but some say the poor are being sacrificed however , for many these words are like a slap in the face .
only the ruling communist party is to blame for the fact that there are no controls over those in power , that there is no transparency , no checks and balances . officials and businessmen in cahoots environmental activist wu lihong , who has long campaigned against the pollution of lake taihu , says there is a tangled web of corruption and nepotism , with officials and factory owners working hand-in-hand . " they are in cahoots and they have the same interests .
that 's why the central government never finds out the truth and does not know about local issues .
the central government has no power – that ’ s one of our system 's problems . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : migrant workers are flocking to the cities to find work but they are often subject to abuse there is also corruption at the highest level .
at the beginning of the year , a former supreme court judge was sentenced to lifetime imprisonment for taking bribes and corruption charges .
last month , the former head of china ’ s nuclear agency was expelled from the party . " power creates corruption , " says zhou xiaozheng .
" and absolute power creates absolute corruption .
we humans are not saints .
anyone who is in power for a long time becomes corrupt .
that ’ s why we have to monitor those in power better . " but , he adds , this is what is currently not possible in china .
the media have restricted powers of control .
censorship in china is all-pervasive in china .

el mahroug turned 18 on tuesday .
despite newspaper speculation that the issue could bring down berlusconi 's government and lead to early elections , the prime minister said he and his coalition were in it for the long haul .
" you should be completely reassured about the government and about the fact that it 's a government that still has a majority that intends to govern until the end of its term , " he said .
berlusconi has faced down other sex scandals by saying that while he is " no saint , " he has never paid for sex .
his current term of office expires in 2013 .

berlusconi not budging the most recent scandal facing berlusconi involves reports that a teenage girl named karima el mahroug was paid to attend raunchy parties at his villa near milan last year and that he later intervened and obtained her release when she was arrested for theft .
el mahroug turned 18 on tuesday .
despite newspaper speculation that the issue could bring down berlusconi 's government and lead to early elections , the prime minister said he and his coalition were in it for the long haul .
" you should be completely reassured about the government and about the fact that it 's a government that still has a majority that intends to govern until the end of its term , " he said .
berlusconi has faced down other sex scandals by saying that while he is " no saint , " he has never paid for sex .
his current term of office expires in 2013 .

munich is competing against annecy in france , and pyeongchang in south korea .

the guarantees include financial support for the organization of the games and the application of legal regulations in the fight against doping .
the government is set to provide some 500 million euros -lrb- 700 million dollars -rrb- for the games .
the total cost is estimated at 1.3 billion euros .
the government will not contribute to the bid 's marketing costs of 33 million euros , but will step in to help if the organizing committee runs up a deficit .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : katarina witt won gold for east germany in 1984 " i am delighted we have received this wholehearted endorsement from elected representatives at all levels of government , " witt said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de united states -pipe- 03.11.2010 obama concedes defeat in house , pledges to work with republicans großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the balance of power is shifting in the us congress president barack obama admits that he took a beating in the mid-term elections as republicans storm into the house of representatives .
the democrats manage to keep a slim majority in the senate . us republicans won a huge majority in the house of representatives in midterm elections , delivering a blow president barack obama described as a " shellacking . "
" i am not recommending for every future president that they take a shellacking like i did last night , " obama said in a news conference on wednesday .
" i am sure there are easier ways to learn these lessons . "
the conservative republican party gained at least 60 seats in the house of representatives , the biggest shift of congressional power since 1948 and more than enough to win control of the 435-member lower chamber .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : john boehner is set to become the new house speaker the vote toppled democrat nancy pelosi from her position as speaker of the house , leaving ohio republic and house minority leader john boehner ready to fill the position .
speaking as almost all of the polls across the country had closed , boehner pledged to cut government spending .
in a victory rally at the republican party 's headquarters in washington , he said that americans had sent a clear message for obama to " change course . "
" our new majority will be prepared to do things differently , " boehner said .
" it starts with cutting spending instead of increasing it , reducing the size of government instead of increasing it , and reforming the way congress works . "
president obama placed a congratulatory phone call to boehner on tuesday evening , saying he looked forward to working together with boehner to find common ground and move the country forward .
bildunterschrift : environmental legislation on hold however , republican control of the house could lead to legislative gridlock .
obama acknowledged that democratic plans for a " cap-and-trade " system - charging industry for carbon dioxide emissions blamed for global climate change - would have to be put off for at least the next two years .
" it 's doubtful that you could get the votes to pass that through the house this year , or next year , or the year after , " obama said .
" cap and trade was just one way of skinning the cat … it was a means , not an end . "
republicans made gains in the senate , where 37 out of 100 upper house seats were at stake .
with three seats still too close to call on wednesday , democrats took a net loss of 6 seats for 51 , while republicans took 46 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama and the democrats kept hold of the senate democrats were helped by a victory for democratic majority leader harry reid , who won his seat with about 50 percent of the vote .
reid was challenged by sharron angle , backed by the grassroots conservative tea party movement .
democrats were not so lucky in florida , where republican marco rubio became the first tea party-backed candidate to win a senate seat .
but another tea party favorite - controversial senate candidate for delaware , christine o 'donnell - lost her race .
comfortable majority in lower house although much of the debate leading up to the election focused on anxiety about the us economy , the increased number of republican seats in congress may also have foreign policy implications .
spending on development could be blocked in the lower house and republican gains in the senate are likely to make it more difficult for the obama administration to ratify international treaties .
it is thought that the republicans could use their enhanced platform in congress to frustrate aspects of obama 's foreign policy , for instance , by opposing any peace deal in afghanistan that would bring the taliban to the negotiating table .
of the 50 states in the union , 37 also elected a new governor .
california voters elected democrat jerry brown , who served as governor in the 1970s and 80s , replacing austrian-born actor-turned-politician arnold schwarzenegger .
the state also rejected a proposal to decriminalize recreational marijuana .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de united states -pipe- 03.11.2010 obama concedes defeat in house , pledges to work with republicans großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the balance of power is shifting in the us congress president barack obama admits that he took a beating in the mid-term elections as republicans storm into the house of representatives .
the democrats manage to keep a slim majority in the senate . us republicans won a huge majority in the house of representatives in midterm elections , delivering a blow president barack obama described as a " shellacking . "
" i am not recommending for every future president that they take a shellacking like i did last night , " obama said in a news conference on wednesday .
" i am sure there are easier ways to learn these lessons . "
the conservative republican party gained at least 60 seats in the house of representatives , the biggest shift of congressional power since 1948 and more than enough to win control of the 435-member lower chamber .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : john boehner is set to become the new house speaker the vote toppled democrat nancy pelosi from her position as speaker of the house , leaving ohio republic and house minority leader john boehner ready to fill the position .
speaking as almost all of the polls across the country had closed , boehner pledged to cut government spending .
in a victory rally at the republican party 's headquarters in washington , he said that americans had sent a clear message for obama to " change course . "
" our new majority will be prepared to do things differently , " boehner said .
" it starts with cutting spending instead of increasing it , reducing the size of government instead of increasing it , and reforming the way congress works . "
president obama placed a congratulatory phone call to boehner on tuesday evening , saying he looked forward to working together with boehner to find common ground and move the country forward .
bildunterschrift : environmental legislation on hold however , republican control of the house could lead to legislative gridlock .
obama acknowledged that democratic plans for a " cap-and-trade " system - charging industry for carbon dioxide emissions blamed for global climate change - would have to be put off for at least the next two years .
" it 's doubtful that you could get the votes to pass that through the house this year , or next year , or the year after , " obama said .
" cap and trade was just one way of skinning the cat … it was a means , not an end . "
republicans made gains in the senate , where 37 out of 100 upper house seats were at stake .
with three seats still too close to call on wednesday , democrats took a net loss of 6 seats for 51 , while republicans took 46 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama and the democrats kept hold of the senate democrats were helped by a victory for democratic majority leader harry reid , who won his seat with about 50 percent of the vote .
reid was challenged by sharron angle , backed by the grassroots conservative tea party movement .
democrats were not so lucky in florida , where republican marco rubio became the first tea party-backed candidate to win a senate seat .
but another tea party favorite - controversial senate candidate for delaware , christine o 'donnell - lost her race .
comfortable majority in lower house although much of the debate leading up to the election focused on anxiety about the us economy , the increased number of republican seats in congress may also have foreign policy implications .
spending on development could be blocked in the lower house and republican gains in the senate are likely to make it more difficult for the obama administration to ratify international treaties .
it is thought that the republicans could use their enhanced platform in congress to frustrate aspects of obama 's foreign policy , for instance , by opposing any peace deal in afghanistan that would bring the taliban to the negotiating table .
of the 50 states in the union , 37 also elected a new governor .
california voters elected democrat jerry brown , who served as governor in the 1970s and 80s , replacing austrian-born actor-turned-politician arnold schwarzenegger .
the state also rejected a proposal to decriminalize recreational marijuana .

the vote is expected to delay eu-sponsored talks with serbia . voters in kosovo are to go to the polls in snap elections on dec .
12 , after prime minister hashim thaci 's weakened government supported a no-confidence vote in the country 's parliament .
the southern balkan state 's first elections since it declared independence are expected to delay the start of european union-sponsored talks with serbia on improving their bilateral relations dialogue should start " only after new institutions emerging from these polls are constituted , " interim president jakup krasniqi told reporters in pristina .
belgrade has refused to recognize kosovo since the former serbian province unilaterally declared independence in 2008 .
the eu has been trying to get pristina and belgrade to hold direct talks in a bid to normalize relations between the two sides .
preparations for early elections are also expected to delay plans to privatize the state-owned telecoms firm and choose a company to build a badly needed coal-fired power plant this year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : elections may delay key decisions on privatization .
kosovo is the youngest and one of the poorest countries in europe with an unemployment rate of more than 45 percent .
thaci brought down own government the no-confidence motion on tuesday was supported by 64 of the 120 legislators .
it was submitted two weeks after thaci 's coalition fell apart when former president fatmir sejidu pulled his party out of the governing coalition .
sejidu also stepped down as president in mid-october , after the country 's constitutional court ruled that he could not be the leader of a political party and the country 's president at the same time .
interim president jakup krasniqi immediately dissolved parliament and announced the polls , which under kosovo 's constitution , have to be held within 45 days .
thaci 's own deputies voted against the government and he later expressed satisfaction at the outcome of the vote .
" the vote by the members of parliament is a vote for the future of kosovo .
it is a responsible decision that will mark a new beginning for the state of kosovo , " he said .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bomb squads in greece have had their hands full in total , greek police are looking into around 13 packages containing bombs that were addressed to foreign politicians or delivered to foreign embassies in athens .
one package reached the office of german chancellor angela merkel in berlin , but was discovered and diffused without causing damage or injuries .
another package addressed to italian prime minister silvio berlusconi was discovered on a cargo plane flying to paris from athens .
the plane made an emergency landing in bologna , and the package caught fire while being checked by authorities on the ground .
a third package led to the arrest of two suspects on monday .
the two men , aged 22 and 24 , were discovered with a package containing explosives that was addressed to french president nicolas sarkozy .
searching for suspects the swiss , russian , chilean and bulgarian embassies in athens were also among the targets of the letter bombs .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a bomb made it to the german chancellory most of the bombs were destroyed in controlled blasts by police , but there was an explosion at the swiss embassy that resulted in no injuries .
police believe the packages are being sent by far-left militants , who are thought to have carried out small bomb attacks on political and international targets in the past .
in addition to monday 's two arrests , police have released photos of five militants believed to be connected to the parcel bombs .
on tuesday , greek prime minister george papandreou said the suspects were " trying in vain to disrupt social peace in the country with criminal acts . "
tighter controls chancellor merkel was on an official visit to belgium at the time the package was discovered in berlin .
she did say , however , that the recent series of package bombs from greece and yemen indicated a need for stricter controls on freight shipping between the european union , the united states , and around the globe .
" this is urgently about implementing stricter world-wide controls to prevent terror attacks , " merkel said in an interview with the passauer neue presse newspaper .

german politicians are wondering what a divided american government will mean for europe and world politics . german politicians believe tuesday 's congressional elections in the united states will change the landscape of foreign policy .
the elections represent a major threat to us president barack obama 's power at home , as the opposition republicans gained a majority in the congress 's lower house , the house of representatives , and boosted their numbers in the senate .
a bigger role on the world stage ?
the german government 's coordinator for german-american relations , hans-ulrich klose , said wednesday he expected obama to turn his gaze outward in light of new difficulties in domestic politics .
he told national radio station deutschlandradio that the president would now be concentrating more on the mideast conflict .
" i hesitate to speak of a solution to the problems , but it would be good if there were more intelligent conflict management , " klose said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polenz says europe needs to play a bigger role on the world stage the chairman of the bundestag parliament 's foreign affairs committee , ruprecht polenz , also stressed that obama could maintain a strong role in international politics , as the president is only dependent on congress in matters of international diplomacy when it comes to ratifying treaties .
europe to ' step up to the plate . '
however , polenz took a different position from klose 's , positing that conflicts within american politics could weaken the us 's leading position in worldwide diplomacy .
" of course , the us 's role in the world will be judged by its partners according to how strong they are at home .
in that sense , -lsb- obama -rsb- is somewhat weakened , " polenz told deutsche welle .
polenz stressed that germany and europe would have to take a stronger position in global diplomacy if the us were to take a step back , especially in matters such as the mideast conflict , russian-american relations and china 's ascent to the world stage .
" we need solutions to certain conflicts and problems in this world , and if the americans ca n't focus on that as strongly as in the past , then europe will have to do more , " he said , adding , " we do n't have an eternity to answer as many foreign-policy questions as possible with one voice and act accordingly . "
" one message of this election is that we are now being put more to the challenge , " polenz added .
polenz said that europe was not capable of filling the us 's shoes in matters of world politics , but stressed that a more politically divided america needed europe 's support : " it will be important for us to put more effort into our relationship because we need to work together when one partner ca n't carry as much of the burden . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klose says democrats and republicans will have to cooperate more closely one place where europe will have to take on more responsibility , according to rainer stinner , foreign policy spokesperson for germany 's free democrats - the party of foreign minister guido westerwelle - is in the reshaping of the north atlantic treaty organization -lrb- nato -rrb- .
nato is currently forming its new strategic concept .
" if nato members agree that a missile defense shield is necessary , then it will surely need to be financed by all nato partners and can not all be put on the americans ' shoulders , " stinner said .
stalemate or renewed cooperation ?
the big question facing american politics is whether democrats and republicans can work together , or if increased control by the opposition republicans will mean a political stalemate .
polenz believes a standstill would be " fatal " for the us both at home and abroad .
klose and stinner , however , believe the two parties will be forced to work together .
stinner said that , should the republicans continue trying to block all legislation from the democrats , it could backfire against them in the next elections .
" the republicans would do well not to continue a purely oppositional politics , " he said , " but to try to work together with the president so that he ca n't position them as preventing -lsb- progress -rsb- . "

" i must say that the construction of the new space center , commissioned in 2007 , is one of the biggest and most ambitious initiatives in russia today , " he said in a speech earlier this year .
" not only will it confirm russia 's status as a technological leader and boost its potential in science and technology , but , just as importantly , it will allow hundreds , if not thousands , of young specialists to prove themselves , to show their talent , and to make their most ambitious plans come true . "
despite the united states ' re-evaluation of their role in the international space community , american authorities are putting a positive spin on a decreased american presence .
" space is expensive , " said robert navias , a nasa spokesperson , in an interview with deutsche welle .
" it 's hard to get into orbit , it 's very difficult to launch the spacecraft into orbit .
and by doing so together , we do so on a collective basis from an economic and technological standpoint that serves both nations much better than if we tried to do it ourselves . "
he also acknowledged that while russia will be responsible for bring astronauts to the iss , americans still have a lot to do .
" the russians in turn are mutually dependant on us for maintaining station 's operation since nasa has the lead role in mission operations , oversight of the station 's components , and the flight control capability of the station , " he added .
" so through our mutual dependence on one another we have actually built a stronger partnership on a global basis using each other 's expertise to be able to solve problems quickly . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in 2011 , endeavor is scheduled to be the final american space shuttle launch space research becoming more international the us said it planned to look to private companies to invest in future spacecraft .
but so far , no private companies have secured such investment .
meanwhile , the russian federal space agency is set to receive $ 306 million for u.s. astronauts to fly to the international space station in 2012 onboard a russian soyuz rocket .
however , the decision to ground the shuttles raises mixed emotions among us astronauts .
" well , it 's kind of sad that the space shuttle is going to be retired , " said mark kelly , commander of the last scheduled mission of us space shuttle endeavor in february 2011 , in an interview with deutsche welle .
" you know , it 's an incredible vehicle , there 's never been anything like it , that can carry huge payloads , over 30 thousand pounds into orbit , it has an airlock where we could do space walks , it has a robotic arm , we could manipulate payloads , we could capture satellites , we could bring satellites home .
i mean to bring home a payload that weighs 30 thousand pounds is just incredible , no spacecraft could every do that before .
so to see that capability go away is a little bit sad , but it 's been in the plan . "
however , as both moscow and washington are still leading the space race , their dominance could be soon challenged by india and china , which are funding and developing their own space programs .
the chinese shenzhou vii spacecraft is already in operation , and china 's first spacewalk took place in 2008 , and meanwhile , india has announced a manned spaceflight by 2014 .

german politicians are wondering what a divided american government will mean for europe and world politics . german politicians believe tuesday 's congressional elections in the united states will change the landscape of foreign policy .
the elections represent a major threat to us president barack obama 's power at home , as the opposition republicans gained a majority in the congress 's lower house , the house of representatives , and boosted their numbers in the senate .
a bigger role on the world stage ?
the german government 's coordinator for german-american relations , hans-ulrich klose , said wednesday he expected obama to turn his gaze outward in light of new difficulties in domestic politics .
he told national radio station deutschlandradio that the president would now be concentrating more on the mideast conflict .
" i hesitate to speak of a solution to the problems , but it would be good if there were more intelligent conflict management , " klose said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polenz says europe needs to play a bigger role on the world stage the chairman of the bundestag parliament 's foreign affairs committee , ruprecht polenz , also stressed that obama could maintain a strong role in international politics , as the president is only dependent on congress in matters of international diplomacy when it comes to ratifying treaties .
europe to ' step up to the plate . '
however , polenz took a different position from klose 's , positing that conflicts within american politics could weaken the us 's leading position in worldwide diplomacy .
" of course , the us 's role in the world will be judged by its partners according to how strong they are at home .
in that sense , -lsb- obama -rsb- is somewhat weakened , " polenz told deutsche welle .
polenz stressed that germany and europe would have to take a stronger position in global diplomacy if the us were to take a step back , especially in matters such as the mideast conflict , russian-american relations and china 's ascent to the world stage .
" we need solutions to certain conflicts and problems in this world , and if the americans ca n't focus on that as strongly as in the past , then europe will have to do more , " he said , adding , " we do n't have an eternity to answer as many foreign-policy questions as possible with one voice and act accordingly . "
" one message of this election is that we are now being put more to the challenge , " polenz added .
polenz said that europe was not capable of filling the us 's shoes in matters of world politics , but stressed that a more politically divided america needed europe 's support : " it will be important for us to put more effort into our relationship because we need to work together when one partner ca n't carry as much of the burden . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klose says democrats and republicans will have to cooperate more closely one place where europe will have to take on more responsibility , according to rainer stinner , foreign policy spokesperson for germany 's free democrats - the party of foreign minister guido westerwelle - is in the reshaping of the north atlantic treaty organization -lrb- nato -rrb- .
nato is currently forming its new strategic concept .
" if nato members agree that a missile defense shield is necessary , then it will surely need to be financed by all nato partners and can not all be put on the americans ' shoulders , " stinner said .
stalemate or renewed cooperation ?
the big question facing american politics is whether democrats and republicans can work together , or if increased control by the opposition republicans will mean a political stalemate .
polenz believes a standstill would be " fatal " for the us both at home and abroad .
klose and stinner , however , believe the two parties will be forced to work together .
stinner said that , should the republicans continue trying to block all legislation from the democrats , it could backfire against them in the next elections .
" the republicans would do well not to continue a purely oppositional politics , " he said , " but to try to work together with the president so that he ca n't position them as preventing -lsb- progress -rsb- . "

not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content .
would you register a .de domain name with an " ß " in it ?
the following reader responses are from the deutsche welle facebook fan page .
it would be quite annoying for people who do n't have a german keyboard . - alessandro it would be just as annoying as an umlaut .
but if they do n't speak german , why would they visit a german website ? - wolfgang wolfgang , i know several german websites , that have support for several languages or at least english . - gerhard well , i do n't know if i would register a .de website address with " ß . "
it would be pretty annoying for people who do n't understand or can not type german .
besides , i think people who do n't understand german may still go to german websites because some of them provide information in other languages .
by the way , i like " ß , " because it looks very german and also is very cute . - pin-shuan yes !
more original !
and it is a good way to resist the overly complicated “ reform der deutschen rechtschreibung von 1996 . ” - luis yay !
do it !

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de internet -pipe- 03.11.2010 uk privacy authorities say google breached data protection act großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : google first announced the collection of data in may british officials say that google will be audited and must promise not to violate the law again , but will not be fined .
the move comes as canada , spain and , most recently , italy are scrutinizing the california company . in an announcement wednesday , british data protection authorities said there was a " significant breach of the data protection act " and that google uk would be subject to an audit .
further , it added , the company must promise that similar data breaches do not occur again .
the uk authorities had once again taken up the privacy case against google late last month after google had revealed further details that it had obtained " wifi data . "
that data included passwords and e-mails while google was sending cars along british streets and in other countries for its street view service .
earlier this year , the information commissioner 's office -lrb- ico -rrb- had said that it had found " no wrongdoing " on google 's part , but re-opened an investigation last week .
" it is my view that the collection of this information was not fair or lawful and constitutes a significant breach of the first principle of the data protection act , " said christopher graham , the uk information commissioner , in a statement published wednesday on the ico 's website .
" the most appropriate and proportionate regulatory action in these circumstances is to get written legal assurance from google that this will not happen again – and to follow this up with an ico audit . "
the ico elaborated that it had declined to seek monetary damages against the silicon valley company as it would have been too legally difficult to prove .
" monetary penalties can only be served when a strict set of criteria is satisfied , including that the breach was likely to cause substantial harm or substantial distress – this alone would be very hard to prove in this case , " wrote kirsty mccaskill , an ico spokesperson , in a statement provided to deutsche welle .
" the vast majority of the pay-load data was also collected prior to 6 april 2010 , before our new powers came into force . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the vehicles used to create street view inadvertantly collected the data google says google has admitted guilt in a written statement also provided to deutsche welle , peter fleischer , google 's global privacy counsel said that the company had made a mistake .
" we are profoundly sorry for mistakenly collecting payload data in the uk from unencrypted wireless networks , " he wrote .
" since we announced our mistake in may we have cooperated closely with the ico and worked to improve our internal controls .
as we have said before , we did not want this data , have never used any of it in our products or services , and have sought to delete it as quickly as possible .
we are in the process of confirming that there are no outstanding legal obligations upon us to retain the data , and will then ensure that it is quickly and safely deleted . "
previously , as recently as october 22 , google officials have apologized for the mistake and said that it would be changing its policies .
" we are mortified by what happened , but confident that these changes to our processes and structure will significantly improve our internal privacy and security practices for the benefit of all our users , " wrote alan eustace , google 's senior vice president of engineering and research , in a post published on october 22 on google 's public policy blog .
the american federal trade commission decided last week to drop its investigation against google , while in recent weeks , similar government agencies in italy , canada and spain have all pursued action against the company .
the investigations worldwide began earlier this year after german authorities in hamburg discovered the payload data in one of google 's vehicles , and they are continuing to investigate as well .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de press freedom -pipe- 03.11.2010 media suppression , violence against journalists increases in latin america großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : latin america is experiencing a worrying return to censorship press freedom campaigners and journalism associations are increasingly concerned at what many describe as the dawning of a new era of media suppression in a number of latin american countries . while journalists no longer face the threats associated with the institutionalized death squads of the past , a new shadow is being cast over free speech and objective reporting in nations which have long since cast off the yoke of dictatorship . government-controlled censorship and the targeting of journalists by the state security apparatus may be part of many latin american countries ' dark history .
but free speech is still in danger from powerful organized crime syndicates intent on silencing reporters and the disturbing creep of monopolized media industries under the auspices of sovereign leaders . the country generating most concern is mexico , where a total of 68 journalists and media workers have been killed and a further 11 abducted since 2000 .
mexico has become one of the deadliest places in the world for journalists .
the rising power of drug cartels and the mexican government 's violent crackdown on narcotics gangs has turned areas of the country into battlegrounds . journalists there working on stories about the drug war live in constant fear of being kidnapped , tortured and murdered by cartels desperate to silence the media 's reporting on their activities and members .
these alliances are eager to gain control of the airwaves .
the international press freedom organization reporters without borders claims that drug gangs target journalists with impunity , as prosecutions relating to these crimes are very rarely completed . mexican government failing journalists , campaigners claim bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : journalists continue to die while reporting on mexico 's drug war reporters without borders also claims that mexico 's special federal attorney 's office for combating violence against the media has failed to make much of an impression since its creation in 2006 .
the myriad departments dedicated to press freedom in the executive , legislative and judicial branches of government often cancel each other out through passivity or negligence . " the mexican government has done almost nothing to protect journalists , " benoit hervieu , the americas expert at reporters without borders , told deutsche welle .
" the special attorney charged with following up the investigations into crimes against journalists has been given over 500 files , and maybe one percent of them have been looked into .
it is very hard to follow up investigations in mexico . " the mexican government has also been dogged by accusations that certain sectors of the state apparatus have been infiltrated by organized crime gangs .
it is alleged that the authorities are also complicit , if not entirely responsible , for serious human rights violations including the suppression of free speech . " some government officials are involved in the suppression of the media and the violence committed against journalists , so investigations get hindered at an official level , " hervieu said .
" it is very hard to pursue these cases .
plus bureaucracy is terrible in mexico .
it is one of the worst countries in latin america for this . " fear drives journalists to self-censor journalists in mexico are living in such fear that there is a concern that the constant threat to their lives is leading to a form of self-censorship in an attempt to protect themselves . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pressure from cartels force journalists to self-censorship only last week , el diario , a newspaper in the mexican border city of ciudad juárez , appealed directly in a front-page story to the drug cartels which have turned the city into a war zone and who have taken a number of journalists ' lives .
in the article , the paper asked for reporting and censorship guidelines . " gentlemen … please explain to us … what you would like us to publish or stop publishing , " the statement read .
" the last thing we want is for another one of our colleagues to fall victim to your gunshots . " " the cartels are obviously involved and responsible for attacks and media suppression but they also provide the government with a very convenient excuse , " said hervieu .
" it is so easy for the government to blame the cartels .
this is war , and in war confusion is high .
it is therefore easy to say that the enemy is responsible .
but in some of the most dangerous regions of mexico , it is the police and the army which is the most feared . " while mexico is considered the most dangerous place in latin america for press freedom , it is not the only country in the region where journalists ' lives are at risk .
in honduras , eight journalists have been killed so far this year by drug traffickers or in violent struggles with government forces in protests over land reform and the political situation in the country since the government was overthrown in 2009 . " in honduras , the violence came after the coup in 2009 and the attacks on journalists came as revenge for dissent during the unrest , " hervieu said .
" this political violence continues with no investigations .
honduras , along with mexico and colombia , is one of the most dangerous places for journalists in latin america . " democratically-elected leaders building media monopolies elsewhere , the rise of government-backed media monopolies and the election of leaders keen to suppress dissenting voices are having detrimental effects on press freedom in countries such as venezuela , ecuador , argentina and bolivia . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chavez forced a number of media outlets to close down dictatorships may be a thing of the past in most latin america countries , apart from cuba , but leaders like venezuelan president hugo chávez are exercising a level of control similar to that favored by the totalitarian regimes they were elected to replace .
chávez has closed down a television network , 32 radio stations and two local television channels allegedly because they criticized a political ally . rights groups accuse both president rafael correa of ecuador and argentina 's leader cristina fernández of increasing their governments ' grip on media institutions to an unhealthy degree . correa 's regime now controls some 20 media companies in ecuador and has brought in legislation which limits ownership of media outlets and what these outlets can broadcast in certain circumstances .
this legislation was cited during a period of unrest in september when correa ordered all television and radio stations to broadcast only government-supplied information . dismantling powerful opponent in argentina bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fernández has her eye on increasing favorable coverage meanwhile in argentina , fernández is allegedly engaged in a campaign to break up the country 's biggest media conglomerate , the clarín group , after it began broadcasting negative coverage of her and her recently deceased husband and former president néstor kirchner . by applying pressure to some of the group 's most influential contract partners , cancelling the company 's license to provide internet service , and sending tax officials to raid the group 's headquarters , fernández is determined to dismantle a powerful mouthpiece of dissent while increasing government advertising revenue in a bid to replace the clarín group 's negative content with more government-friendly coverage . " clarín , owner of newspapers , radio stations , broadcast and cable television outlets , and an internet service provider , has had an antagonistic relationship with fernandez-kirchner since a 2008 conflict with the farming sector over a tax raise , " according to carlos lauría , senior program coordinator for the americas at the committee to protect journalists -lrb- cpj -rrb- .
he said the government had accused clarín and other private media of biased coverage . " journalists at clarín and national newspaper la nación believe the government is engaged in an intimidating campaign to silence critics , " lauría said . meanwhile both bolivia and nicaragua have passed laws which allow their governments to close media outlets deemed disruptive while allegedly prosecuting and imprisoning critical reporters on trumped up charges such as money laundering . media campaigners have a pessimistic view of the state of press freedom in latin america and while there are efforts being made to turn things around , few have much hope of widespread change . " what is needed is open debate , " said hervieu .
" in argentina and uruguay , there was a debate among teachers and intellectuals about how the media could regain its full freedom .
that 's a start . " however , he said in mexico , it would take a massive institutional reform with the help of the united states to bring about change . " but the situation as a whole is desperate , " hervieu said . author : nick amies editor : sabina casagrande send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de immigration -pipe- 03.11.2010 chancellor wants to expand ' integration courses ' for immigrants großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : around 1.8 million people will attend the courses germany intends to expand the program of courses to help immigrants to integrate .
chancellor merkel pointed to successful examples of integration and said society should put more effort into working with immigrants . by 2015 german chancellor angela merkel wants to give every immigrant the opportunity to take part in integration courses .
the government estimates that by that time around 1.8 million people will have attended the courses since they were first introduced in 2005 .
" we 're catching up in 10 years on what we failed to do in the previous 30 years , " merkel said at the end of an integration summit in berlin on wednesday .
" we want to be more concrete . "
that was the message of german chancellor angela merkel at the berlin integration summit .
she wants to set clear standards to make it easier to assess what germany has achieved , and what is still to be done on the issue of integration .
' multiculturalism has failed ' merkel said the notion that integration could be achieved simply by different living next to one another was outdated .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : politicians , experts and minority groups took part merkel , who said in a speech last month that " multiculturalism has failed , " set out to prove that integration would not happen by itself .
she said that true integration required much more energy and engagement from all of society .
the chancellor praised the atmosphere at the summit as being " the right working environment . "
the 120 participants , including politicians , economists , and representatives of the police and the media apparently exchanged " controversial opinions " with one another .
merkel said they had spoken openly about " what had yet to be achieved . "
for example , she pointed out that there was a lot of work still to do on the issue of violence in schools .
" there 's still a long way to go on this journey , " merkel commented .
the government says it will spend about 400 million euros -lrb- 560 million dollars -rrb- by 2014 on improving german language skills among the children of immigrants so they can perform better at school .
it is also seeking to help immigrants get their foreign qualifications recognised in germany , and to have more people from immigrant backgrounds working in the civil service and in the police force .
success stories there were some impressive examples of successes in immigration policy , merkel said .
she cited sport as an example .
the 2010 german world cup team was the most multicultural ever , with a number of players from turkish and african immigrant families .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and boehmer have drawn up an action plan maria boehmer is the government minister responsible for the issue of integration .
she echoed the chancellor 's words , saying that " a lot of ground had been gained " in the last few years .
she said there were more positive stories of integration " than had been told in the last few weeks . "
germany has been embroiled in a debate about integration since a prominent member of the board of the state bank , the bundesbank , sparked outrage in germany and abroad when he published a book which claimed that muslims themselves were in part responsible for failing to integrate into german society .
he was forced to resign from his post , but the debate simmered on .
boehmer cited a new national action plan , which should make progress in integration easier to follow , and will complement the current national integration plan .
she said that police , care workers and teachers could play a " bridging role " in helping immigrants to integrate .
some participants , however , criticized the lack of real results at the summit .
aydan oezoguz , who is responsible for integration in the opposition spd parliamentary group , called the action plan a " hotch-potch of measures that had already been agreed on . "
the spokesperson on migration policy for the left party , sevim dagdelen , said it was merely a " symbolic summit " that would not change the daily reality for immigrants in germany . ´ the federal statistics office says about 16 million people in germany come from a " migrant background " - just under 20 percent of the population .
of these , an estimated 4 million are muslim , mostly of turkish origin .

but free speech is still in danger from powerful organized crime syndicates intent on silencing reporters and the disturbing creep of monopolized media industries under the auspices of sovereign leaders . the country generating most concern is mexico , where a total of 68 journalists and media workers have been killed and a further 11 abducted since 2000 .
mexico has become one of the deadliest places in the world for journalists .
the rising power of drug cartels and the mexican government 's violent crackdown on narcotics gangs has turned areas of the country into battlegrounds . journalists there working on stories about the drug war live in constant fear of being kidnapped , tortured and murdered by cartels desperate to silence the media 's reporting on their activities and members .
these alliances are eager to gain control of the airwaves .
the international press freedom organization reporters without borders claims that drug gangs target journalists with impunity , as prosecutions relating to these crimes are very rarely completed . mexican government failing journalists , campaigners claim bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : journalists continue to die while reporting on mexico 's drug war reporters without borders also claims that mexico 's special federal attorney 's office for combating violence against the media has failed to make much of an impression since its creation in 2006 .
the myriad departments dedicated to press freedom in the executive , legislative and judicial branches of government often cancel each other out through passivity or negligence . " the mexican government has done almost nothing to protect journalists , " benoit hervieu , the americas expert at reporters without borders , told deutsche welle .
" the special attorney charged with following up the investigations into crimes against journalists has been given over 500 files , and maybe one percent of them have been looked into .
it is very hard to follow up investigations in mexico . " the mexican government has also been dogged by accusations that certain sectors of the state apparatus have been infiltrated by organized crime gangs .
it is alleged that the authorities are also complicit , if not entirely responsible , for serious human rights violations including the suppression of free speech . " some government officials are involved in the suppression of the media and the violence committed against journalists , so investigations get hindered at an official level , " hervieu said .
" it is very hard to pursue these cases .
plus bureaucracy is terrible in mexico .
it is one of the worst countries in latin america for this . " fear drives journalists to self-censor journalists in mexico are living in such fear that there is a concern that the constant threat to their lives is leading to a form of self-censorship in an attempt to protect themselves . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pressure from cartels force journalists to self-censorship only last week , el diario , a newspaper in the mexican border city of ciudad juárez , appealed directly in a front-page story to the drug cartels which have turned the city into a war zone and who have taken a number of journalists ' lives .
in the article , the paper asked for reporting and censorship guidelines . " gentlemen … please explain to us … what you would like us to publish or stop publishing , " the statement read .
" the last thing we want is for another one of our colleagues to fall victim to your gunshots . " " the cartels are obviously involved and responsible for attacks and media suppression but they also provide the government with a very convenient excuse , " said hervieu .
" it is so easy for the government to blame the cartels .
this is war , and in war confusion is high .
it is therefore easy to say that the enemy is responsible .
but in some of the most dangerous regions of mexico , it is the police and the army which is the most feared . " while mexico is considered the most dangerous place in latin america for press freedom , it is not the only country in the region where journalists ' lives are at risk .
in honduras , eight journalists have been killed so far this year by drug traffickers or in violent struggles with government forces in protests over land reform and the political situation in the country since the government was overthrown in 2009 . " in honduras , the violence came after the coup in 2009 and the attacks on journalists came as revenge for dissent during the unrest , " hervieu said .
" this political violence continues with no investigations .
honduras , along with mexico and colombia , is one of the most dangerous places for journalists in latin america . " democratically-elected leaders building media monopolies elsewhere , the rise of government-backed media monopolies and the election of leaders keen to suppress dissenting voices are having detrimental effects on press freedom in countries such as venezuela , ecuador , argentina and bolivia . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chavez forced a number of media outlets to close down dictatorships may be a thing of the past in most latin america countries , apart from cuba , but leaders like venezuelan president hugo chávez are exercising a level of control similar to that favored by the totalitarian regimes they were elected to replace .
chávez has closed down a television network , 32 radio stations and two local television channels allegedly because they criticized a political ally . rights groups accuse both president rafael correa of ecuador and argentina 's leader cristina fernández of increasing their governments ' grip on media institutions to an unhealthy degree . correa 's regime now controls some 20 media companies in ecuador and has brought in legislation which limits ownership of media outlets and what these outlets can broadcast in certain circumstances .
this legislation was cited during a period of unrest in september when correa ordered all television and radio stations to broadcast only government-supplied information . dismantling powerful opponent in argentina bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fernández has her eye on increasing favorable coverage meanwhile in argentina , fernández is allegedly engaged in a campaign to break up the country 's biggest media conglomerate , the clarín group , after it began broadcasting negative coverage of her and her recently deceased husband and former president néstor kirchner . by applying pressure to some of the group 's most influential contract partners , cancelling the company 's license to provide internet service , and sending tax officials to raid the group 's headquarters , fernández is determined to dismantle a powerful mouthpiece of dissent while increasing government advertising revenue in a bid to replace the clarín group 's negative content with more government-friendly coverage .

chancellor merkel pointed to successful examples of integration and said society should put more effort into working with immigrants . by 2015 german chancellor angela merkel wants to give every immigrant the opportunity to take part in integration courses .
the government estimates that by that time around 1.8 million people will have attended the courses since they were first introduced in 2005 .
" we 're catching up in 10 years on what we failed to do in the previous 30 years , " merkel said at the end of an integration summit in berlin on wednesday .
" we want to be more concrete . "
that was the message of german chancellor angela merkel at the berlin integration summit .
she wants to set clear standards to make it easier to assess what germany has achieved , and what is still to be done on the issue of integration .
' multiculturalism has failed ' merkel said the notion that integration could be achieved simply by different living next to one another was outdated .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : politicians , experts and minority groups took part merkel , who said in a speech last month that " multiculturalism has failed , " set out to prove that integration would not happen by itself .
she said that true integration required much more energy and engagement from all of society .
the chancellor praised the atmosphere at the summit as being " the right working environment . "
the 120 participants , including politicians , economists , and representatives of the police and the media apparently exchanged " controversial opinions " with one another .
merkel said they had spoken openly about " what had yet to be achieved . "
for example , she pointed out that there was a lot of work still to do on the issue of violence in schools .
" there 's still a long way to go on this journey , " merkel commented .
the government says it will spend about 400 million euros -lrb- 560 million dollars -rrb- by 2014 on improving german language skills among the children of immigrants so they can perform better at school .
it is also seeking to help immigrants get their foreign qualifications recognised in germany , and to have more people from immigrant backgrounds working in the civil service and in the police force .
success stories there were some impressive examples of successes in immigration policy , merkel said .
she cited sport as an example .
the 2010 german world cup team was the most multicultural ever , with a number of players from turkish and african immigrant families .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and boehmer have drawn up an action plan maria boehmer is the government minister responsible for the issue of integration .
she echoed the chancellor 's words , saying that " a lot of ground had been gained " in the last few years .
she said there were more positive stories of integration " than had been told in the last few weeks . "
germany has been embroiled in a debate about integration since a prominent member of the board of the state bank , the bundesbank , sparked outrage in germany and abroad when he published a book which claimed that muslims themselves were in part responsible for failing to integrate into german society .
he was forced to resign from his post , but the debate simmered on .
boehmer cited a new national action plan , which should make progress in integration easier to follow , and will complement the current national integration plan .
she said that police , care workers and teachers could play a " bridging role " in helping immigrants to integrate .
some participants , however , criticized the lack of real results at the summit .
aydan oezoguz , who is responsible for integration in the opposition spd parliamentary group , called the action plan a " hotch-potch of measures that had already been agreed on . "
the spokesperson on migration policy for the left party , sevim dagdelen , said it was merely a " symbolic summit " that would not change the daily reality for immigrants in germany . ´ the federal statistics office says about 16 million people in germany come from a " migrant background " - just under 20 percent of the population .
of these , an estimated 4 million are muslim , mostly of turkish origin .

the move comes as canada , spain and , most recently , italy are scrutinizing the california company . in an announcement wednesday , british data protection authorities said there was a " significant breach of the data protection act " and that google uk would be subject to an audit .
further , it added , the company must promise that similar data breaches do not occur again .
the uk authorities had once again taken up the privacy case against google late last month after google had revealed further details that it had obtained " wifi data . "
that data included passwords and e-mails while google was sending cars along british streets and in other countries for its street view service .
earlier this year , the information commissioner 's office -lrb- ico -rrb- had said that it had found " no wrongdoing " on google 's part , but re-opened an investigation last week .
" it is my view that the collection of this information was not fair or lawful and constitutes a significant breach of the first principle of the data protection act , " said christopher graham , the uk information commissioner , in a statement published wednesday on the ico 's website .
" the most appropriate and proportionate regulatory action in these circumstances is to get written legal assurance from google that this will not happen again – and to follow this up with an ico audit . "
the ico elaborated that it had declined to seek monetary damages against the silicon valley company as it would have been too legally difficult to prove .
" monetary penalties can only be served when a strict set of criteria is satisfied , including that the breach was likely to cause substantial harm or substantial distress – this alone would be very hard to prove in this case , " wrote kirsty mccaskill , an ico spokesperson , in a statement provided to deutsche welle .

as we have said before , we did not want this data , have never used any of it in our products or services , and have sought to delete it as quickly as possible .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de research -pipe- 03.11.2010 scientists assert finger length and sexual promiscuity linked in human ancestors großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neanderthals are believed to have had more sexual partners in an anthropological study , british researchers found that neanderthals may have had more sexual partners .
scientists still do not know when ancient primates began to migrate from being more to less promiscuous . although neanderthals have not lived in europe for 30,000 years , they continue to fascinate scientists around the world .
a new study from the united kingdom suggests that neanderthals had more partners than modern humans .
they reached this conclusion by comparing the ratio of different finger lengths that allow scientists to determine some kinds of behavior , including sexual promiscuity .
emma nelson , a doctoral student at the university of liverpool , had shown in previous research that high levels of in-utero androgens increase the length of the fourth , or ring , finger when compared to the second , or index finger .
the team found that a low ratio indicates higher levels of competitiveness , aggressiveness and more sexual partners , while a high ratio indicates more monogamy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neanderthals had a index-to-ring finger ratio of 0.928 , which is less than modern humans comparisons amongst four species in a paper published today in the british journal proceedings of the royal society b , the team compared the finger-length ratios amongst various ancient hominin species , including ardipithecus ramidus , a hominid who lived around 4.4 million years ago ; australopithecus afarensis , which lived around three to four million years ago ; neanderthals , who disappeared around 28,000 years ago ; and early humans dating back to 95,000 years ago .
" it is believed that prenatal androgens affect the genes responsible for the development of fingers , toes and the reproductive system , " said nelson in a statement .
" we have recently shown that promiscuous primate species have low index to ring finger ratios , while monogamous species have high ratios .
we used this information to estimate the social behavior of extinct apes and hominins .
although the fossil record is limited for this period , and more fossils are needed to confirm our findings , this method could prove to be an exciting new way of understanding how our social behavior has evolved . "
the study found that modern humans have an average of a 0.957 index-to-ring finger ratio , and are generally a more monogamous species , while chimps ' , gorillas ' and orangutans ' average ratio is at 0.91 , and are generally more promiscuous .
the researchers also found that an early modern human found in an israeli cave , dating back to approximately 95,000 years ago , had a ratio of 0.935 , which would be more promiscuous than modern humans as well .
neanderthals , meanwhile , had a ratio of 0.928 .
further study needed in an interview with the agence france presse , nelson added that the research team would like to be able to confirm their findings through other means .
anthropologists still do not agree when or why humans and their ancestors began to migrate from a more promiscuous mating system to a more monogamous one , given that the former group would hold an evolutionary advantage in terms of being able to spread their genes more quickly and more widely .
" pair-bonding , in a broad sense , is universal among humans , but it is not known when the transition from a promiscuous mating system to a stable bonded one occurred , " wrote the scientists in their scientific paper .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the findings could reveal more about mating practices amongst our ancestors disagreement amongst anthropologists however , not all scientists agree with these findings .
in an interview with the american news website , msnbc.com , another anthropologist who was not part of the study said that this correlation of finger ratios is not a " good predictor of any social behaviors . "
" in addition to the problem of using a poor predictor , this study has another problem that we often face with fossils - there are very few of them , and it 's not obvious which sample of living primates we should be comparing with them , " said john hawks , an anthropology professor at the university of wisconsin , madison .

not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content .
would you register a .de domain name with an " ß " in it ?
the following reader responses are from the deutsche welle facebook fan page .
it would be quite annoying for people who do n't have a german keyboard . - alessandro it would be just as annoying as an umlaut .
but if they do n't speak german , why would they visit a german website ? - wolfgang wolfgang , i know several german websites , that have support for several languages or at least english . - gerhard well , i do n't know if i would register a .de website address with " ß . "
it would be pretty annoying for people who do n't understand or can not type german .
besides , i think people who do n't understand german may still go to german websites because some of them provide information in other languages .
by the way , i like " ß , " because it looks very german and also is very cute . - pin-shuan yes !
more original !
and it is a good way to resist the overly complicated “ reform der deutschen rechtschreibung von 1996 . ” - luis yay !
do it !
save german language and culture !
to those of you who complain about the keyboard , do some research , you can use " hot keys " to make foreign characters . - kadesh exactly kadesh .
there are some really simple number pad commands that will insert german characters -lrb- and many other symbols as well -rrb- . - chris alas , that character does n't exist on my keyboard !
how will i type it into the browser ? - judith where does one find these number pad commands ? - lyle it would be nice to allow ' ss ' or ' sz ' to do the same job on non-german keyboards . - claudio http : / / tlt.its.psu.edu / suggestions / international / accents / codeint.html sorry , i should have added this earlier ... ßßß - kadesh when you use the codes or special keys for the special letters does the computer recognize font differences ? - michelle i tried also alt + 0223 according to my character map but it simply does n't work , at least in facebook . - claudio using the ß in your url would be a really good way to ensure that no one outside of germany ever visited it , except perhaps via links from somewhere else .
not a good idea . - tanya i do n't think i would .
for me , the coolest thing about the web is the ability to bring people together .
using a character which is only found on keyboards in two countries -lrb- germany and austria - the german-speaking swiss stopped using the ß years ago -rrb- would be more divisive than inclusive .
but do n't get me wrong , i 'm not in favor of a “ super language ” that should take over the world .
german should stay german !
but on the international level , there should be a level playing field for the internet .
i 'm just saying . - patrick i do n't like it .

the move comes as canada , spain and , most recently , italy are scrutinizing the california company . in an announcement wednesday , british data protection authorities said there was a " significant breach of the data protection act " and that google uk would be subject to an audit .
further , it added , the company must promise that similar data breaches do not occur again .
the uk authorities had once again taken up the privacy case against google late last month after google had revealed further details that it had obtained " wifi data . "
that data included passwords and e-mails while google was sending cars along british streets and in other countries for its street view service .
earlier this year , the information commissioner 's office -lrb- ico -rrb- had said that it had found " no wrongdoing " on google 's part , but re-opened an investigation last week .
" it is my view that the collection of this information was not fair or lawful and constitutes a significant breach of the first principle of the data protection act , " said christopher graham , the uk information commissioner , in a statement published wednesday on the ico 's website .
" the most appropriate and proportionate regulatory action in these circumstances is to get written legal assurance from google that this will not happen again – and to follow this up with an ico audit . "
the ico elaborated that it had declined to seek monetary damages against the silicon valley company as it would have been too legally difficult to prove .
" monetary penalties can only be served when a strict set of criteria is satisfied , including that the breach was likely to cause substantial harm or substantial distress – this alone would be very hard to prove in this case , " wrote kirsty mccaskill , an ico spokesperson , in a statement provided to deutsche welle .
" the vast majority of the pay-load data was also collected prior to 6 april 2010 , before our new powers came into force . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the vehicles used to create street view inadvertantly collected the data google says google has admitted guilt in a written statement also provided to deutsche welle , peter fleischer , google 's global privacy counsel said that the company had made a mistake .
" we are profoundly sorry for mistakenly collecting payload data in the uk from unencrypted wireless networks , " he wrote .
" since we announced our mistake in may we have cooperated closely with the ico and worked to improve our internal controls .
as we have said before , we did not want this data , have never used any of it in our products or services , and have sought to delete it as quickly as possible .
we are in the process of confirming that there are no outstanding legal obligations upon us to retain the data , and will then ensure that it is quickly and safely deleted . "
previously , as recently as october 22 , google officials have apologized for the mistake and said that it would be changing its policies .
" we are mortified by what happened , but confident that these changes to our processes and structure will significantly improve our internal privacy and security practices for the benefit of all our users , " wrote alan eustace , google 's senior vice president of engineering and research , in a post published on october 22 on google 's public policy blog .
the american federal trade commission decided last week to drop its investigation against google , while in recent weeks , similar government agencies in italy , canada and spain have all pursued action against the company .
the investigations worldwide began earlier this year after german authorities in hamburg discovered the payload data in one of google 's vehicles , and they are continuing to investigate as well .

german politicians are wondering what a divided american government will mean for europe and world politics . german politicians believe tuesday 's congressional elections in the united states will change the landscape of foreign policy .
the elections represent a major threat to us president barack obama 's power at home , as the opposition republicans gained a majority in the congress 's lower house , the house of representatives , and boosted their numbers in the senate .
a bigger role on the world stage ?
the german government 's coordinator for german-american relations , hans-ulrich klose , said wednesday he expected obama to turn his gaze outward in light of new difficulties in domestic politics .
he told national radio station deutschlandradio that the president would now be concentrating more on the mideast conflict .
" i hesitate to speak of a solution to the problems , but it would be good if there were more intelligent conflict management , " klose said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polenz says europe needs to play a bigger role on the world stage the chairman of the bundestag parliament 's foreign affairs committee , ruprecht polenz , also stressed that obama could maintain a strong role in international politics , as the president is only dependent on congress in matters of international diplomacy when it comes to ratifying treaties .
europe to ' step up to the plate . '
however , polenz took a different position from klose 's , positing that conflicts within american politics could weaken the us 's leading position in worldwide diplomacy .
" of course , the us 's role in the world will be judged by its partners according to how strong they are at home .
in that sense , -lsb- obama -rsb- is somewhat weakened , " polenz told deutsche welle .
polenz stressed that germany and europe would have to take a stronger position in global diplomacy if the us were to take a step back , especially in matters such as the mideast conflict , russian-american relations and china 's ascent to the world stage .
" we need solutions to certain conflicts and problems in this world , and if the americans ca n't focus on that as strongly as in the past , then europe will have to do more , " he said , adding , " we do n't have an eternity to answer as many foreign-policy questions as possible with one voice and act accordingly . "
" one message of this election is that we are now being put more to the challenge , " polenz added .
polenz said that europe was not capable of filling the us 's shoes in matters of world politics , but stressed that a more politically divided america needed europe 's support : " it will be important for us to put more effort into our relationship because we need to work together when one partner ca n't carry as much of the burden . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klose says democrats and republicans will have to cooperate more closely one place where europe will have to take on more responsibility , according to rainer stinner , foreign policy spokesperson for germany 's free democrats - the party of foreign minister guido westerwelle - is in the reshaping of the north atlantic treaty organization -lrb- nato -rrb- .
nato is currently forming its new strategic concept .
" if nato members agree that a missile defense shield is necessary , then it will surely need to be financed by all nato partners and can not all be put on the americans ' shoulders , " stinner said .
stalemate or renewed cooperation ?
the big question facing american politics is whether democrats and republicans can work together , or if increased control by the opposition republicans will mean a political stalemate .
polenz believes a standstill would be " fatal " for the us both at home and abroad .
klose and stinner , however , believe the two parties will be forced to work together .
stinner said that , should the republicans continue trying to block all legislation from the democrats , it could backfire against them in the next elections .
" the republicans would do well not to continue a purely oppositional politics , " he said , " but to try to work together with the president so that he ca n't position them as preventing -lsb- progress -rsb- . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de immigration -pipe- 03.11.2010 chancellor wants to expand ' integration courses ' for immigrants großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : around 1.8 million people will attend the courses germany intends to expand the program of courses to help immigrants to integrate .
chancellor merkel pointed to successful examples of integration and said society should put more effort into working with immigrants . by 2015 german chancellor angela merkel wants to give every immigrant the opportunity to take part in integration courses .
the government estimates that by that time around 1.8 million people will have attended the courses since they were first introduced in 2005 .
" we 're catching up in 10 years on what we failed to do in the previous 30 years , " merkel said at the end of an integration summit in berlin on wednesday .
" we want to be more concrete . "
that was the message of german chancellor angela merkel at the berlin integration summit .
she wants to set clear standards to make it easier to assess what germany has achieved , and what is still to be done on the issue of integration .
' multiculturalism has failed ' merkel said the notion that integration could be achieved simply by different living next to one another was outdated .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : politicians , experts and minority groups took part merkel , who said in a speech last month that " multiculturalism has failed , " set out to prove that integration would not happen by itself .
she said that true integration required much more energy and engagement from all of society .
the chancellor praised the atmosphere at the summit as being " the right working environment . "
the 120 participants , including politicians , economists , and representatives of the police and the media apparently exchanged " controversial opinions " with one another .
merkel said they had spoken openly about " what had yet to be achieved . "
for example , she pointed out that there was a lot of work still to do on the issue of violence in schools .
" there 's still a long way to go on this journey , " merkel commented .
the government says it will spend about 400 million euros -lrb- 560 million dollars -rrb- by 2014 on improving german language skills among the children of immigrants so they can perform better at school .
it is also seeking to help immigrants get their foreign qualifications recognised in germany , and to have more people from immigrant backgrounds working in the civil service and in the police force .
success stories there were some impressive examples of successes in immigration policy , merkel said .
she cited sport as an example .
the 2010 german world cup team was the most multicultural ever , with a number of players from turkish and african immigrant families .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and boehmer have drawn up an action plan maria boehmer is the government minister responsible for the issue of integration .
she echoed the chancellor 's words , saying that " a lot of ground had been gained " in the last few years .
she said there were more positive stories of integration " than had been told in the last few weeks . "
germany has been embroiled in a debate about integration since a prominent member of the board of the state bank , the bundesbank , sparked outrage in germany and abroad when he published a book which claimed that muslims themselves were in part responsible for failing to integrate into german society .
he was forced to resign from his post , but the debate simmered on .
boehmer cited a new national action plan , which should make progress in integration easier to follow , and will complement the current national integration plan .
she said that police , care workers and teachers could play a " bridging role " in helping immigrants to integrate .
some participants , however , criticized the lack of real results at the summit .
aydan oezoguz , who is responsible for integration in the opposition spd parliamentary group , called the action plan a " hotch-potch of measures that had already been agreed on . "
the spokesperson on migration policy for the left party , sevim dagdelen , said it was merely a " symbolic summit " that would not change the daily reality for immigrants in germany . ´ the federal statistics office says about 16 million people in germany come from a " migrant background " - just under 20 percent of the population .
of these , an estimated 4 million are muslim , mostly of turkish origin .

not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content .
would you register a .de domain name with an " ß " in it ?
the following reader responses are from the deutsche welle facebook fan page .
it would be quite annoying for people who do n't have a german keyboard . - alessandro it would be just as annoying as an umlaut .
but if they do n't speak german , why would they visit a german website ? - wolfgang wolfgang , i know several german websites , that have support for several languages or at least english . - gerhard well , i do n't know if i would register a .de website address with " ß . "
it would be pretty annoying for people who do n't understand or can not type german .
besides , i think people who do n't understand german may still go to german websites because some of them provide information in other languages .
by the way , i like " ß , " because it looks very german and also is very cute . - pin-shuan yes !
more original !
and it is a good way to resist the overly complicated “ reform der deutschen rechtschreibung von 1996 . ” - luis yay !
do it !
save german language and culture !
to those of you who complain about the keyboard , do some research , you can use " hot keys " to make foreign characters . - kadesh exactly kadesh .
there are some really simple number pad commands that will insert german characters -lrb- and many other symbols as well -rrb- . - chris alas , that character does n't exist on my keyboard !
how will i type it into the browser ? - judith where does one find these number pad commands ? - lyle it would be nice to allow ' ss ' or ' sz ' to do the same job on non-german keyboards . - claudio http : / / tlt.its.psu.edu / suggestions / international / accents / codeint.html sorry , i should have added this earlier ... ßßß - kadesh when you use the codes or special keys for the special letters does the computer recognize font differences ? - michelle i tried also alt + 0223 according to my character map but it simply does n't work , at least in facebook . - claudio using the ß in your url would be a really good way to ensure that no one outside of germany ever visited it , except perhaps via links from somewhere else .
not a good idea . - tanya i do n't think i would .
for me , the coolest thing about the web is the ability to bring people together .
using a character which is only found on keyboards in two countries -lrb- germany and austria - the german-speaking swiss stopped using the ß years ago -rrb- would be more divisive than inclusive .
but do n't get me wrong , i 'm not in favor of a “ super language ” that should take over the world .
german should stay german !
but on the international level , there should be a level playing field for the internet .
i 'm just saying . - patrick i do n't like it .
i wo n't be able to type some german and austrian web addresses ! - alberto sure why not ?
just press alt 225 and there you go - ß .
but i must admit , not everyone 's going to like it with all these special keyboard codes , especially the non-germanic countries . - kristin compiled by stuart tiffen editor : michael lawton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ? 9799 media center watch and listen explore new content daily in dw 's multimedia archive .

barack obama has to now own up to his faults and react , says dw 's washington correspondent christina bergmann . it was the anticipated slap in the face for the us president .
barack obama had tried to do everything right and everything at the same time .
now , he has to realize that he blew it with all sides in the process .
the conservatives were seething above all from the health reform , which they view as an unacceptable government intrusion into their lives .
but obama failed to dominate the debate in time .
now , he has to recognize that it 's not enough to do good deeds .
you also have to talk about them .
even faithful supporters accuse him of failing to set his priorities right .
they say he should have dealt with the economy instead of the health reform .
as a matter of fact , obama did do so right at the beginning of his term .
but the administration too quickly assumed that economic activity would pick up again .
the economic crisis in europe threw a monkey wrench in these plans - and unemployment figures in the us increased .
the president recognized too late that when citizens are hard up , they always point their finger at the white house .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christina bergmann is dw 's washington correspondent obama also alienated many supporters in his voter base , for example through his inconsistent back and forth about military guidelines forbidding homosexuals from serving openly in the military .
during his campaign , obama had pledged to do away with this practice .
he could n't fulfill this promise just as little as he could his vow to close guantanamo within one year 's time .
but above all , barack obama underestimated one thing : voters all across the country still do n't think much of " washington . "
two years ago , obama was able to benefit from this attitude .
he promised to change politics in the capital .
but he has not accomplished that .
the rift between the democrats and the republicans is deeper than it ever was .
it 's high time to redeem this pledge of bipartisanship .
it makes just as little sense to always blame the republicans - who indeed were mainly experts in saying " no " - as it does to constantly point the finger at his predecessor .
it 's true : george w. bush did drive the country into a crisis .
but that is in the past .
washington is now personified by barack obama as he found out bitterly on this election day .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de space -pipe- 03.11.2010 russian space program on the rise großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : humans have been living aboard the iss for 10 years a decade after continuous human habitation on the international space station , russia takes the lead , and will be responsible for ferrying astronauts to the station .
meanwhile , china and india are also coming up . this week marks the 10th anniversary of continuous human habitation aboard the international space station .
despite the 16 countries that have collectively spent over $ 100 billion over the past decade , the station 's construction is still not complete .
next year , when the the project is expected to be finally completed , the international space community will have to exclusively rely on the russian space program to ferry astronauts to and from the station , as nasa is expected to launch one of its final space shuttle missions later this week .
that may bring a new level of prestige for the russian space program , which in 2011 will also celebrate its 50th anniversary of the launch of the first man into space , yuri gagarin .
russian cosmodrome slated to open in 2015 the russian space industry , which had become a shadow of itself after the collapse of the soviet union , is once again enjoying state support .
the government has increased spending on the space industry by 40 percent for each of the past five years .
in 2009 , it received a record $ 2.8 billion .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia will celebrate the 50th anniversary of soviet cosmonaut yuri gagarin 's space flight in 2011 russian prime minister vladimir putin also confirmed this fall that russia 's new $ 800 million vostochny cosmodorome in the country 's far east should be up and running by 2015 .
" i must say that the construction of the new space center , commissioned in 2007 , is one of the biggest and most ambitious initiatives in russia today , " he said in a speech earlier this year .
" not only will it confirm russia 's status as a technological leader and boost its potential in science and technology , but , just as importantly , it will allow hundreds , if not thousands , of young specialists to prove themselves , to show their talent , and to make their most ambitious plans come true . "
despite the united states ' re-evaluation of their role in the international space community , american authorities are putting a positive spin on a decreased american presence .
" space is expensive , " said robert navias , a nasa spokesperson , in an interview with deutsche welle .
" it 's hard to get into orbit , it 's very difficult to launch the spacecraft into orbit .
and by doing so together , we do so on a collective basis from an economic and technological standpoint that serves both nations much better than if we tried to do it ourselves . "
he also acknowledged that while russia will be responsible for bring astronauts to the iss , americans still have a lot to do .
" the russians in turn are mutually dependant on us for maintaining station 's operation since nasa has the lead role in mission operations , oversight of the station 's components , and the flight control capability of the station , " he added .
" so through our mutual dependence on one another we have actually built a stronger partnership on a global basis using each other 's expertise to be able to solve problems quickly . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in 2011 , endeavor is scheduled to be the final american space shuttle launch space research becoming more international the us said it planned to look to private companies to invest in future spacecraft .
but so far , no private companies have secured such investment .
meanwhile , the russian federal space agency is set to receive $ 306 million for u.s. astronauts to fly to the international space station in 2012 onboard a russian soyuz rocket .
however , the decision to ground the shuttles raises mixed emotions among us astronauts .
" well , it 's kind of sad that the space shuttle is going to be retired , " said mark kelly , commander of the last scheduled mission of us space shuttle endeavor in february 2011 , in an interview with deutsche welle .
" you know , it 's an incredible vehicle , there 's never been anything like it , that can carry huge payloads , over 30 thousand pounds into orbit , it has an airlock where we could do space walks , it has a robotic arm , we could manipulate payloads , we could capture satellites , we could bring satellites home .
i mean to bring home a payload that weighs 30 thousand pounds is just incredible , no spacecraft could every do that before .
so to see that capability go away is a little bit sad , but it 's been in the plan . "
however , as both moscow and washington are still leading the space race , their dominance could be soon challenged by india and china , which are funding and developing their own space programs .
the chinese shenzhou vii spacecraft is already in operation , and china 's first spacewalk took place in 2008 , and meanwhile , india has announced a manned spaceflight by 2014 .

the move comes as canada , spain and , most recently , italy are scrutinizing the california company . in an announcement wednesday , british data protection authorities said there was a " significant breach of the data protection act " and that google uk would be subject to an audit .
further , it added , the company must promise that similar data breaches do not occur again .
the uk authorities had once again taken up the privacy case against google late last month after google had revealed further details that it had obtained " wifi data . "
that data included passwords and e-mails while google was sending cars along british streets and in other countries for its street view service .
earlier this year , the information commissioner 's office -lrb- ico -rrb- had said that it had found " no wrongdoing " on google 's part , but re-opened an investigation last week .
" it is my view that the collection of this information was not fair or lawful and constitutes a significant breach of the first principle of the data protection act , " said christopher graham , the uk information commissioner , in a statement published wednesday on the ico 's website .
" the most appropriate and proportionate regulatory action in these circumstances is to get written legal assurance from google that this will not happen again – and to follow this up with an ico audit . "
the ico elaborated that it had declined to seek monetary damages against the silicon valley company as it would have been too legally difficult to prove .
" monetary penalties can only be served when a strict set of criteria is satisfied , including that the breach was likely to cause substantial harm or substantial distress – this alone would be very hard to prove in this case , " wrote kirsty mccaskill , an ico spokesperson , in a statement provided to deutsche welle .

as we have said before , we did not want this data , have never used any of it in our products or services , and have sought to delete it as quickly as possible .
we are in the process of confirming that there are no outstanding legal obligations upon us to retain the data , and will then ensure that it is quickly and safely deleted . "

the american federal trade commission decided last week to drop its investigation against google , while in recent weeks , similar government agencies in italy , canada and spain have all pursued action against the company .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de immigration -pipe- 03.11.2010 chancellor wants to expand ' integration courses ' for immigrants großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : around 1.8 million people will attend the courses germany intends to expand the program of courses to help immigrants to integrate .
chancellor merkel pointed to successful examples of integration and said society should put more effort into working with immigrants . by 2015 german chancellor angela merkel wants to give every immigrant the opportunity to take part in integration courses .
the government estimates that by that time around 1.8 million people will have attended the courses since they were first introduced in 2005 .
" we 're catching up in 10 years on what we failed to do in the previous 30 years , " merkel said at the end of an integration summit in berlin on wednesday .
" we want to be more concrete . "
that was the message of german chancellor angela merkel at the berlin integration summit .
she wants to set clear standards to make it easier to assess what germany has achieved , and what is still to be done on the issue of integration .
' multiculturalism has failed ' merkel said the notion that integration could be achieved simply by different living next to one another was outdated .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : politicians , experts and minority groups took part merkel , who said in a speech last month that " multiculturalism has failed , " set out to prove that integration would not happen by itself .
she said that true integration required much more energy and engagement from all of society .
the chancellor praised the atmosphere at the summit as being " the right working environment . "
the 120 participants , including politicians , economists , and representatives of the police and the media apparently exchanged " controversial opinions " with one another .
merkel said they had spoken openly about " what had yet to be achieved . "
for example , she pointed out that there was a lot of work still to do on the issue of violence in schools .
" there 's still a long way to go on this journey , " merkel commented .
the government says it will spend about 400 million euros -lrb- 560 million dollars -rrb- by 2014 on improving german language skills among the children of immigrants so they can perform better at school .
it is also seeking to help immigrants get their foreign qualifications recognised in germany , and to have more people from immigrant backgrounds working in the civil service and in the police force .
success stories there were some impressive examples of successes in immigration policy , merkel said .
she cited sport as an example .
the 2010 german world cup team was the most multicultural ever , with a number of players from turkish and african immigrant families .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and boehmer have drawn up an action plan maria boehmer is the government minister responsible for the issue of integration .
she echoed the chancellor 's words , saying that " a lot of ground had been gained " in the last few years .
she said there were more positive stories of integration " than had been told in the last few weeks . "
germany has been embroiled in a debate about integration since a prominent member of the board of the state bank , the bundesbank , sparked outrage in germany and abroad when he published a book which claimed that muslims themselves were in part responsible for failing to integrate into german society .
he was forced to resign from his post , but the debate simmered on .
boehmer cited a new national action plan , which should make progress in integration easier to follow , and will complement the current national integration plan .
she said that police , care workers and teachers could play a " bridging role " in helping immigrants to integrate .
some participants , however , criticized the lack of real results at the summit .
aydan oezoguz , who is responsible for integration in the opposition spd parliamentary group , called the action plan a " hotch-potch of measures that had already been agreed on . "
the spokesperson on migration policy for the left party , sevim dagdelen , said it was merely a " symbolic summit " that would not change the daily reality for immigrants in germany . ´ the federal statistics office says about 16 million people in germany come from a " migrant background " - just under 20 percent of the population .
of these , an estimated 4 million are muslim , mostly of turkish origin .

the government estimates that by that time around 1.8 million people will have attended the courses since they were first introduced in 2005 .
" we 're catching up in 10 years on what we failed to do in the previous 30 years , " merkel said at the end of an integration summit in berlin on wednesday .
" we want to be more concrete . "
that was the message of german chancellor angela merkel at the berlin integration summit .
she wants to set clear standards to make it easier to assess what germany has achieved , and what is still to be done on the issue of integration .
' multiculturalism has failed ' merkel said the notion that integration could be achieved simply by different living next to one another was outdated .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : politicians , experts and minority groups took part merkel , who said in a speech last month that " multiculturalism has failed , " set out to prove that integration would not happen by itself .
she said that true integration required much more energy and engagement from all of society .
the chancellor praised the atmosphere at the summit as being " the right working environment . "
the 120 participants , including politicians , economists , and representatives of the police and the media apparently exchanged " controversial opinions " with one another .
merkel said they had spoken openly about " what had yet to be achieved . "
for example , she pointed out that there was a lot of work still to do on the issue of violence in schools .
" there 's still a long way to go on this journey , " merkel commented .
the government says it will spend about 400 million euros -lrb- 560 million dollars -rrb- by 2014 on improving german language skills among the children of immigrants so they can perform better at school .
it is also seeking to help immigrants get their foreign qualifications recognised in germany , and to have more people from immigrant backgrounds working in the civil service and in the police force .
success stories there were some impressive examples of successes in immigration policy , merkel said .
she cited sport as an example .
the 2010 german world cup team was the most multicultural ever , with a number of players from turkish and african immigrant families .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and boehmer have drawn up an action plan maria boehmer is the government minister responsible for the issue of integration .
she echoed the chancellor 's words , saying that " a lot of ground had been gained " in the last few years .
she said there were more positive stories of integration " than had been told in the last few weeks . "
germany has been embroiled in a debate about integration since a prominent member of the board of the state bank , the bundesbank , sparked outrage in germany and abroad when he published a book which claimed that muslims themselves were in part responsible for failing to integrate into german society .
he was forced to resign from his post , but the debate simmered on .
boehmer cited a new national action plan , which should make progress in integration easier to follow , and will complement the current national integration plan .
she said that police , care workers and teachers could play a " bridging role " in helping immigrants to integrate .
some participants , however , criticized the lack of real results at the summit .
aydan oezoguz , who is responsible for integration in the opposition spd parliamentary group , called the action plan a " hotch-potch of measures that had already been agreed on . "
the spokesperson on migration policy for the left party , sevim dagdelen , said it was merely a " symbolic summit " that would not change the daily reality for immigrants in germany . ´ the federal statistics office says about 16 million people in germany come from a " migrant background " - just under 20 percent of the population .
of these , an estimated 4 million are muslim , mostly of turkish origin .

but if they do n't speak german , why would they visit a german website ? - wolfgang wolfgang , i know several german websites , that have support for several languages or at least english . - gerhard well , i do n't know if i would register a .de website address with " ß . "
it would be pretty annoying for people who do n't understand or can not type german .
besides , i think people who do n't understand german may still go to german websites because some of them provide information in other languages .
by the way , i like " ß , " because it looks very german and also is very cute . - pin-shuan yes !
more original !
and it is a good way to resist the overly complicated “ reform der deutschen rechtschreibung von 1996 . ” - luis yay !
do it !
save german language and culture !
to those of you who complain about the keyboard , do some research , you can use " hot keys " to make foreign characters . - kadesh exactly kadesh .
there are some really simple number pad commands that will insert german characters -lrb- and many other symbols as well -rrb- . - chris alas , that character does n't exist on my keyboard !
how will i type it into the browser ? - judith where does one find these number pad commands ? - lyle it would be nice to allow ' ss ' or ' sz ' to do the same job on non-german keyboards . - claudio http : / / tlt.its.psu.edu / suggestions / international / accents / codeint.html sorry , i should have added this earlier ... ßßß - kadesh when you use the codes or special keys for the special letters does the computer recognize font differences ? - michelle i tried also alt + 0223 according to my character map but it simply does n't work , at least in facebook . - claudio using the ß in your url would be a really good way to ensure that no one outside of germany ever visited it , except perhaps via links from somewhere else .
not a good idea . - tanya i do n't think i would .
for me , the coolest thing about the web is the ability to bring people together .
using a character which is only found on keyboards in two countries -lrb- germany and austria - the german-speaking swiss stopped using the ß years ago -rrb- would be more divisive than inclusive .
but do n't get me wrong , i 'm not in favor of a “ super language ” that should take over the world .
german should stay german !
but on the international level , there should be a level playing field for the internet .
i 'm just saying . - patrick i do n't like it .
i wo n't be able to type some german and austrian web addresses ! - alberto sure why not ?
just press alt 225 and there you go - ß .
but i must admit , not everyone 's going to like it with all these special keyboard codes , especially the non-germanic countries . - kristin compiled by stuart tiffen editor : michael lawton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ? 9799 dw-tv europe live journal - nachrichten mit wirtschaft we 're sorry , due to legal issues this content can not be transmitted as live stream .

scientists still do not know when ancient primates began to migrate from being more to less promiscuous . although neanderthals have not lived in europe for 30,000 years , they continue to fascinate scientists around the world .
a new study from the united kingdom suggests that neanderthals had more partners than modern humans .
they reached this conclusion by comparing the ratio of different finger lengths that allow scientists to determine some kinds of behavior , including sexual promiscuity .
emma nelson , a doctoral student at the university of liverpool , had shown in previous research that high levels of in-utero androgens increase the length of the fourth , or ring , finger when compared to the second , or index finger .
the team found that a low ratio indicates higher levels of competitiveness , aggressiveness and more sexual partners , while a high ratio indicates more monogamy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neanderthals had a index-to-ring finger ratio of 0.928 , which is less than modern humans comparisons amongst four species in a paper published today in the british journal proceedings of the royal society b , the team compared the finger-length ratios amongst various ancient hominin species , including ardipithecus ramidus , a hominid who lived around 4.4 million years ago ; australopithecus afarensis , which lived around three to four million years ago ; neanderthals , who disappeared around 28,000 years ago ; and early humans dating back to 95,000 years ago .
" it is believed that prenatal androgens affect the genes responsible for the development of fingers , toes and the reproductive system , " said nelson in a statement .
" we have recently shown that promiscuous primate species have low index to ring finger ratios , while monogamous species have high ratios .
we used this information to estimate the social behavior of extinct apes and hominins .
although the fossil record is limited for this period , and more fossils are needed to confirm our findings , this method could prove to be an exciting new way of understanding how our social behavior has evolved . "
the study found that modern humans have an average of a 0.957 index-to-ring finger ratio , and are generally a more monogamous species , while chimps ' , gorillas ' and orangutans ' average ratio is at 0.91 , and are generally more promiscuous .
the researchers also found that an early modern human found in an israeli cave , dating back to approximately 95,000 years ago , had a ratio of 0.935 , which would be more promiscuous than modern humans as well .
neanderthals , meanwhile , had a ratio of 0.928 .
further study needed in an interview with the agence france presse , nelson added that the research team would like to be able to confirm their findings through other means .
anthropologists still do not agree when or why humans and their ancestors began to migrate from a more promiscuous mating system to a more monogamous one , given that the former group would hold an evolutionary advantage in terms of being able to spread their genes more quickly and more widely .
" pair-bonding , in a broad sense , is universal among humans , but it is not known when the transition from a promiscuous mating system to a stable bonded one occurred , " wrote the scientists in their scientific paper .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the findings could reveal more about mating practices amongst our ancestors disagreement amongst anthropologists however , not all scientists agree with these findings .
in an interview with the american news website , msnbc.com , another anthropologist who was not part of the study said that this correlation of finger ratios is not a " good predictor of any social behaviors . "
" in addition to the problem of using a poor predictor , this study has another problem that we often face with fossils - there are very few of them , and it 's not obvious which sample of living primates we should be comparing with them , " said john hawks , an anthropology professor at the university of wisconsin , madison .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de foreign trade -pipe- 03.11.2010 industry leaders warn against overreaction on air freight security großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : industry leaders say total security is a politicians ' fantasy as air cargo security is tightened around europe , german industry leaders warn that expensive checks on freight would damage world trade .
total security is simply a politician 's fantasy , they say . the pressure was on the german government when it was revealed sunday that a us-bound bomb discovered on a cargo plane in london had passed through germany 's cologne bonn airport .
all flights - first cargo , then passenger services – from the bomb 's country of origin , yemen , were suspended .
interior minister thomas de maiziere was quick to announce that investigations would follow .
" air freight has been relatively under-monitored up to now .
evidently they recognized that and exploited it .
this means changes for the air freight business . "
transport minister peter ramsauer echoed his colleague and underlined the swiftness of the government 's measures .
" our security measures are meant to guarantee that no freight will get to germany from yemen , " he said .
" now possible gaps in the air freight security system have to be uncovered and closed . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ramsauer said security gaps need to be uncovered and closed time is money but german industry leaders are worried that the government may be lining up knee-jerk security measures that could prove costly .
" the safety checks are becoming more bureaucratic and cumbersome .
that costs time , and time is money , " axel nitschke , export economy chief at the german association of chambers of commerce and industry -lrb- dihk -rrb- , told the handelsblatt newspaper dierk mueller , general manager of the american chamber of commerce in germany , told deutsche welle that talk of extra checks was little more than a security blanket for politicians eager to cover their backs .
the us government has already passed a law stating that all cargo containers entering the us by sea or air have to be scanned , but this is a task that thwarts all logistics .
" this law is already in place , but not implemented , " mueller said .
" the us government said we must postpone implementation until we know how to do it .
even if you have all the money in the world , no-one knows how to do it .
there is just no 100 percent security . "
physically impossible the technological obstacles are practically insurmountable .
" air freight is a little easier .
the containers are smaller , but still , you have to do x-raying and computer tomography , because x-raying ca n't detect certain types of plastic explosives .
even that would cost enormous amounts of money . "
" and then you have to tell where these things come from , " he added .
" even if all the major western hemisphere countries say , ' we have 100 percent safety procedures ' , they would still need all the paperwork – stamps and stamps and papers and papers – there is no way to do it 100 percent .
you always have some countries not participating . "
the german government has already admitted as much .
jan muecke , the parliamentary state secretary in the federal ministry of transportation , said monday : " it is practically impossible to scan the entire freight , given the current quantity . "
even if the logistical and technological problems could be surmounted , mueller believes that tightening security will always damage the economy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : authorities fear terrorists have found a gap in airport security " the governments will never pay this .
the consumer will always pay for the extra costs , " he said .
" and it 's not just a matter of money , it 's also the delay .
spare parts for airplanes or special machines sometimes have to be delivered in a few hours . "
" the delay will mean a lack of quality , a lack of punctuality , lack of efficiency , so it will be detrimental to the world economy in the end . "
practical solutions mueller believes that , as with the illegal drugs trade , the only practical solution is to infiltrate the criminal organizations themselves .
" if all this worked , we would not have illegal drugs going to the us , " he said .
" but we have hundreds of tons being illegally imported to the us every year .
these things can not be prevented from entering the country .
we can do something to control the mafia and the terrorists , but not the product itself . "
in germany , federal police under the authority of the interior ministry are responsible for searching passengers , but security for cargo planes comes under the remit of the transport ministry , through the federal agency of aviation -lrb- lba -rrb- .
cargo companies like the german dhl also carry out their own security checks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scanning freight is time-consuming and expensive " of course , to protect against dangers , we have to ensure that safety comes first , " dihk boss martin wansleben told deutsche welle .
" the minute check of every single delivery at the airport has technical and organizational limits .
that is why it is so important that a secure chain of delivery is introduced , with complete supervision from the dispatcher to the airport . "
to achieve this , wansleben believes that existing european union regulations need to be better implemented .
" the eu 's prescribed certification of known dispatchers and regulated commissioners should finally be introduced by the federal agency of aviation , " he said .
" in terms of value , around 35-40 percent of international trade is processed through air freight , " wansleben added .
" these are particularly valuable , urgent , or fragile goods .
that means any interference in air freight will lead to significant costs . "

german politicians are wondering what a divided american government will mean for europe and world politics . german politicians believe tuesday 's congressional elections in the united states will change the landscape of foreign policy .
the elections represent a major threat to us president barack obama 's power at home , as the opposition republicans gained a majority in the congress 's lower house , the house of representatives , and boosted their numbers in the senate .
a bigger role on the world stage ?
the german government 's coordinator for german-american relations , hans-ulrich klose , said wednesday he expected obama to turn his gaze outward in light of new difficulties in domestic politics .
he told national radio station deutschlandradio that the president would now be concentrating more on the mideast conflict .
" i hesitate to speak of a solution to the problems , but it would be good if there were more intelligent conflict management , " klose said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polenz says europe needs to play a bigger role on the world stage the chairman of the bundestag parliament 's foreign affairs committee , ruprecht polenz , also stressed that obama could maintain a strong role in international politics , as the president is only dependent on congress in matters of international diplomacy when it comes to ratifying treaties .
europe to ' step up to the plate . '
however , polenz took a different position from klose 's , positing that conflicts within american politics could weaken the us 's leading position in worldwide diplomacy .
" of course , the us 's role in the world will be judged by its partners according to how strong they are at home .
in that sense , -lsb- obama -rsb- is somewhat weakened , " polenz told deutsche welle .
polenz stressed that germany and europe would have to take a stronger position in global diplomacy if the us were to take a step back , especially in matters such as the mideast conflict , russian-american relations and china 's ascent to the world stage .
" we need solutions to certain conflicts and problems in this world , and if the americans ca n't focus on that as strongly as in the past , then europe will have to do more , " he said , adding , " we do n't have an eternity to answer as many foreign-policy questions as possible with one voice and act accordingly . "
" one message of this election is that we are now being put more to the challenge , " polenz added .
polenz said that europe was not capable of filling the us 's shoes in matters of world politics , but stressed that a more politically divided america needed europe 's support : " it will be important for us to put more effort into our relationship because we need to work together when one partner ca n't carry as much of the burden . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klose says democrats and republicans will have to cooperate more closely one place where europe will have to take on more responsibility , according to rainer stinner , foreign policy spokesperson for germany 's free democrats - the party of foreign minister guido westerwelle - is in the reshaping of the north atlantic treaty organization -lrb- nato -rrb- .
nato is currently forming its new strategic concept .
" if nato members agree that a missile defense shield is necessary , then it will surely need to be financed by all nato partners and can not all be put on the americans ' shoulders , " stinner said .
stalemate or renewed cooperation ?
the big question facing american politics is whether democrats and republicans can work together , or if increased control by the opposition republicans will mean a political stalemate .
polenz believes a standstill would be " fatal " for the us both at home and abroad .
klose and stinner , however , believe the two parties will be forced to work together .
stinner said that , should the republicans continue trying to block all legislation from the democrats , it could backfire against them in the next elections .
" the republicans would do well not to continue a purely oppositional politics , " he said , " but to try to work together with the president so that he ca n't position them as preventing -lsb- progress -rsb- . "

not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content .
would you register a .de domain name with an " ß " in it ?
the following reader responses are from the deutsche welle facebook fan page .
it would be quite annoying for people who do n't have a german keyboard . - alessandro it would be just as annoying as an umlaut .
but if they do n't speak german , why would they visit a german website ? - wolfgang wolfgang , i know several german websites , that have support for several languages or at least english . - gerhard well , i do n't know if i would register a .de website address with " ß . "
it would be pretty annoying for people who do n't understand or can not type german .
besides , i think people who do n't understand german may still go to german websites because some of them provide information in other languages .
by the way , i like " ß , " because it looks very german and also is very cute . - pin-shuan yes !
more original !
and it is a good way to resist the overly complicated “ reform der deutschen rechtschreibung von 1996 . ” - luis yay !
do it !
save german language and culture !
to those of you who complain about the keyboard , do some research , you can use " hot keys " to make foreign characters . - kadesh exactly kadesh .
there are some really simple number pad commands that will insert german characters -lrb- and many other symbols as well -rrb- . - chris alas , that character does n't exist on my keyboard !
how will i type it into the browser ? - judith where does one find these number pad commands ? - lyle it would be nice to allow ' ss ' or ' sz ' to do the same job on non-german keyboards . - claudio http : / / tlt.its.psu.edu / suggestions / international / accents / codeint.html sorry , i should have added this earlier ... ßßß - kadesh when you use the codes or special keys for the special letters does the computer recognize font differences ? - michelle i tried also alt + 0223 according to my character map but it simply does n't work , at least in facebook . - claudio using the ß in your url would be a really good way to ensure that no one outside of germany ever visited it , except perhaps via links from somewhere else .
not a good idea . - tanya i do n't think i would .
for me , the coolest thing about the web is the ability to bring people together .
using a character which is only found on keyboards in two countries -lrb- germany and austria - the german-speaking swiss stopped using the ß years ago -rrb- would be more divisive than inclusive .
but do n't get me wrong , i 'm not in favor of a “ super language ” that should take over the world .
german should stay german !
but on the international level , there should be a level playing field for the internet .
i 'm just saying . - patrick i do n't like it .
i wo n't be able to type some german and austrian web addresses ! - alberto sure why not ?
just press alt 225 and there you go - ß .
but i must admit , not everyone 's going to like it with all these special keyboard codes , especially the non-germanic countries . - kristin compiled by stuart tiffen editor : michael lawton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

german politicians are wondering what a divided american government will mean for europe and world politics . german politicians believe tuesday 's congressional elections in the united states will change the landscape of foreign policy .
the elections represent a major threat to us president barack obama 's power at home , as the opposition republicans gained a majority in the congress 's lower house , the house of representatives , and boosted their numbers in the senate .
a bigger role on the world stage ?
the german government 's coordinator for german-american relations , hans-ulrich klose , said wednesday he expected obama to turn his gaze outward in light of new difficulties in domestic politics .
he told national radio station deutschlandradio that the president would now be concentrating more on the mideast conflict .

however , polenz took a different position from klose 's , positing that conflicts within american politics could weaken the us 's leading position in worldwide diplomacy .
" of course , the us 's role in the world will be judged by its partners according to how strong they are at home .
in that sense , -lsb- obama -rsb- is somewhat weakened , " polenz told deutsche welle .
polenz stressed that germany and europe would have to take a stronger position in global diplomacy if the us were to take a step back , especially in matters such as the mideast conflict , russian-american relations and china 's ascent to the world stage .
" we need solutions to certain conflicts and problems in this world , and if the americans ca n't focus on that as strongly as in the past , then europe will have to do more , " he said , adding , " we do n't have an eternity to answer as many foreign-policy questions as possible with one voice and act accordingly . "
" one message of this election is that we are now being put more to the challenge , " polenz added .
polenz said that europe was not capable of filling the us 's shoes in matters of world politics , but stressed that a more politically divided america needed europe 's support : " it will be important for us to put more effort into our relationship because we need to work together when one partner ca n't carry as much of the burden . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klose says democrats and republicans will have to cooperate more closely one place where europe will have to take on more responsibility , according to rainer stinner , foreign policy spokesperson for germany 's free democrats - the party of foreign minister guido westerwelle - is in the reshaping of the north atlantic treaty organization -lrb- nato -rrb- .
nato is currently forming its new strategic concept .
" if nato members agree that a missile defense shield is necessary , then it will surely need to be financed by all nato partners and can not all be put on the americans ' shoulders , " stinner said .
stalemate or renewed cooperation ?
the big question facing american politics is whether democrats and republicans can work together , or if increased control by the opposition republicans will mean a political stalemate .
polenz believes a standstill would be " fatal " for the us both at home and abroad .
klose and stinner , however , believe the two parties will be forced to work together .
stinner said that , should the republicans continue trying to block all legislation from the democrats , it could backfire against them in the next elections .
" the republicans would do well not to continue a purely oppositional politics , " he said , " but to try to work together with the president so that he ca n't position them as preventing -lsb- progress -rsb- . "

but as china booms , there is concern human life is being left on the wayside by power-hungry and corrupt officials . as the world expo in shanghai wound down , there was one exhibit at the chile pavilion that continued to attract the masses .
the phoenix 2 capsule , which helped rescue 33 chilean miners last month , triggered a debate about mine safety in china . one visitor said that the rescue operation in chile showed a respect for human life that china could learn from .
just days after the chilean miners were rescued , some 30 of their chinese colleagues in a mine in henan province died in an explosion . " the mine was unsafe but they don ’ t care about worker safety .
all they care about is production , " the mother of one of the dead miners said angrily . safety laws often ignored federal safety laws and directives from beijing are often ignored .
former functionaries themselves say that china ’ s economic boom is partly based on blood . " all they care about is developing the economy , " says zhou xiaozheng , a sociologist at the people ’ s university in beijing .
" they just look at gdp in order to gauge development .
that ’ s how they are judged and that ’ s what their promotions are based upon . " in its rhetoric , the central government in beijing preaches about sustainable growth , about the environment and development without waste of resources .
prime minister wen jiabao often talks about people-oriented policies .
" the government acquired its power from the people , all power goes back to the people and we have to do everything for the people , " he recently said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many chinese are getting rich but some say the poor are being sacrificed however , for many these words are like a slap in the face .
only the ruling communist party is to blame for the fact that there are no controls over those in power , that there is no transparency , no checks and balances . officials and businessmen in cahoots environmental activist wu lihong , who has long campaigned against the pollution of lake taihu , says there is a tangled web of corruption and nepotism , with officials and factory owners working hand-in-hand . " they are in cahoots and they have the same interests .
that 's why the central government never finds out the truth and does not know about local issues .
the central government has no power – that ’ s one of our system 's problems . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : migrant workers are flocking to the cities to find work but they are often subject to abuse there is also corruption at the highest level .
at the beginning of the year , a former supreme court judge was sentenced to lifetime imprisonment for taking bribes and corruption charges .
last month , the former head of china ’ s nuclear agency was expelled from the party . " power creates corruption , " says zhou xiaozheng .
" and absolute power creates absolute corruption .
we humans are not saints .
anyone who is in power for a long time becomes corrupt .
that ’ s why we have to monitor those in power better . " but , he adds , this is what is currently not possible in china .
the media have restricted powers of control .
censorship in china is all-pervasive in china .

the democrats manage to keep a slim majority in the senate . us republicans won a huge majority in the house of representatives in midterm elections , delivering a blow president barack obama described as a " shellacking . "
" i am not recommending for every future president that they take a shellacking like i did last night , " obama said in a news conference on wednesday .
" i am sure there are easier ways to learn these lessons . "
the conservative republican party gained at least 60 seats in the house of representatives , the biggest shift of congressional power since 1948 and more than enough to win control of the 435-member lower chamber .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : john boehner is set to become the new house speaker the vote toppled democrat nancy pelosi from her position as speaker of the house , leaving ohio republic and house minority leader john boehner ready to fill the position .
speaking as almost all of the polls across the country had closed , boehner pledged to cut government spending .
in a victory rally at the republican party 's headquarters in washington , he said that americans had sent a clear message for obama to " change course . "
" our new majority will be prepared to do things differently , " boehner said .
" it starts with cutting spending instead of increasing it , reducing the size of government instead of increasing it , and reforming the way congress works . "
president obama placed a congratulatory phone call to boehner on tuesday evening , saying he looked forward to working together with boehner to find common ground and move the country forward .
bildunterschrift : environmental legislation on hold however , republican control of the house could lead to legislative gridlock .
obama acknowledged that democratic plans for a " cap-and-trade " system - charging industry for carbon dioxide emissions blamed for global climate change - would have to be put off for at least the next two years .
" it 's doubtful that you could get the votes to pass that through the house this year , or next year , or the year after , " obama said .
" cap and trade was just one way of skinning the cat … it was a means , not an end . "
republicans made gains in the senate , where 37 out of 100 upper house seats were at stake .
with three seats still too close to call on wednesday , democrats took a net loss of 6 seats for 51 , while republicans took 46 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama and the democrats kept hold of the senate democrats were helped by a victory for democratic majority leader harry reid , who won his seat with about 50 percent of the vote .
reid was challenged by sharron angle , backed by the grassroots conservative tea party movement .
democrats were not so lucky in florida , where republican marco rubio became the first tea party-backed candidate to win a senate seat .
but another tea party favorite - controversial senate candidate for delaware , christine o 'donnell - lost her race .
comfortable majority in lower house although much of the debate leading up to the election focused on anxiety about the us economy , the increased number of republican seats in congress may also have foreign policy implications .
spending on development could be blocked in the lower house and republican gains in the senate are likely to make it more difficult for the obama administration to ratify international treaties .
it is thought that the republicans could use their enhanced platform in congress to frustrate aspects of obama 's foreign policy , for instance , by opposing any peace deal in afghanistan that would bring the taliban to the negotiating table .
of the 50 states in the union , 37 also elected a new governor .
california voters elected democrat jerry brown , who served as governor in the 1970s and 80s , replacing austrian-born actor-turned-politician arnold schwarzenegger .
the state also rejected a proposal to decriminalize recreational marijuana .

barack obama has to now own up to his faults and react , says dw 's washington correspondent christina bergmann . it was the anticipated slap in the face for the us president .
barack obama had tried to do everything right and everything at the same time .
now , he has to realize that he blew it with all sides in the process .
the conservatives were seething above all from the health reform , which they view as an unacceptable government intrusion into their lives .
but obama failed to dominate the debate in time .
now , he has to recognize that it 's not enough to do good deeds .
you also have to talk about them .
even faithful supporters accuse him of failing to set his priorities right .
they say he should have dealt with the economy instead of the health reform .
as a matter of fact , obama did do so right at the beginning of his term .
but the administration too quickly assumed that economic activity would pick up again .
the economic crisis in europe threw a monkey wrench in these plans - and unemployment figures in the us increased .
the president recognized too late that when citizens are hard up , they always point their finger at the white house .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christina bergmann is dw 's washington correspondent obama also alienated many supporters in his voter base , for example through his inconsistent back and forth about military guidelines forbidding homosexuals from serving openly in the military .
during his campaign , obama had pledged to do away with this practice .
he could n't fulfill this promise just as little as he could his vow to close guantanamo within one year 's time .
but above all , barack obama underestimated one thing : voters all across the country still do n't think much of " washington . "
two years ago , obama was able to benefit from this attitude .
he promised to change politics in the capital .
but he has not accomplished that .
the rift between the democrats and the republicans is deeper than it ever was .
it 's high time to redeem this pledge of bipartisanship .
it makes just as little sense to always blame the republicans - who indeed were mainly experts in saying " no " - as it does to constantly point the finger at his predecessor .
it 's true : george w. bush did drive the country into a crisis .
but that is in the past .
washington is now personified by barack obama as he found out bitterly on this election day .

chancellor merkel pointed to successful examples of integration and said society should put more effort into working with immigrants . by 2015 german chancellor angela merkel wants to give every immigrant the opportunity to take part in integration courses .
the government estimates that by that time around 1.8 million people will have attended the courses since they were first introduced in 2005 .
" we 're catching up in 10 years on what we failed to do in the previous 30 years , " merkel said at the end of an integration summit in berlin on wednesday .
" we want to be more concrete . "
that was the message of german chancellor angela merkel at the berlin integration summit .
she wants to set clear standards to make it easier to assess what germany has achieved , and what is still to be done on the issue of integration .
' multiculturalism has failed ' merkel said the notion that integration could be achieved simply by different living next to one another was outdated .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : politicians , experts and minority groups took part merkel , who said in a speech last month that " multiculturalism has failed , " set out to prove that integration would not happen by itself .
she said that true integration required much more energy and engagement from all of society .
the chancellor praised the atmosphere at the summit as being " the right working environment . "
the 120 participants , including politicians , economists , and representatives of the police and the media apparently exchanged " controversial opinions " with one another .
merkel said they had spoken openly about " what had yet to be achieved . "
for example , she pointed out that there was a lot of work still to do on the issue of violence in schools .
" there 's still a long way to go on this journey , " merkel commented .
the government says it will spend about 400 million euros -lrb- 560 million dollars -rrb- by 2014 on improving german language skills among the children of immigrants so they can perform better at school .
it is also seeking to help immigrants get their foreign qualifications recognised in germany , and to have more people from immigrant backgrounds working in the civil service and in the police force .
success stories there were some impressive examples of successes in immigration policy , merkel said .
she cited sport as an example .
the 2010 german world cup team was the most multicultural ever , with a number of players from turkish and african immigrant families .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and boehmer have drawn up an action plan maria boehmer is the government minister responsible for the issue of integration .
she echoed the chancellor 's words , saying that " a lot of ground had been gained " in the last few years .
she said there were more positive stories of integration " than had been told in the last few weeks . "
germany has been embroiled in a debate about integration since a prominent member of the board of the state bank , the bundesbank , sparked outrage in germany and abroad when he published a book which claimed that muslims themselves were in part responsible for failing to integrate into german society .
he was forced to resign from his post , but the debate simmered on .
boehmer cited a new national action plan , which should make progress in integration easier to follow , and will complement the current national integration plan .
she said that police , care workers and teachers could play a " bridging role " in helping immigrants to integrate .
some participants , however , criticized the lack of real results at the summit .
aydan oezoguz , who is responsible for integration in the opposition spd parliamentary group , called the action plan a " hotch-potch of measures that had already been agreed on . "
the spokesperson on migration policy for the left party , sevim dagdelen , said it was merely a " symbolic summit " that would not change the daily reality for immigrants in germany . ´ the federal statistics office says about 16 million people in germany come from a " migrant background " - just under 20 percent of the population .
of these , an estimated 4 million are muslim , mostly of turkish origin .

for example , she pointed out that there was a lot of work still to do on the issue of violence in schools .
" there 's still a long way to go on this journey , " merkel commented .
the government says it will spend about 400 million euros -lrb- 560 million dollars -rrb- by 2014 on improving german language skills among the children of immigrants so they can perform better at school .
it is also seeking to help immigrants get their foreign qualifications recognised in germany , and to have more people from immigrant backgrounds working in the civil service and in the police force .
success stories there were some impressive examples of successes in immigration policy , merkel said .
she cited sport as an example .
the 2010 german world cup team was the most multicultural ever , with a number of players from turkish and african immigrant families .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and boehmer have drawn up an action plan maria boehmer is the government minister responsible for the issue of integration .
she echoed the chancellor 's words , saying that " a lot of ground had been gained " in the last few years .
she said there were more positive stories of integration " than had been told in the last few weeks . "
germany has been embroiled in a debate about integration since a prominent member of the board of the state bank , the bundesbank , sparked outrage in germany and abroad when he published a book which claimed that muslims themselves were in part responsible for failing to integrate into german society .
he was forced to resign from his post , but the debate simmered on .
boehmer cited a new national action plan , which should make progress in integration easier to follow , and will complement the current national integration plan .
she said that police , care workers and teachers could play a " bridging role " in helping immigrants to integrate .
some participants , however , criticized the lack of real results at the summit .
aydan oezoguz , who is responsible for integration in the opposition spd parliamentary group , called the action plan a " hotch-potch of measures that had already been agreed on . "
the spokesperson on migration policy for the left party , sevim dagdelen , said it was merely a " symbolic summit " that would not change the daily reality for immigrants in germany . ´ the federal statistics office says about 16 million people in germany come from a " migrant background " - just under 20 percent of the population .
of these , an estimated 4 million are muslim , mostly of turkish origin .

the democrats manage to keep a slim majority in the senate . us republicans won a huge majority in the house of representatives in midterm elections , delivering a blow president barack obama described as a " shellacking . "
" i am not recommending for every future president that they take a shellacking like i did last night , " obama said in a news conference on wednesday .
" i am sure there are easier ways to learn these lessons . "
the conservative republican party gained at least 60 seats in the house of representatives , the biggest shift of congressional power since 1948 and more than enough to win control of the 435-member lower chamber .

speaking as almost all of the polls across the country had closed , boehner pledged to cut government spending .
in a victory rally at the republican party 's headquarters in washington , he said that americans had sent a clear message for obama to " change course . "
" our new majority will be prepared to do things differently , " boehner said .
" it starts with cutting spending instead of increasing it , reducing the size of government instead of increasing it , and reforming the way congress works . "
president obama placed a congratulatory phone call to boehner on tuesday evening , saying he looked forward to working together with boehner to find common ground and move the country forward .
bildunterschrift : environmental legislation on hold however , republican control of the house could lead to legislative gridlock .
obama acknowledged that democratic plans for a " cap-and-trade " system - charging industry for carbon dioxide emissions blamed for global climate change - would have to be put off for at least the next two years .
" it 's doubtful that you could get the votes to pass that through the house this year , or next year , or the year after , " obama said .
" cap and trade was just one way of skinning the cat … it was a means , not an end . "
republicans made gains in the senate , where 37 out of 100 upper house seats were at stake .
with three seats still too close to call on wednesday , democrats took a net loss of 6 seats for 51 , while republicans took 46 .

comfortable majority in lower house although much of the debate leading up to the election focused on anxiety about the us economy , the increased number of republican seats in congress may also have foreign policy implications .
spending on development could be blocked in the lower house and republican gains in the senate are likely to make it more difficult for the obama administration to ratify international treaties .
it is thought that the republicans could use their enhanced platform in congress to frustrate aspects of obama 's foreign policy , for instance , by opposing any peace deal in afghanistan that would bring the taliban to the negotiating table .

instead , he triggered a new uproar with an anti-gay comment . italian prime minister silvio berlusconi brushed off a growing scandal over his relationship with a young girl on tuesday , but drew fresh criticism for a comment about homosexuality .
" when i 'm in the presence of a beautiful girl , i look at her , " he said at the opening of a motorcycle industry show in milan .
" it 's better to have a passion for beautiful girls than to be gay . "
gay rights activists and opposition center-left politicians condemned the remark .
paolo patane , president of the gay rights group arcigay , said it was " gratuitous " and " vulgar . "
" it offends not only homosexual people but also women in general . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : actress julianne moore has also criticized berlusconi 's remarks actress julianne moore was in rome to present the " the kids are all right , " a film about a lesbian couple and their teenage children , at the rome film festival and reacted with dismay to berlusconi 's statement .
" i think it 's unfortunate , archaic and idiotic , " she said .
" to hint or say that there is something wrong with homosexuality … it 's unfortunate and it 's embarrassing when people continue to perpetuate these untruths . "
berlusconi not budging the most recent scandal facing berlusconi involves reports that a teenage girl named karima el mahroug was paid to attend raunchy parties at his villa near milan last year and that he later intervened and obtained her release when she was arrested for theft .
el mahroug turned 18 on tuesday .
despite newspaper speculation that the issue could bring down berlusconi 's government and lead to early elections , the prime minister said he and his coalition were in it for the long haul .
" you should be completely reassured about the government and about the fact that it 's a government that still has a majority that intends to govern until the end of its term , " he said .
berlusconi has faced down other sex scandals by saying that while he is " no saint , " he has never paid for sex .
his current term of office expires in 2013 .

instead , he triggered a new uproar with an anti-gay comment . italian prime minister silvio berlusconi brushed off a growing scandal over his relationship with a young girl on tuesday , but drew fresh criticism for a comment about homosexuality .
" when i 'm in the presence of a beautiful girl , i look at her , " he said at the opening of a motorcycle industry show in milan .
" it 's better to have a passion for beautiful girls than to be gay . "
gay rights activists and opposition center-left politicians condemned the remark .
paolo patane , president of the gay rights group arcigay , said it was " gratuitous " and " vulgar . "
" it offends not only homosexual people but also women in general . "

" i think it 's unfortunate , archaic and idiotic , " she said .
" to hint or say that there is something wrong with homosexuality … it 's unfortunate and it 's embarrassing when people continue to perpetuate these untruths . "
berlusconi not budging the most recent scandal facing berlusconi involves reports that a teenage girl named karima el mahroug was paid to attend raunchy parties at his villa near milan last year and that he later intervened and obtained her release when she was arrested for theft .
el mahroug turned 18 on tuesday .
despite newspaper speculation that the issue could bring down berlusconi 's government and lead to early elections , the prime minister said he and his coalition were in it for the long haul .
" you should be completely reassured about the government and about the fact that it 's a government that still has a majority that intends to govern until the end of its term , " he said .
berlusconi has faced down other sex scandals by saying that while he is " no saint , " he has never paid for sex .
his current term of office expires in 2013 .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : katarina witt won gold for east germany in 1984 " i am delighted we have received this wholehearted endorsement from elected representatives at all levels of government , " witt said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de united states -pipe- 03.11.2010 german politicians predict us elections will impact world politics großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany wonders how american elections will affect world politics republican victories in tuesday 's midterm elections dealt a major blow to president barack obama .
german politicians are wondering what a divided american government will mean for europe and world politics . german politicians believe tuesday 's congressional elections in the united states will change the landscape of foreign policy .
the elections represent a major threat to us president barack obama 's power at home , as the opposition republicans gained a majority in the congress 's lower house , the house of representatives , and boosted their numbers in the senate .
a bigger role on the world stage ?
the german government 's coordinator for german-american relations , hans-ulrich klose , said wednesday he expected obama to turn his gaze outward in light of new difficulties in domestic politics .
he told national radio station deutschlandradio that the president would now be concentrating more on the mideast conflict .
" i hesitate to speak of a solution to the problems , but it would be good if there were more intelligent conflict management , " klose said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polenz says europe needs to play a bigger role on the world stage the chairman of the bundestag parliament 's foreign affairs committee , ruprecht polenz , also stressed that obama could maintain a strong role in international politics , as the president is only dependent on congress in matters of international diplomacy when it comes to ratifying treaties .
europe to ' step up to the plate . '
however , polenz took a different position from klose 's , positing that conflicts within american politics could weaken the us 's leading position in worldwide diplomacy .
" of course , the us 's role in the world will be judged by its partners according to how strong they are at home .
in that sense , -lsb- obama -rsb- is somewhat weakened , " polenz told deutsche welle .
polenz stressed that germany and europe would have to take a stronger position in global diplomacy if the us were to take a step back , especially in matters such as the mideast conflict , russian-american relations and china 's ascent to the world stage .
" we need solutions to certain conflicts and problems in this world , and if the americans ca n't focus on that as strongly as in the past , then europe will have to do more , " he said , adding , " we do n't have an eternity to answer as many foreign-policy questions as possible with one voice and act accordingly . "
" one message of this election is that we are now being put more to the challenge , " polenz added .
polenz said that europe was not capable of filling the us 's shoes in matters of world politics , but stressed that a more politically divided america needed europe 's support : " it will be important for us to put more effort into our relationship because we need to work together when one partner ca n't carry as much of the burden . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klose says democrats and republicans will have to cooperate more closely one place where europe will have to take on more responsibility , according to rainer stinner , foreign policy spokesperson for germany 's free democrats - the party of foreign minister guido westerwelle - is in the reshaping of the north atlantic treaty organization -lrb- nato -rrb- .
nato is currently forming its new strategic concept .
" if nato members agree that a missile defense shield is necessary , then it will surely need to be financed by all nato partners and can not all be put on the americans ' shoulders , " stinner said .
stalemate or renewed cooperation ?
the big question facing american politics is whether democrats and republicans can work together , or if increased control by the opposition republicans will mean a political stalemate .
polenz believes a standstill would be " fatal " for the us both at home and abroad .
klose and stinner , however , believe the two parties will be forced to work together .
stinner said that , should the republicans continue trying to block all legislation from the democrats , it could backfire against them in the next elections .
" the republicans would do well not to continue a purely oppositional politics , " he said , " but to try to work together with the president so that he ca n't position them as preventing -lsb- progress -rsb- . "

german politicians are wondering what a divided american government will mean for europe and world politics . german politicians believe tuesday 's congressional elections in the united states will change the landscape of foreign policy .
the elections represent a major threat to us president barack obama 's power at home , as the opposition republicans gained a majority in the congress 's lower house , the house of representatives , and boosted their numbers in the senate .
a bigger role on the world stage ?
the german government 's coordinator for german-american relations , hans-ulrich klose , said wednesday he expected obama to turn his gaze outward in light of new difficulties in domestic politics .
he told national radio station deutschlandradio that the president would now be concentrating more on the mideast conflict .
" i hesitate to speak of a solution to the problems , but it would be good if there were more intelligent conflict management , " klose said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polenz says europe needs to play a bigger role on the world stage the chairman of the bundestag parliament 's foreign affairs committee , ruprecht polenz , also stressed that obama could maintain a strong role in international politics , as the president is only dependent on congress in matters of international diplomacy when it comes to ratifying treaties .
europe to ' step up to the plate . '
however , polenz took a different position from klose 's , positing that conflicts within american politics could weaken the us 's leading position in worldwide diplomacy .
" of course , the us 's role in the world will be judged by its partners according to how strong they are at home .
in that sense , -lsb- obama -rsb- is somewhat weakened , " polenz told deutsche welle .
polenz stressed that germany and europe would have to take a stronger position in global diplomacy if the us were to take a step back , especially in matters such as the mideast conflict , russian-american relations and china 's ascent to the world stage .
" we need solutions to certain conflicts and problems in this world , and if the americans ca n't focus on that as strongly as in the past , then europe will have to do more , " he said , adding , " we do n't have an eternity to answer as many foreign-policy questions as possible with one voice and act accordingly . "
" one message of this election is that we are now being put more to the challenge , " polenz added .
polenz said that europe was not capable of filling the us 's shoes in matters of world politics , but stressed that a more politically divided america needed europe 's support : " it will be important for us to put more effort into our relationship because we need to work together when one partner ca n't carry as much of the burden . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klose says democrats and republicans will have to cooperate more closely one place where europe will have to take on more responsibility , according to rainer stinner , foreign policy spokesperson for germany 's free democrats - the party of foreign minister guido westerwelle - is in the reshaping of the north atlantic treaty organization -lrb- nato -rrb- .
nato is currently forming its new strategic concept .
" if nato members agree that a missile defense shield is necessary , then it will surely need to be financed by all nato partners and can not all be put on the americans ' shoulders , " stinner said .
stalemate or renewed cooperation ?
the big question facing american politics is whether democrats and republicans can work together , or if increased control by the opposition republicans will mean a political stalemate .
polenz believes a standstill would be " fatal " for the us both at home and abroad .
klose and stinner , however , believe the two parties will be forced to work together .
stinner said that , should the republicans continue trying to block all legislation from the democrats , it could backfire against them in the next elections .
" the republicans would do well not to continue a purely oppositional politics , " he said , " but to try to work together with the president so that he ca n't position them as preventing -lsb- progress -rsb- . "

the move comes as canada , spain and , most recently , italy are scrutinizing the california company . in an announcement wednesday , british data protection authorities said there was a " significant breach of the data protection act " and that google uk would be subject to an audit .
further , it added , the company must promise that similar data breaches do not occur again .
the uk authorities had once again taken up the privacy case against google late last month after google had revealed further details that it had obtained " wifi data . "
that data included passwords and e-mails while google was sending cars along british streets and in other countries for its street view service .
earlier this year , the information commissioner 's office -lrb- ico -rrb- had said that it had found " no wrongdoing " on google 's part , but re-opened an investigation last week .
" it is my view that the collection of this information was not fair or lawful and constitutes a significant breach of the first principle of the data protection act , " said christopher graham , the uk information commissioner , in a statement published wednesday on the ico 's website .
" the most appropriate and proportionate regulatory action in these circumstances is to get written legal assurance from google that this will not happen again – and to follow this up with an ico audit . "
the ico elaborated that it had declined to seek monetary damages against the silicon valley company as it would have been too legally difficult to prove .
" monetary penalties can only be served when a strict set of criteria is satisfied , including that the breach was likely to cause substantial harm or substantial distress – this alone would be very hard to prove in this case , " wrote kirsty mccaskill , an ico spokesperson , in a statement provided to deutsche welle .
" the vast majority of the pay-load data was also collected prior to 6 april 2010 , before our new powers came into force . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the vehicles used to create street view inadvertantly collected the data google says google has admitted guilt in a written statement also provided to deutsche welle , peter fleischer , google 's global privacy counsel said that the company had made a mistake .
" we are profoundly sorry for mistakenly collecting payload data in the uk from unencrypted wireless networks , " he wrote .
" since we announced our mistake in may we have cooperated closely with the ico and worked to improve our internal controls .
as we have said before , we did not want this data , have never used any of it in our products or services , and have sought to delete it as quickly as possible .
we are in the process of confirming that there are no outstanding legal obligations upon us to retain the data , and will then ensure that it is quickly and safely deleted . "
previously , as recently as october 22 , google officials have apologized for the mistake and said that it would be changing its policies .
" we are mortified by what happened , but confident that these changes to our processes and structure will significantly improve our internal privacy and security practices for the benefit of all our users , " wrote alan eustace , google 's senior vice president of engineering and research , in a post published on october 22 on google 's public policy blog .
the american federal trade commission decided last week to drop its investigation against google , while in recent weeks , similar government agencies in italy , canada and spain have all pursued action against the company .
the investigations worldwide began earlier this year after german authorities in hamburg discovered the payload data in one of google 's vehicles , and they are continuing to investigate as well .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de space -pipe- 03.11.2010 russian space program on the rise großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : humans have been living aboard the iss for 10 years a decade after continuous human habitation on the international space station , russia takes the lead , and will be responsible for ferrying astronauts to the station .
meanwhile , china and india are also coming up . this week marks the 10th anniversary of continuous human habitation aboard the international space station .
despite the 16 countries that have collectively spent over $ 100 billion over the past decade , the station 's construction is still not complete .
next year , when the the project is expected to be finally completed , the international space community will have to exclusively rely on the russian space program to ferry astronauts to and from the station , as nasa is expected to launch one of its final space shuttle missions later this week .
that may bring a new level of prestige for the russian space program , which in 2011 will also celebrate its 50th anniversary of the launch of the first man into space , yuri gagarin .
russian cosmodrome slated to open in 2015 the russian space industry , which had become a shadow of itself after the collapse of the soviet union , is once again enjoying state support .
the government has increased spending on the space industry by 40 percent for each of the past five years .
in 2009 , it received a record $ 2.8 billion .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia will celebrate the 50th anniversary of soviet cosmonaut yuri gagarin 's space flight in 2011 russian prime minister vladimir putin also confirmed this fall that russia 's new $ 800 million vostochny cosmodorome in the country 's far east should be up and running by 2015 .
" i must say that the construction of the new space center , commissioned in 2007 , is one of the biggest and most ambitious initiatives in russia today , " he said in a speech earlier this year .
" not only will it confirm russia 's status as a technological leader and boost its potential in science and technology , but , just as importantly , it will allow hundreds , if not thousands , of young specialists to prove themselves , to show their talent , and to make their most ambitious plans come true . "
despite the united states ' re-evaluation of their role in the international space community , american authorities are putting a positive spin on a decreased american presence .
" space is expensive , " said robert navias , a nasa spokesperson , in an interview with deutsche welle .
" it 's hard to get into orbit , it 's very difficult to launch the spacecraft into orbit .
and by doing so together , we do so on a collective basis from an economic and technological standpoint that serves both nations much better than if we tried to do it ourselves . "

despite the 16 countries that have collectively spent over $ 100 billion over the past decade , the station 's construction is still not complete .
next year , when the the project is expected to be finally completed , the international space community will have to exclusively rely on the russian space program to ferry astronauts to and from the station , as nasa is expected to launch one of its final space shuttle missions later this week .

instead , he triggered a new uproar with an anti-gay comment . italian prime minister silvio berlusconi brushed off a growing scandal over his relationship with a young girl on tuesday , but drew fresh criticism for a comment about homosexuality .
" when i 'm in the presence of a beautiful girl , i look at her , " he said at the opening of a motorcycle industry show in milan .
" it 's better to have a passion for beautiful girls than to be gay . "
gay rights activists and opposition center-left politicians condemned the remark .
paolo patane , president of the gay rights group arcigay , said it was " gratuitous " and " vulgar . "
" it offends not only homosexual people but also women in general . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : actress julianne moore has also criticized berlusconi 's remarks actress julianne moore was in rome to present the " the kids are all right , " a film about a lesbian couple and their teenage children , at the rome film festival and reacted with dismay to berlusconi 's statement .
" i think it 's unfortunate , archaic and idiotic , " she said .
" to hint or say that there is something wrong with homosexuality … it 's unfortunate and it 's embarrassing when people continue to perpetuate these untruths . "
berlusconi not budging the most recent scandal facing berlusconi involves reports that a teenage girl named karima el mahroug was paid to attend raunchy parties at his villa near milan last year and that he later intervened and obtained her release when she was arrested for theft .
el mahroug turned 18 on tuesday .
despite newspaper speculation that the issue could bring down berlusconi 's government and lead to early elections , the prime minister said he and his coalition were in it for the long haul .
" you should be completely reassured about the government and about the fact that it 's a government that still has a majority that intends to govern until the end of its term , " he said .
berlusconi has faced down other sex scandals by saying that while he is " no saint , " he has never paid for sex .
his current term of office expires in 2013 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de space -pipe- 03.11.2010 russian space program on the rise großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : humans have been living aboard the iss for 10 years a decade after continuous human habitation on the international space station , russia takes the lead , and will be responsible for ferrying astronauts to the station .
meanwhile , china and india are also coming up . this week marks the 10th anniversary of continuous human habitation aboard the international space station .
despite the 16 countries that have collectively spent over $ 100 billion over the past decade , the station 's construction is still not complete .
next year , when the the project is expected to be finally completed , the international space community will have to exclusively rely on the russian space program to ferry astronauts to and from the station , as nasa is expected to launch one of its final space shuttle missions later this week .
that may bring a new level of prestige for the russian space program , which in 2011 will also celebrate its 50th anniversary of the launch of the first man into space , yuri gagarin .
russian cosmodrome slated to open in 2015 the russian space industry , which had become a shadow of itself after the collapse of the soviet union , is once again enjoying state support .
the government has increased spending on the space industry by 40 percent for each of the past five years .
in 2009 , it received a record $ 2.8 billion .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia will celebrate the 50th anniversary of soviet cosmonaut yuri gagarin 's space flight in 2011 russian prime minister vladimir putin also confirmed this fall that russia 's new $ 800 million vostochny cosmodorome in the country 's far east should be up and running by 2015 .
" i must say that the construction of the new space center , commissioned in 2007 , is one of the biggest and most ambitious initiatives in russia today , " he said in a speech earlier this year .
" not only will it confirm russia 's status as a technological leader and boost its potential in science and technology , but , just as importantly , it will allow hundreds , if not thousands , of young specialists to prove themselves , to show their talent , and to make their most ambitious plans come true . "
despite the united states ' re-evaluation of their role in the international space community , american authorities are putting a positive spin on a decreased american presence .
" space is expensive , " said robert navias , a nasa spokesperson , in an interview with deutsche welle .
" it 's hard to get into orbit , it 's very difficult to launch the spacecraft into orbit .
and by doing so together , we do so on a collective basis from an economic and technological standpoint that serves both nations much better than if we tried to do it ourselves . "
he also acknowledged that while russia will be responsible for bring astronauts to the iss , americans still have a lot to do .
" the russians in turn are mutually dependant on us for maintaining station 's operation since nasa has the lead role in mission operations , oversight of the station 's components , and the flight control capability of the station , " he added .
" so through our mutual dependence on one another we have actually built a stronger partnership on a global basis using each other 's expertise to be able to solve problems quickly . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in 2011 , endeavor is scheduled to be the final american space shuttle launch space research becoming more international the us said it planned to look to private companies to invest in future spacecraft .
but so far , no private companies have secured such investment .
meanwhile , the russian federal space agency is set to receive $ 306 million for u.s. astronauts to fly to the international space station in 2012 onboard a russian soyuz rocket .
however , the decision to ground the shuttles raises mixed emotions among us astronauts .
" well , it 's kind of sad that the space shuttle is going to be retired , " said mark kelly , commander of the last scheduled mission of us space shuttle endeavor in february 2011 , in an interview with deutsche welle .
" you know , it 's an incredible vehicle , there 's never been anything like it , that can carry huge payloads , over 30 thousand pounds into orbit , it has an airlock where we could do space walks , it has a robotic arm , we could manipulate payloads , we could capture satellites , we could bring satellites home .
i mean to bring home a payload that weighs 30 thousand pounds is just incredible , no spacecraft could every do that before .
so to see that capability go away is a little bit sad , but it 's been in the plan . "
however , as both moscow and washington are still leading the space race , their dominance could be soon challenged by india and china , which are funding and developing their own space programs .
the chinese shenzhou vii spacecraft is already in operation , and china 's first spacewalk took place in 2008 , and meanwhile , india has announced a manned spaceflight by 2014 .

german politicians are wondering what a divided american government will mean for europe and world politics . german politicians believe tuesday 's congressional elections in the united states will change the landscape of foreign policy .
the elections represent a major threat to us president barack obama 's power at home , as the opposition republicans gained a majority in the congress 's lower house , the house of representatives , and boosted their numbers in the senate .
a bigger role on the world stage ?
the german government 's coordinator for german-american relations , hans-ulrich klose , said wednesday he expected obama to turn his gaze outward in light of new difficulties in domestic politics .
he told national radio station deutschlandradio that the president would now be concentrating more on the mideast conflict .
" i hesitate to speak of a solution to the problems , but it would be good if there were more intelligent conflict management , " klose said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polenz says europe needs to play a bigger role on the world stage the chairman of the bundestag parliament 's foreign affairs committee , ruprecht polenz , also stressed that obama could maintain a strong role in international politics , as the president is only dependent on congress in matters of international diplomacy when it comes to ratifying treaties .
europe to ' step up to the plate . '
however , polenz took a different position from klose 's , positing that conflicts within american politics could weaken the us 's leading position in worldwide diplomacy .
" of course , the us 's role in the world will be judged by its partners according to how strong they are at home .
in that sense , -lsb- obama -rsb- is somewhat weakened , " polenz told deutsche welle .
polenz stressed that germany and europe would have to take a stronger position in global diplomacy if the us were to take a step back , especially in matters such as the mideast conflict , russian-american relations and china 's ascent to the world stage .
" we need solutions to certain conflicts and problems in this world , and if the americans ca n't focus on that as strongly as in the past , then europe will have to do more , " he said , adding , " we do n't have an eternity to answer as many foreign-policy questions as possible with one voice and act accordingly . "
" one message of this election is that we are now being put more to the challenge , " polenz added .
polenz said that europe was not capable of filling the us 's shoes in matters of world politics , but stressed that a more politically divided america needed europe 's support : " it will be important for us to put more effort into our relationship because we need to work together when one partner ca n't carry as much of the burden . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klose says democrats and republicans will have to cooperate more closely one place where europe will have to take on more responsibility , according to rainer stinner , foreign policy spokesperson for germany 's free democrats - the party of foreign minister guido westerwelle - is in the reshaping of the north atlantic treaty organization -lrb- nato -rrb- .
nato is currently forming its new strategic concept .
" if nato members agree that a missile defense shield is necessary , then it will surely need to be financed by all nato partners and can not all be put on the americans ' shoulders , " stinner said .
stalemate or renewed cooperation ?
the big question facing american politics is whether democrats and republicans can work together , or if increased control by the opposition republicans will mean a political stalemate .
polenz believes a standstill would be " fatal " for the us both at home and abroad .
klose and stinner , however , believe the two parties will be forced to work together .
stinner said that , should the republicans continue trying to block all legislation from the democrats , it could backfire against them in the next elections .
" the republicans would do well not to continue a purely oppositional politics , " he said , " but to try to work together with the president so that he ca n't position them as preventing -lsb- progress -rsb- . "

scientists still do not know when ancient primates began to migrate from being more to less promiscuous . although neanderthals have not lived in europe for 30,000 years , they continue to fascinate scientists around the world .
a new study from the united kingdom suggests that neanderthals had more partners than modern humans .
they reached this conclusion by comparing the ratio of different finger lengths that allow scientists to determine some kinds of behavior , including sexual promiscuity .
emma nelson , a doctoral student at the university of liverpool , had shown in previous research that high levels of in-utero androgens increase the length of the fourth , or ring , finger when compared to the second , or index finger .
the team found that a low ratio indicates higher levels of competitiveness , aggressiveness and more sexual partners , while a high ratio indicates more monogamy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neanderthals had a index-to-ring finger ratio of 0.928 , which is less than modern humans comparisons amongst four species in a paper published today in the british journal proceedings of the royal society b , the team compared the finger-length ratios amongst various ancient hominin species , including ardipithecus ramidus , a hominid who lived around 4.4 million years ago ; australopithecus afarensis , which lived around three to four million years ago ; neanderthals , who disappeared around 28,000 years ago ; and early humans dating back to 95,000 years ago .
" it is believed that prenatal androgens affect the genes responsible for the development of fingers , toes and the reproductive system , " said nelson in a statement .
" we have recently shown that promiscuous primate species have low index to ring finger ratios , while monogamous species have high ratios .
we used this information to estimate the social behavior of extinct apes and hominins .
although the fossil record is limited for this period , and more fossils are needed to confirm our findings , this method could prove to be an exciting new way of understanding how our social behavior has evolved . "
the study found that modern humans have an average of a 0.957 index-to-ring finger ratio , and are generally a more monogamous species , while chimps ' , gorillas ' and orangutans ' average ratio is at 0.91 , and are generally more promiscuous .
the researchers also found that an early modern human found in an israeli cave , dating back to approximately 95,000 years ago , had a ratio of 0.935 , which would be more promiscuous than modern humans as well .
neanderthals , meanwhile , had a ratio of 0.928 .
further study needed in an interview with the agence france presse , nelson added that the research team would like to be able to confirm their findings through other means .
anthropologists still do not agree when or why humans and their ancestors began to migrate from a more promiscuous mating system to a more monogamous one , given that the former group would hold an evolutionary advantage in terms of being able to spread their genes more quickly and more widely .
" pair-bonding , in a broad sense , is universal among humans , but it is not known when the transition from a promiscuous mating system to a stable bonded one occurred , " wrote the scientists in their scientific paper .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the findings could reveal more about mating practices amongst our ancestors disagreement amongst anthropologists however , not all scientists agree with these findings .
in an interview with the american news website , msnbc.com , another anthropologist who was not part of the study said that this correlation of finger ratios is not a " good predictor of any social behaviors . "
" in addition to the problem of using a poor predictor , this study has another problem that we often face with fossils - there are very few of them , and it 's not obvious which sample of living primates we should be comparing with them , " said john hawks , an anthropology professor at the university of wisconsin , madison .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de immigration -pipe- 03.11.2010 chancellor wants to expand ' integration courses ' for immigrants großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : around 1.8 million people will attend the courses germany intends to expand the program of courses to help immigrants to integrate .
chancellor merkel pointed to successful examples of integration and said society should put more effort into working with immigrants . by 2015 german chancellor angela merkel wants to give every immigrant the opportunity to take part in integration courses .
the government estimates that by that time around 1.8 million people will have attended the courses since they were first introduced in 2005 .
" we 're catching up in 10 years on what we failed to do in the previous 30 years , " merkel said at the end of an integration summit in berlin on wednesday .
" we want to be more concrete . "
that was the message of german chancellor angela merkel at the berlin integration summit .
she wants to set clear standards to make it easier to assess what germany has achieved , and what is still to be done on the issue of integration .
' multiculturalism has failed ' merkel said the notion that integration could be achieved simply by different living next to one another was outdated .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : politicians , experts and minority groups took part merkel , who said in a speech last month that " multiculturalism has failed , " set out to prove that integration would not happen by itself .
she said that true integration required much more energy and engagement from all of society .
the chancellor praised the atmosphere at the summit as being " the right working environment . "
the 120 participants , including politicians , economists , and representatives of the police and the media apparently exchanged " controversial opinions " with one another .
merkel said they had spoken openly about " what had yet to be achieved . "
for example , she pointed out that there was a lot of work still to do on the issue of violence in schools .
" there 's still a long way to go on this journey , " merkel commented .
the government says it will spend about 400 million euros -lrb- 560 million dollars -rrb- by 2014 on improving german language skills among the children of immigrants so they can perform better at school .
it is also seeking to help immigrants get their foreign qualifications recognised in germany , and to have more people from immigrant backgrounds working in the civil service and in the police force .
success stories there were some impressive examples of successes in immigration policy , merkel said .
she cited sport as an example .
the 2010 german world cup team was the most multicultural ever , with a number of players from turkish and african immigrant families .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and boehmer have drawn up an action plan maria boehmer is the government minister responsible for the issue of integration .
she echoed the chancellor 's words , saying that " a lot of ground had been gained " in the last few years .
she said there were more positive stories of integration " than had been told in the last few weeks . "
germany has been embroiled in a debate about integration since a prominent member of the board of the state bank , the bundesbank , sparked outrage in germany and abroad when he published a book which claimed that muslims themselves were in part responsible for failing to integrate into german society .
he was forced to resign from his post , but the debate simmered on .
boehmer cited a new national action plan , which should make progress in integration easier to follow , and will complement the current national integration plan .
she said that police , care workers and teachers could play a " bridging role " in helping immigrants to integrate .
some participants , however , criticized the lack of real results at the summit .
aydan oezoguz , who is responsible for integration in the opposition spd parliamentary group , called the action plan a " hotch-potch of measures that had already been agreed on . "
the spokesperson on migration policy for the left party , sevim dagdelen , said it was merely a " symbolic summit " that would not change the daily reality for immigrants in germany . ´ the federal statistics office says about 16 million people in germany come from a " migrant background " - just under 20 percent of the population .
of these , an estimated 4 million are muslim , mostly of turkish origin .

" pair-bonding , in a broad sense , is universal among humans , but it is not known when the transition from a promiscuous mating system to a stable bonded one occurred , " wrote the scientists in their scientific paper .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the findings could reveal more about mating practices amongst our ancestors disagreement amongst anthropologists however , not all scientists agree with these findings .
in an interview with the american news website , msnbc.com , another anthropologist who was not part of the study said that this correlation of finger ratios is not a " good predictor of any social behaviors . "
" in addition to the problem of using a poor predictor , this study has another problem that we often face with fossils - there are very few of them , and it 's not obvious which sample of living primates we should be comparing with them , " said john hawks , an anthropology professor at the university of wisconsin , madison .

instead , he triggered a new uproar with an anti-gay comment . italian prime minister silvio berlusconi brushed off a growing scandal over his relationship with a young girl on tuesday , but drew fresh criticism for a comment about homosexuality .
" when i 'm in the presence of a beautiful girl , i look at her , " he said at the opening of a motorcycle industry show in milan .
" it 's better to have a passion for beautiful girls than to be gay . "
gay rights activists and opposition center-left politicians condemned the remark .
paolo patane , president of the gay rights group arcigay , said it was " gratuitous " and " vulgar . "
" it offends not only homosexual people but also women in general . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : actress julianne moore has also criticized berlusconi 's remarks actress julianne moore was in rome to present the " the kids are all right , " a film about a lesbian couple and their teenage children , at the rome film festival and reacted with dismay to berlusconi 's statement .
" i think it 's unfortunate , archaic and idiotic , " she said .
" to hint or say that there is something wrong with homosexuality … it 's unfortunate and it 's embarrassing when people continue to perpetuate these untruths . "
berlusconi not budging the most recent scandal facing berlusconi involves reports that a teenage girl named karima el mahroug was paid to attend raunchy parties at his villa near milan last year and that he later intervened and obtained her release when she was arrested for theft .
el mahroug turned 18 on tuesday .
despite newspaper speculation that the issue could bring down berlusconi 's government and lead to early elections , the prime minister said he and his coalition were in it for the long haul .
" you should be completely reassured about the government and about the fact that it 's a government that still has a majority that intends to govern until the end of its term , " he said .
berlusconi has faced down other sex scandals by saying that while he is " no saint , " he has never paid for sex .
his current term of office expires in 2013 .

but as china booms , there is concern human life is being left on the wayside by power-hungry and corrupt officials . as the world expo in shanghai wound down , there was one exhibit at the chile pavilion that continued to attract the masses .
the phoenix 2 capsule , which helped rescue 33 chilean miners last month , triggered a debate about mine safety in china . one visitor said that the rescue operation in chile showed a respect for human life that china could learn from .
just days after the chilean miners were rescued , some 30 of their chinese colleagues in a mine in henan province died in an explosion . " the mine was unsafe but they don ’ t care about worker safety .
all they care about is production , " the mother of one of the dead miners said angrily . safety laws often ignored federal safety laws and directives from beijing are often ignored .
former functionaries themselves say that china ’ s economic boom is partly based on blood . " all they care about is developing the economy , " says zhou xiaozheng , a sociologist at the people ’ s university in beijing .
" they just look at gdp in order to gauge development .
that ’ s how they are judged and that ’ s what their promotions are based upon . " in its rhetoric , the central government in beijing preaches about sustainable growth , about the environment and development without waste of resources .
prime minister wen jiabao often talks about people-oriented policies .
" the government acquired its power from the people , all power goes back to the people and we have to do everything for the people , " he recently said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many chinese are getting rich but some say the poor are being sacrificed however , for many these words are like a slap in the face .
only the ruling communist party is to blame for the fact that there are no controls over those in power , that there is no transparency , no checks and balances . officials and businessmen in cahoots environmental activist wu lihong , who has long campaigned against the pollution of lake taihu , says there is a tangled web of corruption and nepotism , with officials and factory owners working hand-in-hand . " they are in cahoots and they have the same interests .
that 's why the central government never finds out the truth and does not know about local issues .
the central government has no power – that ’ s one of our system 's problems . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : migrant workers are flocking to the cities to find work but they are often subject to abuse there is also corruption at the highest level .
at the beginning of the year , a former supreme court judge was sentenced to lifetime imprisonment for taking bribes and corruption charges .
last month , the former head of china ’ s nuclear agency was expelled from the party . " power creates corruption , " says zhou xiaozheng .
" and absolute power creates absolute corruption .
we humans are not saints .
anyone who is in power for a long time becomes corrupt .
that ’ s why we have to monitor those in power better . " but , he adds , this is what is currently not possible in china .
the media have restricted powers of control .
censorship in china is all-pervasive in china .
even though the media are allowed to report on accidents such as the one in henan , the deeper causes usually remain unexamined . author : ruth kirchner -lrb- act -rrb- editor : arun chowdhury send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ? 9797 media center watch and listen explore new content daily in dw 's multimedia archive .

another package addressed to italian prime minister silvio berlusconi was discovered on a cargo plane flying to paris from athens .
the plane made an emergency landing in bologna , and the package caught fire while being checked by authorities on the ground .
a third package led to the arrest of two suspects on monday .
the two men , aged 22 and 24 , were discovered with a package containing explosives that was addressed to french president nicolas sarkozy .
searching for suspects the swiss , russian , chilean and bulgarian embassies in athens were also among the targets of the letter bombs .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a bomb made it to the german chancellory most of the bombs were destroyed in controlled blasts by police , but there was an explosion at the swiss embassy that resulted in no injuries .
police believe the packages are being sent by far-left militants , who are thought to have carried out small bomb attacks on political and international targets in the past .
in addition to monday 's two arrests , police have released photos of five militants believed to be connected to the parcel bombs .
on tuesday , greek prime minister george papandreou said the suspects were " trying in vain to disrupt social peace in the country with criminal acts . "
tighter controls chancellor merkel was on an official visit to belgium at the time the package was discovered in berlin .
she did say , however , that the recent series of package bombs from greece and yemen indicated a need for stricter controls on freight shipping between the european union , the united states , and around the globe .
" this is urgently about implementing stricter world-wide controls to prevent terror attacks , " merkel said in an interview with the passauer neue presse newspaper .

the rift between the democrats and the republicans is deeper than it ever was .
it 's high time to redeem this pledge of bipartisanship .
it makes just as little sense to always blame the republicans - who indeed were mainly experts in saying " no " - as it does to constantly point the finger at his predecessor .
it 's true : george w. bush did drive the country into a crisis .
but that is in the past .
washington is now personified by barack obama as he found out bitterly on this election day .

scientists still do not know when ancient primates began to migrate from being more to less promiscuous . although neanderthals have not lived in europe for 30,000 years , they continue to fascinate scientists around the world .
a new study from the united kingdom suggests that neanderthals had more partners than modern humans .
they reached this conclusion by comparing the ratio of different finger lengths that allow scientists to determine some kinds of behavior , including sexual promiscuity .
emma nelson , a doctoral student at the university of liverpool , had shown in previous research that high levels of in-utero androgens increase the length of the fourth , or ring , finger when compared to the second , or index finger .
the team found that a low ratio indicates higher levels of competitiveness , aggressiveness and more sexual partners , while a high ratio indicates more monogamy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neanderthals had a index-to-ring finger ratio of 0.928 , which is less than modern humans comparisons amongst four species in a paper published today in the british journal proceedings of the royal society b , the team compared the finger-length ratios amongst various ancient hominin species , including ardipithecus ramidus , a hominid who lived around 4.4 million years ago ; australopithecus afarensis , which lived around three to four million years ago ; neanderthals , who disappeared around 28,000 years ago ; and early humans dating back to 95,000 years ago .
" it is believed that prenatal androgens affect the genes responsible for the development of fingers , toes and the reproductive system , " said nelson in a statement .
" we have recently shown that promiscuous primate species have low index to ring finger ratios , while monogamous species have high ratios .
we used this information to estimate the social behavior of extinct apes and hominins .
although the fossil record is limited for this period , and more fossils are needed to confirm our findings , this method could prove to be an exciting new way of understanding how our social behavior has evolved . "
the study found that modern humans have an average of a 0.957 index-to-ring finger ratio , and are generally a more monogamous species , while chimps ' , gorillas ' and orangutans ' average ratio is at 0.91 , and are generally more promiscuous .
the researchers also found that an early modern human found in an israeli cave , dating back to approximately 95,000 years ago , had a ratio of 0.935 , which would be more promiscuous than modern humans as well .
neanderthals , meanwhile , had a ratio of 0.928 .
further study needed in an interview with the agence france presse , nelson added that the research team would like to be able to confirm their findings through other means .
anthropologists still do not agree when or why humans and their ancestors began to migrate from a more promiscuous mating system to a more monogamous one , given that the former group would hold an evolutionary advantage in terms of being able to spread their genes more quickly and more widely .
" pair-bonding , in a broad sense , is universal among humans , but it is not known when the transition from a promiscuous mating system to a stable bonded one occurred , " wrote the scientists in their scientific paper .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the findings could reveal more about mating practices amongst our ancestors disagreement amongst anthropologists however , not all scientists agree with these findings .
in an interview with the american news website , msnbc.com , another anthropologist who was not part of the study said that this correlation of finger ratios is not a " good predictor of any social behaviors . "
" in addition to the problem of using a poor predictor , this study has another problem that we often face with fossils - there are very few of them , and it 's not obvious which sample of living primates we should be comparing with them , " said john hawks , an anthropology professor at the university of wisconsin , madison .

but free speech is still in danger from powerful organized crime syndicates intent on silencing reporters and the disturbing creep of monopolized media industries under the auspices of sovereign leaders . the country generating most concern is mexico , where a total of 68 journalists and media workers have been killed and a further 11 abducted since 2000 .
mexico has become one of the deadliest places in the world for journalists .
the rising power of drug cartels and the mexican government 's violent crackdown on narcotics gangs has turned areas of the country into battlegrounds . journalists there working on stories about the drug war live in constant fear of being kidnapped , tortured and murdered by cartels desperate to silence the media 's reporting on their activities and members .
these alliances are eager to gain control of the airwaves .
the international press freedom organization reporters without borders claims that drug gangs target journalists with impunity , as prosecutions relating to these crimes are very rarely completed . mexican government failing journalists , campaigners claim bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : journalists continue to die while reporting on mexico 's drug war reporters without borders also claims that mexico 's special federal attorney 's office for combating violence against the media has failed to make much of an impression since its creation in 2006 .
the myriad departments dedicated to press freedom in the executive , legislative and judicial branches of government often cancel each other out through passivity or negligence . " the mexican government has done almost nothing to protect journalists , " benoit hervieu , the americas expert at reporters without borders , told deutsche welle .
" the special attorney charged with following up the investigations into crimes against journalists has been given over 500 files , and maybe one percent of them have been looked into .
it is very hard to follow up investigations in mexico . " the mexican government has also been dogged by accusations that certain sectors of the state apparatus have been infiltrated by organized crime gangs .
it is alleged that the authorities are also complicit , if not entirely responsible , for serious human rights violations including the suppression of free speech . " some government officials are involved in the suppression of the media and the violence committed against journalists , so investigations get hindered at an official level , " hervieu said .
" it is very hard to pursue these cases .
plus bureaucracy is terrible in mexico .
it is one of the worst countries in latin america for this . " fear drives journalists to self-censor journalists in mexico are living in such fear that there is a concern that the constant threat to their lives is leading to a form of self-censorship in an attempt to protect themselves . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pressure from cartels force journalists to self-censorship only last week , el diario , a newspaper in the mexican border city of ciudad juárez , appealed directly in a front-page story to the drug cartels which have turned the city into a war zone and who have taken a number of journalists ' lives .
in the article , the paper asked for reporting and censorship guidelines . " gentlemen … please explain to us … what you would like us to publish or stop publishing , " the statement read .
" the last thing we want is for another one of our colleagues to fall victim to your gunshots . " " the cartels are obviously involved and responsible for attacks and media suppression but they also provide the government with a very convenient excuse , " said hervieu .
" it is so easy for the government to blame the cartels .
this is war , and in war confusion is high .
it is therefore easy to say that the enemy is responsible .
but in some of the most dangerous regions of mexico , it is the police and the army which is the most feared . " while mexico is considered the most dangerous place in latin america for press freedom , it is not the only country in the region where journalists ' lives are at risk .
in honduras , eight journalists have been killed so far this year by drug traffickers or in violent struggles with government forces in protests over land reform and the political situation in the country since the government was overthrown in 2009 . " in honduras , the violence came after the coup in 2009 and the attacks on journalists came as revenge for dissent during the unrest , " hervieu said .
" this political violence continues with no investigations .
honduras , along with mexico and colombia , is one of the most dangerous places for journalists in latin america . " democratically-elected leaders building media monopolies elsewhere , the rise of government-backed media monopolies and the election of leaders keen to suppress dissenting voices are having detrimental effects on press freedom in countries such as venezuela , ecuador , argentina and bolivia . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chavez forced a number of media outlets to close down dictatorships may be a thing of the past in most latin america countries , apart from cuba , but leaders like venezuelan president hugo chávez are exercising a level of control similar to that favored by the totalitarian regimes they were elected to replace .
chávez has closed down a television network , 32 radio stations and two local television channels allegedly because they criticized a political ally . rights groups accuse both president rafael correa of ecuador and argentina 's leader cristina fernández of increasing their governments ' grip on media institutions to an unhealthy degree . correa 's regime now controls some 20 media companies in ecuador and has brought in legislation which limits ownership of media outlets and what these outlets can broadcast in certain circumstances .
this legislation was cited during a period of unrest in september when correa ordered all television and radio stations to broadcast only government-supplied information . dismantling powerful opponent in argentina bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fernández has her eye on increasing favorable coverage meanwhile in argentina , fernández is allegedly engaged in a campaign to break up the country 's biggest media conglomerate , the clarín group , after it began broadcasting negative coverage of her and her recently deceased husband and former president néstor kirchner . by applying pressure to some of the group 's most influential contract partners , cancelling the company 's license to provide internet service , and sending tax officials to raid the group 's headquarters , fernández is determined to dismantle a powerful mouthpiece of dissent while increasing government advertising revenue in a bid to replace the clarín group 's negative content with more government-friendly coverage . " clarín , owner of newspapers , radio stations , broadcast and cable television outlets , and an internet service provider , has had an antagonistic relationship with fernandez-kirchner since a 2008 conflict with the farming sector over a tax raise , " according to carlos lauría , senior program coordinator for the americas at the committee to protect journalists -lrb- cpj -rrb- .
he said the government had accused clarín and other private media of biased coverage . " journalists at clarín and national newspaper la nación believe the government is engaged in an intimidating campaign to silence critics , " lauría said . meanwhile both bolivia and nicaragua have passed laws which allow their governments to close media outlets deemed disruptive while allegedly prosecuting and imprisoning critical reporters on trumped up charges such as money laundering . media campaigners have a pessimistic view of the state of press freedom in latin america and while there are efforts being made to turn things around , few have much hope of widespread change . " what is needed is open debate , " said hervieu .
" in argentina and uruguay , there was a debate among teachers and intellectuals about how the media could regain its full freedom .
that 's a start . " however , he said in mexico , it would take a massive institutional reform with the help of the united states to bring about change .

" democratically-elected leaders building media monopolies elsewhere , the rise of government-backed media monopolies and the election of leaders keen to suppress dissenting voices are having detrimental effects on press freedom in countries such as venezuela , ecuador , argentina and bolivia . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chavez forced a number of media outlets to close down dictatorships may be a thing of the past in most latin america countries , apart from cuba , but leaders like venezuelan president hugo chávez are exercising a level of control similar to that favored by the totalitarian regimes they were elected to replace .
chávez has closed down a television network , 32 radio stations and two local television channels allegedly because they criticized a political ally . rights groups accuse both president rafael correa of ecuador and argentina 's leader cristina fernández of increasing their governments ' grip on media institutions to an unhealthy degree . correa 's regime now controls some 20 media companies in ecuador and has brought in legislation which limits ownership of media outlets and what these outlets can broadcast in certain circumstances .
this legislation was cited during a period of unrest in september when correa ordered all television and radio stations to broadcast only government-supplied information . dismantling powerful opponent in argentina bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fernández has her eye on increasing favorable coverage meanwhile in argentina , fernández is allegedly engaged in a campaign to break up the country 's biggest media conglomerate , the clarín group , after it began broadcasting negative coverage of her and her recently deceased husband and former president néstor kirchner . by applying pressure to some of the group 's most influential contract partners , cancelling the company 's license to provide internet service , and sending tax officials to raid the group 's headquarters , fernández is determined to dismantle a powerful mouthpiece of dissent while increasing government advertising revenue in a bid to replace the clarín group 's negative content with more government-friendly coverage . " clarín , owner of newspapers , radio stations , broadcast and cable television outlets , and an internet service provider , has had an antagonistic relationship with fernandez-kirchner since a 2008 conflict with the farming sector over a tax raise , " according to carlos lauría , senior program coordinator for the americas at the committee to protect journalists -lrb- cpj -rrb- .
he said the government had accused clarín and other private media of biased coverage . " journalists at clarín and national newspaper la nación believe the government is engaged in an intimidating campaign to silence critics , " lauría said . meanwhile both bolivia and nicaragua have passed laws which allow their governments to close media outlets deemed disruptive while allegedly prosecuting and imprisoning critical reporters on trumped up charges such as money laundering . media campaigners have a pessimistic view of the state of press freedom in latin america and while there are efforts being made to turn things around , few have much hope of widespread change . " what is needed is open debate , " said hervieu .
" in argentina and uruguay , there was a debate among teachers and intellectuals about how the media could regain its full freedom .
that 's a start . " however , he said in mexico , it would take a massive institutional reform with the help of the united states to bring about change . " but the situation as a whole is desperate , " hervieu said . author : nick amies editor : sabina casagrande send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the total cost is estimated at 1.3 billion euros .
the government will not contribute to the bid 's marketing costs of 33 million euros , but will step in to help if the organizing committee runs up a deficit .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : katarina witt won gold for east germany in 1984 " i am delighted we have received this wholehearted endorsement from elected representatives at all levels of government , " witt said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de foreign trade -pipe- 03.11.2010 industry leaders warn against overreaction on air freight security großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : industry leaders say total security is a politicians ' fantasy as air cargo security is tightened around europe , german industry leaders warn that expensive checks on freight would damage world trade .
total security is simply a politician 's fantasy , they say . the pressure was on the german government when it was revealed sunday that a us-bound bomb discovered on a cargo plane in london had passed through germany 's cologne bonn airport .
all flights - first cargo , then passenger services – from the bomb 's country of origin , yemen , were suspended .
interior minister thomas de maiziere was quick to announce that investigations would follow .
" air freight has been relatively under-monitored up to now .
evidently they recognized that and exploited it .
this means changes for the air freight business . "
transport minister peter ramsauer echoed his colleague and underlined the swiftness of the government 's measures .
" our security measures are meant to guarantee that no freight will get to germany from yemen , " he said .
" now possible gaps in the air freight security system have to be uncovered and closed . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ramsauer said security gaps need to be uncovered and closed time is money but german industry leaders are worried that the government may be lining up knee-jerk security measures that could prove costly .
" the safety checks are becoming more bureaucratic and cumbersome .
that costs time , and time is money , " axel nitschke , export economy chief at the german association of chambers of commerce and industry -lrb- dihk -rrb- , told the handelsblatt newspaper dierk mueller , general manager of the american chamber of commerce in germany , told deutsche welle that talk of extra checks was little more than a security blanket for politicians eager to cover their backs .
the us government has already passed a law stating that all cargo containers entering the us by sea or air have to be scanned , but this is a task that thwarts all logistics .
" this law is already in place , but not implemented , " mueller said .
" the us government said we must postpone implementation until we know how to do it .
even if you have all the money in the world , no-one knows how to do it .
there is just no 100 percent security . "
physically impossible the technological obstacles are practically insurmountable .
" air freight is a little easier .
the containers are smaller , but still , you have to do x-raying and computer tomography , because x-raying ca n't detect certain types of plastic explosives .
even that would cost enormous amounts of money . "
" and then you have to tell where these things come from , " he added .
" even if all the major western hemisphere countries say , ' we have 100 percent safety procedures ' , they would still need all the paperwork – stamps and stamps and papers and papers – there is no way to do it 100 percent .
you always have some countries not participating . "
the german government has already admitted as much .
jan muecke , the parliamentary state secretary in the federal ministry of transportation , said monday : " it is practically impossible to scan the entire freight , given the current quantity . "
even if the logistical and technological problems could be surmounted , mueller believes that tightening security will always damage the economy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : authorities fear terrorists have found a gap in airport security " the governments will never pay this .
the consumer will always pay for the extra costs , " he said .
" and it 's not just a matter of money , it 's also the delay .
spare parts for airplanes or special machines sometimes have to be delivered in a few hours . "
" the delay will mean a lack of quality , a lack of punctuality , lack of efficiency , so it will be detrimental to the world economy in the end . "
practical solutions mueller believes that , as with the illegal drugs trade , the only practical solution is to infiltrate the criminal organizations themselves .
" if all this worked , we would not have illegal drugs going to the us , " he said .
" but we have hundreds of tons being illegally imported to the us every year .
these things can not be prevented from entering the country .
we can do something to control the mafia and the terrorists , but not the product itself . "
in germany , federal police under the authority of the interior ministry are responsible for searching passengers , but security for cargo planes comes under the remit of the transport ministry , through the federal agency of aviation -lrb- lba -rrb- .
cargo companies like the german dhl also carry out their own security checks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scanning freight is time-consuming and expensive " of course , to protect against dangers , we have to ensure that safety comes first , " dihk boss martin wansleben told deutsche welle .
" the minute check of every single delivery at the airport has technical and organizational limits .
that is why it is so important that a secure chain of delivery is introduced , with complete supervision from the dispatcher to the airport . "
to achieve this , wansleben believes that existing european union regulations need to be better implemented .
" the eu 's prescribed certification of known dispatchers and regulated commissioners should finally be introduced by the federal agency of aviation , " he said .
" in terms of value , around 35-40 percent of international trade is processed through air freight , " wansleben added .
" these are particularly valuable , urgent , or fragile goods .
that means any interference in air freight will lead to significant costs . "

the move comes as canada , spain and , most recently , italy are scrutinizing the california company . in an announcement wednesday , british data protection authorities said there was a " significant breach of the data protection act " and that google uk would be subject to an audit .
further , it added , the company must promise that similar data breaches do not occur again .
the uk authorities had once again taken up the privacy case against google late last month after google had revealed further details that it had obtained " wifi data . "
that data included passwords and e-mails while google was sending cars along british streets and in other countries for its street view service .
earlier this year , the information commissioner 's office -lrb- ico -rrb- had said that it had found " no wrongdoing " on google 's part , but re-opened an investigation last week .
" it is my view that the collection of this information was not fair or lawful and constitutes a significant breach of the first principle of the data protection act , " said christopher graham , the uk information commissioner , in a statement published wednesday on the ico 's website .
" the most appropriate and proportionate regulatory action in these circumstances is to get written legal assurance from google that this will not happen again – and to follow this up with an ico audit . "
the ico elaborated that it had declined to seek monetary damages against the silicon valley company as it would have been too legally difficult to prove .
" monetary penalties can only be served when a strict set of criteria is satisfied , including that the breach was likely to cause substantial harm or substantial distress – this alone would be very hard to prove in this case , " wrote kirsty mccaskill , an ico spokesperson , in a statement provided to deutsche welle .
" the vast majority of the pay-load data was also collected prior to 6 april 2010 , before our new powers came into force . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the vehicles used to create street view inadvertantly collected the data google says google has admitted guilt in a written statement also provided to deutsche welle , peter fleischer , google 's global privacy counsel said that the company had made a mistake .
" we are profoundly sorry for mistakenly collecting payload data in the uk from unencrypted wireless networks , " he wrote .
" since we announced our mistake in may we have cooperated closely with the ico and worked to improve our internal controls .
as we have said before , we did not want this data , have never used any of it in our products or services , and have sought to delete it as quickly as possible .
we are in the process of confirming that there are no outstanding legal obligations upon us to retain the data , and will then ensure that it is quickly and safely deleted . "
previously , as recently as october 22 , google officials have apologized for the mistake and said that it would be changing its policies .
" we are mortified by what happened , but confident that these changes to our processes and structure will significantly improve our internal privacy and security practices for the benefit of all our users , " wrote alan eustace , google 's senior vice president of engineering and research , in a post published on october 22 on google 's public policy blog .
the american federal trade commission decided last week to drop its investigation against google , while in recent weeks , similar government agencies in italy , canada and spain have all pursued action against the company .
the investigations worldwide began earlier this year after german authorities in hamburg discovered the payload data in one of google 's vehicles , and they are continuing to investigate as well .

chancellor merkel pointed to successful examples of integration and said society should put more effort into working with immigrants . by 2015 german chancellor angela merkel wants to give every immigrant the opportunity to take part in integration courses .
the government estimates that by that time around 1.8 million people will have attended the courses since they were first introduced in 2005 .
" we 're catching up in 10 years on what we failed to do in the previous 30 years , " merkel said at the end of an integration summit in berlin on wednesday .
" we want to be more concrete . "
that was the message of german chancellor angela merkel at the berlin integration summit .
she wants to set clear standards to make it easier to assess what germany has achieved , and what is still to be done on the issue of integration .
' multiculturalism has failed ' merkel said the notion that integration could be achieved simply by different living next to one another was outdated .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : politicians , experts and minority groups took part merkel , who said in a speech last month that " multiculturalism has failed , " set out to prove that integration would not happen by itself .
she said that true integration required much more energy and engagement from all of society .
the chancellor praised the atmosphere at the summit as being " the right working environment . "
the 120 participants , including politicians , economists , and representatives of the police and the media apparently exchanged " controversial opinions " with one another .
merkel said they had spoken openly about " what had yet to be achieved . "
for example , she pointed out that there was a lot of work still to do on the issue of violence in schools .
" there 's still a long way to go on this journey , " merkel commented .
the government says it will spend about 400 million euros -lrb- 560 million dollars -rrb- by 2014 on improving german language skills among the children of immigrants so they can perform better at school .
it is also seeking to help immigrants get their foreign qualifications recognised in germany , and to have more people from immigrant backgrounds working in the civil service and in the police force .
success stories there were some impressive examples of successes in immigration policy , merkel said .
she cited sport as an example .
the 2010 german world cup team was the most multicultural ever , with a number of players from turkish and african immigrant families .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and boehmer have drawn up an action plan maria boehmer is the government minister responsible for the issue of integration .
she echoed the chancellor 's words , saying that " a lot of ground had been gained " in the last few years .
she said there were more positive stories of integration " than had been told in the last few weeks . "
germany has been embroiled in a debate about integration since a prominent member of the board of the state bank , the bundesbank , sparked outrage in germany and abroad when he published a book which claimed that muslims themselves were in part responsible for failing to integrate into german society .
he was forced to resign from his post , but the debate simmered on .
boehmer cited a new national action plan , which should make progress in integration easier to follow , and will complement the current national integration plan .
she said that police , care workers and teachers could play a " bridging role " in helping immigrants to integrate .
some participants , however , criticized the lack of real results at the summit .
aydan oezoguz , who is responsible for integration in the opposition spd parliamentary group , called the action plan a " hotch-potch of measures that had already been agreed on . "
the spokesperson on migration policy for the left party , sevim dagdelen , said it was merely a " symbolic summit " that would not change the daily reality for immigrants in germany . ´ the federal statistics office says about 16 million people in germany come from a " migrant background " - just under 20 percent of the population .
of these , an estimated 4 million are muslim , mostly of turkish origin .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de press freedom -pipe- 03.11.2010 media suppression , violence against journalists increases in latin america großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : latin america is experiencing a worrying return to censorship press freedom campaigners and journalism associations are increasingly concerned at what many describe as the dawning of a new era of media suppression in a number of latin american countries . while journalists no longer face the threats associated with the institutionalized death squads of the past , a new shadow is being cast over free speech and objective reporting in nations which have long since cast off the yoke of dictatorship . government-controlled censorship and the targeting of journalists by the state security apparatus may be part of many latin american countries ' dark history .
but free speech is still in danger from powerful organized crime syndicates intent on silencing reporters and the disturbing creep of monopolized media industries under the auspices of sovereign leaders . the country generating most concern is mexico , where a total of 68 journalists and media workers have been killed and a further 11 abducted since 2000 .
mexico has become one of the deadliest places in the world for journalists .
the rising power of drug cartels and the mexican government 's violent crackdown on narcotics gangs has turned areas of the country into battlegrounds . journalists there working on stories about the drug war live in constant fear of being kidnapped , tortured and murdered by cartels desperate to silence the media 's reporting on their activities and members .
these alliances are eager to gain control of the airwaves .
the international press freedom organization reporters without borders claims that drug gangs target journalists with impunity , as prosecutions relating to these crimes are very rarely completed . mexican government failing journalists , campaigners claim bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : journalists continue to die while reporting on mexico 's drug war reporters without borders also claims that mexico 's special federal attorney 's office for combating violence against the media has failed to make much of an impression since its creation in 2006 .
the myriad departments dedicated to press freedom in the executive , legislative and judicial branches of government often cancel each other out through passivity or negligence . " the mexican government has done almost nothing to protect journalists , " benoit hervieu , the americas expert at reporters without borders , told deutsche welle .
" the special attorney charged with following up the investigations into crimes against journalists has been given over 500 files , and maybe one percent of them have been looked into .
it is very hard to follow up investigations in mexico . " the mexican government has also been dogged by accusations that certain sectors of the state apparatus have been infiltrated by organized crime gangs .
it is alleged that the authorities are also complicit , if not entirely responsible , for serious human rights violations including the suppression of free speech . " some government officials are involved in the suppression of the media and the violence committed against journalists , so investigations get hindered at an official level , " hervieu said .
" it is very hard to pursue these cases .
plus bureaucracy is terrible in mexico .
it is one of the worst countries in latin america for this . " fear drives journalists to self-censor journalists in mexico are living in such fear that there is a concern that the constant threat to their lives is leading to a form of self-censorship in an attempt to protect themselves . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pressure from cartels force journalists to self-censorship only last week , el diario , a newspaper in the mexican border city of ciudad juárez , appealed directly in a front-page story to the drug cartels which have turned the city into a war zone and who have taken a number of journalists ' lives .
in the article , the paper asked for reporting and censorship guidelines . " gentlemen … please explain to us … what you would like us to publish or stop publishing , " the statement read .
" the last thing we want is for another one of our colleagues to fall victim to your gunshots . " " the cartels are obviously involved and responsible for attacks and media suppression but they also provide the government with a very convenient excuse , " said hervieu .
" it is so easy for the government to blame the cartels .
this is war , and in war confusion is high .
it is therefore easy to say that the enemy is responsible .
but in some of the most dangerous regions of mexico , it is the police and the army which is the most feared . " while mexico is considered the most dangerous place in latin america for press freedom , it is not the only country in the region where journalists ' lives are at risk .
in honduras , eight journalists have been killed so far this year by drug traffickers or in violent struggles with government forces in protests over land reform and the political situation in the country since the government was overthrown in 2009 . " in honduras , the violence came after the coup in 2009 and the attacks on journalists came as revenge for dissent during the unrest , " hervieu said .
" this political violence continues with no investigations .
honduras , along with mexico and colombia , is one of the most dangerous places for journalists in latin america . " democratically-elected leaders building media monopolies elsewhere , the rise of government-backed media monopolies and the election of leaders keen to suppress dissenting voices are having detrimental effects on press freedom in countries such as venezuela , ecuador , argentina and bolivia . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chavez forced a number of media outlets to close down dictatorships may be a thing of the past in most latin america countries , apart from cuba , but leaders like venezuelan president hugo chávez are exercising a level of control similar to that favored by the totalitarian regimes they were elected to replace .
chávez has closed down a television network , 32 radio stations and two local television channels allegedly because they criticized a political ally . rights groups accuse both president rafael correa of ecuador and argentina 's leader cristina fernández of increasing their governments ' grip on media institutions to an unhealthy degree . correa 's regime now controls some 20 media companies in ecuador and has brought in legislation which limits ownership of media outlets and what these outlets can broadcast in certain circumstances .
this legislation was cited during a period of unrest in september when correa ordered all television and radio stations to broadcast only government-supplied information . dismantling powerful opponent in argentina bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fernández has her eye on increasing favorable coverage meanwhile in argentina , fernández is allegedly engaged in a campaign to break up the country 's biggest media conglomerate , the clarín group , after it began broadcasting negative coverage of her and her recently deceased husband and former president néstor kirchner . by applying pressure to some of the group 's most influential contract partners , cancelling the company 's license to provide internet service , and sending tax officials to raid the group 's headquarters , fernández is determined to dismantle a powerful mouthpiece of dissent while increasing government advertising revenue in a bid to replace the clarín group 's negative content with more government-friendly coverage . " clarín , owner of newspapers , radio stations , broadcast and cable television outlets , and an internet service provider , has had an antagonistic relationship with fernandez-kirchner since a 2008 conflict with the farming sector over a tax raise , " according to carlos lauría , senior program coordinator for the americas at the committee to protect journalists -lrb- cpj -rrb- .
he said the government had accused clarín and other private media of biased coverage . " journalists at clarín and national newspaper la nación believe the government is engaged in an intimidating campaign to silence critics , " lauría said . meanwhile both bolivia and nicaragua have passed laws which allow their governments to close media outlets deemed disruptive while allegedly prosecuting and imprisoning critical reporters on trumped up charges such as money laundering . media campaigners have a pessimistic view of the state of press freedom in latin america and while there are efforts being made to turn things around , few have much hope of widespread change . " what is needed is open debate , " said hervieu .
" in argentina and uruguay , there was a debate among teachers and intellectuals about how the media could regain its full freedom .
that 's a start . " however , he said in mexico , it would take a massive institutional reform with the help of the united states to bring about change . " but the situation as a whole is desperate , " hervieu said . author : nick amies editor : sabina casagrande send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the move comes as canada , spain and , most recently , italy are scrutinizing the california company . in an announcement wednesday , british data protection authorities said there was a " significant breach of the data protection act " and that google uk would be subject to an audit .
further , it added , the company must promise that similar data breaches do not occur again .
the uk authorities had once again taken up the privacy case against google late last month after google had revealed further details that it had obtained " wifi data . "
that data included passwords and e-mails while google was sending cars along british streets and in other countries for its street view service .
earlier this year , the information commissioner 's office -lrb- ico -rrb- had said that it had found " no wrongdoing " on google 's part , but re-opened an investigation last week .
" it is my view that the collection of this information was not fair or lawful and constitutes a significant breach of the first principle of the data protection act , " said christopher graham , the uk information commissioner , in a statement published wednesday on the ico 's website .
" the most appropriate and proportionate regulatory action in these circumstances is to get written legal assurance from google that this will not happen again – and to follow this up with an ico audit . "
the ico elaborated that it had declined to seek monetary damages against the silicon valley company as it would have been too legally difficult to prove .
" monetary penalties can only be served when a strict set of criteria is satisfied , including that the breach was likely to cause substantial harm or substantial distress – this alone would be very hard to prove in this case , " wrote kirsty mccaskill , an ico spokesperson , in a statement provided to deutsche welle .
" the vast majority of the pay-load data was also collected prior to 6 april 2010 , before our new powers came into force . ”

" since we announced our mistake in may we have cooperated closely with the ico and worked to improve our internal controls .
as we have said before , we did not want this data , have never used any of it in our products or services , and have sought to delete it as quickly as possible .
we are in the process of confirming that there are no outstanding legal obligations upon us to retain the data , and will then ensure that it is quickly and safely deleted . "
previously , as recently as october 22 , google officials have apologized for the mistake and said that it would be changing its policies .
" we are mortified by what happened , but confident that these changes to our processes and structure will significantly improve our internal privacy and security practices for the benefit of all our users , " wrote alan eustace , google 's senior vice president of engineering and research , in a post published on october 22 on google 's public policy blog .
the american federal trade commission decided last week to drop its investigation against google , while in recent weeks , similar government agencies in italy , canada and spain have all pursued action against the company .
the investigations worldwide began earlier this year after german authorities in hamburg discovered the payload data in one of google 's vehicles , and they are continuing to investigate as well .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de united states -pipe- 03.11.2010 obama concedes defeat in house , pledges to work with republicans großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the balance of power is shifting in the us congress president barack obama admits that he took a beating in the mid-term elections as republicans storm into the house of representatives .
the democrats manage to keep a slim majority in the senate . us republicans won a huge majority in the house of representatives in midterm elections , delivering a blow president barack obama described as a " shellacking . "
" i am not recommending for every future president that they take a shellacking like i did last night , " obama said in a news conference on wednesday .
" i am sure there are easier ways to learn these lessons . "
the conservative republican party gained at least 60 seats in the house of representatives , the biggest shift of congressional power since 1948 and more than enough to win control of the 435-member lower chamber .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : john boehner is set to become the new house speaker the vote toppled democrat nancy pelosi from her position as speaker of the house , leaving ohio republic and house minority leader john boehner ready to fill the position .
speaking as almost all of the polls across the country had closed , boehner pledged to cut government spending .
in a victory rally at the republican party 's headquarters in washington , he said that americans had sent a clear message for obama to " change course . "
" our new majority will be prepared to do things differently , " boehner said .
" it starts with cutting spending instead of increasing it , reducing the size of government instead of increasing it , and reforming the way congress works . "
president obama placed a congratulatory phone call to boehner on tuesday evening , saying he looked forward to working together with boehner to find common ground and move the country forward .
bildunterschrift : environmental legislation on hold however , republican control of the house could lead to legislative gridlock .
obama acknowledged that democratic plans for a " cap-and-trade " system - charging industry for carbon dioxide emissions blamed for global climate change - would have to be put off for at least the next two years .
" it 's doubtful that you could get the votes to pass that through the house this year , or next year , or the year after , " obama said .
" cap and trade was just one way of skinning the cat … it was a means , not an end . "
republicans made gains in the senate , where 37 out of 100 upper house seats were at stake .
with three seats still too close to call on wednesday , democrats took a net loss of 6 seats for 51 , while republicans took 46 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama and the democrats kept hold of the senate democrats were helped by a victory for democratic majority leader harry reid , who won his seat with about 50 percent of the vote .
reid was challenged by sharron angle , backed by the grassroots conservative tea party movement .
democrats were not so lucky in florida , where republican marco rubio became the first tea party-backed candidate to win a senate seat .
but another tea party favorite - controversial senate candidate for delaware , christine o 'donnell - lost her race .
comfortable majority in lower house although much of the debate leading up to the election focused on anxiety about the us economy , the increased number of republican seats in congress may also have foreign policy implications .
spending on development could be blocked in the lower house and republican gains in the senate are likely to make it more difficult for the obama administration to ratify international treaties .
it is thought that the republicans could use their enhanced platform in congress to frustrate aspects of obama 's foreign policy , for instance , by opposing any peace deal in afghanistan that would bring the taliban to the negotiating table .
of the 50 states in the union , 37 also elected a new governor .
california voters elected democrat jerry brown , who served as governor in the 1970s and 80s , replacing austrian-born actor-turned-politician arnold schwarzenegger .
the state also rejected a proposal to decriminalize recreational marijuana .

german politicians are wondering what a divided american government will mean for europe and world politics . german politicians believe tuesday 's congressional elections in the united states will change the landscape of foreign policy .
the elections represent a major threat to us president barack obama 's power at home , as the opposition republicans gained a majority in the congress 's lower house , the house of representatives , and boosted their numbers in the senate .
a bigger role on the world stage ?
the german government 's coordinator for german-american relations , hans-ulrich klose , said wednesday he expected obama to turn his gaze outward in light of new difficulties in domestic politics .
he told national radio station deutschlandradio that the president would now be concentrating more on the mideast conflict .
" i hesitate to speak of a solution to the problems , but it would be good if there were more intelligent conflict management , " klose said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polenz says europe needs to play a bigger role on the world stage the chairman of the bundestag parliament 's foreign affairs committee , ruprecht polenz , also stressed that obama could maintain a strong role in international politics , as the president is only dependent on congress in matters of international diplomacy when it comes to ratifying treaties .
europe to ' step up to the plate . '
however , polenz took a different position from klose 's , positing that conflicts within american politics could weaken the us 's leading position in worldwide diplomacy .
" of course , the us 's role in the world will be judged by its partners according to how strong they are at home .
in that sense , -lsb- obama -rsb- is somewhat weakened , " polenz told deutsche welle .
polenz stressed that germany and europe would have to take a stronger position in global diplomacy if the us were to take a step back , especially in matters such as the mideast conflict , russian-american relations and china 's ascent to the world stage .
" we need solutions to certain conflicts and problems in this world , and if the americans ca n't focus on that as strongly as in the past , then europe will have to do more , " he said , adding , " we do n't have an eternity to answer as many foreign-policy questions as possible with one voice and act accordingly . "
" one message of this election is that we are now being put more to the challenge , " polenz added .
polenz said that europe was not capable of filling the us 's shoes in matters of world politics , but stressed that a more politically divided america needed europe 's support : " it will be important for us to put more effort into our relationship because we need to work together when one partner ca n't carry as much of the burden . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klose says democrats and republicans will have to cooperate more closely one place where europe will have to take on more responsibility , according to rainer stinner , foreign policy spokesperson for germany 's free democrats - the party of foreign minister guido westerwelle - is in the reshaping of the north atlantic treaty organization -lrb- nato -rrb- .
nato is currently forming its new strategic concept .
" if nato members agree that a missile defense shield is necessary , then it will surely need to be financed by all nato partners and can not all be put on the americans ' shoulders , " stinner said .
stalemate or renewed cooperation ?
the big question facing american politics is whether democrats and republicans can work together , or if increased control by the opposition republicans will mean a political stalemate .
polenz believes a standstill would be " fatal " for the us both at home and abroad .
klose and stinner , however , believe the two parties will be forced to work together .
stinner said that , should the republicans continue trying to block all legislation from the democrats , it could backfire against them in the next elections .
" the republicans would do well not to continue a purely oppositional politics , " he said , " but to try to work together with the president so that he ca n't position them as preventing -lsb- progress -rsb- . "

the democrats manage to keep a slim majority in the senate . us republicans won a huge majority in the house of representatives in midterm elections , delivering a blow president barack obama described as a " shellacking . "
" i am not recommending for every future president that they take a shellacking like i did last night , " obama said in a news conference on wednesday .
" i am sure there are easier ways to learn these lessons . "
the conservative republican party gained at least 60 seats in the house of representatives , the biggest shift of congressional power since 1948 and more than enough to win control of the 435-member lower chamber .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : john boehner is set to become the new house speaker the vote toppled democrat nancy pelosi from her position as speaker of the house , leaving ohio republic and house minority leader john boehner ready to fill the position .
speaking as almost all of the polls across the country had closed , boehner pledged to cut government spending .
in a victory rally at the republican party 's headquarters in washington , he said that americans had sent a clear message for obama to " change course . "
" our new majority will be prepared to do things differently , " boehner said .
" it starts with cutting spending instead of increasing it , reducing the size of government instead of increasing it , and reforming the way congress works . "
president obama placed a congratulatory phone call to boehner on tuesday evening , saying he looked forward to working together with boehner to find common ground and move the country forward .
bildunterschrift : environmental legislation on hold however , republican control of the house could lead to legislative gridlock .
obama acknowledged that democratic plans for a " cap-and-trade " system - charging industry for carbon dioxide emissions blamed for global climate change - would have to be put off for at least the next two years .
" it 's doubtful that you could get the votes to pass that through the house this year , or next year , or the year after , " obama said .
" cap and trade was just one way of skinning the cat … it was a means , not an end . "
republicans made gains in the senate , where 37 out of 100 upper house seats were at stake .
with three seats still too close to call on wednesday , democrats took a net loss of 6 seats for 51 , while republicans took 46 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama and the democrats kept hold of the senate democrats were helped by a victory for democratic majority leader harry reid , who won his seat with about 50 percent of the vote .
reid was challenged by sharron angle , backed by the grassroots conservative tea party movement .
democrats were not so lucky in florida , where republican marco rubio became the first tea party-backed candidate to win a senate seat .
but another tea party favorite - controversial senate candidate for delaware , christine o 'donnell - lost her race .
comfortable majority in lower house although much of the debate leading up to the election focused on anxiety about the us economy , the increased number of republican seats in congress may also have foreign policy implications .
spending on development could be blocked in the lower house and republican gains in the senate are likely to make it more difficult for the obama administration to ratify international treaties .
it is thought that the republicans could use their enhanced platform in congress to frustrate aspects of obama 's foreign policy , for instance , by opposing any peace deal in afghanistan that would bring the taliban to the negotiating table .
of the 50 states in the union , 37 also elected a new governor .
california voters elected democrat jerry brown , who served as governor in the 1970s and 80s , replacing austrian-born actor-turned-politician arnold schwarzenegger .
the state also rejected a proposal to decriminalize recreational marijuana .

" it starts with cutting spending instead of increasing it , reducing the size of government instead of increasing it , and reforming the way congress works . "
president obama placed a congratulatory phone call to boehner on tuesday evening , saying he looked forward to working together with boehner to find common ground and move the country forward .
bildunterschrift : environmental legislation on hold however , republican control of the house could lead to legislative gridlock .
obama acknowledged that democratic plans for a " cap-and-trade " system - charging industry for carbon dioxide emissions blamed for global climate change - would have to be put off for at least the next two years .
" it 's doubtful that you could get the votes to pass that through the house this year , or next year , or the year after , " obama said .
" cap and trade was just one way of skinning the cat … it was a means , not an end . "
republicans made gains in the senate , where 37 out of 100 upper house seats were at stake .
with three seats still too close to call on wednesday , democrats took a net loss of 6 seats for 51 , while republicans took 46 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama and the democrats kept hold of the senate democrats were helped by a victory for democratic majority leader harry reid , who won his seat with about 50 percent of the vote .
reid was challenged by sharron angle , backed by the grassroots conservative tea party movement .
democrats were not so lucky in florida , where republican marco rubio became the first tea party-backed candidate to win a senate seat .
but another tea party favorite - controversial senate candidate for delaware , christine o 'donnell - lost her race .
comfortable majority in lower house although much of the debate leading up to the election focused on anxiety about the us economy , the increased number of republican seats in congress may also have foreign policy implications .
spending on development could be blocked in the lower house and republican gains in the senate are likely to make it more difficult for the obama administration to ratify international treaties .
it is thought that the republicans could use their enhanced platform in congress to frustrate aspects of obama 's foreign policy , for instance , by opposing any peace deal in afghanistan that would bring the taliban to the negotiating table .
of the 50 states in the union , 37 also elected a new governor .
california voters elected democrat jerry brown , who served as governor in the 1970s and 80s , replacing austrian-born actor-turned-politician arnold schwarzenegger .
the state also rejected a proposal to decriminalize recreational marijuana .

chancellor merkel pointed to successful examples of integration and said society should put more effort into working with immigrants . by 2015 german chancellor angela merkel wants to give every immigrant the opportunity to take part in integration courses .
the government estimates that by that time around 1.8 million people will have attended the courses since they were first introduced in 2005 .
" we 're catching up in 10 years on what we failed to do in the previous 30 years , " merkel said at the end of an integration summit in berlin on wednesday .
" we want to be more concrete . "
that was the message of german chancellor angela merkel at the berlin integration summit .
she wants to set clear standards to make it easier to assess what germany has achieved , and what is still to be done on the issue of integration .
' multiculturalism has failed ' merkel said the notion that integration could be achieved simply by different living next to one another was outdated .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : politicians , experts and minority groups took part merkel , who said in a speech last month that " multiculturalism has failed , " set out to prove that integration would not happen by itself .
she said that true integration required much more energy and engagement from all of society .
the chancellor praised the atmosphere at the summit as being " the right working environment . "
the 120 participants , including politicians , economists , and representatives of the police and the media apparently exchanged " controversial opinions " with one another .
merkel said they had spoken openly about " what had yet to be achieved . "
for example , she pointed out that there was a lot of work still to do on the issue of violence in schools .
" there 's still a long way to go on this journey , " merkel commented .
the government says it will spend about 400 million euros -lrb- 560 million dollars -rrb- by 2014 on improving german language skills among the children of immigrants so they can perform better at school .
it is also seeking to help immigrants get their foreign qualifications recognised in germany , and to have more people from immigrant backgrounds working in the civil service and in the police force .
success stories there were some impressive examples of successes in immigration policy , merkel said .
she cited sport as an example .
the 2010 german world cup team was the most multicultural ever , with a number of players from turkish and african immigrant families .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and boehmer have drawn up an action plan maria boehmer is the government minister responsible for the issue of integration .
she echoed the chancellor 's words , saying that " a lot of ground had been gained " in the last few years .
she said there were more positive stories of integration " than had been told in the last few weeks . "
germany has been embroiled in a debate about integration since a prominent member of the board of the state bank , the bundesbank , sparked outrage in germany and abroad when he published a book which claimed that muslims themselves were in part responsible for failing to integrate into german society .
he was forced to resign from his post , but the debate simmered on .
boehmer cited a new national action plan , which should make progress in integration easier to follow , and will complement the current national integration plan .
she said that police , care workers and teachers could play a " bridging role " in helping immigrants to integrate .
some participants , however , criticized the lack of real results at the summit .
aydan oezoguz , who is responsible for integration in the opposition spd parliamentary group , called the action plan a " hotch-potch of measures that had already been agreed on . "
the spokesperson on migration policy for the left party , sevim dagdelen , said it was merely a " symbolic summit " that would not change the daily reality for immigrants in germany . ´ the federal statistics office says about 16 million people in germany come from a " migrant background " - just under 20 percent of the population .
of these , an estimated 4 million are muslim , mostly of turkish origin .

the vote is expected to delay eu-sponsored talks with serbia . voters in kosovo are to go to the polls in snap elections on dec .
12 , after prime minister hashim thaci 's weakened government supported a no-confidence vote in the country 's parliament .
the southern balkan state 's first elections since it declared independence are expected to delay the start of european union-sponsored talks with serbia on improving their bilateral relations dialogue should start " only after new institutions emerging from these polls are constituted , " interim president jakup krasniqi told reporters in pristina .
belgrade has refused to recognize kosovo since the former serbian province unilaterally declared independence in 2008 .
the eu has been trying to get pristina and belgrade to hold direct talks in a bid to normalize relations between the two sides .
preparations for early elections are also expected to delay plans to privatize the state-owned telecoms firm and choose a company to build a badly needed coal-fired power plant this year .

it was submitted two weeks after thaci 's coalition fell apart when former president fatmir sejidu pulled his party out of the governing coalition .

interim president jakup krasniqi immediately dissolved parliament and announced the polls , which under kosovo 's constitution , have to be held within 45 days .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de press freedom -pipe- 03.11.2010 media suppression , violence against journalists increases in latin america großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : latin america is experiencing a worrying return to censorship press freedom campaigners and journalism associations are increasingly concerned at what many describe as the dawning of a new era of media suppression in a number of latin american countries . while journalists no longer face the threats associated with the institutionalized death squads of the past , a new shadow is being cast over free speech and objective reporting in nations which have long since cast off the yoke of dictatorship . government-controlled censorship and the targeting of journalists by the state security apparatus may be part of many latin american countries ' dark history .
but free speech is still in danger from powerful organized crime syndicates intent on silencing reporters and the disturbing creep of monopolized media industries under the auspices of sovereign leaders . the country generating most concern is mexico , where a total of 68 journalists and media workers have been killed and a further 11 abducted since 2000 .
mexico has become one of the deadliest places in the world for journalists .
the rising power of drug cartels and the mexican government 's violent crackdown on narcotics gangs has turned areas of the country into battlegrounds . journalists there working on stories about the drug war live in constant fear of being kidnapped , tortured and murdered by cartels desperate to silence the media 's reporting on their activities and members .
these alliances are eager to gain control of the airwaves .
the international press freedom organization reporters without borders claims that drug gangs target journalists with impunity , as prosecutions relating to these crimes are very rarely completed . mexican government failing journalists , campaigners claim bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : journalists continue to die while reporting on mexico 's drug war reporters without borders also claims that mexico 's special federal attorney 's office for combating violence against the media has failed to make much of an impression since its creation in 2006 .
the myriad departments dedicated to press freedom in the executive , legislative and judicial branches of government often cancel each other out through passivity or negligence . " the mexican government has done almost nothing to protect journalists , " benoit hervieu , the americas expert at reporters without borders , told deutsche welle .
" the special attorney charged with following up the investigations into crimes against journalists has been given over 500 files , and maybe one percent of them have been looked into .
it is very hard to follow up investigations in mexico . " the mexican government has also been dogged by accusations that certain sectors of the state apparatus have been infiltrated by organized crime gangs .
it is alleged that the authorities are also complicit , if not entirely responsible , for serious human rights violations including the suppression of free speech . " some government officials are involved in the suppression of the media and the violence committed against journalists , so investigations get hindered at an official level , " hervieu said .
" it is very hard to pursue these cases .
plus bureaucracy is terrible in mexico .
it is one of the worst countries in latin america for this . " fear drives journalists to self-censor journalists in mexico are living in such fear that there is a concern that the constant threat to their lives is leading to a form of self-censorship in an attempt to protect themselves . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pressure from cartels force journalists to self-censorship only last week , el diario , a newspaper in the mexican border city of ciudad juárez , appealed directly in a front-page story to the drug cartels which have turned the city into a war zone and who have taken a number of journalists ' lives .
in the article , the paper asked for reporting and censorship guidelines . " gentlemen … please explain to us … what you would like us to publish or stop publishing , " the statement read .
" the last thing we want is for another one of our colleagues to fall victim to your gunshots . " " the cartels are obviously involved and responsible for attacks and media suppression but they also provide the government with a very convenient excuse , " said hervieu .
" it is so easy for the government to blame the cartels .
this is war , and in war confusion is high .
it is therefore easy to say that the enemy is responsible .
but in some of the most dangerous regions of mexico , it is the police and the army which is the most feared . " while mexico is considered the most dangerous place in latin america for press freedom , it is not the only country in the region where journalists ' lives are at risk .
in honduras , eight journalists have been killed so far this year by drug traffickers or in violent struggles with government forces in protests over land reform and the political situation in the country since the government was overthrown in 2009 . " in honduras , the violence came after the coup in 2009 and the attacks on journalists came as revenge for dissent during the unrest , " hervieu said .
" this political violence continues with no investigations .
honduras , along with mexico and colombia , is one of the most dangerous places for journalists in latin america . " democratically-elected leaders building media monopolies elsewhere , the rise of government-backed media monopolies and the election of leaders keen to suppress dissenting voices are having detrimental effects on press freedom in countries such as venezuela , ecuador , argentina and bolivia . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chavez forced a number of media outlets to close down dictatorships may be a thing of the past in most latin america countries , apart from cuba , but leaders like venezuelan president hugo chávez are exercising a level of control similar to that favored by the totalitarian regimes they were elected to replace .
chávez has closed down a television network , 32 radio stations and two local television channels allegedly because they criticized a political ally . rights groups accuse both president rafael correa of ecuador and argentina 's leader cristina fernández of increasing their governments ' grip on media institutions to an unhealthy degree . correa 's regime now controls some 20 media companies in ecuador and has brought in legislation which limits ownership of media outlets and what these outlets can broadcast in certain circumstances .
this legislation was cited during a period of unrest in september when correa ordered all television and radio stations to broadcast only government-supplied information . dismantling powerful opponent in argentina bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fernández has her eye on increasing favorable coverage meanwhile in argentina , fernández is allegedly engaged in a campaign to break up the country 's biggest media conglomerate , the clarín group , after it began broadcasting negative coverage of her and her recently deceased husband and former president néstor kirchner . by applying pressure to some of the group 's most influential contract partners , cancelling the company 's license to provide internet service , and sending tax officials to raid the group 's headquarters , fernández is determined to dismantle a powerful mouthpiece of dissent while increasing government advertising revenue in a bid to replace the clarín group 's negative content with more government-friendly coverage . " clarín , owner of newspapers , radio stations , broadcast and cable television outlets , and an internet service provider , has had an antagonistic relationship with fernandez-kirchner since a 2008 conflict with the farming sector over a tax raise , " according to carlos lauría , senior program coordinator for the americas at the committee to protect journalists -lrb- cpj -rrb- .
he said the government had accused clarín and other private media of biased coverage . " journalists at clarín and national newspaper la nación believe the government is engaged in an intimidating campaign to silence critics , " lauría said . meanwhile both bolivia and nicaragua have passed laws which allow their governments to close media outlets deemed disruptive while allegedly prosecuting and imprisoning critical reporters on trumped up charges such as money laundering . media campaigners have a pessimistic view of the state of press freedom in latin america and while there are efforts being made to turn things around , few have much hope of widespread change . " what is needed is open debate , " said hervieu .
" in argentina and uruguay , there was a debate among teachers and intellectuals about how the media could regain its full freedom .
that 's a start . " however , he said in mexico , it would take a massive institutional reform with the help of the united states to bring about change . " but the situation as a whole is desperate , " hervieu said . author : nick amies editor : sabina casagrande send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

however , her profile is on the rise as one of her most famous works is re-published . " it 's a little gem , a more than worthwhile work of literature , " said american arts journalist thomas gladysz , " it has literary sophistication and unusual historical significance . "
he was talking about german author margarete boehme 's 1905 work " tagebuch einer verlorenen " -lrb- " diary of a lost girl " -rrb- , which tells the story , in diary form , of a young girl called thymian and her descent into the world of prostitution .
the book was wildly successful when it was first released , with many contemporary reviewers unaware that it was a work of fiction and not an actual diary .
" the book was truly a phenomenon at the beginning of the 20th century , " said gladysz , " it was translated into 14 languages , inspired a sequel , a stage play , a parody , two silent films and a score of imitators .
by the end of the 1920s , more than 1.2 million copies were in print and one scholar has ranked it among the best selling books of its time in germany . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iconic flapper louise brooks played thymian in the 1929 film version of the book successful in its own right , the story of thymian 's downfall came to greater public attention thanks to the 1929 cinema version starring wide-eyed louise brooks in the title role .
the film , directed by g. w. pabst , was a box office smash and one of brooks ' most iconic screen performances .
as president of the louise brooks society , gladysz obviously ranks this as a personal favorite but thinks it 's about time boehme received as much credit as brooks .
" boehme 's name is prominent in the credits at the beginning of the film , " he said , " but who reads the credits ?
boehme remains an obscure figure even to those interested in early german cinema . "
hence , gladysz is re-releasing boehme 's iconic work in the united states for the first time in more than 100 years .
" i felt such a work needed a helping hand out of the undeserved obscurity into which it had fallen , " he said .
a rediscovery the book , which comes with an in-depth introduction by gladysz , will be presented to the public at a special event at the san francisco public library in november .
the launch is being supported by the local division of the goethe-institut , germany 's principal cultural development organization .
gretchen good , organizer of the san francisco book presentation , said she became interested in boehme 's book stemmed from having read many so-called hoax memoirs - works of fiction - published recently in the us .
" i was one of the hundreds of thousands readers taken in by james frey 's ' a million little pieces , ' and i followed the ensuing debate over the acceptable amount of fiction in a non-fiction memoir with keen interest , " good told deutsche welle .
" approaching ' the diary of a lost girl , ' i believed it to be the possible distant ancestor of the american hoax memoir . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thomas gladysz 's new version of the book - the first in over 100 years margarete boehme was born on may 8 , 1867 and grew up in the small northern german town of husum .
in her lifetime she wrote more than 40 novels and a number of short stories , articles and reviews .
by the turn of the 20th century , she was one of the mostly widely read authors in germany , but , since her death in 1939 , she has slipped into relative obscurity .
gladysz said that interest in the book is gradually picking up .
in addition to the support of the goethe-institute , it has been reviewed several times and libraries are starting to pick it up .
the neue galerie in new york , a museum dedicated to german and austrian art and culture , has also placed a " substantial order " of copies for their shop .
all this makes gladysz very happy : " slowly , it 's making its way out into the world . "

but free speech is still in danger from powerful organized crime syndicates intent on silencing reporters and the disturbing creep of monopolized media industries under the auspices of sovereign leaders . the country generating most concern is mexico , where a total of 68 journalists and media workers have been killed and a further 11 abducted since 2000 .
mexico has become one of the deadliest places in the world for journalists .
the rising power of drug cartels and the mexican government 's violent crackdown on narcotics gangs has turned areas of the country into battlegrounds . journalists there working on stories about the drug war live in constant fear of being kidnapped , tortured and murdered by cartels desperate to silence the media 's reporting on their activities and members .
these alliances are eager to gain control of the airwaves .
the international press freedom organization reporters without borders claims that drug gangs target journalists with impunity , as prosecutions relating to these crimes are very rarely completed . mexican government failing journalists , campaigners claim bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : journalists continue to die while reporting on mexico 's drug war reporters without borders also claims that mexico 's special federal attorney 's office for combating violence against the media has failed to make much of an impression since its creation in 2006 .
the myriad departments dedicated to press freedom in the executive , legislative and judicial branches of government often cancel each other out through passivity or negligence . " the mexican government has done almost nothing to protect journalists , " benoit hervieu , the americas expert at reporters without borders , told deutsche welle .
" the special attorney charged with following up the investigations into crimes against journalists has been given over 500 files , and maybe one percent of them have been looked into .
it is very hard to follow up investigations in mexico . " the mexican government has also been dogged by accusations that certain sectors of the state apparatus have been infiltrated by organized crime gangs .
it is alleged that the authorities are also complicit , if not entirely responsible , for serious human rights violations including the suppression of free speech . " some government officials are involved in the suppression of the media and the violence committed against journalists , so investigations get hindered at an official level , " hervieu said .
" it is very hard to pursue these cases .
plus bureaucracy is terrible in mexico .
it is one of the worst countries in latin america for this . " fear drives journalists to self-censor journalists in mexico are living in such fear that there is a concern that the constant threat to their lives is leading to a form of self-censorship in an attempt to protect themselves . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pressure from cartels force journalists to self-censorship only last week , el diario , a newspaper in the mexican border city of ciudad juárez , appealed directly in a front-page story to the drug cartels which have turned the city into a war zone and who have taken a number of journalists ' lives .
in the article , the paper asked for reporting and censorship guidelines . " gentlemen … please explain to us … what you would like us to publish or stop publishing , " the statement read .
" the last thing we want is for another one of our colleagues to fall victim to your gunshots . " " the cartels are obviously involved and responsible for attacks and media suppression but they also provide the government with a very convenient excuse , " said hervieu .
" it is so easy for the government to blame the cartels .
this is war , and in war confusion is high .
it is therefore easy to say that the enemy is responsible .
but in some of the most dangerous regions of mexico , it is the police and the army which is the most feared . " while mexico is considered the most dangerous place in latin america for press freedom , it is not the only country in the region where journalists ' lives are at risk .
in honduras , eight journalists have been killed so far this year by drug traffickers or in violent struggles with government forces in protests over land reform and the political situation in the country since the government was overthrown in 2009 . " in honduras , the violence came after the coup in 2009 and the attacks on journalists came as revenge for dissent during the unrest , " hervieu said .
" this political violence continues with no investigations .
honduras , along with mexico and colombia , is one of the most dangerous places for journalists in latin america . " democratically-elected leaders building media monopolies elsewhere , the rise of government-backed media monopolies and the election of leaders keen to suppress dissenting voices are having detrimental effects on press freedom in countries such as venezuela , ecuador , argentina and bolivia . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chavez forced a number of media outlets to close down dictatorships may be a thing of the past in most latin america countries , apart from cuba , but leaders like venezuelan president hugo chávez are exercising a level of control similar to that favored by the totalitarian regimes they were elected to replace .
chávez has closed down a television network , 32 radio stations and two local television channels allegedly because they criticized a political ally . rights groups accuse both president rafael correa of ecuador and argentina 's leader cristina fernández of increasing their governments ' grip on media institutions to an unhealthy degree . correa 's regime now controls some 20 media companies in ecuador and has brought in legislation which limits ownership of media outlets and what these outlets can broadcast in certain circumstances .
this legislation was cited during a period of unrest in september when correa ordered all television and radio stations to broadcast only government-supplied information . dismantling powerful opponent in argentina bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fernández has her eye on increasing favorable coverage meanwhile in argentina , fernández is allegedly engaged in a campaign to break up the country 's biggest media conglomerate , the clarín group , after it began broadcasting negative coverage of her and her recently deceased husband and former president néstor kirchner . by applying pressure to some of the group 's most influential contract partners , cancelling the company 's license to provide internet service , and sending tax officials to raid the group 's headquarters , fernández is determined to dismantle a powerful mouthpiece of dissent while increasing government advertising revenue in a bid to replace the clarín group 's negative content with more government-friendly coverage . " clarín , owner of newspapers , radio stations , broadcast and cable television outlets , and an internet service provider , has had an antagonistic relationship with fernandez-kirchner since a 2008 conflict with the farming sector over a tax raise , " according to carlos lauría , senior program coordinator for the americas at the committee to protect journalists -lrb- cpj -rrb- .
he said the government had accused clarín and other private media of biased coverage . " journalists at clarín and national newspaper la nación believe the government is engaged in an intimidating campaign to silence critics , " lauría said . meanwhile both bolivia and nicaragua have passed laws which allow their governments to close media outlets deemed disruptive while allegedly prosecuting and imprisoning critical reporters on trumped up charges such as money laundering . media campaigners have a pessimistic view of the state of press freedom in latin america and while there are efforts being made to turn things around , few have much hope of widespread change . " what is needed is open debate , " said hervieu .
" in argentina and uruguay , there was a debate among teachers and intellectuals about how the media could regain its full freedom .
that 's a start . " however , he said in mexico , it would take a massive institutional reform with the help of the united states to bring about change .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de literature -pipe- 03.11.2010 forgotten book by margarete boehme to be revived in us großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a rare photograph of margarete boehme taken in 1902 germany has a long literary tradition but names like goethe and schiller are likely to spring to mind before margarete boehme 's .
however , her profile is on the rise as one of her most famous works is re-published . " it 's a little gem , a more than worthwhile work of literature , " said american arts journalist thomas gladysz , " it has literary sophistication and unusual historical significance . "
he was talking about german author margarete boehme 's 1905 work " tagebuch einer verlorenen " -lrb- " diary of a lost girl " -rrb- , which tells the story , in diary form , of a young girl called thymian and her descent into the world of prostitution .
the book was wildly successful when it was first released , with many contemporary reviewers unaware that it was a work of fiction and not an actual diary .
" the book was truly a phenomenon at the beginning of the 20th century , " said gladysz , " it was translated into 14 languages , inspired a sequel , a stage play , a parody , two silent films and a score of imitators .
by the end of the 1920s , more than 1.2 million copies were in print and one scholar has ranked it among the best selling books of its time in germany . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iconic flapper louise brooks played thymian in the 1929 film version of the book successful in its own right , the story of thymian 's downfall came to greater public attention thanks to the 1929 cinema version starring wide-eyed louise brooks in the title role .
the film , directed by g. w. pabst , was a box office smash and one of brooks ' most iconic screen performances .
as president of the louise brooks society , gladysz obviously ranks this as a personal favorite but thinks it 's about time boehme received as much credit as brooks .
" boehme 's name is prominent in the credits at the beginning of the film , " he said , " but who reads the credits ?
boehme remains an obscure figure even to those interested in early german cinema . "
hence , gladysz is re-releasing boehme 's iconic work in the united states for the first time in more than 100 years .
" i felt such a work needed a helping hand out of the undeserved obscurity into which it had fallen , " he said .
a rediscovery the book , which comes with an in-depth introduction by gladysz , will be presented to the public at a special event at the san francisco public library in november .
the launch is being supported by the local division of the goethe-institut , germany 's principal cultural development organization .
gretchen good , organizer of the san francisco book presentation , said she became interested in boehme 's book stemmed from having read many so-called hoax memoirs - works of fiction - published recently in the us .
" i was one of the hundreds of thousands readers taken in by james frey 's ' a million little pieces , ' and i followed the ensuing debate over the acceptable amount of fiction in a non-fiction memoir with keen interest , " good told deutsche welle .
" approaching ' the diary of a lost girl , ' i believed it to be the possible distant ancestor of the american hoax memoir . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thomas gladysz 's new version of the book - the first in over 100 years margarete boehme was born on may 8 , 1867 and grew up in the small northern german town of husum .
in her lifetime she wrote more than 40 novels and a number of short stories , articles and reviews .
by the turn of the 20th century , she was one of the mostly widely read authors in germany , but , since her death in 1939 , she has slipped into relative obscurity .
gladysz said that interest in the book is gradually picking up .
in addition to the support of the goethe-institute , it has been reviewed several times and libraries are starting to pick it up .
the neue galerie in new york , a museum dedicated to german and austrian art and culture , has also placed a " substantial order " of copies for their shop .
all this makes gladysz very happy : " slowly , it 's making its way out into the world . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de literature -pipe- 03.11.2010 forgotten book by margarete boehme to be revived in us großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a rare photograph of margarete boehme taken in 1902 germany has a long literary tradition but names like goethe and schiller are likely to spring to mind before margarete boehme 's .
however , her profile is on the rise as one of her most famous works is re-published . " it 's a little gem , a more than worthwhile work of literature , " said american arts journalist thomas gladysz , " it has literary sophistication and unusual historical significance . "
he was talking about german author margarete boehme 's 1905 work " tagebuch einer verlorenen " -lrb- " diary of a lost girl " -rrb- , which tells the story , in diary form , of a young girl called thymian and her descent into the world of prostitution .
the book was wildly successful when it was first released , with many contemporary reviewers unaware that it was a work of fiction and not an actual diary .
" the book was truly a phenomenon at the beginning of the 20th century , " said gladysz , " it was translated into 14 languages , inspired a sequel , a stage play , a parody , two silent films and a score of imitators .
by the end of the 1920s , more than 1.2 million copies were in print and one scholar has ranked it among the best selling books of its time in germany . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iconic flapper louise brooks played thymian in the 1929 film version of the book successful in its own right , the story of thymian 's downfall came to greater public attention thanks to the 1929 cinema version starring wide-eyed louise brooks in the title role .
the film , directed by g. w. pabst , was a box office smash and one of brooks ' most iconic screen performances .
as president of the louise brooks society , gladysz obviously ranks this as a personal favorite but thinks it 's about time boehme received as much credit as brooks .
" boehme 's name is prominent in the credits at the beginning of the film , " he said , " but who reads the credits ?
boehme remains an obscure figure even to those interested in early german cinema . "
hence , gladysz is re-releasing boehme 's iconic work in the united states for the first time in more than 100 years .
" i felt such a work needed a helping hand out of the undeserved obscurity into which it had fallen , " he said .
a rediscovery the book , which comes with an in-depth introduction by gladysz , will be presented to the public at a special event at the san francisco public library in november .
the launch is being supported by the local division of the goethe-institut , germany 's principal cultural development organization .
gretchen good , organizer of the san francisco book presentation , said she became interested in boehme 's book stemmed from having read many so-called hoax memoirs - works of fiction - published recently in the us .
" i was one of the hundreds of thousands readers taken in by james frey 's ' a million little pieces , ' and i followed the ensuing debate over the acceptable amount of fiction in a non-fiction memoir with keen interest , " good told deutsche welle .
" approaching ' the diary of a lost girl , ' i believed it to be the possible distant ancestor of the american hoax memoir . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thomas gladysz 's new version of the book - the first in over 100 years margarete boehme was born on may 8 , 1867 and grew up in the small northern german town of husum .
in her lifetime she wrote more than 40 novels and a number of short stories , articles and reviews .
by the turn of the 20th century , she was one of the mostly widely read authors in germany , but , since her death in 1939 , she has slipped into relative obscurity .
gladysz said that interest in the book is gradually picking up .
in addition to the support of the goethe-institute , it has been reviewed several times and libraries are starting to pick it up .
the neue galerie in new york , a museum dedicated to german and austrian art and culture , has also placed a " substantial order " of copies for their shop .
all this makes gladysz very happy : " slowly , it 's making its way out into the world . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de space -pipe- 03.11.2010 russian space program on the rise großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : humans have been living aboard the iss for 10 years a decade after continuous human habitation on the international space station , russia takes the lead , and will be responsible for ferrying astronauts to the station .
meanwhile , china and india are also coming up . this week marks the 10th anniversary of continuous human habitation aboard the international space station .
despite the 16 countries that have collectively spent over $ 100 billion over the past decade , the station 's construction is still not complete .
next year , when the the project is expected to be finally completed , the international space community will have to exclusively rely on the russian space program to ferry astronauts to and from the station , as nasa is expected to launch one of its final space shuttle missions later this week .
that may bring a new level of prestige for the russian space program , which in 2011 will also celebrate its 50th anniversary of the launch of the first man into space , yuri gagarin .
russian cosmodrome slated to open in 2015 the russian space industry , which had become a shadow of itself after the collapse of the soviet union , is once again enjoying state support .
the government has increased spending on the space industry by 40 percent for each of the past five years .
in 2009 , it received a record $ 2.8 billion .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia will celebrate the 50th anniversary of soviet cosmonaut yuri gagarin 's space flight in 2011 russian prime minister vladimir putin also confirmed this fall that russia 's new $ 800 million vostochny cosmodorome in the country 's far east should be up and running by 2015 .
" i must say that the construction of the new space center , commissioned in 2007 , is one of the biggest and most ambitious initiatives in russia today , " he said in a speech earlier this year .
" not only will it confirm russia 's status as a technological leader and boost its potential in science and technology , but , just as importantly , it will allow hundreds , if not thousands , of young specialists to prove themselves , to show their talent , and to make their most ambitious plans come true . "
despite the united states ' re-evaluation of their role in the international space community , american authorities are putting a positive spin on a decreased american presence .
" space is expensive , " said robert navias , a nasa spokesperson , in an interview with deutsche welle .
" it 's hard to get into orbit , it 's very difficult to launch the spacecraft into orbit .
and by doing so together , we do so on a collective basis from an economic and technological standpoint that serves both nations much better than if we tried to do it ourselves . "
he also acknowledged that while russia will be responsible for bring astronauts to the iss , americans still have a lot to do .
" the russians in turn are mutually dependant on us for maintaining station 's operation since nasa has the lead role in mission operations , oversight of the station 's components , and the flight control capability of the station , " he added .
" so through our mutual dependence on one another we have actually built a stronger partnership on a global basis using each other 's expertise to be able to solve problems quickly . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in 2011 , endeavor is scheduled to be the final american space shuttle launch space research becoming more international the us said it planned to look to private companies to invest in future spacecraft .
but so far , no private companies have secured such investment .
meanwhile , the russian federal space agency is set to receive $ 306 million for u.s. astronauts to fly to the international space station in 2012 onboard a russian soyuz rocket .
however , the decision to ground the shuttles raises mixed emotions among us astronauts .
" well , it 's kind of sad that the space shuttle is going to be retired , " said mark kelly , commander of the last scheduled mission of us space shuttle endeavor in february 2011 , in an interview with deutsche welle .
" you know , it 's an incredible vehicle , there 's never been anything like it , that can carry huge payloads , over 30 thousand pounds into orbit , it has an airlock where we could do space walks , it has a robotic arm , we could manipulate payloads , we could capture satellites , we could bring satellites home .
i mean to bring home a payload that weighs 30 thousand pounds is just incredible , no spacecraft could every do that before .
so to see that capability go away is a little bit sad , but it 's been in the plan . "
however , as both moscow and washington are still leading the space race , their dominance could be soon challenged by india and china , which are funding and developing their own space programs .
the chinese shenzhou vii spacecraft is already in operation , and china 's first spacewalk took place in 2008 , and meanwhile , india has announced a manned spaceflight by 2014 .

the southern balkan state 's first elections since it declared independence are expected to delay the start of european union-sponsored talks with serbia on improving their bilateral relations dialogue should start " only after new institutions emerging from these polls are constituted , " interim president jakup krasniqi told reporters in pristina .
belgrade has refused to recognize kosovo since the former serbian province unilaterally declared independence in 2008 .
the eu has been trying to get pristina and belgrade to hold direct talks in a bid to normalize relations between the two sides .

it was submitted two weeks after thaci 's coalition fell apart when former president fatmir sejidu pulled his party out of the governing coalition .
sejidu also stepped down as president in mid-october , after the country 's constitutional court ruled that he could not be the leader of a political party and the country 's president at the same time .
interim president jakup krasniqi immediately dissolved parliament and announced the polls , which under kosovo 's constitution , have to be held within 45 days .
thaci 's own deputies voted against the government and he later expressed satisfaction at the outcome of the vote .
" the vote by the members of parliament is a vote for the future of kosovo .
it is a responsible decision that will mark a new beginning for the state of kosovo , " he said .

another package addressed to italian prime minister silvio berlusconi was discovered on a cargo plane flying to paris from athens .
the plane made an emergency landing in bologna , and the package caught fire while being checked by authorities on the ground .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de space -pipe- 03.11.2010 russian space program on the rise großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : humans have been living aboard the iss for 10 years a decade after continuous human habitation on the international space station , russia takes the lead , and will be responsible for ferrying astronauts to the station .
meanwhile , china and india are also coming up . this week marks the 10th anniversary of continuous human habitation aboard the international space station .
despite the 16 countries that have collectively spent over $ 100 billion over the past decade , the station 's construction is still not complete .
next year , when the the project is expected to be finally completed , the international space community will have to exclusively rely on the russian space program to ferry astronauts to and from the station , as nasa is expected to launch one of its final space shuttle missions later this week .
that may bring a new level of prestige for the russian space program , which in 2011 will also celebrate its 50th anniversary of the launch of the first man into space , yuri gagarin .
russian cosmodrome slated to open in 2015 the russian space industry , which had become a shadow of itself after the collapse of the soviet union , is once again enjoying state support .
the government has increased spending on the space industry by 40 percent for each of the past five years .
in 2009 , it received a record $ 2.8 billion .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia will celebrate the 50th anniversary of soviet cosmonaut yuri gagarin 's space flight in 2011 russian prime minister vladimir putin also confirmed this fall that russia 's new $ 800 million vostochny cosmodorome in the country 's far east should be up and running by 2015 .
" i must say that the construction of the new space center , commissioned in 2007 , is one of the biggest and most ambitious initiatives in russia today , " he said in a speech earlier this year .
" not only will it confirm russia 's status as a technological leader and boost its potential in science and technology , but , just as importantly , it will allow hundreds , if not thousands , of young specialists to prove themselves , to show their talent , and to make their most ambitious plans come true . "
despite the united states ' re-evaluation of their role in the international space community , american authorities are putting a positive spin on a decreased american presence .
" space is expensive , " said robert navias , a nasa spokesperson , in an interview with deutsche welle .
" it 's hard to get into orbit , it 's very difficult to launch the spacecraft into orbit .
and by doing so together , we do so on a collective basis from an economic and technological standpoint that serves both nations much better than if we tried to do it ourselves . "
he also acknowledged that while russia will be responsible for bring astronauts to the iss , americans still have a lot to do .
" the russians in turn are mutually dependant on us for maintaining station 's operation since nasa has the lead role in mission operations , oversight of the station 's components , and the flight control capability of the station , " he added .
" so through our mutual dependence on one another we have actually built a stronger partnership on a global basis using each other 's expertise to be able to solve problems quickly . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in 2011 , endeavor is scheduled to be the final american space shuttle launch space research becoming more international the us said it planned to look to private companies to invest in future spacecraft .
but so far , no private companies have secured such investment .
meanwhile , the russian federal space agency is set to receive $ 306 million for u.s. astronauts to fly to the international space station in 2012 onboard a russian soyuz rocket .
however , the decision to ground the shuttles raises mixed emotions among us astronauts .
" well , it 's kind of sad that the space shuttle is going to be retired , " said mark kelly , commander of the last scheduled mission of us space shuttle endeavor in february 2011 , in an interview with deutsche welle .
" you know , it 's an incredible vehicle , there 's never been anything like it , that can carry huge payloads , over 30 thousand pounds into orbit , it has an airlock where we could do space walks , it has a robotic arm , we could manipulate payloads , we could capture satellites , we could bring satellites home .
i mean to bring home a payload that weighs 30 thousand pounds is just incredible , no spacecraft could every do that before .
so to see that capability go away is a little bit sad , but it 's been in the plan . "
however , as both moscow and washington are still leading the space race , their dominance could be soon challenged by india and china , which are funding and developing their own space programs .
the chinese shenzhou vii spacecraft is already in operation , and china 's first spacewalk took place in 2008 , and meanwhile , india has announced a manned spaceflight by 2014 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de internet -pipe- 03.11.2010 uk privacy authorities say google breached data protection act großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : google first announced the collection of data in may british officials say that google will be audited and must promise not to violate the law again , but will not be fined .
the move comes as canada , spain and , most recently , italy are scrutinizing the california company . in an announcement wednesday , british data protection authorities said there was a " significant breach of the data protection act " and that google uk would be subject to an audit .
further , it added , the company must promise that similar data breaches do not occur again .
the uk authorities had once again taken up the privacy case against google late last month after google had revealed further details that it had obtained " wifi data . "
that data included passwords and e-mails while google was sending cars along british streets and in other countries for its street view service .
earlier this year , the information commissioner 's office -lrb- ico -rrb- had said that it had found " no wrongdoing " on google 's part , but re-opened an investigation last week .
" it is my view that the collection of this information was not fair or lawful and constitutes a significant breach of the first principle of the data protection act , " said christopher graham , the uk information commissioner , in a statement published wednesday on the ico 's website .
" the most appropriate and proportionate regulatory action in these circumstances is to get written legal assurance from google that this will not happen again – and to follow this up with an ico audit . "
the ico elaborated that it had declined to seek monetary damages against the silicon valley company as it would have been too legally difficult to prove .
" monetary penalties can only be served when a strict set of criteria is satisfied , including that the breach was likely to cause substantial harm or substantial distress – this alone would be very hard to prove in this case , " wrote kirsty mccaskill , an ico spokesperson , in a statement provided to deutsche welle .
" the vast majority of the pay-load data was also collected prior to 6 april 2010 , before our new powers came into force . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the vehicles used to create street view inadvertantly collected the data google says google has admitted guilt in a written statement also provided to deutsche welle , peter fleischer , google 's global privacy counsel said that the company had made a mistake .
" we are profoundly sorry for mistakenly collecting payload data in the uk from unencrypted wireless networks , " he wrote .
" since we announced our mistake in may we have cooperated closely with the ico and worked to improve our internal controls .
as we have said before , we did not want this data , have never used any of it in our products or services , and have sought to delete it as quickly as possible .
we are in the process of confirming that there are no outstanding legal obligations upon us to retain the data , and will then ensure that it is quickly and safely deleted . "
previously , as recently as october 22 , google officials have apologized for the mistake and said that it would be changing its policies .
" we are mortified by what happened , but confident that these changes to our processes and structure will significantly improve our internal privacy and security practices for the benefit of all our users , " wrote alan eustace , google 's senior vice president of engineering and research , in a post published on october 22 on google 's public policy blog .
the american federal trade commission decided last week to drop its investigation against google , while in recent weeks , similar government agencies in italy , canada and spain have all pursued action against the company .
the investigations worldwide began earlier this year after german authorities in hamburg discovered the payload data in one of google 's vehicles , and they are continuing to investigate as well .

but as china booms , there is concern human life is being left on the wayside by power-hungry and corrupt officials . as the world expo in shanghai wound down , there was one exhibit at the chile pavilion that continued to attract the masses .
the phoenix 2 capsule , which helped rescue 33 chilean miners last month , triggered a debate about mine safety in china . one visitor said that the rescue operation in chile showed a respect for human life that china could learn from .
just days after the chilean miners were rescued , some 30 of their chinese colleagues in a mine in henan province died in an explosion . " the mine was unsafe but they don ’ t care about worker safety .
all they care about is production , " the mother of one of the dead miners said angrily . safety laws often ignored federal safety laws and directives from beijing are often ignored .
former functionaries themselves say that china ’ s economic boom is partly based on blood . " all they care about is developing the economy , " says zhou xiaozheng , a sociologist at the people ’ s university in beijing .
" they just look at gdp in order to gauge development .
that ’ s how they are judged and that ’ s what their promotions are based upon . " in its rhetoric , the central government in beijing preaches about sustainable growth , about the environment and development without waste of resources .
prime minister wen jiabao often talks about people-oriented policies .
" the government acquired its power from the people , all power goes back to the people and we have to do everything for the people , " he recently said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many chinese are getting rich but some say the poor are being sacrificed however , for many these words are like a slap in the face .
only the ruling communist party is to blame for the fact that there are no controls over those in power , that there is no transparency , no checks and balances . officials and businessmen in cahoots environmental activist wu lihong , who has long campaigned against the pollution of lake taihu , says there is a tangled web of corruption and nepotism , with officials and factory owners working hand-in-hand . " they are in cahoots and they have the same interests .
that 's why the central government never finds out the truth and does not know about local issues .
the central government has no power – that ’ s one of our system 's problems . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : migrant workers are flocking to the cities to find work but they are often subject to abuse there is also corruption at the highest level .
at the beginning of the year , a former supreme court judge was sentenced to lifetime imprisonment for taking bribes and corruption charges .
last month , the former head of china ’ s nuclear agency was expelled from the party . " power creates corruption , " says zhou xiaozheng .
" and absolute power creates absolute corruption .
we humans are not saints .
anyone who is in power for a long time becomes corrupt .
that ’ s why we have to monitor those in power better . " but , he adds , this is what is currently not possible in china .
the media have restricted powers of control .
censorship in china is all-pervasive in china .

the move comes as canada , spain and , most recently , italy are scrutinizing the california company . in an announcement wednesday , british data protection authorities said there was a " significant breach of the data protection act " and that google uk would be subject to an audit .
further , it added , the company must promise that similar data breaches do not occur again .
the uk authorities had once again taken up the privacy case against google late last month after google had revealed further details that it had obtained " wifi data . "
that data included passwords and e-mails while google was sending cars along british streets and in other countries for its street view service .
earlier this year , the information commissioner 's office -lrb- ico -rrb- had said that it had found " no wrongdoing " on google 's part , but re-opened an investigation last week .
" it is my view that the collection of this information was not fair or lawful and constitutes a significant breach of the first principle of the data protection act , " said christopher graham , the uk information commissioner , in a statement published wednesday on the ico 's website .
" the most appropriate and proportionate regulatory action in these circumstances is to get written legal assurance from google that this will not happen again – and to follow this up with an ico audit . "
the ico elaborated that it had declined to seek monetary damages against the silicon valley company as it would have been too legally difficult to prove .
" monetary penalties can only be served when a strict set of criteria is satisfied , including that the breach was likely to cause substantial harm or substantial distress – this alone would be very hard to prove in this case , " wrote kirsty mccaskill , an ico spokesperson , in a statement provided to deutsche welle .
" the vast majority of the pay-load data was also collected prior to 6 april 2010 , before our new powers came into force . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the vehicles used to create street view inadvertantly collected the data google says google has admitted guilt in a written statement also provided to deutsche welle , peter fleischer , google 's global privacy counsel said that the company had made a mistake .
" we are profoundly sorry for mistakenly collecting payload data in the uk from unencrypted wireless networks , " he wrote .
" since we announced our mistake in may we have cooperated closely with the ico and worked to improve our internal controls .
as we have said before , we did not want this data , have never used any of it in our products or services , and have sought to delete it as quickly as possible .
we are in the process of confirming that there are no outstanding legal obligations upon us to retain the data , and will then ensure that it is quickly and safely deleted . "
previously , as recently as october 22 , google officials have apologized for the mistake and said that it would be changing its policies .
" we are mortified by what happened , but confident that these changes to our processes and structure will significantly improve our internal privacy and security practices for the benefit of all our users , " wrote alan eustace , google 's senior vice president of engineering and research , in a post published on october 22 on google 's public policy blog .
the american federal trade commission decided last week to drop its investigation against google , while in recent weeks , similar government agencies in italy , canada and spain have all pursued action against the company .
the investigations worldwide began earlier this year after german authorities in hamburg discovered the payload data in one of google 's vehicles , and they are continuing to investigate as well .

munich is competing against annecy in france , and pyeongchang in south korea .
" today 's cabinet decision means the federal government has put into effect the german parliament 's recommendation of july 2 , 2009 to promote and support the olympic bid , " the german interior minister thomas de maizière , who is responsible for the sport portfolio , said on wednesday .
the guarantees include financial support for the organization of the games and the application of legal regulations in the fight against doping .
the government is set to provide some 500 million euros -lrb- 700 million dollars -rrb- for the games .
the total cost is estimated at 1.3 billion euros .
the government will not contribute to the bid 's marketing costs of 33 million euros , but will step in to help if the organizing committee runs up a deficit .
a first for bavaria ?
the head of the munich bid committee , katarina witt , a former east german figure skating champion , welcomed the cabinet 's decision .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : katarina witt won gold for east germany in 1984 " i am delighted we have received this wholehearted endorsement from elected representatives at all levels of government , " witt said .
" we clearly have a nationwide appreciation of the huge benefits the games would bring to bavaria , germany and the olympic movement , " she added .
if munich won the bid , it would become the first city to host both the summer and winter olympics .
the city staged the summer games in 1972 .
the international olympic committee -lrb- ioc -rrb- will select the winner of the competition to host the 2018 winter games on july 6 , 2011 .

the elections represent a major threat to us president barack obama 's power at home , as the opposition republicans gained a majority in the congress 's lower house , the house of representatives , and boosted their numbers in the senate .
a bigger role on the world stage ?
the german government 's coordinator for german-american relations , hans-ulrich klose , said wednesday he expected obama to turn his gaze outward in light of new difficulties in domestic politics .
he told national radio station deutschlandradio that the president would now be concentrating more on the mideast conflict .
" i hesitate to speak of a solution to the problems , but it would be good if there were more intelligent conflict management , " klose said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polenz says europe needs to play a bigger role on the world stage the chairman of the bundestag parliament 's foreign affairs committee , ruprecht polenz , also stressed that obama could maintain a strong role in international politics , as the president is only dependent on congress in matters of international diplomacy when it comes to ratifying treaties .
europe to ' step up to the plate . '
however , polenz took a different position from klose 's , positing that conflicts within american politics could weaken the us 's leading position in worldwide diplomacy .
" of course , the us 's role in the world will be judged by its partners according to how strong they are at home .
in that sense , -lsb- obama -rsb- is somewhat weakened , " polenz told deutsche welle .
polenz stressed that germany and europe would have to take a stronger position in global diplomacy if the us were to take a step back , especially in matters such as the mideast conflict , russian-american relations and china 's ascent to the world stage .
" we need solutions to certain conflicts and problems in this world , and if the americans ca n't focus on that as strongly as in the past , then europe will have to do more , " he said , adding , " we do n't have an eternity to answer as many foreign-policy questions as possible with one voice and act accordingly . "
" one message of this election is that we are now being put more to the challenge , " polenz added .
polenz said that europe was not capable of filling the us 's shoes in matters of world politics , but stressed that a more politically divided america needed europe 's support : " it will be important for us to put more effort into our relationship because we need to work together when one partner ca n't carry as much of the burden . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klose says democrats and republicans will have to cooperate more closely one place where europe will have to take on more responsibility , according to rainer stinner , foreign policy spokesperson for germany 's free democrats - the party of foreign minister guido westerwelle - is in the reshaping of the north atlantic treaty organization -lrb- nato -rrb- .
nato is currently forming its new strategic concept .
" if nato members agree that a missile defense shield is necessary , then it will surely need to be financed by all nato partners and can not all be put on the americans ' shoulders , " stinner said .
stalemate or renewed cooperation ?
the big question facing american politics is whether democrats and republicans can work together , or if increased control by the opposition republicans will mean a political stalemate .
polenz believes a standstill would be " fatal " for the us both at home and abroad .
klose and stinner , however , believe the two parties will be forced to work together .
stinner said that , should the republicans continue trying to block all legislation from the democrats , it could backfire against them in the next elections .
" the republicans would do well not to continue a purely oppositional politics , " he said , " but to try to work together with the president so that he ca n't position them as preventing -lsb- progress -rsb- . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de space -pipe- 03.11.2010 russian space program on the rise großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : humans have been living aboard the iss for 10 years a decade after continuous human habitation on the international space station , russia takes the lead , and will be responsible for ferrying astronauts to the station .
meanwhile , china and india are also coming up . this week marks the 10th anniversary of continuous human habitation aboard the international space station .
despite the 16 countries that have collectively spent over $ 100 billion over the past decade , the station 's construction is still not complete .
next year , when the the project is expected to be finally completed , the international space community will have to exclusively rely on the russian space program to ferry astronauts to and from the station , as nasa is expected to launch one of its final space shuttle missions later this week .
that may bring a new level of prestige for the russian space program , which in 2011 will also celebrate its 50th anniversary of the launch of the first man into space , yuri gagarin .
russian cosmodrome slated to open in 2015 the russian space industry , which had become a shadow of itself after the collapse of the soviet union , is once again enjoying state support .
the government has increased spending on the space industry by 40 percent for each of the past five years .
in 2009 , it received a record $ 2.8 billion .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia will celebrate the 50th anniversary of soviet cosmonaut yuri gagarin 's space flight in 2011 russian prime minister vladimir putin also confirmed this fall that russia 's new $ 800 million vostochny cosmodorome in the country 's far east should be up and running by 2015 .
" i must say that the construction of the new space center , commissioned in 2007 , is one of the biggest and most ambitious initiatives in russia today , " he said in a speech earlier this year .
" not only will it confirm russia 's status as a technological leader and boost its potential in science and technology , but , just as importantly , it will allow hundreds , if not thousands , of young specialists to prove themselves , to show their talent , and to make their most ambitious plans come true . "
despite the united states ' re-evaluation of their role in the international space community , american authorities are putting a positive spin on a decreased american presence .
" space is expensive , " said robert navias , a nasa spokesperson , in an interview with deutsche welle .
" it 's hard to get into orbit , it 's very difficult to launch the spacecraft into orbit .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bomb squads in greece have had their hands full in total , greek police are looking into around 13 packages containing bombs that were addressed to foreign politicians or delivered to foreign embassies in athens .
one package reached the office of german chancellor angela merkel in berlin , but was discovered and diffused without causing damage or injuries .
another package addressed to italian prime minister silvio berlusconi was discovered on a cargo plane flying to paris from athens .
the plane made an emergency landing in bologna , and the package caught fire while being checked by authorities on the ground .
a third package led to the arrest of two suspects on monday .
the two men , aged 22 and 24 , were discovered with a package containing explosives that was addressed to french president nicolas sarkozy .
searching for suspects the swiss , russian , chilean and bulgarian embassies in athens were also among the targets of the letter bombs .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a bomb made it to the german chancellory most of the bombs were destroyed in controlled blasts by police , but there was an explosion at the swiss embassy that resulted in no injuries .
police believe the packages are being sent by far-left militants , who are thought to have carried out small bomb attacks on political and international targets in the past .
in addition to monday 's two arrests , police have released photos of five militants believed to be connected to the parcel bombs .
on tuesday , greek prime minister george papandreou said the suspects were " trying in vain to disrupt social peace in the country with criminal acts . "
tighter controls chancellor merkel was on an official visit to belgium at the time the package was discovered in berlin .
she did say , however , that the recent series of package bombs from greece and yemen indicated a need for stricter controls on freight shipping between the european union , the united states , and around the globe .
" this is urgently about implementing stricter world-wide controls to prevent terror attacks , " merkel said in an interview with the passauer neue presse newspaper .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bomb squads in greece have had their hands full in total , greek police are looking into around 13 packages containing bombs that were addressed to foreign politicians or delivered to foreign embassies in athens .
one package reached the office of german chancellor angela merkel in berlin , but was discovered and diffused without causing damage or injuries .
another package addressed to italian prime minister silvio berlusconi was discovered on a cargo plane flying to paris from athens .
the plane made an emergency landing in bologna , and the package caught fire while being checked by authorities on the ground .
a third package led to the arrest of two suspects on monday .

" this is urgently about implementing stricter world-wide controls to prevent terror attacks , " merkel said in an interview with the passauer neue presse newspaper .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christina bergmann is dw 's washington correspondent obama also alienated many supporters in his voter base , for example through his inconsistent back and forth about military guidelines forbidding homosexuals from serving openly in the military .
during his campaign , obama had pledged to do away with this practice .
he could n't fulfill this promise just as little as he could his vow to close guantanamo within one year 's time .
but above all , barack obama underestimated one thing : voters all across the country still do n't think much of " washington . "
two years ago , obama was able to benefit from this attitude .
he promised to change politics in the capital .
but he has not accomplished that .
the rift between the democrats and the republicans is deeper than it ever was .
it 's high time to redeem this pledge of bipartisanship .
it makes just as little sense to always blame the republicans - who indeed were mainly experts in saying " no " - as it does to constantly point the finger at his predecessor .
it 's true : george w. bush did drive the country into a crisis .
but that is in the past .
washington is now personified by barack obama as he found out bitterly on this election day .

" i am not recommending for every future president that they take a shellacking like i did last night , " obama said in a news conference on wednesday .
" i am sure there are easier ways to learn these lessons . "
the conservative republican party gained at least 60 seats in the house of representatives , the biggest shift of congressional power since 1948 and more than enough to win control of the 435-member lower chamber .

in a victory rally at the republican party 's headquarters in washington , he said that americans had sent a clear message for obama to " change course . "
" our new majority will be prepared to do things differently , " boehner said .
" it starts with cutting spending instead of increasing it , reducing the size of government instead of increasing it , and reforming the way congress works . "
president obama placed a congratulatory phone call to boehner on tuesday evening , saying he looked forward to working together with boehner to find common ground and move the country forward .

obama acknowledged that democratic plans for a " cap-and-trade " system - charging industry for carbon dioxide emissions blamed for global climate change - would have to be put off for at least the next two years .
" it 's doubtful that you could get the votes to pass that through the house this year , or next year , or the year after , " obama said .
" cap and trade was just one way of skinning the cat … it was a means , not an end . "
republicans made gains in the senate , where 37 out of 100 upper house seats were at stake .

tel aviv had the better of the first half with forwards toto tamuz and ben sahar posing several threats but failing to convert .
at the other end of the pitch , spanish striker raul and dutchman klaas-jan huntelaar struggled to break through the defense quite as effectively as their opponents .
while schalke keeper manuel neuer frustrated hapoel with several acrobatic saves , his tel aviv counterpart vincent enyeama was rarely troubled .
the goalless draw meant that bottom side hapoel gained their first points of the campaign , but left schalke , on seven points in group b , looking over their shoulder at third place benfica .

total security is simply a politician 's fantasy , they say . the pressure was on the german government when it was revealed sunday that a us-bound bomb discovered on a cargo plane in london had passed through germany 's cologne bonn airport .
all flights - first cargo , then passenger services – from the bomb 's country of origin , yemen , were suspended .
interior minister thomas de maiziere was quick to announce that investigations would follow .
" air freight has been relatively under-monitored up to now .
evidently they recognized that and exploited it .
this means changes for the air freight business . "
transport minister peter ramsauer echoed his colleague and underlined the swiftness of the government 's measures .
" our security measures are meant to guarantee that no freight will get to germany from yemen , " he said .
" now possible gaps in the air freight security system have to be uncovered and closed . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ramsauer said security gaps need to be uncovered and closed time is money but german industry leaders are worried that the government may be lining up knee-jerk security measures that could prove costly .
" the safety checks are becoming more bureaucratic and cumbersome .
that costs time , and time is money , " axel nitschke , export economy chief at the german association of chambers of commerce and industry -lrb- dihk -rrb- , told the handelsblatt newspaper dierk mueller , general manager of the american chamber of commerce in germany , told deutsche welle that talk of extra checks was little more than a security blanket for politicians eager to cover their backs .
the us government has already passed a law stating that all cargo containers entering the us by sea or air have to be scanned , but this is a task that thwarts all logistics .
" this law is already in place , but not implemented , " mueller said .
" the us government said we must postpone implementation until we know how to do it .
even if you have all the money in the world , no-one knows how to do it .
there is just no 100 percent security . "
physically impossible the technological obstacles are practically insurmountable .
" air freight is a little easier .
the containers are smaller , but still , you have to do x-raying and computer tomography , because x-raying ca n't detect certain types of plastic explosives .
even that would cost enormous amounts of money . "
" and then you have to tell where these things come from , " he added .
" even if all the major western hemisphere countries say , ' we have 100 percent safety procedures ' , they would still need all the paperwork – stamps and stamps and papers and papers – there is no way to do it 100 percent .
you always have some countries not participating . "
the german government has already admitted as much .
jan muecke , the parliamentary state secretary in the federal ministry of transportation , said monday : " it is practically impossible to scan the entire freight , given the current quantity . "
even if the logistical and technological problems could be surmounted , mueller believes that tightening security will always damage the economy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : authorities fear terrorists have found a gap in airport security " the governments will never pay this .
the consumer will always pay for the extra costs , " he said .
" and it 's not just a matter of money , it 's also the delay .
spare parts for airplanes or special machines sometimes have to be delivered in a few hours . "
" the delay will mean a lack of quality , a lack of punctuality , lack of efficiency , so it will be detrimental to the world economy in the end . "
practical solutions mueller believes that , as with the illegal drugs trade , the only practical solution is to infiltrate the criminal organizations themselves .
" if all this worked , we would not have illegal drugs going to the us , " he said .
" but we have hundreds of tons being illegally imported to the us every year .
these things can not be prevented from entering the country .
we can do something to control the mafia and the terrorists , but not the product itself . "
in germany , federal police under the authority of the interior ministry are responsible for searching passengers , but security for cargo planes comes under the remit of the transport ministry , through the federal agency of aviation -lrb- lba -rrb- .
cargo companies like the german dhl also carry out their own security checks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scanning freight is time-consuming and expensive " of course , to protect against dangers , we have to ensure that safety comes first , " dihk boss martin wansleben told deutsche welle .
" the minute check of every single delivery at the airport has technical and organizational limits .
that is why it is so important that a secure chain of delivery is introduced , with complete supervision from the dispatcher to the airport . "
to achieve this , wansleben believes that existing european union regulations need to be better implemented .
" the eu 's prescribed certification of known dispatchers and regulated commissioners should finally be introduced by the federal agency of aviation , " he said .
" in terms of value , around 35-40 percent of international trade is processed through air freight , " wansleben added .
" these are particularly valuable , urgent , or fragile goods .
that means any interference in air freight will lead to significant costs . "

total security is simply a politician 's fantasy , they say . the pressure was on the german government when it was revealed sunday that a us-bound bomb discovered on a cargo plane in london had passed through germany 's cologne bonn airport .
all flights - first cargo , then passenger services – from the bomb 's country of origin , yemen , were suspended .
interior minister thomas de maiziere was quick to announce that investigations would follow .
" air freight has been relatively under-monitored up to now .
evidently they recognized that and exploited it .
this means changes for the air freight business . "
transport minister peter ramsauer echoed his colleague and underlined the swiftness of the government 's measures .
" our security measures are meant to guarantee that no freight will get to germany from yemen , " he said .
" now possible gaps in the air freight security system have to be uncovered and closed . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ramsauer said security gaps need to be uncovered and closed time is money but german industry leaders are worried that the government may be lining up knee-jerk security measures that could prove costly .
" the safety checks are becoming more bureaucratic and cumbersome .
that costs time , and time is money , " axel nitschke , export economy chief at the german association of chambers of commerce and industry -lrb- dihk -rrb- , told the handelsblatt newspaper dierk mueller , general manager of the american chamber of commerce in germany , told deutsche welle that talk of extra checks was little more than a security blanket for politicians eager to cover their backs .
the us government has already passed a law stating that all cargo containers entering the us by sea or air have to be scanned , but this is a task that thwarts all logistics .
" this law is already in place , but not implemented , " mueller said .
" the us government said we must postpone implementation until we know how to do it .
even if you have all the money in the world , no-one knows how to do it .
there is just no 100 percent security . "
physically impossible the technological obstacles are practically insurmountable .
" air freight is a little easier .
the containers are smaller , but still , you have to do x-raying and computer tomography , because x-raying ca n't detect certain types of plastic explosives .
even that would cost enormous amounts of money . "
" and then you have to tell where these things come from , " he added .
" even if all the major western hemisphere countries say , ' we have 100 percent safety procedures ' , they would still need all the paperwork – stamps and stamps and papers and papers – there is no way to do it 100 percent .
you always have some countries not participating . "
the german government has already admitted as much .
jan muecke , the parliamentary state secretary in the federal ministry of transportation , said monday : " it is practically impossible to scan the entire freight , given the current quantity . "
even if the logistical and technological problems could be surmounted , mueller believes that tightening security will always damage the economy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : authorities fear terrorists have found a gap in airport security " the governments will never pay this .
the consumer will always pay for the extra costs , " he said .
" and it 's not just a matter of money , it 's also the delay .
spare parts for airplanes or special machines sometimes have to be delivered in a few hours . "
" the delay will mean a lack of quality , a lack of punctuality , lack of efficiency , so it will be detrimental to the world economy in the end . "
practical solutions mueller believes that , as with the illegal drugs trade , the only practical solution is to infiltrate the criminal organizations themselves .
" if all this worked , we would not have illegal drugs going to the us , " he said .
" but we have hundreds of tons being illegally imported to the us every year .
these things can not be prevented from entering the country .
we can do something to control the mafia and the terrorists , but not the product itself . "
in germany , federal police under the authority of the interior ministry are responsible for searching passengers , but security for cargo planes comes under the remit of the transport ministry , through the federal agency of aviation -lrb- lba -rrb- .
cargo companies like the german dhl also carry out their own security checks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scanning freight is time-consuming and expensive " of course , to protect against dangers , we have to ensure that safety comes first , " dihk boss martin wansleben told deutsche welle .
" the minute check of every single delivery at the airport has technical and organizational limits .
that is why it is so important that a secure chain of delivery is introduced , with complete supervision from the dispatcher to the airport . "
to achieve this , wansleben believes that existing european union regulations need to be better implemented .
" the eu 's prescribed certification of known dispatchers and regulated commissioners should finally be introduced by the federal agency of aviation , " he said .
" in terms of value , around 35-40 percent of international trade is processed through air freight , " wansleben added .
" these are particularly valuable , urgent , or fragile goods .
that means any interference in air freight will lead to significant costs . "

however , her profile is on the rise as one of her most famous works is re-published . " it 's a little gem , a more than worthwhile work of literature , " said american arts journalist thomas gladysz , " it has literary sophistication and unusual historical significance . "
he was talking about german author margarete boehme 's 1905 work " tagebuch einer verlorenen " -lrb- " diary of a lost girl " -rrb- , which tells the story , in diary form , of a young girl called thymian and her descent into the world of prostitution .
the book was wildly successful when it was first released , with many contemporary reviewers unaware that it was a work of fiction and not an actual diary .
" the book was truly a phenomenon at the beginning of the 20th century , " said gladysz , " it was translated into 14 languages , inspired a sequel , a stage play , a parody , two silent films and a score of imitators .
by the end of the 1920s , more than 1.2 million copies were in print and one scholar has ranked it among the best selling books of its time in germany . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iconic flapper louise brooks played thymian in the 1929 film version of the book successful in its own right , the story of thymian 's downfall came to greater public attention thanks to the 1929 cinema version starring wide-eyed louise brooks in the title role .
the film , directed by g. w. pabst , was a box office smash and one of brooks ' most iconic screen performances .
as president of the louise brooks society , gladysz obviously ranks this as a personal favorite but thinks it 's about time boehme received as much credit as brooks .
" boehme 's name is prominent in the credits at the beginning of the film , " he said , " but who reads the credits ?
boehme remains an obscure figure even to those interested in early german cinema . "
hence , gladysz is re-releasing boehme 's iconic work in the united states for the first time in more than 100 years .
" i felt such a work needed a helping hand out of the undeserved obscurity into which it had fallen , " he said .
a rediscovery the book , which comes with an in-depth introduction by gladysz , will be presented to the public at a special event at the san francisco public library in november .
the launch is being supported by the local division of the goethe-institut , germany 's principal cultural development organization .
gretchen good , organizer of the san francisco book presentation , said she became interested in boehme 's book stemmed from having read many so-called hoax memoirs - works of fiction - published recently in the us .
" i was one of the hundreds of thousands readers taken in by james frey 's ' a million little pieces , ' and i followed the ensuing debate over the acceptable amount of fiction in a non-fiction memoir with keen interest , " good told deutsche welle .
" approaching ' the diary of a lost girl , ' i believed it to be the possible distant ancestor of the american hoax memoir . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thomas gladysz 's new version of the book - the first in over 100 years margarete boehme was born on may 8 , 1867 and grew up in the small northern german town of husum .
in her lifetime she wrote more than 40 novels and a number of short stories , articles and reviews .
by the turn of the 20th century , she was one of the mostly widely read authors in germany , but , since her death in 1939 , she has slipped into relative obscurity .
gladysz said that interest in the book is gradually picking up .
in addition to the support of the goethe-institute , it has been reviewed several times and libraries are starting to pick it up .
the neue galerie in new york , a museum dedicated to german and austrian art and culture , has also placed a " substantial order " of copies for their shop .
all this makes gladysz very happy : " slowly , it 's making its way out into the world . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de literature -pipe- 03.11.2010 forgotten book by margarete boehme to be revived in us großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a rare photograph of margarete boehme taken in 1902 germany has a long literary tradition but names like goethe and schiller are likely to spring to mind before margarete boehme 's .
however , her profile is on the rise as one of her most famous works is re-published . " it 's a little gem , a more than worthwhile work of literature , " said american arts journalist thomas gladysz , " it has literary sophistication and unusual historical significance . "
he was talking about german author margarete boehme 's 1905 work " tagebuch einer verlorenen " -lrb- " diary of a lost girl " -rrb- , which tells the story , in diary form , of a young girl called thymian and her descent into the world of prostitution .
the book was wildly successful when it was first released , with many contemporary reviewers unaware that it was a work of fiction and not an actual diary .
" the book was truly a phenomenon at the beginning of the 20th century , " said gladysz , " it was translated into 14 languages , inspired a sequel , a stage play , a parody , two silent films and a score of imitators .
by the end of the 1920s , more than 1.2 million copies were in print and one scholar has ranked it among the best selling books of its time in germany . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iconic flapper louise brooks played thymian in the 1929 film version of the book successful in its own right , the story of thymian 's downfall came to greater public attention thanks to the 1929 cinema version starring wide-eyed louise brooks in the title role .
the film , directed by g. w. pabst , was a box office smash and one of brooks ' most iconic screen performances .
as president of the louise brooks society , gladysz obviously ranks this as a personal favorite but thinks it 's about time boehme received as much credit as brooks .
" boehme 's name is prominent in the credits at the beginning of the film , " he said , " but who reads the credits ?
boehme remains an obscure figure even to those interested in early german cinema . "
hence , gladysz is re-releasing boehme 's iconic work in the united states for the first time in more than 100 years .
" i felt such a work needed a helping hand out of the undeserved obscurity into which it had fallen , " he said .
a rediscovery the book , which comes with an in-depth introduction by gladysz , will be presented to the public at a special event at the san francisco public library in november .
the launch is being supported by the local division of the goethe-institut , germany 's principal cultural development organization .
gretchen good , organizer of the san francisco book presentation , said she became interested in boehme 's book stemmed from having read many so-called hoax memoirs - works of fiction - published recently in the us .
" i was one of the hundreds of thousands readers taken in by james frey 's ' a million little pieces , ' and i followed the ensuing debate over the acceptable amount of fiction in a non-fiction memoir with keen interest , " good told deutsche welle .
" approaching ' the diary of a lost girl , ' i believed it to be the possible distant ancestor of the american hoax memoir . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thomas gladysz 's new version of the book - the first in over 100 years margarete boehme was born on may 8 , 1867 and grew up in the small northern german town of husum .
in her lifetime she wrote more than 40 novels and a number of short stories , articles and reviews .
by the turn of the 20th century , she was one of the mostly widely read authors in germany , but , since her death in 1939 , she has slipped into relative obscurity .
gladysz said that interest in the book is gradually picking up .
in addition to the support of the goethe-institute , it has been reviewed several times and libraries are starting to pick it up .
the neue galerie in new york , a museum dedicated to german and austrian art and culture , has also placed a " substantial order " of copies for their shop .
all this makes gladysz very happy : " slowly , it 's making its way out into the world . "

but as china booms , there is concern human life is being left on the wayside by power-hungry and corrupt officials . as the world expo in shanghai wound down , there was one exhibit at the chile pavilion that continued to attract the masses .
the phoenix 2 capsule , which helped rescue 33 chilean miners last month , triggered a debate about mine safety in china . one visitor said that the rescue operation in chile showed a respect for human life that china could learn from .
just days after the chilean miners were rescued , some 30 of their chinese colleagues in a mine in henan province died in an explosion . " the mine was unsafe but they don ’ t care about worker safety .
all they care about is production , " the mother of one of the dead miners said angrily . safety laws often ignored federal safety laws and directives from beijing are often ignored .
former functionaries themselves say that china ’ s economic boom is partly based on blood . " all they care about is developing the economy , " says zhou xiaozheng , a sociologist at the people ’ s university in beijing .
" they just look at gdp in order to gauge development .
that ’ s how they are judged and that ’ s what their promotions are based upon . " in its rhetoric , the central government in beijing preaches about sustainable growth , about the environment and development without waste of resources .

" they are in cahoots and they have the same interests .
that 's why the central government never finds out the truth and does not know about local issues .

at the beginning of the year , a former supreme court judge was sentenced to lifetime imprisonment for taking bribes and corruption charges .
last month , the former head of china ’ s nuclear agency was expelled from the party . " power creates corruption , " says zhou xiaozheng .
" and absolute power creates absolute corruption .
we humans are not saints .
anyone who is in power for a long time becomes corrupt .
that ’ s why we have to monitor those in power better . " but , he adds , this is what is currently not possible in china .
the media have restricted powers of control .

chancellor merkel pointed to successful examples of integration and said society should put more effort into working with immigrants . by 2015 german chancellor angela merkel wants to give every immigrant the opportunity to take part in integration courses .
the government estimates that by that time around 1.8 million people will have attended the courses since they were first introduced in 2005 .
" we 're catching up in 10 years on what we failed to do in the previous 30 years , " merkel said at the end of an integration summit in berlin on wednesday .
" we want to be more concrete . "
that was the message of german chancellor angela merkel at the berlin integration summit .
she wants to set clear standards to make it easier to assess what germany has achieved , and what is still to be done on the issue of integration .
' multiculturalism has failed ' merkel said the notion that integration could be achieved simply by different living next to one another was outdated .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : politicians , experts and minority groups took part merkel , who said in a speech last month that " multiculturalism has failed , " set out to prove that integration would not happen by itself .
she said that true integration required much more energy and engagement from all of society .
the chancellor praised the atmosphere at the summit as being " the right working environment . "
the 120 participants , including politicians , economists , and representatives of the police and the media apparently exchanged " controversial opinions " with one another .
merkel said they had spoken openly about " what had yet to be achieved . "
for example , she pointed out that there was a lot of work still to do on the issue of violence in schools .
" there 's still a long way to go on this journey , " merkel commented .
the government says it will spend about 400 million euros -lrb- 560 million dollars -rrb- by 2014 on improving german language skills among the children of immigrants so they can perform better at school .
it is also seeking to help immigrants get their foreign qualifications recognised in germany , and to have more people from immigrant backgrounds working in the civil service and in the police force .
success stories there were some impressive examples of successes in immigration policy , merkel said .
she cited sport as an example .
the 2010 german world cup team was the most multicultural ever , with a number of players from turkish and african immigrant families .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and boehmer have drawn up an action plan maria boehmer is the government minister responsible for the issue of integration .
she echoed the chancellor 's words , saying that " a lot of ground had been gained " in the last few years .
she said there were more positive stories of integration " than had been told in the last few weeks . "
germany has been embroiled in a debate about integration since a prominent member of the board of the state bank , the bundesbank , sparked outrage in germany and abroad when he published a book which claimed that muslims themselves were in part responsible for failing to integrate into german society .
he was forced to resign from his post , but the debate simmered on .
boehmer cited a new national action plan , which should make progress in integration easier to follow , and will complement the current national integration plan .
she said that police , care workers and teachers could play a " bridging role " in helping immigrants to integrate .
some participants , however , criticized the lack of real results at the summit .
aydan oezoguz , who is responsible for integration in the opposition spd parliamentary group , called the action plan a " hotch-potch of measures that had already been agreed on . "
the spokesperson on migration policy for the left party , sevim dagdelen , said it was merely a " symbolic summit " that would not change the daily reality for immigrants in germany . ´ the federal statistics office says about 16 million people in germany come from a " migrant background " - just under 20 percent of the population .
of these , an estimated 4 million are muslim , mostly of turkish origin .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de internet -pipe- 03.11.2010 uk privacy authorities say google breached data protection act großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : google first announced the collection of data in may british officials say that google will be audited and must promise not to violate the law again , but will not be fined .
the move comes as canada , spain and , most recently , italy are scrutinizing the california company . in an announcement wednesday , british data protection authorities said there was a " significant breach of the data protection act " and that google uk would be subject to an audit .
further , it added , the company must promise that similar data breaches do not occur again .
the uk authorities had once again taken up the privacy case against google late last month after google had revealed further details that it had obtained " wifi data . "
that data included passwords and e-mails while google was sending cars along british streets and in other countries for its street view service .
earlier this year , the information commissioner 's office -lrb- ico -rrb- had said that it had found " no wrongdoing " on google 's part , but re-opened an investigation last week .
" it is my view that the collection of this information was not fair or lawful and constitutes a significant breach of the first principle of the data protection act , " said christopher graham , the uk information commissioner , in a statement published wednesday on the ico 's website .
" the most appropriate and proportionate regulatory action in these circumstances is to get written legal assurance from google that this will not happen again – and to follow this up with an ico audit . "
the ico elaborated that it had declined to seek monetary damages against the silicon valley company as it would have been too legally difficult to prove .
" monetary penalties can only be served when a strict set of criteria is satisfied , including that the breach was likely to cause substantial harm or substantial distress – this alone would be very hard to prove in this case , " wrote kirsty mccaskill , an ico spokesperson , in a statement provided to deutsche welle .
" the vast majority of the pay-load data was also collected prior to 6 april 2010 , before our new powers came into force . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the vehicles used to create street view inadvertantly collected the data google says google has admitted guilt in a written statement also provided to deutsche welle , peter fleischer , google 's global privacy counsel said that the company had made a mistake .
" we are profoundly sorry for mistakenly collecting payload data in the uk from unencrypted wireless networks , " he wrote .
" since we announced our mistake in may we have cooperated closely with the ico and worked to improve our internal controls .
as we have said before , we did not want this data , have never used any of it in our products or services , and have sought to delete it as quickly as possible .
we are in the process of confirming that there are no outstanding legal obligations upon us to retain the data , and will then ensure that it is quickly and safely deleted . "
previously , as recently as october 22 , google officials have apologized for the mistake and said that it would be changing its policies .
" we are mortified by what happened , but confident that these changes to our processes and structure will significantly improve our internal privacy and security practices for the benefit of all our users , " wrote alan eustace , google 's senior vice president of engineering and research , in a post published on october 22 on google 's public policy blog .
the american federal trade commission decided last week to drop its investigation against google , while in recent weeks , similar government agencies in italy , canada and spain have all pursued action against the company .
the investigations worldwide began earlier this year after german authorities in hamburg discovered the payload data in one of google 's vehicles , and they are continuing to investigate as well .

chancellor merkel pointed to successful examples of integration and said society should put more effort into working with immigrants . by 2015 german chancellor angela merkel wants to give every immigrant the opportunity to take part in integration courses .
the government estimates that by that time around 1.8 million people will have attended the courses since they were first introduced in 2005 .
" we 're catching up in 10 years on what we failed to do in the previous 30 years , " merkel said at the end of an integration summit in berlin on wednesday .
" we want to be more concrete . "
that was the message of german chancellor angela merkel at the berlin integration summit .
she wants to set clear standards to make it easier to assess what germany has achieved , and what is still to be done on the issue of integration .
' multiculturalism has failed ' merkel said the notion that integration could be achieved simply by different living next to one another was outdated .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : politicians , experts and minority groups took part merkel , who said in a speech last month that " multiculturalism has failed , " set out to prove that integration would not happen by itself .
she said that true integration required much more energy and engagement from all of society .
the chancellor praised the atmosphere at the summit as being " the right working environment . "
the 120 participants , including politicians , economists , and representatives of the police and the media apparently exchanged " controversial opinions " with one another .
merkel said they had spoken openly about " what had yet to be achieved . "
for example , she pointed out that there was a lot of work still to do on the issue of violence in schools .
" there 's still a long way to go on this journey , " merkel commented .
the government says it will spend about 400 million euros -lrb- 560 million dollars -rrb- by 2014 on improving german language skills among the children of immigrants so they can perform better at school .
it is also seeking to help immigrants get their foreign qualifications recognised in germany , and to have more people from immigrant backgrounds working in the civil service and in the police force .
success stories there were some impressive examples of successes in immigration policy , merkel said .
she cited sport as an example .
the 2010 german world cup team was the most multicultural ever , with a number of players from turkish and african immigrant families .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and boehmer have drawn up an action plan maria boehmer is the government minister responsible for the issue of integration .
she echoed the chancellor 's words , saying that " a lot of ground had been gained " in the last few years .
she said there were more positive stories of integration " than had been told in the last few weeks . "
germany has been embroiled in a debate about integration since a prominent member of the board of the state bank , the bundesbank , sparked outrage in germany and abroad when he published a book which claimed that muslims themselves were in part responsible for failing to integrate into german society .
he was forced to resign from his post , but the debate simmered on .
boehmer cited a new national action plan , which should make progress in integration easier to follow , and will complement the current national integration plan .
she said that police , care workers and teachers could play a " bridging role " in helping immigrants to integrate .
some participants , however , criticized the lack of real results at the summit .
aydan oezoguz , who is responsible for integration in the opposition spd parliamentary group , called the action plan a " hotch-potch of measures that had already been agreed on . "
the spokesperson on migration policy for the left party , sevim dagdelen , said it was merely a " symbolic summit " that would not change the daily reality for immigrants in germany . ´ the federal statistics office says about 16 million people in germany come from a " migrant background " - just under 20 percent of the population .
of these , an estimated 4 million are muslim , mostly of turkish origin .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de internet -pipe- 03.11.2010 uk privacy authorities say google breached data protection act großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : google first announced the collection of data in may british officials say that google will be audited and must promise not to violate the law again , but will not be fined .
the move comes as canada , spain and , most recently , italy are scrutinizing the california company . in an announcement wednesday , british data protection authorities said there was a " significant breach of the data protection act " and that google uk would be subject to an audit .
further , it added , the company must promise that similar data breaches do not occur again .
the uk authorities had once again taken up the privacy case against google late last month after google had revealed further details that it had obtained " wifi data . "
that data included passwords and e-mails while google was sending cars along british streets and in other countries for its street view service .
earlier this year , the information commissioner 's office -lrb- ico -rrb- had said that it had found " no wrongdoing " on google 's part , but re-opened an investigation last week .
" it is my view that the collection of this information was not fair or lawful and constitutes a significant breach of the first principle of the data protection act , " said christopher graham , the uk information commissioner , in a statement published wednesday on the ico 's website .
" the most appropriate and proportionate regulatory action in these circumstances is to get written legal assurance from google that this will not happen again – and to follow this up with an ico audit . "
the ico elaborated that it had declined to seek monetary damages against the silicon valley company as it would have been too legally difficult to prove .
" monetary penalties can only be served when a strict set of criteria is satisfied , including that the breach was likely to cause substantial harm or substantial distress – this alone would be very hard to prove in this case , " wrote kirsty mccaskill , an ico spokesperson , in a statement provided to deutsche welle .
" the vast majority of the pay-load data was also collected prior to 6 april 2010 , before our new powers came into force . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the vehicles used to create street view inadvertantly collected the data google says google has admitted guilt in a written statement also provided to deutsche welle , peter fleischer , google 's global privacy counsel said that the company had made a mistake .
" we are profoundly sorry for mistakenly collecting payload data in the uk from unencrypted wireless networks , " he wrote .
" since we announced our mistake in may we have cooperated closely with the ico and worked to improve our internal controls .
as we have said before , we did not want this data , have never used any of it in our products or services , and have sought to delete it as quickly as possible .
we are in the process of confirming that there are no outstanding legal obligations upon us to retain the data , and will then ensure that it is quickly and safely deleted . "
previously , as recently as october 22 , google officials have apologized for the mistake and said that it would be changing its policies .
" we are mortified by what happened , but confident that these changes to our processes and structure will significantly improve our internal privacy and security practices for the benefit of all our users , " wrote alan eustace , google 's senior vice president of engineering and research , in a post published on october 22 on google 's public policy blog .
the american federal trade commission decided last week to drop its investigation against google , while in recent weeks , similar government agencies in italy , canada and spain have all pursued action against the company .
the investigations worldwide began earlier this year after german authorities in hamburg discovered the payload data in one of google 's vehicles , and they are continuing to investigate as well .

total security is simply a politician 's fantasy , they say . the pressure was on the german government when it was revealed sunday that a us-bound bomb discovered on a cargo plane in london had passed through germany 's cologne bonn airport .
all flights - first cargo , then passenger services – from the bomb 's country of origin , yemen , were suspended .
interior minister thomas de maiziere was quick to announce that investigations would follow .
" air freight has been relatively under-monitored up to now .
evidently they recognized that and exploited it .
this means changes for the air freight business . "
transport minister peter ramsauer echoed his colleague and underlined the swiftness of the government 's measures .
" our security measures are meant to guarantee that no freight will get to germany from yemen , " he said .
" now possible gaps in the air freight security system have to be uncovered and closed . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ramsauer said security gaps need to be uncovered and closed time is money but german industry leaders are worried that the government may be lining up knee-jerk security measures that could prove costly .
" the safety checks are becoming more bureaucratic and cumbersome .
that costs time , and time is money , " axel nitschke , export economy chief at the german association of chambers of commerce and industry -lrb- dihk -rrb- , told the handelsblatt newspaper dierk mueller , general manager of the american chamber of commerce in germany , told deutsche welle that talk of extra checks was little more than a security blanket for politicians eager to cover their backs .
the us government has already passed a law stating that all cargo containers entering the us by sea or air have to be scanned , but this is a task that thwarts all logistics .
" this law is already in place , but not implemented , " mueller said .
" the us government said we must postpone implementation until we know how to do it .
even if you have all the money in the world , no-one knows how to do it .
there is just no 100 percent security . "
physically impossible the technological obstacles are practically insurmountable .
" air freight is a little easier .
the containers are smaller , but still , you have to do x-raying and computer tomography , because x-raying ca n't detect certain types of plastic explosives .
even that would cost enormous amounts of money . "
" and then you have to tell where these things come from , " he added .
" even if all the major western hemisphere countries say , ' we have 100 percent safety procedures ' , they would still need all the paperwork – stamps and stamps and papers and papers – there is no way to do it 100 percent .
you always have some countries not participating . "
the german government has already admitted as much .
jan muecke , the parliamentary state secretary in the federal ministry of transportation , said monday : " it is practically impossible to scan the entire freight , given the current quantity . "
even if the logistical and technological problems could be surmounted , mueller believes that tightening security will always damage the economy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : authorities fear terrorists have found a gap in airport security " the governments will never pay this .
the consumer will always pay for the extra costs , " he said .
" and it 's not just a matter of money , it 's also the delay .
spare parts for airplanes or special machines sometimes have to be delivered in a few hours . "
" the delay will mean a lack of quality , a lack of punctuality , lack of efficiency , so it will be detrimental to the world economy in the end . "
practical solutions mueller believes that , as with the illegal drugs trade , the only practical solution is to infiltrate the criminal organizations themselves .
" if all this worked , we would not have illegal drugs going to the us , " he said .
" but we have hundreds of tons being illegally imported to the us every year .
these things can not be prevented from entering the country .
we can do something to control the mafia and the terrorists , but not the product itself . "
in germany , federal police under the authority of the interior ministry are responsible for searching passengers , but security for cargo planes comes under the remit of the transport ministry , through the federal agency of aviation -lrb- lba -rrb- .
cargo companies like the german dhl also carry out their own security checks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scanning freight is time-consuming and expensive " of course , to protect against dangers , we have to ensure that safety comes first , " dihk boss martin wansleben told deutsche welle .
" the minute check of every single delivery at the airport has technical and organizational limits .
that is why it is so important that a secure chain of delivery is introduced , with complete supervision from the dispatcher to the airport . "
to achieve this , wansleben believes that existing european union regulations need to be better implemented .
" the eu 's prescribed certification of known dispatchers and regulated commissioners should finally be introduced by the federal agency of aviation , " he said .
" in terms of value , around 35-40 percent of international trade is processed through air freight , " wansleben added .
" these are particularly valuable , urgent , or fragile goods .
that means any interference in air freight will lead to significant costs . "

" even if all the major western hemisphere countries say , ' we have 100 percent safety procedures ' , they would still need all the paperwork – stamps and stamps and papers and papers – there is no way to do it 100 percent .
you always have some countries not participating . "
the german government has already admitted as much .
jan muecke , the parliamentary state secretary in the federal ministry of transportation , said monday : " it is practically impossible to scan the entire freight , given the current quantity . "
even if the logistical and technological problems could be surmounted , mueller believes that tightening security will always damage the economy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : authorities fear terrorists have found a gap in airport security " the governments will never pay this .
the consumer will always pay for the extra costs , " he said .
" and it 's not just a matter of money , it 's also the delay .
spare parts for airplanes or special machines sometimes have to be delivered in a few hours . "
" the delay will mean a lack of quality , a lack of punctuality , lack of efficiency , so it will be detrimental to the world economy in the end . "
practical solutions mueller believes that , as with the illegal drugs trade , the only practical solution is to infiltrate the criminal organizations themselves .
" if all this worked , we would not have illegal drugs going to the us , " he said .
" but we have hundreds of tons being illegally imported to the us every year .
these things can not be prevented from entering the country .
we can do something to control the mafia and the terrorists , but not the product itself . "
in germany , federal police under the authority of the interior ministry are responsible for searching passengers , but security for cargo planes comes under the remit of the transport ministry , through the federal agency of aviation -lrb- lba -rrb- .
cargo companies like the german dhl also carry out their own security checks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scanning freight is time-consuming and expensive " of course , to protect against dangers , we have to ensure that safety comes first , " dihk boss martin wansleben told deutsche welle .
" the minute check of every single delivery at the airport has technical and organizational limits .
that is why it is so important that a secure chain of delivery is introduced , with complete supervision from the dispatcher to the airport . "
to achieve this , wansleben believes that existing european union regulations need to be better implemented .
" the eu 's prescribed certification of known dispatchers and regulated commissioners should finally be introduced by the federal agency of aviation , " he said .
" in terms of value , around 35-40 percent of international trade is processed through air freight , " wansleben added .
" these are particularly valuable , urgent , or fragile goods .
that means any interference in air freight will lead to significant costs . "

the move comes as canada , spain and , most recently , italy are scrutinizing the california company . in an announcement wednesday , british data protection authorities said there was a " significant breach of the data protection act " and that google uk would be subject to an audit .
further , it added , the company must promise that similar data breaches do not occur again .
the uk authorities had once again taken up the privacy case against google late last month after google had revealed further details that it had obtained " wifi data . "
that data included passwords and e-mails while google was sending cars along british streets and in other countries for its street view service .
earlier this year , the information commissioner 's office -lrb- ico -rrb- had said that it had found " no wrongdoing " on google 's part , but re-opened an investigation last week .
" it is my view that the collection of this information was not fair or lawful and constitutes a significant breach of the first principle of the data protection act , " said christopher graham , the uk information commissioner , in a statement published wednesday on the ico 's website .
" the most appropriate and proportionate regulatory action in these circumstances is to get written legal assurance from google that this will not happen again – and to follow this up with an ico audit . "
the ico elaborated that it had declined to seek monetary damages against the silicon valley company as it would have been too legally difficult to prove .
" monetary penalties can only be served when a strict set of criteria is satisfied , including that the breach was likely to cause substantial harm or substantial distress – this alone would be very hard to prove in this case , " wrote kirsty mccaskill , an ico spokesperson , in a statement provided to deutsche welle .
" the vast majority of the pay-load data was also collected prior to 6 april 2010 , before our new powers came into force . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the vehicles used to create street view inadvertantly collected the data google says google has admitted guilt in a written statement also provided to deutsche welle , peter fleischer , google 's global privacy counsel said that the company had made a mistake .
" we are profoundly sorry for mistakenly collecting payload data in the uk from unencrypted wireless networks , " he wrote .
" since we announced our mistake in may we have cooperated closely with the ico and worked to improve our internal controls .
as we have said before , we did not want this data , have never used any of it in our products or services , and have sought to delete it as quickly as possible .
we are in the process of confirming that there are no outstanding legal obligations upon us to retain the data , and will then ensure that it is quickly and safely deleted . "
previously , as recently as october 22 , google officials have apologized for the mistake and said that it would be changing its policies .
" we are mortified by what happened , but confident that these changes to our processes and structure will significantly improve our internal privacy and security practices for the benefit of all our users , " wrote alan eustace , google 's senior vice president of engineering and research , in a post published on october 22 on google 's public policy blog .
the american federal trade commission decided last week to drop its investigation against google , while in recent weeks , similar government agencies in italy , canada and spain have all pursued action against the company .
the investigations worldwide began earlier this year after german authorities in hamburg discovered the payload data in one of google 's vehicles , and they are continuing to investigate as well .

scientists still do not know when ancient primates began to migrate from being more to less promiscuous . although neanderthals have not lived in europe for 30,000 years , they continue to fascinate scientists around the world .
a new study from the united kingdom suggests that neanderthals had more partners than modern humans .
they reached this conclusion by comparing the ratio of different finger lengths that allow scientists to determine some kinds of behavior , including sexual promiscuity .
emma nelson , a doctoral student at the university of liverpool , had shown in previous research that high levels of in-utero androgens increase the length of the fourth , or ring , finger when compared to the second , or index finger .
the team found that a low ratio indicates higher levels of competitiveness , aggressiveness and more sexual partners , while a high ratio indicates more monogamy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neanderthals had a index-to-ring finger ratio of 0.928 , which is less than modern humans comparisons amongst four species in a paper published today in the british journal proceedings of the royal society b , the team compared the finger-length ratios amongst various ancient hominin species , including ardipithecus ramidus , a hominid who lived around 4.4 million years ago ; australopithecus afarensis , which lived around three to four million years ago ; neanderthals , who disappeared around 28,000 years ago ; and early humans dating back to 95,000 years ago .
" it is believed that prenatal androgens affect the genes responsible for the development of fingers , toes and the reproductive system , " said nelson in a statement .
" we have recently shown that promiscuous primate species have low index to ring finger ratios , while monogamous species have high ratios .
we used this information to estimate the social behavior of extinct apes and hominins .
although the fossil record is limited for this period , and more fossils are needed to confirm our findings , this method could prove to be an exciting new way of understanding how our social behavior has evolved . "
the study found that modern humans have an average of a 0.957 index-to-ring finger ratio , and are generally a more monogamous species , while chimps ' , gorillas ' and orangutans ' average ratio is at 0.91 , and are generally more promiscuous .
the researchers also found that an early modern human found in an israeli cave , dating back to approximately 95,000 years ago , had a ratio of 0.935 , which would be more promiscuous than modern humans as well .
neanderthals , meanwhile , had a ratio of 0.928 .
further study needed in an interview with the agence france presse , nelson added that the research team would like to be able to confirm their findings through other means .
anthropologists still do not agree when or why humans and their ancestors began to migrate from a more promiscuous mating system to a more monogamous one , given that the former group would hold an evolutionary advantage in terms of being able to spread their genes more quickly and more widely .
" pair-bonding , in a broad sense , is universal among humans , but it is not known when the transition from a promiscuous mating system to a stable bonded one occurred , " wrote the scientists in their scientific paper .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the findings could reveal more about mating practices amongst our ancestors disagreement amongst anthropologists however , not all scientists agree with these findings .
in an interview with the american news website , msnbc.com , another anthropologist who was not part of the study said that this correlation of finger ratios is not a " good predictor of any social behaviors . "
" in addition to the problem of using a poor predictor , this study has another problem that we often face with fossils - there are very few of them , and it 's not obvious which sample of living primates we should be comparing with them , " said john hawks , an anthropology professor at the university of wisconsin , madison .

german politicians are wondering what a divided american government will mean for europe and world politics . german politicians believe tuesday 's congressional elections in the united states will change the landscape of foreign policy .
the elections represent a major threat to us president barack obama 's power at home , as the opposition republicans gained a majority in the congress 's lower house , the house of representatives , and boosted their numbers in the senate .
a bigger role on the world stage ?
the german government 's coordinator for german-american relations , hans-ulrich klose , said wednesday he expected obama to turn his gaze outward in light of new difficulties in domestic politics .
he told national radio station deutschlandradio that the president would now be concentrating more on the mideast conflict .
" i hesitate to speak of a solution to the problems , but it would be good if there were more intelligent conflict management , " klose said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polenz says europe needs to play a bigger role on the world stage the chairman of the bundestag parliament 's foreign affairs committee , ruprecht polenz , also stressed that obama could maintain a strong role in international politics , as the president is only dependent on congress in matters of international diplomacy when it comes to ratifying treaties .
europe to ' step up to the plate . '
however , polenz took a different position from klose 's , positing that conflicts within american politics could weaken the us 's leading position in worldwide diplomacy .
" of course , the us 's role in the world will be judged by its partners according to how strong they are at home .
in that sense , -lsb- obama -rsb- is somewhat weakened , " polenz told deutsche welle .
polenz stressed that germany and europe would have to take a stronger position in global diplomacy if the us were to take a step back , especially in matters such as the mideast conflict , russian-american relations and china 's ascent to the world stage .
" we need solutions to certain conflicts and problems in this world , and if the americans ca n't focus on that as strongly as in the past , then europe will have to do more , " he said , adding , " we do n't have an eternity to answer as many foreign-policy questions as possible with one voice and act accordingly . "
" one message of this election is that we are now being put more to the challenge , " polenz added .
polenz said that europe was not capable of filling the us 's shoes in matters of world politics , but stressed that a more politically divided america needed europe 's support : " it will be important for us to put more effort into our relationship because we need to work together when one partner ca n't carry as much of the burden . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klose says democrats and republicans will have to cooperate more closely one place where europe will have to take on more responsibility , according to rainer stinner , foreign policy spokesperson for germany 's free democrats - the party of foreign minister guido westerwelle - is in the reshaping of the north atlantic treaty organization -lrb- nato -rrb- .
nato is currently forming its new strategic concept .
" if nato members agree that a missile defense shield is necessary , then it will surely need to be financed by all nato partners and can not all be put on the americans ' shoulders , " stinner said .
stalemate or renewed cooperation ?
the big question facing american politics is whether democrats and republicans can work together , or if increased control by the opposition republicans will mean a political stalemate .
polenz believes a standstill would be " fatal " for the us both at home and abroad .
klose and stinner , however , believe the two parties will be forced to work together .
stinner said that , should the republicans continue trying to block all legislation from the democrats , it could backfire against them in the next elections .
" the republicans would do well not to continue a purely oppositional politics , " he said , " but to try to work together with the president so that he ca n't position them as preventing -lsb- progress -rsb- . "

meanwhile , china and india are also coming up . this week marks the 10th anniversary of continuous human habitation aboard the international space station .
despite the 16 countries that have collectively spent over $ 100 billion over the past decade , the station 's construction is still not complete .
next year , when the the project is expected to be finally completed , the international space community will have to exclusively rely on the russian space program to ferry astronauts to and from the station , as nasa is expected to launch one of its final space shuttle missions later this week .
that may bring a new level of prestige for the russian space program , which in 2011 will also celebrate its 50th anniversary of the launch of the first man into space , yuri gagarin .
russian cosmodrome slated to open in 2015 the russian space industry , which had become a shadow of itself after the collapse of the soviet union , is once again enjoying state support .
the government has increased spending on the space industry by 40 percent for each of the past five years .
in 2009 , it received a record $ 2.8 billion .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia will celebrate the 50th anniversary of soviet cosmonaut yuri gagarin 's space flight in 2011 russian prime minister vladimir putin also confirmed this fall that russia 's new $ 800 million vostochny cosmodorome in the country 's far east should be up and running by 2015 .
" i must say that the construction of the new space center , commissioned in 2007 , is one of the biggest and most ambitious initiatives in russia today , " he said in a speech earlier this year .
" not only will it confirm russia 's status as a technological leader and boost its potential in science and technology , but , just as importantly , it will allow hundreds , if not thousands , of young specialists to prove themselves , to show their talent , and to make their most ambitious plans come true . "
despite the united states ' re-evaluation of their role in the international space community , american authorities are putting a positive spin on a decreased american presence .
" space is expensive , " said robert navias , a nasa spokesperson , in an interview with deutsche welle .
" it 's hard to get into orbit , it 's very difficult to launch the spacecraft into orbit .
and by doing so together , we do so on a collective basis from an economic and technological standpoint that serves both nations much better than if we tried to do it ourselves . "
he also acknowledged that while russia will be responsible for bring astronauts to the iss , americans still have a lot to do .
" the russians in turn are mutually dependant on us for maintaining station 's operation since nasa has the lead role in mission operations , oversight of the station 's components , and the flight control capability of the station , " he added .
" so through our mutual dependence on one another we have actually built a stronger partnership on a global basis using each other 's expertise to be able to solve problems quickly . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in 2011 , endeavor is scheduled to be the final american space shuttle launch space research becoming more international the us said it planned to look to private companies to invest in future spacecraft .
but so far , no private companies have secured such investment .
meanwhile , the russian federal space agency is set to receive $ 306 million for u.s. astronauts to fly to the international space station in 2012 onboard a russian soyuz rocket .
however , the decision to ground the shuttles raises mixed emotions among us astronauts .
" well , it 's kind of sad that the space shuttle is going to be retired , " said mark kelly , commander of the last scheduled mission of us space shuttle endeavor in february 2011 , in an interview with deutsche welle .
" you know , it 's an incredible vehicle , there 's never been anything like it , that can carry huge payloads , over 30 thousand pounds into orbit , it has an airlock where we could do space walks , it has a robotic arm , we could manipulate payloads , we could capture satellites , we could bring satellites home .
i mean to bring home a payload that weighs 30 thousand pounds is just incredible , no spacecraft could every do that before .
so to see that capability go away is a little bit sad , but it 's been in the plan . "
however , as both moscow and washington are still leading the space race , their dominance could be soon challenged by india and china , which are funding and developing their own space programs .
the chinese shenzhou vii spacecraft is already in operation , and china 's first spacewalk took place in 2008 , and meanwhile , india has announced a manned spaceflight by 2014 .

barack obama has to now own up to his faults and react , says dw 's washington correspondent christina bergmann . it was the anticipated slap in the face for the us president .
barack obama had tried to do everything right and everything at the same time .
now , he has to realize that he blew it with all sides in the process .
the conservatives were seething above all from the health reform , which they view as an unacceptable government intrusion into their lives .
but obama failed to dominate the debate in time .
now , he has to recognize that it 's not enough to do good deeds .
you also have to talk about them .
even faithful supporters accuse him of failing to set his priorities right .
they say he should have dealt with the economy instead of the health reform .
as a matter of fact , obama did do so right at the beginning of his term .
but the administration too quickly assumed that economic activity would pick up again .
the economic crisis in europe threw a monkey wrench in these plans - and unemployment figures in the us increased .
the president recognized too late that when citizens are hard up , they always point their finger at the white house .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christina bergmann is dw 's washington correspondent obama also alienated many supporters in his voter base , for example through his inconsistent back and forth about military guidelines forbidding homosexuals from serving openly in the military .
during his campaign , obama had pledged to do away with this practice .
he could n't fulfill this promise just as little as he could his vow to close guantanamo within one year 's time .
but above all , barack obama underestimated one thing : voters all across the country still do n't think much of " washington . "
two years ago , obama was able to benefit from this attitude .
he promised to change politics in the capital .
but he has not accomplished that .
the rift between the democrats and the republicans is deeper than it ever was .
it 's high time to redeem this pledge of bipartisanship .
it makes just as little sense to always blame the republicans - who indeed were mainly experts in saying " no " - as it does to constantly point the finger at his predecessor .
it 's true : george w. bush did drive the country into a crisis .
but that is in the past .
washington is now personified by barack obama as he found out bitterly on this election day .

barack obama has to now own up to his faults and react , says dw 's washington correspondent christina bergmann . it was the anticipated slap in the face for the us president .
barack obama had tried to do everything right and everything at the same time .
now , he has to realize that he blew it with all sides in the process .
the conservatives were seething above all from the health reform , which they view as an unacceptable government intrusion into their lives .
but obama failed to dominate the debate in time .
now , he has to recognize that it 's not enough to do good deeds .
you also have to talk about them .
even faithful supporters accuse him of failing to set his priorities right .
they say he should have dealt with the economy instead of the health reform .
as a matter of fact , obama did do so right at the beginning of his term .
but the administration too quickly assumed that economic activity would pick up again .
the economic crisis in europe threw a monkey wrench in these plans - and unemployment figures in the us increased .
the president recognized too late that when citizens are hard up , they always point their finger at the white house .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christina bergmann is dw 's washington correspondent obama also alienated many supporters in his voter base , for example through his inconsistent back and forth about military guidelines forbidding homosexuals from serving openly in the military .
during his campaign , obama had pledged to do away with this practice .
he could n't fulfill this promise just as little as he could his vow to close guantanamo within one year 's time .
but above all , barack obama underestimated one thing : voters all across the country still do n't think much of " washington . "
two years ago , obama was able to benefit from this attitude .
he promised to change politics in the capital .
but he has not accomplished that .
the rift between the democrats and the republicans is deeper than it ever was .
it 's high time to redeem this pledge of bipartisanship .
it makes just as little sense to always blame the republicans - who indeed were mainly experts in saying " no " - as it does to constantly point the finger at his predecessor .
it 's true : george w. bush did drive the country into a crisis .
but that is in the past .
washington is now personified by barack obama as he found out bitterly on this election day .

this is a good time for the european union to help belarus emerge from its isolation , says dw 's daniel scheschkewitz . the german foreign minister 's visit was a risky undertaking .
a politician ca n't expect to present pretty photos and upbeat declarations from the last stronghold of communist rule in europe , where the death penalty is still applied and human rights are routinely trampled upon .
as far as human rights are concerned , guido westerwelle travelled right into the lion 's den .
alexander lukashenko is an outcast among european leaders , a man who rules his country with an iron fist and whose secret police do not shy away from killing opponents of the regime .
so why has the german foreign minister chosen to meet with such a man ?
and why now ?
the former soviet republic with its 10 million inhabitants is an important country , it borders on the european union and deserves attention for its economic potential .
safeguarding existing routes of transport for oil and gas shipments as well as trade cooperation make it advisable to maintain a dialogue with the rulers in minsk .
while at the same time , human rights should not be forgotten , it is an opportune time to exert pressure of the sort westerwelle has exerted during his visit . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daniel scheschkewitz lukashenko has called early presidential elections in mid-december , a vote in which the country 's leadership can show how serious it is about free elections and pluralism .
bearing that in mind , westerwelle 's talks , also with other contenders for the presidency , send the right signal . lukashenko needs eu support due to its tense relations with russia , it is an opportune time for belarus to seek closer ties with the eu , maybe even membership in the council of europe .
the eu foreign ministers have recognized this quest ; accordingly , they loosened entry bans imposed on belarus politicians in 2004 , although the sanctions generally remain in force . in his talks with lukashenko , guido westerwelle is likely to have repeated offers of cooperation - provided , of course , that the belarus leadership shows a real and comprehensible willingness to reform .
there can only be constructive relations and membership in the council of europe for belarus , if elections in december are more free and fair than was the case in 2006 .
lukashenko has promised the german foreign minister that the vote will be handled properly - but skepticism remains .
registering all of the opposition candidates as well as independent election observers would be a first step .
in addition , belarus would have to start functioning in accordance with the rule of law .
a moratorium and eventually a ban on capital punishment could move the country 's value system closer to that of europe . in 21st century europe , isolation should no longer be a political tool of choice .
and it need n't be if minsk takes the offer of dialogue seriously .
westerwelle 's sensitive visit is a bold step towards cooperation , well coordinated with the country 's eu neighbors lithuania and poland . now it 's time for belarus to follow up its vague pledges with concrete action .

the southern balkan state 's first elections since it declared independence are expected to delay the start of european union-sponsored talks with serbia on improving their bilateral relations dialogue should start " only after new institutions emerging from these polls are constituted , " interim president jakup krasniqi told reporters in pristina .
belgrade has refused to recognize kosovo since the former serbian province unilaterally declared independence in 2008 .
the eu has been trying to get pristina and belgrade to hold direct talks in a bid to normalize relations between the two sides .

interim president jakup krasniqi immediately dissolved parliament and announced the polls , which under kosovo 's constitution , have to be held within 45 days .

" the vote by the members of parliament is a vote for the future of kosovo .
it is a responsible decision that will mark a new beginning for the state of kosovo , " he said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de united states -pipe- 03.11.2010 obama concedes defeat in house , pledges to work with republicans großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the balance of power is shifting in the us congress president barack obama admits that he took a beating in the mid-term elections as republicans storm into the house of representatives .
the democrats manage to keep a slim majority in the senate . us republicans won a huge majority in the house of representatives in midterm elections , delivering a blow president barack obama described as a " shellacking . "
" i am not recommending for every future president that they take a shellacking like i did last night , " obama said in a news conference on wednesday .
" i am sure there are easier ways to learn these lessons . "
the conservative republican party gained at least 60 seats in the house of representatives , the biggest shift of congressional power since 1948 and more than enough to win control of the 435-member lower chamber .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : john boehner is set to become the new house speaker the vote toppled democrat nancy pelosi from her position as speaker of the house , leaving ohio republic and house minority leader john boehner ready to fill the position .
speaking as almost all of the polls across the country had closed , boehner pledged to cut government spending .
in a victory rally at the republican party 's headquarters in washington , he said that americans had sent a clear message for obama to " change course . "
" our new majority will be prepared to do things differently , " boehner said .
" it starts with cutting spending instead of increasing it , reducing the size of government instead of increasing it , and reforming the way congress works . "
president obama placed a congratulatory phone call to boehner on tuesday evening , saying he looked forward to working together with boehner to find common ground and move the country forward .
bildunterschrift : environmental legislation on hold however , republican control of the house could lead to legislative gridlock .
obama acknowledged that democratic plans for a " cap-and-trade " system - charging industry for carbon dioxide emissions blamed for global climate change - would have to be put off for at least the next two years .
" it 's doubtful that you could get the votes to pass that through the house this year , or next year , or the year after , " obama said .
" cap and trade was just one way of skinning the cat … it was a means , not an end . "
republicans made gains in the senate , where 37 out of 100 upper house seats were at stake .
with three seats still too close to call on wednesday , democrats took a net loss of 6 seats for 51 , while republicans took 46 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama and the democrats kept hold of the senate democrats were helped by a victory for democratic majority leader harry reid , who won his seat with about 50 percent of the vote .
reid was challenged by sharron angle , backed by the grassroots conservative tea party movement .
democrats were not so lucky in florida , where republican marco rubio became the first tea party-backed candidate to win a senate seat .
but another tea party favorite - controversial senate candidate for delaware , christine o 'donnell - lost her race .
comfortable majority in lower house although much of the debate leading up to the election focused on anxiety about the us economy , the increased number of republican seats in congress may also have foreign policy implications .
spending on development could be blocked in the lower house and republican gains in the senate are likely to make it more difficult for the obama administration to ratify international treaties .
it is thought that the republicans could use their enhanced platform in congress to frustrate aspects of obama 's foreign policy , for instance , by opposing any peace deal in afghanistan that would bring the taliban to the negotiating table .
of the 50 states in the union , 37 also elected a new governor .
california voters elected democrat jerry brown , who served as governor in the 1970s and 80s , replacing austrian-born actor-turned-politician arnold schwarzenegger .
the state also rejected a proposal to decriminalize recreational marijuana .

werder bremen 's chances of advancing are all but over , losing to dutch champs twente . schalke were held to a draw in their soccer showdown with hapoel tel aviv , leaving them only a point ahead of their third-place champions league group rivals .
tel aviv had the better of the first half with forwards toto tamuz and ben sahar posing several threats but failing to convert .
at the other end of the pitch , spanish striker raul and dutchman klaas-jan huntelaar struggled to break through the defense quite as effectively as their opponents .
while schalke keeper manuel neuer frustrated hapoel with several acrobatic saves , his tel aviv counterpart vincent enyeama was rarely troubled .

a deflected shot from nacer chadli put the dutch club ahead after 81 minutes , before a stooping header from luuk de jong sealed the win with six minutes remaining .
bremen are at the bottom of group a on two points , three points behind twente .
english side tottenham hotspur now top the group on goal difference with seven points after a 3-1 home victory over european champions inter milan .

" when i 'm in the presence of a beautiful girl , i look at her , " he said at the opening of a motorcycle industry show in milan .
" it 's better to have a passion for beautiful girls than to be gay . "

despite newspaper speculation that the issue could bring down berlusconi 's government and lead to early elections , the prime minister said he and his coalition were in it for the long haul .
" you should be completely reassured about the government and about the fact that it 's a government that still has a majority that intends to govern until the end of its term , " he said .
berlusconi has faced down other sex scandals by saying that while he is " no saint , " he has never paid for sex .
his current term of office expires in 2013 .

niebel set out to promote germany 's engagement in latin america . german development minister dirk niebel has told bolivian president evo morales of his concern about the lack of security for international investors in the country .
niebel questioned morales 's policy of nationalizing key industries , including oil , gas and coal mining .
" i am sure that german companies are interested in bolivia , " niebel said during his visit to la paz .
" but their investments must be safe and companies can not be nationalized . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " investments must be safe , " niebel said in may 2008 , the german-peruvian company " oiltanking " was brought under state control by morales .
the company is now trying to use international arbitration to get compensation .
the dispute is over the sum of around 16 million dollars -lrb- 11 million euros -rrb- , as well as who should pay outstanding debts .
" regarding the energy sector , i think the government is going to continue its existing policy , " niebel said .

however , he added there are better prospects in branches like pharmaceuticals and the paper industry .
companies wanting to invest in bolivia need a lot of patience - in addition to the necessary funds .
the system can be bureaucratic and slow , and is prone to corruption .
developing the market is at the forefront of the work of the german-bolivian chamber of commerce .
joerg zehnle believes that countries should work together to make this happen .
" in bolivia there are a number of under-developed markets - that 's why it 's described as a developing country , " zehnle explained .
" and that 's where the german economy , as well as german development work , can get involved in the future . "
zehnle wants in particular to focus on education , renewable energy and energy efficiency .
concerns about justice the german development minister said he wanted to find new ways of cooperating with bolivia in future .
in terms of the level of financial support germany may in future provide , niebel wants to take into account the legal aspects of the aid .
germany spent 62 million euros -lrb- 86 million dollars -rrb- in bolivia in the year 2009-2010 , primarily directed at the fight against poverty .
the country is a priority recipient of german aid funds . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : morales is said to have fired a number of opposition officials niebel is concerned about how the money is being used , notably because the judicial system is not seen as independent .

niebel said he 'd told the bolivian president that the germans work differently .
" for us , someone is said to be innocent until he is proven guilty in a court of law .
you can not be fired just because the public prosecutor has brought charges against you , " niebel said . press freedom also under scutiny freedom of speech is also in danger in bolivia .
a new law may soon come into force , allowing morales to close down entire editorial departments if journalists are found to have written racist articles .
niebel said he had not found time to discuss this issue with the president . niebel 's first visit to south america is seen as an opportunity to promote germany 's engagement on the continent by helping cash-poor but resource-rich nations to become more independent .
" during german unification and the european union 's extension in eastern europe , we did not pay enough attention to some other parts of the world , " niebel said .
" that applies particularly to africa and to some extent to latin america . "
niebel continues his tour of south america in peru and colombia .

niebel set out to promote germany 's engagement in latin america . german development minister dirk niebel has told bolivian president evo morales of his concern about the lack of security for international investors in the country .
niebel questioned morales 's policy of nationalizing key industries , including oil , gas and coal mining .
" i am sure that german companies are interested in bolivia , " niebel said during his visit to la paz .
" but their investments must be safe and companies can not be nationalized . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " investments must be safe , " niebel said in may 2008 , the german-peruvian company " oiltanking " was brought under state control by morales .
the company is now trying to use international arbitration to get compensation .
the dispute is over the sum of around 16 million dollars -lrb- 11 million euros -rrb- , as well as who should pay outstanding debts .
" regarding the energy sector , i think the government is going to continue its existing policy , " niebel said .
" you have to take note of that and adjust your business decisions accordingly . "
strategic investment according to the german-bolivian chamber of commerce , only companies investing in strategically important fields such as mining , gas , oil and transport are at risk .
those who want to invest in such industries should think their decision through carefully , the head of the chamber of commerce , joerg zehnle , warned .
however , he added there are better prospects in branches like pharmaceuticals and the paper industry .
companies wanting to invest in bolivia need a lot of patience - in addition to the necessary funds .
the system can be bureaucratic and slow , and is prone to corruption .
developing the market is at the forefront of the work of the german-bolivian chamber of commerce .
joerg zehnle believes that countries should work together to make this happen .
" in bolivia there are a number of under-developed markets - that 's why it 's described as a developing country , " zehnle explained .
" and that 's where the german economy , as well as german development work , can get involved in the future . "
zehnle wants in particular to focus on education , renewable energy and energy efficiency .
concerns about justice the german development minister said he wanted to find new ways of cooperating with bolivia in future .
in terms of the level of financial support germany may in future provide , niebel wants to take into account the legal aspects of the aid .
germany spent 62 million euros -lrb- 86 million dollars -rrb- in bolivia in the year 2009-2010 , primarily directed at the fight against poverty .
the country is a priority recipient of german aid funds . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : morales is said to have fired a number of opposition officials niebel is concerned about how the money is being used , notably because the judicial system is not seen as independent .
morales is accused of firing public officials who refused to toe the government line .
niebel said he 'd told the bolivian president that the germans work differently .
" for us , someone is said to be innocent until he is proven guilty in a court of law .
you can not be fired just because the public prosecutor has brought charges against you , " niebel said . press freedom also under scutiny freedom of speech is also in danger in bolivia .
a new law may soon come into force , allowing morales to close down entire editorial departments if journalists are found to have written racist articles .
niebel said he had not found time to discuss this issue with the president . niebel 's first visit to south america is seen as an opportunity to promote germany 's engagement on the continent by helping cash-poor but resource-rich nations to become more independent .
" during german unification and the european union 's extension in eastern europe , we did not pay enough attention to some other parts of the world , " niebel said .
" that applies particularly to africa and to some extent to latin america . "
niebel continues his tour of south america in peru and colombia .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de foreign trade -pipe- 03.11.2010 industry leaders warn against overreaction on air freight security großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : industry leaders say total security is a politicians ' fantasy as air cargo security is tightened around europe , german industry leaders warn that expensive checks on freight would damage world trade .
total security is simply a politician 's fantasy , they say . the pressure was on the german government when it was revealed sunday that a us-bound bomb discovered on a cargo plane in london had passed through germany 's cologne bonn airport .
all flights - first cargo , then passenger services – from the bomb 's country of origin , yemen , were suspended .
interior minister thomas de maiziere was quick to announce that investigations would follow .
" air freight has been relatively under-monitored up to now .
evidently they recognized that and exploited it .
this means changes for the air freight business . "
transport minister peter ramsauer echoed his colleague and underlined the swiftness of the government 's measures .
" our security measures are meant to guarantee that no freight will get to germany from yemen , " he said .
" now possible gaps in the air freight security system have to be uncovered and closed . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ramsauer said security gaps need to be uncovered and closed time is money but german industry leaders are worried that the government may be lining up knee-jerk security measures that could prove costly .
" the safety checks are becoming more bureaucratic and cumbersome .
that costs time , and time is money , " axel nitschke , export economy chief at the german association of chambers of commerce and industry -lrb- dihk -rrb- , told the handelsblatt newspaper dierk mueller , general manager of the american chamber of commerce in germany , told deutsche welle that talk of extra checks was little more than a security blanket for politicians eager to cover their backs .
the us government has already passed a law stating that all cargo containers entering the us by sea or air have to be scanned , but this is a task that thwarts all logistics .
" this law is already in place , but not implemented , " mueller said .
" the us government said we must postpone implementation until we know how to do it .
even if you have all the money in the world , no-one knows how to do it .
there is just no 100 percent security . "
physically impossible the technological obstacles are practically insurmountable .

total security is simply a politician 's fantasy , they say . the pressure was on the german government when it was revealed sunday that a us-bound bomb discovered on a cargo plane in london had passed through germany 's cologne bonn airport .
all flights - first cargo , then passenger services – from the bomb 's country of origin , yemen , were suspended .
interior minister thomas de maiziere was quick to announce that investigations would follow .
" air freight has been relatively under-monitored up to now .
evidently they recognized that and exploited it .
this means changes for the air freight business . "
transport minister peter ramsauer echoed his colleague and underlined the swiftness of the government 's measures .
" our security measures are meant to guarantee that no freight will get to germany from yemen , " he said .
" now possible gaps in the air freight security system have to be uncovered and closed . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ramsauer said security gaps need to be uncovered and closed time is money but german industry leaders are worried that the government may be lining up knee-jerk security measures that could prove costly .
" the safety checks are becoming more bureaucratic and cumbersome .
that costs time , and time is money , " axel nitschke , export economy chief at the german association of chambers of commerce and industry -lrb- dihk -rrb- , told the handelsblatt newspaper dierk mueller , general manager of the american chamber of commerce in germany , told deutsche welle that talk of extra checks was little more than a security blanket for politicians eager to cover their backs .
the us government has already passed a law stating that all cargo containers entering the us by sea or air have to be scanned , but this is a task that thwarts all logistics .
" this law is already in place , but not implemented , " mueller said .
" the us government said we must postpone implementation until we know how to do it .
even if you have all the money in the world , no-one knows how to do it .
there is just no 100 percent security . "
physically impossible the technological obstacles are practically insurmountable .
" air freight is a little easier .
the containers are smaller , but still , you have to do x-raying and computer tomography , because x-raying ca n't detect certain types of plastic explosives .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de press freedom -pipe- 03.11.2010 media suppression , violence against journalists increases in latin america großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : latin america is experiencing a worrying return to censorship press freedom campaigners and journalism associations are increasingly concerned at what many describe as the dawning of a new era of media suppression in a number of latin american countries . while journalists no longer face the threats associated with the institutionalized death squads of the past , a new shadow is being cast over free speech and objective reporting in nations which have long since cast off the yoke of dictatorship . government-controlled censorship and the targeting of journalists by the state security apparatus may be part of many latin american countries ' dark history .
but free speech is still in danger from powerful organized crime syndicates intent on silencing reporters and the disturbing creep of monopolized media industries under the auspices of sovereign leaders . the country generating most concern is mexico , where a total of 68 journalists and media workers have been killed and a further 11 abducted since 2000 .
mexico has become one of the deadliest places in the world for journalists .
the rising power of drug cartels and the mexican government 's violent crackdown on narcotics gangs has turned areas of the country into battlegrounds . journalists there working on stories about the drug war live in constant fear of being kidnapped , tortured and murdered by cartels desperate to silence the media 's reporting on their activities and members .
these alliances are eager to gain control of the airwaves .
the international press freedom organization reporters without borders claims that drug gangs target journalists with impunity , as prosecutions relating to these crimes are very rarely completed . mexican government failing journalists , campaigners claim bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : journalists continue to die while reporting on mexico 's drug war reporters without borders also claims that mexico 's special federal attorney 's office for combating violence against the media has failed to make much of an impression since its creation in 2006 .
the myriad departments dedicated to press freedom in the executive , legislative and judicial branches of government often cancel each other out through passivity or negligence . " the mexican government has done almost nothing to protect journalists , " benoit hervieu , the americas expert at reporters without borders , told deutsche welle .
" the special attorney charged with following up the investigations into crimes against journalists has been given over 500 files , and maybe one percent of them have been looked into .
it is very hard to follow up investigations in mexico . " the mexican government has also been dogged by accusations that certain sectors of the state apparatus have been infiltrated by organized crime gangs .
it is alleged that the authorities are also complicit , if not entirely responsible , for serious human rights violations including the suppression of free speech . " some government officials are involved in the suppression of the media and the violence committed against journalists , so investigations get hindered at an official level , " hervieu said .
" it is very hard to pursue these cases .
plus bureaucracy is terrible in mexico .
it is one of the worst countries in latin america for this . " fear drives journalists to self-censor journalists in mexico are living in such fear that there is a concern that the constant threat to their lives is leading to a form of self-censorship in an attempt to protect themselves . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pressure from cartels force journalists to self-censorship only last week , el diario , a newspaper in the mexican border city of ciudad juárez , appealed directly in a front-page story to the drug cartels which have turned the city into a war zone and who have taken a number of journalists ' lives .
in the article , the paper asked for reporting and censorship guidelines . " gentlemen … please explain to us … what you would like us to publish or stop publishing , " the statement read .
" the last thing we want is for another one of our colleagues to fall victim to your gunshots . " " the cartels are obviously involved and responsible for attacks and media suppression but they also provide the government with a very convenient excuse , " said hervieu .
" it is so easy for the government to blame the cartels .
this is war , and in war confusion is high .
it is therefore easy to say that the enemy is responsible .
but in some of the most dangerous regions of mexico , it is the police and the army which is the most feared . " while mexico is considered the most dangerous place in latin america for press freedom , it is not the only country in the region where journalists ' lives are at risk .
in honduras , eight journalists have been killed so far this year by drug traffickers or in violent struggles with government forces in protests over land reform and the political situation in the country since the government was overthrown in 2009 . " in honduras , the violence came after the coup in 2009 and the attacks on journalists came as revenge for dissent during the unrest , " hervieu said .
" this political violence continues with no investigations .
honduras , along with mexico and colombia , is one of the most dangerous places for journalists in latin america . " democratically-elected leaders building media monopolies elsewhere , the rise of government-backed media monopolies and the election of leaders keen to suppress dissenting voices are having detrimental effects on press freedom in countries such as venezuela , ecuador , argentina and bolivia . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chavez forced a number of media outlets to close down dictatorships may be a thing of the past in most latin america countries , apart from cuba , but leaders like venezuelan president hugo chávez are exercising a level of control similar to that favored by the totalitarian regimes they were elected to replace .
chávez has closed down a television network , 32 radio stations and two local television channels allegedly because they criticized a political ally . rights groups accuse both president rafael correa of ecuador and argentina 's leader cristina fernández of increasing their governments ' grip on media institutions to an unhealthy degree . correa 's regime now controls some 20 media companies in ecuador and has brought in legislation which limits ownership of media outlets and what these outlets can broadcast in certain circumstances .
this legislation was cited during a period of unrest in september when correa ordered all television and radio stations to broadcast only government-supplied information . dismantling powerful opponent in argentina bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fernández has her eye on increasing favorable coverage meanwhile in argentina , fernández is allegedly engaged in a campaign to break up the country 's biggest media conglomerate , the clarín group , after it began broadcasting negative coverage of her and her recently deceased husband and former president néstor kirchner . by applying pressure to some of the group 's most influential contract partners , cancelling the company 's license to provide internet service , and sending tax officials to raid the group 's headquarters , fernández is determined to dismantle a powerful mouthpiece of dissent while increasing government advertising revenue in a bid to replace the clarín group 's negative content with more government-friendly coverage . " clarín , owner of newspapers , radio stations , broadcast and cable television outlets , and an internet service provider , has had an antagonistic relationship with fernandez-kirchner since a 2008 conflict with the farming sector over a tax raise , " according to carlos lauría , senior program coordinator for the americas at the committee to protect journalists -lrb- cpj -rrb- .
he said the government had accused clarín and other private media of biased coverage . " journalists at clarín and national newspaper la nación believe the government is engaged in an intimidating campaign to silence critics , " lauría said . meanwhile both bolivia and nicaragua have passed laws which allow their governments to close media outlets deemed disruptive while allegedly prosecuting and imprisoning critical reporters on trumped up charges such as money laundering . media campaigners have a pessimistic view of the state of press freedom in latin america and while there are efforts being made to turn things around , few have much hope of widespread change . " what is needed is open debate , " said hervieu .
" in argentina and uruguay , there was a debate among teachers and intellectuals about how the media could regain its full freedom .
that 's a start . " however , he said in mexico , it would take a massive institutional reform with the help of the united states to bring about change .

chancellor merkel pointed to successful examples of integration and said society should put more effort into working with immigrants . by 2015 german chancellor angela merkel wants to give every immigrant the opportunity to take part in integration courses .
the government estimates that by that time around 1.8 million people will have attended the courses since they were first introduced in 2005 .
" we 're catching up in 10 years on what we failed to do in the previous 30 years , " merkel said at the end of an integration summit in berlin on wednesday .
" we want to be more concrete . "
that was the message of german chancellor angela merkel at the berlin integration summit .
she wants to set clear standards to make it easier to assess what germany has achieved , and what is still to be done on the issue of integration .
' multiculturalism has failed ' merkel said the notion that integration could be achieved simply by different living next to one another was outdated .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : politicians , experts and minority groups took part merkel , who said in a speech last month that " multiculturalism has failed , " set out to prove that integration would not happen by itself .
she said that true integration required much more energy and engagement from all of society .
the chancellor praised the atmosphere at the summit as being " the right working environment . "
the 120 participants , including politicians , economists , and representatives of the police and the media apparently exchanged " controversial opinions " with one another .
merkel said they had spoken openly about " what had yet to be achieved . "
for example , she pointed out that there was a lot of work still to do on the issue of violence in schools .
" there 's still a long way to go on this journey , " merkel commented .
the government says it will spend about 400 million euros -lrb- 560 million dollars -rrb- by 2014 on improving german language skills among the children of immigrants so they can perform better at school .
it is also seeking to help immigrants get their foreign qualifications recognised in germany , and to have more people from immigrant backgrounds working in the civil service and in the police force .
success stories there were some impressive examples of successes in immigration policy , merkel said .
she cited sport as an example .
the 2010 german world cup team was the most multicultural ever , with a number of players from turkish and african immigrant families .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and boehmer have drawn up an action plan maria boehmer is the government minister responsible for the issue of integration .
she echoed the chancellor 's words , saying that " a lot of ground had been gained " in the last few years .
she said there were more positive stories of integration " than had been told in the last few weeks . "
germany has been embroiled in a debate about integration since a prominent member of the board of the state bank , the bundesbank , sparked outrage in germany and abroad when he published a book which claimed that muslims themselves were in part responsible for failing to integrate into german society .
he was forced to resign from his post , but the debate simmered on .
boehmer cited a new national action plan , which should make progress in integration easier to follow , and will complement the current national integration plan .
she said that police , care workers and teachers could play a " bridging role " in helping immigrants to integrate .
some participants , however , criticized the lack of real results at the summit .
aydan oezoguz , who is responsible for integration in the opposition spd parliamentary group , called the action plan a " hotch-potch of measures that had already been agreed on . "
the spokesperson on migration policy for the left party , sevim dagdelen , said it was merely a " symbolic summit " that would not change the daily reality for immigrants in germany . ´ the federal statistics office says about 16 million people in germany come from a " migrant background " - just under 20 percent of the population .
of these , an estimated 4 million are muslim , mostly of turkish origin .

chancellor merkel pointed to successful examples of integration and said society should put more effort into working with immigrants . by 2015 german chancellor angela merkel wants to give every immigrant the opportunity to take part in integration courses .
the government estimates that by that time around 1.8 million people will have attended the courses since they were first introduced in 2005 .
" we 're catching up in 10 years on what we failed to do in the previous 30 years , " merkel said at the end of an integration summit in berlin on wednesday .
" we want to be more concrete . "
that was the message of german chancellor angela merkel at the berlin integration summit .
she wants to set clear standards to make it easier to assess what germany has achieved , and what is still to be done on the issue of integration .
' multiculturalism has failed ' merkel said the notion that integration could be achieved simply by different living next to one another was outdated .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : politicians , experts and minority groups took part merkel , who said in a speech last month that " multiculturalism has failed , " set out to prove that integration would not happen by itself .
she said that true integration required much more energy and engagement from all of society .
the chancellor praised the atmosphere at the summit as being " the right working environment . "
the 120 participants , including politicians , economists , and representatives of the police and the media apparently exchanged " controversial opinions " with one another .
merkel said they had spoken openly about " what had yet to be achieved . "
for example , she pointed out that there was a lot of work still to do on the issue of violence in schools .
" there 's still a long way to go on this journey , " merkel commented .
the government says it will spend about 400 million euros -lrb- 560 million dollars -rrb- by 2014 on improving german language skills among the children of immigrants so they can perform better at school .
it is also seeking to help immigrants get their foreign qualifications recognised in germany , and to have more people from immigrant backgrounds working in the civil service and in the police force .
success stories there were some impressive examples of successes in immigration policy , merkel said .
she cited sport as an example .
the 2010 german world cup team was the most multicultural ever , with a number of players from turkish and african immigrant families .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and boehmer have drawn up an action plan maria boehmer is the government minister responsible for the issue of integration .
she echoed the chancellor 's words , saying that " a lot of ground had been gained " in the last few years .
she said there were more positive stories of integration " than had been told in the last few weeks . "
germany has been embroiled in a debate about integration since a prominent member of the board of the state bank , the bundesbank , sparked outrage in germany and abroad when he published a book which claimed that muslims themselves were in part responsible for failing to integrate into german society .
he was forced to resign from his post , but the debate simmered on .
boehmer cited a new national action plan , which should make progress in integration easier to follow , and will complement the current national integration plan .
she said that police , care workers and teachers could play a " bridging role " in helping immigrants to integrate .
some participants , however , criticized the lack of real results at the summit .
aydan oezoguz , who is responsible for integration in the opposition spd parliamentary group , called the action plan a " hotch-potch of measures that had already been agreed on . "
the spokesperson on migration policy for the left party , sevim dagdelen , said it was merely a " symbolic summit " that would not change the daily reality for immigrants in germany . ´ the federal statistics office says about 16 million people in germany come from a " migrant background " - just under 20 percent of the population .
of these , an estimated 4 million are muslim , mostly of turkish origin .

but free speech is still in danger from powerful organized crime syndicates intent on silencing reporters and the disturbing creep of monopolized media industries under the auspices of sovereign leaders . the country generating most concern is mexico , where a total of 68 journalists and media workers have been killed and a further 11 abducted since 2000 .
mexico has become one of the deadliest places in the world for journalists .
the rising power of drug cartels and the mexican government 's violent crackdown on narcotics gangs has turned areas of the country into battlegrounds . journalists there working on stories about the drug war live in constant fear of being kidnapped , tortured and murdered by cartels desperate to silence the media 's reporting on their activities and members .
these alliances are eager to gain control of the airwaves .
the international press freedom organization reporters without borders claims that drug gangs target journalists with impunity , as prosecutions relating to these crimes are very rarely completed . mexican government failing journalists , campaigners claim bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : journalists continue to die while reporting on mexico 's drug war reporters without borders also claims that mexico 's special federal attorney 's office for combating violence against the media has failed to make much of an impression since its creation in 2006 .
the myriad departments dedicated to press freedom in the executive , legislative and judicial branches of government often cancel each other out through passivity or negligence . " the mexican government has done almost nothing to protect journalists , " benoit hervieu , the americas expert at reporters without borders , told deutsche welle .
" the special attorney charged with following up the investigations into crimes against journalists has been given over 500 files , and maybe one percent of them have been looked into .
it is very hard to follow up investigations in mexico . " the mexican government has also been dogged by accusations that certain sectors of the state apparatus have been infiltrated by organized crime gangs .
it is alleged that the authorities are also complicit , if not entirely responsible , for serious human rights violations including the suppression of free speech . " some government officials are involved in the suppression of the media and the violence committed against journalists , so investigations get hindered at an official level , " hervieu said .
" it is very hard to pursue these cases .
plus bureaucracy is terrible in mexico .
it is one of the worst countries in latin america for this . " fear drives journalists to self-censor journalists in mexico are living in such fear that there is a concern that the constant threat to their lives is leading to a form of self-censorship in an attempt to protect themselves . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pressure from cartels force journalists to self-censorship only last week , el diario , a newspaper in the mexican border city of ciudad juárez , appealed directly in a front-page story to the drug cartels which have turned the city into a war zone and who have taken a number of journalists ' lives .
in the article , the paper asked for reporting and censorship guidelines . " gentlemen … please explain to us … what you would like us to publish or stop publishing , " the statement read .
" the last thing we want is for another one of our colleagues to fall victim to your gunshots . " " the cartels are obviously involved and responsible for attacks and media suppression but they also provide the government with a very convenient excuse , " said hervieu .
" it is so easy for the government to blame the cartels .
this is war , and in war confusion is high .
it is therefore easy to say that the enemy is responsible .
but in some of the most dangerous regions of mexico , it is the police and the army which is the most feared . " while mexico is considered the most dangerous place in latin america for press freedom , it is not the only country in the region where journalists ' lives are at risk .
in honduras , eight journalists have been killed so far this year by drug traffickers or in violent struggles with government forces in protests over land reform and the political situation in the country since the government was overthrown in 2009 . " in honduras , the violence came after the coup in 2009 and the attacks on journalists came as revenge for dissent during the unrest , " hervieu said .
" this political violence continues with no investigations .
honduras , along with mexico and colombia , is one of the most dangerous places for journalists in latin america . " democratically-elected leaders building media monopolies elsewhere , the rise of government-backed media monopolies and the election of leaders keen to suppress dissenting voices are having detrimental effects on press freedom in countries such as venezuela , ecuador , argentina and bolivia . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chavez forced a number of media outlets to close down dictatorships may be a thing of the past in most latin america countries , apart from cuba , but leaders like venezuelan president hugo chávez are exercising a level of control similar to that favored by the totalitarian regimes they were elected to replace .
chávez has closed down a television network , 32 radio stations and two local television channels allegedly because they criticized a political ally . rights groups accuse both president rafael correa of ecuador and argentina 's leader cristina fernández of increasing their governments ' grip on media institutions to an unhealthy degree . correa 's regime now controls some 20 media companies in ecuador and has brought in legislation which limits ownership of media outlets and what these outlets can broadcast in certain circumstances .
this legislation was cited during a period of unrest in september when correa ordered all television and radio stations to broadcast only government-supplied information . dismantling powerful opponent in argentina bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fernández has her eye on increasing favorable coverage meanwhile in argentina , fernández is allegedly engaged in a campaign to break up the country 's biggest media conglomerate , the clarín group , after it began broadcasting negative coverage of her and her recently deceased husband and former president néstor kirchner . by applying pressure to some of the group 's most influential contract partners , cancelling the company 's license to provide internet service , and sending tax officials to raid the group 's headquarters , fernández is determined to dismantle a powerful mouthpiece of dissent while increasing government advertising revenue in a bid to replace the clarín group 's negative content with more government-friendly coverage . " clarín , owner of newspapers , radio stations , broadcast and cable television outlets , and an internet service provider , has had an antagonistic relationship with fernandez-kirchner since a 2008 conflict with the farming sector over a tax raise , " according to carlos lauría , senior program coordinator for the americas at the committee to protect journalists -lrb- cpj -rrb- .
he said the government had accused clarín and other private media of biased coverage . " journalists at clarín and national newspaper la nación believe the government is engaged in an intimidating campaign to silence critics , " lauría said . meanwhile both bolivia and nicaragua have passed laws which allow their governments to close media outlets deemed disruptive while allegedly prosecuting and imprisoning critical reporters on trumped up charges such as money laundering . media campaigners have a pessimistic view of the state of press freedom in latin america and while there are efforts being made to turn things around , few have much hope of widespread change . " what is needed is open debate , " said hervieu .
" in argentina and uruguay , there was a debate among teachers and intellectuals about how the media could regain its full freedom .

but free speech is still in danger from powerful organized crime syndicates intent on silencing reporters and the disturbing creep of monopolized media industries under the auspices of sovereign leaders . the country generating most concern is mexico , where a total of 68 journalists and media workers have been killed and a further 11 abducted since 2000 .
mexico has become one of the deadliest places in the world for journalists .
the rising power of drug cartels and the mexican government 's violent crackdown on narcotics gangs has turned areas of the country into battlegrounds . journalists there working on stories about the drug war live in constant fear of being kidnapped , tortured and murdered by cartels desperate to silence the media 's reporting on their activities and members .
these alliances are eager to gain control of the airwaves .
the international press freedom organization reporters without borders claims that drug gangs target journalists with impunity , as prosecutions relating to these crimes are very rarely completed . mexican government failing journalists , campaigners claim bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : journalists continue to die while reporting on mexico 's drug war reporters without borders also claims that mexico 's special federal attorney 's office for combating violence against the media has failed to make much of an impression since its creation in 2006 .
the myriad departments dedicated to press freedom in the executive , legislative and judicial branches of government often cancel each other out through passivity or negligence . " the mexican government has done almost nothing to protect journalists , " benoit hervieu , the americas expert at reporters without borders , told deutsche welle .
" the special attorney charged with following up the investigations into crimes against journalists has been given over 500 files , and maybe one percent of them have been looked into .
it is very hard to follow up investigations in mexico . " the mexican government has also been dogged by accusations that certain sectors of the state apparatus have been infiltrated by organized crime gangs .
it is alleged that the authorities are also complicit , if not entirely responsible , for serious human rights violations including the suppression of free speech . " some government officials are involved in the suppression of the media and the violence committed against journalists , so investigations get hindered at an official level , " hervieu said .
" it is very hard to pursue these cases .
plus bureaucracy is terrible in mexico .
it is one of the worst countries in latin america for this . " fear drives journalists to self-censor journalists in mexico are living in such fear that there is a concern that the constant threat to their lives is leading to a form of self-censorship in an attempt to protect themselves . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pressure from cartels force journalists to self-censorship only last week , el diario , a newspaper in the mexican border city of ciudad juárez , appealed directly in a front-page story to the drug cartels which have turned the city into a war zone and who have taken a number of journalists ' lives .
in the article , the paper asked for reporting and censorship guidelines . " gentlemen … please explain to us … what you would like us to publish or stop publishing , " the statement read .
" the last thing we want is for another one of our colleagues to fall victim to your gunshots . " " the cartels are obviously involved and responsible for attacks and media suppression but they also provide the government with a very convenient excuse , " said hervieu .
" it is so easy for the government to blame the cartels .
this is war , and in war confusion is high .
it is therefore easy to say that the enemy is responsible .
but in some of the most dangerous regions of mexico , it is the police and the army which is the most feared . " while mexico is considered the most dangerous place in latin america for press freedom , it is not the only country in the region where journalists ' lives are at risk .
in honduras , eight journalists have been killed so far this year by drug traffickers or in violent struggles with government forces in protests over land reform and the political situation in the country since the government was overthrown in 2009 . " in honduras , the violence came after the coup in 2009 and the attacks on journalists came as revenge for dissent during the unrest , " hervieu said .
" this political violence continues with no investigations .
honduras , along with mexico and colombia , is one of the most dangerous places for journalists in latin america . " democratically-elected leaders building media monopolies elsewhere , the rise of government-backed media monopolies and the election of leaders keen to suppress dissenting voices are having detrimental effects on press freedom in countries such as venezuela , ecuador , argentina and bolivia . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chavez forced a number of media outlets to close down dictatorships may be a thing of the past in most latin america countries , apart from cuba , but leaders like venezuelan president hugo chávez are exercising a level of control similar to that favored by the totalitarian regimes they were elected to replace .
chávez has closed down a television network , 32 radio stations and two local television channels allegedly because they criticized a political ally . rights groups accuse both president rafael correa of ecuador and argentina 's leader cristina fernández of increasing their governments ' grip on media institutions to an unhealthy degree . correa 's regime now controls some 20 media companies in ecuador and has brought in legislation which limits ownership of media outlets and what these outlets can broadcast in certain circumstances .
this legislation was cited during a period of unrest in september when correa ordered all television and radio stations to broadcast only government-supplied information . dismantling powerful opponent in argentina bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fernández has her eye on increasing favorable coverage meanwhile in argentina , fernández is allegedly engaged in a campaign to break up the country 's biggest media conglomerate , the clarín group , after it began broadcasting negative coverage of her and her recently deceased husband and former president néstor kirchner . by applying pressure to some of the group 's most influential contract partners , cancelling the company 's license to provide internet service , and sending tax officials to raid the group 's headquarters , fernández is determined to dismantle a powerful mouthpiece of dissent while increasing government advertising revenue in a bid to replace the clarín group 's negative content with more government-friendly coverage . " clarín , owner of newspapers , radio stations , broadcast and cable television outlets , and an internet service provider , has had an antagonistic relationship with fernandez-kirchner since a 2008 conflict with the farming sector over a tax raise , " according to carlos lauría , senior program coordinator for the americas at the committee to protect journalists -lrb- cpj -rrb- .
he said the government had accused clarín and other private media of biased coverage . " journalists at clarín and national newspaper la nación believe the government is engaged in an intimidating campaign to silence critics , " lauría said . meanwhile both bolivia and nicaragua have passed laws which allow their governments to close media outlets deemed disruptive while allegedly prosecuting and imprisoning critical reporters on trumped up charges such as money laundering . media campaigners have a pessimistic view of the state of press freedom in latin america and while there are efforts being made to turn things around , few have much hope of widespread change . " what is needed is open debate , " said hervieu .
" in argentina and uruguay , there was a debate among teachers and intellectuals about how the media could regain its full freedom .
that 's a start . " however , he said in mexico , it would take a massive institutional reform with the help of the united states to bring about change .

the move comes as canada , spain and , most recently , italy are scrutinizing the california company . in an announcement wednesday , british data protection authorities said there was a " significant breach of the data protection act " and that google uk would be subject to an audit .
further , it added , the company must promise that similar data breaches do not occur again .
the uk authorities had once again taken up the privacy case against google late last month after google had revealed further details that it had obtained " wifi data . "
that data included passwords and e-mails while google was sending cars along british streets and in other countries for its street view service .
earlier this year , the information commissioner 's office -lrb- ico -rrb- had said that it had found " no wrongdoing " on google 's part , but re-opened an investigation last week .
" it is my view that the collection of this information was not fair or lawful and constitutes a significant breach of the first principle of the data protection act , " said christopher graham , the uk information commissioner , in a statement published wednesday on the ico 's website .
" the most appropriate and proportionate regulatory action in these circumstances is to get written legal assurance from google that this will not happen again – and to follow this up with an ico audit . "
the ico elaborated that it had declined to seek monetary damages against the silicon valley company as it would have been too legally difficult to prove .
" monetary penalties can only be served when a strict set of criteria is satisfied , including that the breach was likely to cause substantial harm or substantial distress – this alone would be very hard to prove in this case , " wrote kirsty mccaskill , an ico spokesperson , in a statement provided to deutsche welle .
" the vast majority of the pay-load data was also collected prior to 6 april 2010 , before our new powers came into force . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the vehicles used to create street view inadvertantly collected the data google says google has admitted guilt in a written statement also provided to deutsche welle , peter fleischer , google 's global privacy counsel said that the company had made a mistake .
" we are profoundly sorry for mistakenly collecting payload data in the uk from unencrypted wireless networks , " he wrote .
" since we announced our mistake in may we have cooperated closely with the ico and worked to improve our internal controls .
as we have said before , we did not want this data , have never used any of it in our products or services , and have sought to delete it as quickly as possible .
we are in the process of confirming that there are no outstanding legal obligations upon us to retain the data , and will then ensure that it is quickly and safely deleted . "
previously , as recently as october 22 , google officials have apologized for the mistake and said that it would be changing its policies .
" we are mortified by what happened , but confident that these changes to our processes and structure will significantly improve our internal privacy and security practices for the benefit of all our users , " wrote alan eustace , google 's senior vice president of engineering and research , in a post published on october 22 on google 's public policy blog .
the american federal trade commission decided last week to drop its investigation against google , while in recent weeks , similar government agencies in italy , canada and spain have all pursued action against the company .
the investigations worldwide began earlier this year after german authorities in hamburg discovered the payload data in one of google 's vehicles , and they are continuing to investigate as well .

the move comes as canada , spain and , most recently , italy are scrutinizing the california company . in an announcement wednesday , british data protection authorities said there was a " significant breach of the data protection act " and that google uk would be subject to an audit .
further , it added , the company must promise that similar data breaches do not occur again .
the uk authorities had once again taken up the privacy case against google late last month after google had revealed further details that it had obtained " wifi data . "
that data included passwords and e-mails while google was sending cars along british streets and in other countries for its street view service .
earlier this year , the information commissioner 's office -lrb- ico -rrb- had said that it had found " no wrongdoing " on google 's part , but re-opened an investigation last week .
" it is my view that the collection of this information was not fair or lawful and constitutes a significant breach of the first principle of the data protection act , " said christopher graham , the uk information commissioner , in a statement published wednesday on the ico 's website .
" the most appropriate and proportionate regulatory action in these circumstances is to get written legal assurance from google that this will not happen again – and to follow this up with an ico audit . "
the ico elaborated that it had declined to seek monetary damages against the silicon valley company as it would have been too legally difficult to prove .
" monetary penalties can only be served when a strict set of criteria is satisfied , including that the breach was likely to cause substantial harm or substantial distress – this alone would be very hard to prove in this case , " wrote kirsty mccaskill , an ico spokesperson , in a statement provided to deutsche welle .
" the vast majority of the pay-load data was also collected prior to 6 april 2010 , before our new powers came into force . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the vehicles used to create street view inadvertantly collected the data google says google has admitted guilt in a written statement also provided to deutsche welle , peter fleischer , google 's global privacy counsel said that the company had made a mistake .
" we are profoundly sorry for mistakenly collecting payload data in the uk from unencrypted wireless networks , " he wrote .
" since we announced our mistake in may we have cooperated closely with the ico and worked to improve our internal controls .
as we have said before , we did not want this data , have never used any of it in our products or services , and have sought to delete it as quickly as possible .
we are in the process of confirming that there are no outstanding legal obligations upon us to retain the data , and will then ensure that it is quickly and safely deleted . "
previously , as recently as october 22 , google officials have apologized for the mistake and said that it would be changing its policies .
" we are mortified by what happened , but confident that these changes to our processes and structure will significantly improve our internal privacy and security practices for the benefit of all our users , " wrote alan eustace , google 's senior vice president of engineering and research , in a post published on october 22 on google 's public policy blog .
the american federal trade commission decided last week to drop its investigation against google , while in recent weeks , similar government agencies in italy , canada and spain have all pursued action against the company .
the investigations worldwide began earlier this year after german authorities in hamburg discovered the payload data in one of google 's vehicles , and they are continuing to investigate as well .

not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content .
would you register a .de domain name with an " ß " in it ?
the following reader responses are from the deutsche welle facebook fan page .
it would be quite annoying for people who do n't have a german keyboard . - alessandro it would be just as annoying as an umlaut .
but if they do n't speak german , why would they visit a german website ? - wolfgang wolfgang , i know several german websites , that have support for several languages or at least english . - gerhard well , i do n't know if i would register a .de website address with " ß . "
it would be pretty annoying for people who do n't understand or can not type german .
besides , i think people who do n't understand german may still go to german websites because some of them provide information in other languages .
by the way , i like " ß , " because it looks very german and also is very cute . - pin-shuan yes !
more original !
and it is a good way to resist the overly complicated “ reform der deutschen rechtschreibung von 1996 . ” - luis yay !
do it !
save german language and culture !
to those of you who complain about the keyboard , do some research , you can use " hot keys " to make foreign characters . - kadesh exactly kadesh .
there are some really simple number pad commands that will insert german characters -lrb- and many other symbols as well -rrb- . - chris alas , that character does n't exist on my keyboard !
how will i type it into the browser ? - judith where does one find these number pad commands ? - lyle it would be nice to allow ' ss ' or ' sz ' to do the same job on non-german keyboards . - claudio http : / / tlt.its.psu.edu / suggestions / international / accents / codeint.html sorry , i should have added this earlier ... ßßß - kadesh when you use the codes or special keys for the special letters does the computer recognize font differences ? - michelle i tried also alt + 0223 according to my character map but it simply does n't work , at least in facebook . - claudio using the ß in your url would be a really good way to ensure that no one outside of germany ever visited it , except perhaps via links from somewhere else .
not a good idea . - tanya i do n't think i would .
for me , the coolest thing about the web is the ability to bring people together .
using a character which is only found on keyboards in two countries -lrb- germany and austria - the german-speaking swiss stopped using the ß years ago -rrb- would be more divisive than inclusive .
but do n't get me wrong , i 'm not in favor of a “ super language ” that should take over the world .
german should stay german !
but on the international level , there should be a level playing field for the internet .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de research -pipe- 03.11.2010 scientists assert finger length and sexual promiscuity linked in human ancestors großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neanderthals are believed to have had more sexual partners in an anthropological study , british researchers found that neanderthals may have had more sexual partners .
scientists still do not know when ancient primates began to migrate from being more to less promiscuous . although neanderthals have not lived in europe for 30,000 years , they continue to fascinate scientists around the world .
a new study from the united kingdom suggests that neanderthals had more partners than modern humans .
they reached this conclusion by comparing the ratio of different finger lengths that allow scientists to determine some kinds of behavior , including sexual promiscuity .
emma nelson , a doctoral student at the university of liverpool , had shown in previous research that high levels of in-utero androgens increase the length of the fourth , or ring , finger when compared to the second , or index finger .
the team found that a low ratio indicates higher levels of competitiveness , aggressiveness and more sexual partners , while a high ratio indicates more monogamy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neanderthals had a index-to-ring finger ratio of 0.928 , which is less than modern humans comparisons amongst four species in a paper published today in the british journal proceedings of the royal society b , the team compared the finger-length ratios amongst various ancient hominin species , including ardipithecus ramidus , a hominid who lived around 4.4 million years ago ; australopithecus afarensis , which lived around three to four million years ago ; neanderthals , who disappeared around 28,000 years ago ; and early humans dating back to 95,000 years ago .
" it is believed that prenatal androgens affect the genes responsible for the development of fingers , toes and the reproductive system , " said nelson in a statement .
" we have recently shown that promiscuous primate species have low index to ring finger ratios , while monogamous species have high ratios .
we used this information to estimate the social behavior of extinct apes and hominins .
although the fossil record is limited for this period , and more fossils are needed to confirm our findings , this method could prove to be an exciting new way of understanding how our social behavior has evolved . "
the study found that modern humans have an average of a 0.957 index-to-ring finger ratio , and are generally a more monogamous species , while chimps ' , gorillas ' and orangutans ' average ratio is at 0.91 , and are generally more promiscuous .
the researchers also found that an early modern human found in an israeli cave , dating back to approximately 95,000 years ago , had a ratio of 0.935 , which would be more promiscuous than modern humans as well .
neanderthals , meanwhile , had a ratio of 0.928 .
further study needed in an interview with the agence france presse , nelson added that the research team would like to be able to confirm their findings through other means .
anthropologists still do not agree when or why humans and their ancestors began to migrate from a more promiscuous mating system to a more monogamous one , given that the former group would hold an evolutionary advantage in terms of being able to spread their genes more quickly and more widely .
" pair-bonding , in a broad sense , is universal among humans , but it is not known when the transition from a promiscuous mating system to a stable bonded one occurred , " wrote the scientists in their scientific paper .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the findings could reveal more about mating practices amongst our ancestors disagreement amongst anthropologists however , not all scientists agree with these findings .
in an interview with the american news website , msnbc.com , another anthropologist who was not part of the study said that this correlation of finger ratios is not a " good predictor of any social behaviors . "
" in addition to the problem of using a poor predictor , this study has another problem that we often face with fossils - there are very few of them , and it 's not obvious which sample of living primates we should be comparing with them , " said john hawks , an anthropology professor at the university of wisconsin , madison .

scientists still do not know when ancient primates began to migrate from being more to less promiscuous . although neanderthals have not lived in europe for 30,000 years , they continue to fascinate scientists around the world .
a new study from the united kingdom suggests that neanderthals had more partners than modern humans .
they reached this conclusion by comparing the ratio of different finger lengths that allow scientists to determine some kinds of behavior , including sexual promiscuity .
emma nelson , a doctoral student at the university of liverpool , had shown in previous research that high levels of in-utero androgens increase the length of the fourth , or ring , finger when compared to the second , or index finger .
the team found that a low ratio indicates higher levels of competitiveness , aggressiveness and more sexual partners , while a high ratio indicates more monogamy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neanderthals had a index-to-ring finger ratio of 0.928 , which is less than modern humans comparisons amongst four species in a paper published today in the british journal proceedings of the royal society b , the team compared the finger-length ratios amongst various ancient hominin species , including ardipithecus ramidus , a hominid who lived around 4.4 million years ago ; australopithecus afarensis , which lived around three to four million years ago ; neanderthals , who disappeared around 28,000 years ago ; and early humans dating back to 95,000 years ago .
" it is believed that prenatal androgens affect the genes responsible for the development of fingers , toes and the reproductive system , " said nelson in a statement .
" we have recently shown that promiscuous primate species have low index to ring finger ratios , while monogamous species have high ratios .
we used this information to estimate the social behavior of extinct apes and hominins .
although the fossil record is limited for this period , and more fossils are needed to confirm our findings , this method could prove to be an exciting new way of understanding how our social behavior has evolved . "
the study found that modern humans have an average of a 0.957 index-to-ring finger ratio , and are generally a more monogamous species , while chimps ' , gorillas ' and orangutans ' average ratio is at 0.91 , and are generally more promiscuous .
the researchers also found that an early modern human found in an israeli cave , dating back to approximately 95,000 years ago , had a ratio of 0.935 , which would be more promiscuous than modern humans as well .
neanderthals , meanwhile , had a ratio of 0.928 .
further study needed in an interview with the agence france presse , nelson added that the research team would like to be able to confirm their findings through other means .
anthropologists still do not agree when or why humans and their ancestors began to migrate from a more promiscuous mating system to a more monogamous one , given that the former group would hold an evolutionary advantage in terms of being able to spread their genes more quickly and more widely .
" pair-bonding , in a broad sense , is universal among humans , but it is not known when the transition from a promiscuous mating system to a stable bonded one occurred , " wrote the scientists in their scientific paper .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the findings could reveal more about mating practices amongst our ancestors disagreement amongst anthropologists however , not all scientists agree with these findings .
in an interview with the american news website , msnbc.com , another anthropologist who was not part of the study said that this correlation of finger ratios is not a " good predictor of any social behaviors . "
" in addition to the problem of using a poor predictor , this study has another problem that we often face with fossils - there are very few of them , and it 's not obvious which sample of living primates we should be comparing with them , " said john hawks , an anthropology professor at the university of wisconsin , madison .

german politicians are wondering what a divided american government will mean for europe and world politics . german politicians believe tuesday 's congressional elections in the united states will change the landscape of foreign policy .
the elections represent a major threat to us president barack obama 's power at home , as the opposition republicans gained a majority in the congress 's lower house , the house of representatives , and boosted their numbers in the senate .
a bigger role on the world stage ?
the german government 's coordinator for german-american relations , hans-ulrich klose , said wednesday he expected obama to turn his gaze outward in light of new difficulties in domestic politics .
he told national radio station deutschlandradio that the president would now be concentrating more on the mideast conflict .
" i hesitate to speak of a solution to the problems , but it would be good if there were more intelligent conflict management , " klose said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polenz says europe needs to play a bigger role on the world stage the chairman of the bundestag parliament 's foreign affairs committee , ruprecht polenz , also stressed that obama could maintain a strong role in international politics , as the president is only dependent on congress in matters of international diplomacy when it comes to ratifying treaties .
europe to ' step up to the plate . '
however , polenz took a different position from klose 's , positing that conflicts within american politics could weaken the us 's leading position in worldwide diplomacy .
" of course , the us 's role in the world will be judged by its partners according to how strong they are at home .
in that sense , -lsb- obama -rsb- is somewhat weakened , " polenz told deutsche welle .
polenz stressed that germany and europe would have to take a stronger position in global diplomacy if the us were to take a step back , especially in matters such as the mideast conflict , russian-american relations and china 's ascent to the world stage .
" we need solutions to certain conflicts and problems in this world , and if the americans ca n't focus on that as strongly as in the past , then europe will have to do more , " he said , adding , " we do n't have an eternity to answer as many foreign-policy questions as possible with one voice and act accordingly . "
" one message of this election is that we are now being put more to the challenge , " polenz added .
polenz said that europe was not capable of filling the us 's shoes in matters of world politics , but stressed that a more politically divided america needed europe 's support : " it will be important for us to put more effort into our relationship because we need to work together when one partner ca n't carry as much of the burden . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klose says democrats and republicans will have to cooperate more closely one place where europe will have to take on more responsibility , according to rainer stinner , foreign policy spokesperson for germany 's free democrats - the party of foreign minister guido westerwelle - is in the reshaping of the north atlantic treaty organization -lrb- nato -rrb- .
nato is currently forming its new strategic concept .
" if nato members agree that a missile defense shield is necessary , then it will surely need to be financed by all nato partners and can not all be put on the americans ' shoulders , " stinner said .
stalemate or renewed cooperation ?
the big question facing american politics is whether democrats and republicans can work together , or if increased control by the opposition republicans will mean a political stalemate .
polenz believes a standstill would be " fatal " for the us both at home and abroad .
klose and stinner , however , believe the two parties will be forced to work together .
stinner said that , should the republicans continue trying to block all legislation from the democrats , it could backfire against them in the next elections .
" the republicans would do well not to continue a purely oppositional politics , " he said , " but to try to work together with the president so that he ca n't position them as preventing -lsb- progress -rsb- . "

in that sense , -lsb- obama -rsb- is somewhat weakened , " polenz told deutsche welle .
polenz stressed that germany and europe would have to take a stronger position in global diplomacy if the us were to take a step back , especially in matters such as the mideast conflict , russian-american relations and china 's ascent to the world stage .
" we need solutions to certain conflicts and problems in this world , and if the americans ca n't focus on that as strongly as in the past , then europe will have to do more , " he said , adding , " we do n't have an eternity to answer as many foreign-policy questions as possible with one voice and act accordingly . "
" one message of this election is that we are now being put more to the challenge , " polenz added .
polenz said that europe was not capable of filling the us 's shoes in matters of world politics , but stressed that a more politically divided america needed europe 's support : " it will be important for us to put more effort into our relationship because we need to work together when one partner ca n't carry as much of the burden . "

nato is currently forming its new strategic concept .
" if nato members agree that a missile defense shield is necessary , then it will surely need to be financed by all nato partners and can not all be put on the americans ' shoulders , " stinner said .
stalemate or renewed cooperation ?
the big question facing american politics is whether democrats and republicans can work together , or if increased control by the opposition republicans will mean a political stalemate .
polenz believes a standstill would be " fatal " for the us both at home and abroad .
klose and stinner , however , believe the two parties will be forced to work together .
stinner said that , should the republicans continue trying to block all legislation from the democrats , it could backfire against them in the next elections .
" the republicans would do well not to continue a purely oppositional politics , " he said , " but to try to work together with the president so that he ca n't position them as preventing -lsb- progress -rsb- . "

despite the 16 countries that have collectively spent over $ 100 billion over the past decade , the station 's construction is still not complete .
next year , when the the project is expected to be finally completed , the international space community will have to exclusively rely on the russian space program to ferry astronauts to and from the station , as nasa is expected to launch one of its final space shuttle missions later this week .
that may bring a new level of prestige for the russian space program , which in 2011 will also celebrate its 50th anniversary of the launch of the first man into space , yuri gagarin .
russian cosmodrome slated to open in 2015 the russian space industry , which had become a shadow of itself after the collapse of the soviet union , is once again enjoying state support .
the government has increased spending on the space industry by 40 percent for each of the past five years .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia will celebrate the 50th anniversary of soviet cosmonaut yuri gagarin 's space flight in 2011 russian prime minister vladimir putin also confirmed this fall that russia 's new $ 800 million vostochny cosmodorome in the country 's far east should be up and running by 2015 .
" i must say that the construction of the new space center , commissioned in 2007 , is one of the biggest and most ambitious initiatives in russia today , " he said in a speech earlier this year .
" not only will it confirm russia 's status as a technological leader and boost its potential in science and technology , but , just as importantly , it will allow hundreds , if not thousands , of young specialists to prove themselves , to show their talent , and to make their most ambitious plans come true . "
despite the united states ' re-evaluation of their role in the international space community , american authorities are putting a positive spin on a decreased american presence .

" it 's hard to get into orbit , it 's very difficult to launch the spacecraft into orbit .
and by doing so together , we do so on a collective basis from an economic and technological standpoint that serves both nations much better than if we tried to do it ourselves . "
he also acknowledged that while russia will be responsible for bring astronauts to the iss , americans still have a lot to do .
" the russians in turn are mutually dependant on us for maintaining station 's operation since nasa has the lead role in mission operations , oversight of the station 's components , and the flight control capability of the station , " he added .

i mean to bring home a payload that weighs 30 thousand pounds is just incredible , no spacecraft could every do that before .
so to see that capability go away is a little bit sad , but it 's been in the plan . "

barack obama has to now own up to his faults and react , says dw 's washington correspondent christina bergmann . it was the anticipated slap in the face for the us president .
barack obama had tried to do everything right and everything at the same time .
now , he has to realize that he blew it with all sides in the process .
the conservatives were seething above all from the health reform , which they view as an unacceptable government intrusion into their lives .
but obama failed to dominate the debate in time .
now , he has to recognize that it 's not enough to do good deeds .
you also have to talk about them .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 03.11.2010 opinion : the belarus leadership must show a real willingness to reform großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister guido westerwelle has met with the belarusian leadership .
this is a good time for the european union to help belarus emerge from its isolation , says dw 's daniel scheschkewitz . the german foreign minister 's visit was a risky undertaking .
a politician ca n't expect to present pretty photos and upbeat declarations from the last stronghold of communist rule in europe , where the death penalty is still applied and human rights are routinely trampled upon .
as far as human rights are concerned , guido westerwelle travelled right into the lion 's den .
alexander lukashenko is an outcast among european leaders , a man who rules his country with an iron fist and whose secret police do not shy away from killing opponents of the regime .
so why has the german foreign minister chosen to meet with such a man ?
and why now ?
the former soviet republic with its 10 million inhabitants is an important country , it borders on the european union and deserves attention for its economic potential .
safeguarding existing routes of transport for oil and gas shipments as well as trade cooperation make it advisable to maintain a dialogue with the rulers in minsk .
while at the same time , human rights should not be forgotten , it is an opportune time to exert pressure of the sort westerwelle has exerted during his visit . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daniel scheschkewitz lukashenko has called early presidential elections in mid-december , a vote in which the country 's leadership can show how serious it is about free elections and pluralism .
bearing that in mind , westerwelle 's talks , also with other contenders for the presidency , send the right signal . lukashenko needs eu support due to its tense relations with russia , it is an opportune time for belarus to seek closer ties with the eu , maybe even membership in the council of europe .
the eu foreign ministers have recognized this quest ; accordingly , they loosened entry bans imposed on belarus politicians in 2004 , although the sanctions generally remain in force . in his talks with lukashenko , guido westerwelle is likely to have repeated offers of cooperation - provided , of course , that the belarus leadership shows a real and comprehensible willingness to reform .
there can only be constructive relations and membership in the council of europe for belarus , if elections in december are more free and fair than was the case in 2006 .
lukashenko has promised the german foreign minister that the vote will be handled properly - but skepticism remains .
registering all of the opposition candidates as well as independent election observers would be a first step .
in addition , belarus would have to start functioning in accordance with the rule of law .
a moratorium and eventually a ban on capital punishment could move the country 's value system closer to that of europe . in 21st century europe , isolation should no longer be a political tool of choice .
and it need n't be if minsk takes the offer of dialogue seriously .
westerwelle 's sensitive visit is a bold step towards cooperation , well coordinated with the country 's eu neighbors lithuania and poland . now it 's time for belarus to follow up its vague pledges with concrete action .

it was submitted two weeks after thaci 's coalition fell apart when former president fatmir sejidu pulled his party out of the governing coalition .
sejidu also stepped down as president in mid-october , after the country 's constitutional court ruled that he could not be the leader of a political party and the country 's president at the same time .
interim president jakup krasniqi immediately dissolved parliament and announced the polls , which under kosovo 's constitution , have to be held within 45 days .
thaci 's own deputies voted against the government and he later expressed satisfaction at the outcome of the vote .
" the vote by the members of parliament is a vote for the future of kosovo .
it is a responsible decision that will mark a new beginning for the state of kosovo , " he said .

the democrats manage to keep a slim majority in the senate . us republicans won a huge majority in the house of representatives in midterm elections , delivering a blow president barack obama described as a " shellacking . "
" i am not recommending for every future president that they take a shellacking like i did last night , " obama said in a news conference on wednesday .
" i am sure there are easier ways to learn these lessons . "
the conservative republican party gained at least 60 seats in the house of representatives , the biggest shift of congressional power since 1948 and more than enough to win control of the 435-member lower chamber .

speaking as almost all of the polls across the country had closed , boehner pledged to cut government spending .
in a victory rally at the republican party 's headquarters in washington , he said that americans had sent a clear message for obama to " change course . "
" our new majority will be prepared to do things differently , " boehner said .
" it starts with cutting spending instead of increasing it , reducing the size of government instead of increasing it , and reforming the way congress works . "
president obama placed a congratulatory phone call to boehner on tuesday evening , saying he looked forward to working together with boehner to find common ground and move the country forward .

obama acknowledged that democratic plans for a " cap-and-trade " system - charging industry for carbon dioxide emissions blamed for global climate change - would have to be put off for at least the next two years .
" it 's doubtful that you could get the votes to pass that through the house this year , or next year , or the year after , " obama said .
" cap and trade was just one way of skinning the cat … it was a means , not an end . "
republicans made gains in the senate , where 37 out of 100 upper house seats were at stake .

comfortable majority in lower house although much of the debate leading up to the election focused on anxiety about the us economy , the increased number of republican seats in congress may also have foreign policy implications .
spending on development could be blocked in the lower house and republican gains in the senate are likely to make it more difficult for the obama administration to ratify international treaties .
it is thought that the republicans could use their enhanced platform in congress to frustrate aspects of obama 's foreign policy , for instance , by opposing any peace deal in afghanistan that would bring the taliban to the negotiating table .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de united states -pipe- 03.11.2010 obama concedes defeat in house , pledges to work with republicans großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the balance of power is shifting in the us congress president barack obama admits that he took a beating in the mid-term elections as republicans storm into the house of representatives .
the democrats manage to keep a slim majority in the senate . us republicans won a huge majority in the house of representatives in midterm elections , delivering a blow president barack obama described as a " shellacking . "
" i am not recommending for every future president that they take a shellacking like i did last night , " obama said in a news conference on wednesday .
" i am sure there are easier ways to learn these lessons . "
the conservative republican party gained at least 60 seats in the house of representatives , the biggest shift of congressional power since 1948 and more than enough to win control of the 435-member lower chamber .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : john boehner is set to become the new house speaker the vote toppled democrat nancy pelosi from her position as speaker of the house , leaving ohio republic and house minority leader john boehner ready to fill the position .
speaking as almost all of the polls across the country had closed , boehner pledged to cut government spending .
in a victory rally at the republican party 's headquarters in washington , he said that americans had sent a clear message for obama to " change course . "
" our new majority will be prepared to do things differently , " boehner said .
" it starts with cutting spending instead of increasing it , reducing the size of government instead of increasing it , and reforming the way congress works . "
president obama placed a congratulatory phone call to boehner on tuesday evening , saying he looked forward to working together with boehner to find common ground and move the country forward .
bildunterschrift : environmental legislation on hold however , republican control of the house could lead to legislative gridlock .
obama acknowledged that democratic plans for a " cap-and-trade " system - charging industry for carbon dioxide emissions blamed for global climate change - would have to be put off for at least the next two years .
" it 's doubtful that you could get the votes to pass that through the house this year , or next year , or the year after , " obama said .
" cap and trade was just one way of skinning the cat … it was a means , not an end . "
republicans made gains in the senate , where 37 out of 100 upper house seats were at stake .
with three seats still too close to call on wednesday , democrats took a net loss of 6 seats for 51 , while republicans took 46 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama and the democrats kept hold of the senate democrats were helped by a victory for democratic majority leader harry reid , who won his seat with about 50 percent of the vote .
reid was challenged by sharron angle , backed by the grassroots conservative tea party movement .
democrats were not so lucky in florida , where republican marco rubio became the first tea party-backed candidate to win a senate seat .
but another tea party favorite - controversial senate candidate for delaware , christine o 'donnell - lost her race .
comfortable majority in lower house although much of the debate leading up to the election focused on anxiety about the us economy , the increased number of republican seats in congress may also have foreign policy implications .
spending on development could be blocked in the lower house and republican gains in the senate are likely to make it more difficult for the obama administration to ratify international treaties .
it is thought that the republicans could use their enhanced platform in congress to frustrate aspects of obama 's foreign policy , for instance , by opposing any peace deal in afghanistan that would bring the taliban to the negotiating table .
of the 50 states in the union , 37 also elected a new governor .
california voters elected democrat jerry brown , who served as governor in the 1970s and 80s , replacing austrian-born actor-turned-politician arnold schwarzenegger .
the state also rejected a proposal to decriminalize recreational marijuana .

werder bremen 's chances of advancing are all but over , losing to dutch champs twente . schalke were held to a draw in their soccer showdown with hapoel tel aviv , leaving them only a point ahead of their third-place champions league group rivals .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de foreign trade -pipe- 03.11.2010 industry leaders warn against overreaction on air freight security großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : industry leaders say total security is a politicians ' fantasy as air cargo security is tightened around europe , german industry leaders warn that expensive checks on freight would damage world trade .
total security is simply a politician 's fantasy , they say . the pressure was on the german government when it was revealed sunday that a us-bound bomb discovered on a cargo plane in london had passed through germany 's cologne bonn airport .
all flights - first cargo , then passenger services – from the bomb 's country of origin , yemen , were suspended .
interior minister thomas de maiziere was quick to announce that investigations would follow .
" air freight has been relatively under-monitored up to now .
evidently they recognized that and exploited it .
this means changes for the air freight business . "
transport minister peter ramsauer echoed his colleague and underlined the swiftness of the government 's measures .
" our security measures are meant to guarantee that no freight will get to germany from yemen , " he said .
" now possible gaps in the air freight security system have to be uncovered and closed . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ramsauer said security gaps need to be uncovered and closed time is money but german industry leaders are worried that the government may be lining up knee-jerk security measures that could prove costly .
" the safety checks are becoming more bureaucratic and cumbersome .
that costs time , and time is money , " axel nitschke , export economy chief at the german association of chambers of commerce and industry -lrb- dihk -rrb- , told the handelsblatt newspaper dierk mueller , general manager of the american chamber of commerce in germany , told deutsche welle that talk of extra checks was little more than a security blanket for politicians eager to cover their backs .
the us government has already passed a law stating that all cargo containers entering the us by sea or air have to be scanned , but this is a task that thwarts all logistics .
" this law is already in place , but not implemented , " mueller said .
" the us government said we must postpone implementation until we know how to do it .
even if you have all the money in the world , no-one knows how to do it .
there is just no 100 percent security . "
physically impossible the technological obstacles are practically insurmountable .
" air freight is a little easier .
the containers are smaller , but still , you have to do x-raying and computer tomography , because x-raying ca n't detect certain types of plastic explosives .
even that would cost enormous amounts of money . "
" and then you have to tell where these things come from , " he added .
" even if all the major western hemisphere countries say , ' we have 100 percent safety procedures ' , they would still need all the paperwork – stamps and stamps and papers and papers – there is no way to do it 100 percent .
you always have some countries not participating . "
the german government has already admitted as much .
jan muecke , the parliamentary state secretary in the federal ministry of transportation , said monday : " it is practically impossible to scan the entire freight , given the current quantity . "
even if the logistical and technological problems could be surmounted , mueller believes that tightening security will always damage the economy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : authorities fear terrorists have found a gap in airport security " the governments will never pay this .
the consumer will always pay for the extra costs , " he said .
" and it 's not just a matter of money , it 's also the delay .
spare parts for airplanes or special machines sometimes have to be delivered in a few hours . "
" the delay will mean a lack of quality , a lack of punctuality , lack of efficiency , so it will be detrimental to the world economy in the end . "
practical solutions mueller believes that , as with the illegal drugs trade , the only practical solution is to infiltrate the criminal organizations themselves .
" if all this worked , we would not have illegal drugs going to the us , " he said .
" but we have hundreds of tons being illegally imported to the us every year .
these things can not be prevented from entering the country .
we can do something to control the mafia and the terrorists , but not the product itself . "
in germany , federal police under the authority of the interior ministry are responsible for searching passengers , but security for cargo planes comes under the remit of the transport ministry , through the federal agency of aviation -lrb- lba -rrb- .
cargo companies like the german dhl also carry out their own security checks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scanning freight is time-consuming and expensive " of course , to protect against dangers , we have to ensure that safety comes first , " dihk boss martin wansleben told deutsche welle .
" the minute check of every single delivery at the airport has technical and organizational limits .
that is why it is so important that a secure chain of delivery is introduced , with complete supervision from the dispatcher to the airport . "
to achieve this , wansleben believes that existing european union regulations need to be better implemented .
" the eu 's prescribed certification of known dispatchers and regulated commissioners should finally be introduced by the federal agency of aviation , " he said .
" in terms of value , around 35-40 percent of international trade is processed through air freight , " wansleben added .
" these are particularly valuable , urgent , or fragile goods .
that means any interference in air freight will lead to significant costs . "

not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content .
would you register a .de domain name with an " ß " in it ?
the following reader responses are from the deutsche welle facebook fan page .
it would be quite annoying for people who do n't have a german keyboard . - alessandro it would be just as annoying as an umlaut .
but if they do n't speak german , why would they visit a german website ? - wolfgang wolfgang , i know several german websites , that have support for several languages or at least english . - gerhard well , i do n't know if i would register a .de website address with " ß . "
it would be pretty annoying for people who do n't understand or can not type german .
besides , i think people who do n't understand german may still go to german websites because some of them provide information in other languages .
by the way , i like " ß , " because it looks very german and also is very cute . - pin-shuan yes !
more original !
and it is a good way to resist the overly complicated “ reform der deutschen rechtschreibung von 1996 . ” - luis yay !
do it !
save german language and culture !
to those of you who complain about the keyboard , do some research , you can use " hot keys " to make foreign characters . - kadesh exactly kadesh .
there are some really simple number pad commands that will insert german characters -lrb- and many other symbols as well -rrb- . - chris alas , that character does n't exist on my keyboard !
how will i type it into the browser ? - judith where does one find these number pad commands ? - lyle it would be nice to allow ' ss ' or ' sz ' to do the same job on non-german keyboards . - claudio http : / / tlt.its.psu.edu / suggestions / international / accents / codeint.html sorry , i should have added this earlier ... ßßß - kadesh when you use the codes or special keys for the special letters does the computer recognize font differences ? - michelle i tried also alt + 0223 according to my character map but it simply does n't work , at least in facebook . - claudio using the ß in your url would be a really good way to ensure that no one outside of germany ever visited it , except perhaps via links from somewhere else .
not a good idea . - tanya i do n't think i would .
for me , the coolest thing about the web is the ability to bring people together .
using a character which is only found on keyboards in two countries -lrb- germany and austria - the german-speaking swiss stopped using the ß years ago -rrb- would be more divisive than inclusive .
but do n't get me wrong , i 'm not in favor of a “ super language ” that should take over the world .
german should stay german !
but on the international level , there should be a level playing field for the internet .
i 'm just saying . - patrick i do n't like it .
i wo n't be able to type some german and austrian web addresses ! - alberto sure why not ?
just press alt 225 and there you go - ß .
but i must admit , not everyone 's going to like it with all these special keyboard codes , especially the non-germanic countries . - kristin compiled by stuart tiffen editor : michael lawton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ? 02 media center watch and listen explore new content daily in dw 's multimedia archive .

not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content .
would you register a .de domain name with an " ß " in it ?
the following reader responses are from the deutsche welle facebook fan page .
it would be quite annoying for people who do n't have a german keyboard . - alessandro it would be just as annoying as an umlaut .
but if they do n't speak german , why would they visit a german website ? - wolfgang wolfgang , i know several german websites , that have support for several languages or at least english . - gerhard well , i do n't know if i would register a .de website address with " ß . "
it would be pretty annoying for people who do n't understand or can not type german .
besides , i think people who do n't understand german may still go to german websites because some of them provide information in other languages .
by the way , i like " ß , " because it looks very german and also is very cute . - pin-shuan yes !
more original !
and it is a good way to resist the overly complicated “ reform der deutschen rechtschreibung von 1996 . ” - luis yay !
do it !
save german language and culture !
to those of you who complain about the keyboard , do some research , you can use " hot keys " to make foreign characters . - kadesh exactly kadesh .
there are some really simple number pad commands that will insert german characters -lrb- and many other symbols as well -rrb- . - chris alas , that character does n't exist on my keyboard !
how will i type it into the browser ? - judith where does one find these number pad commands ? - lyle it would be nice to allow ' ss ' or ' sz ' to do the same job on non-german keyboards . - claudio http : / / tlt.its.psu.edu / suggestions / international / accents / codeint.html sorry , i should have added this earlier ... ßßß - kadesh when you use the codes or special keys for the special letters does the computer recognize font differences ? - michelle i tried also alt + 0223 according to my character map but it simply does n't work , at least in facebook . - claudio using the ß in your url would be a really good way to ensure that no one outside of germany ever visited it , except perhaps via links from somewhere else .
not a good idea . - tanya i do n't think i would .
for me , the coolest thing about the web is the ability to bring people together .
using a character which is only found on keyboards in two countries -lrb- germany and austria - the german-speaking swiss stopped using the ß years ago -rrb- would be more divisive than inclusive .
but do n't get me wrong , i 'm not in favor of a “ super language ” that should take over the world .
german should stay german !
but on the international level , there should be a level playing field for the internet .
i 'm just saying . - patrick i do n't like it .
i wo n't be able to type some german and austrian web addresses ! - alberto sure why not ?
just press alt 225 and there you go - ß .
but i must admit , not everyone 's going to like it with all these special keyboard codes , especially the non-germanic countries . - kristin compiled by stuart tiffen editor : michael lawton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de internet -pipe- 03.11.2010 uk privacy authorities say google breached data protection act großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : google first announced the collection of data in may british officials say that google will be audited and must promise not to violate the law again , but will not be fined .
the move comes as canada , spain and , most recently , italy are scrutinizing the california company . in an announcement wednesday , british data protection authorities said there was a " significant breach of the data protection act " and that google uk would be subject to an audit .
further , it added , the company must promise that similar data breaches do not occur again .
the uk authorities had once again taken up the privacy case against google late last month after google had revealed further details that it had obtained " wifi data . "
that data included passwords and e-mails while google was sending cars along british streets and in other countries for its street view service .
earlier this year , the information commissioner 's office -lrb- ico -rrb- had said that it had found " no wrongdoing " on google 's part , but re-opened an investigation last week .
" it is my view that the collection of this information was not fair or lawful and constitutes a significant breach of the first principle of the data protection act , " said christopher graham , the uk information commissioner , in a statement published wednesday on the ico 's website .
" the most appropriate and proportionate regulatory action in these circumstances is to get written legal assurance from google that this will not happen again – and to follow this up with an ico audit . "
the ico elaborated that it had declined to seek monetary damages against the silicon valley company as it would have been too legally difficult to prove .
" monetary penalties can only be served when a strict set of criteria is satisfied , including that the breach was likely to cause substantial harm or substantial distress – this alone would be very hard to prove in this case , " wrote kirsty mccaskill , an ico spokesperson , in a statement provided to deutsche welle .
" the vast majority of the pay-load data was also collected prior to 6 april 2010 , before our new powers came into force . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the vehicles used to create street view inadvertantly collected the data google says google has admitted guilt in a written statement also provided to deutsche welle , peter fleischer , google 's global privacy counsel said that the company had made a mistake .
" we are profoundly sorry for mistakenly collecting payload data in the uk from unencrypted wireless networks , " he wrote .
" since we announced our mistake in may we have cooperated closely with the ico and worked to improve our internal controls .
as we have said before , we did not want this data , have never used any of it in our products or services , and have sought to delete it as quickly as possible .
we are in the process of confirming that there are no outstanding legal obligations upon us to retain the data , and will then ensure that it is quickly and safely deleted . "
previously , as recently as october 22 , google officials have apologized for the mistake and said that it would be changing its policies .
" we are mortified by what happened , but confident that these changes to our processes and structure will significantly improve our internal privacy and security practices for the benefit of all our users , " wrote alan eustace , google 's senior vice president of engineering and research , in a post published on october 22 on google 's public policy blog .
the american federal trade commission decided last week to drop its investigation against google , while in recent weeks , similar government agencies in italy , canada and spain have all pursued action against the company .
the investigations worldwide began earlier this year after german authorities in hamburg discovered the payload data in one of google 's vehicles , and they are continuing to investigate as well .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de space -pipe- 03.11.2010 russian space program on the rise großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : humans have been living aboard the iss for 10 years a decade after continuous human habitation on the international space station , russia takes the lead , and will be responsible for ferrying astronauts to the station .
meanwhile , china and india are also coming up . this week marks the 10th anniversary of continuous human habitation aboard the international space station .
despite the 16 countries that have collectively spent over $ 100 billion over the past decade , the station 's construction is still not complete .
next year , when the the project is expected to be finally completed , the international space community will have to exclusively rely on the russian space program to ferry astronauts to and from the station , as nasa is expected to launch one of its final space shuttle missions later this week .
that may bring a new level of prestige for the russian space program , which in 2011 will also celebrate its 50th anniversary of the launch of the first man into space , yuri gagarin .
russian cosmodrome slated to open in 2015 the russian space industry , which had become a shadow of itself after the collapse of the soviet union , is once again enjoying state support .
the government has increased spending on the space industry by 40 percent for each of the past five years .
in 2009 , it received a record $ 2.8 billion .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia will celebrate the 50th anniversary of soviet cosmonaut yuri gagarin 's space flight in 2011 russian prime minister vladimir putin also confirmed this fall that russia 's new $ 800 million vostochny cosmodorome in the country 's far east should be up and running by 2015 .
" i must say that the construction of the new space center , commissioned in 2007 , is one of the biggest and most ambitious initiatives in russia today , " he said in a speech earlier this year .
" not only will it confirm russia 's status as a technological leader and boost its potential in science and technology , but , just as importantly , it will allow hundreds , if not thousands , of young specialists to prove themselves , to show their talent , and to make their most ambitious plans come true . "
despite the united states ' re-evaluation of their role in the international space community , american authorities are putting a positive spin on a decreased american presence .
" space is expensive , " said robert navias , a nasa spokesperson , in an interview with deutsche welle .
" it 's hard to get into orbit , it 's very difficult to launch the spacecraft into orbit .
and by doing so together , we do so on a collective basis from an economic and technological standpoint that serves both nations much better than if we tried to do it ourselves . "
he also acknowledged that while russia will be responsible for bring astronauts to the iss , americans still have a lot to do .
" the russians in turn are mutually dependant on us for maintaining station 's operation since nasa has the lead role in mission operations , oversight of the station 's components , and the flight control capability of the station , " he added .
" so through our mutual dependence on one another we have actually built a stronger partnership on a global basis using each other 's expertise to be able to solve problems quickly . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in 2011 , endeavor is scheduled to be the final american space shuttle launch space research becoming more international the us said it planned to look to private companies to invest in future spacecraft .
but so far , no private companies have secured such investment .
meanwhile , the russian federal space agency is set to receive $ 306 million for u.s. astronauts to fly to the international space station in 2012 onboard a russian soyuz rocket .
however , the decision to ground the shuttles raises mixed emotions among us astronauts .
" well , it 's kind of sad that the space shuttle is going to be retired , " said mark kelly , commander of the last scheduled mission of us space shuttle endeavor in february 2011 , in an interview with deutsche welle .
" you know , it 's an incredible vehicle , there 's never been anything like it , that can carry huge payloads , over 30 thousand pounds into orbit , it has an airlock where we could do space walks , it has a robotic arm , we could manipulate payloads , we could capture satellites , we could bring satellites home .
i mean to bring home a payload that weighs 30 thousand pounds is just incredible , no spacecraft could every do that before .
so to see that capability go away is a little bit sad , but it 's been in the plan . "
however , as both moscow and washington are still leading the space race , their dominance could be soon challenged by india and china , which are funding and developing their own space programs .
the chinese shenzhou vii spacecraft is already in operation , and china 's first spacewalk took place in 2008 , and meanwhile , india has announced a manned spaceflight by 2014 .

werder bremen 's chances of advancing are all but over , losing to dutch champs twente . schalke were held to a draw in their soccer showdown with hapoel tel aviv , leaving them only a point ahead of their third-place champions league group rivals .
tel aviv had the better of the first half with forwards toto tamuz and ben sahar posing several threats but failing to convert .
at the other end of the pitch , spanish striker raul and dutchman klaas-jan huntelaar struggled to break through the defense quite as effectively as their opponents .
while schalke keeper manuel neuer frustrated hapoel with several acrobatic saves , his tel aviv counterpart vincent enyeama was rarely troubled .
the goalless draw meant that bottom side hapoel gained their first points of the campaign , but left schalke , on seven points in group b , looking over their shoulder at third place benfica .

the bundesliga side had , in fact , dominated with wave after wave of attack - until captain torsten frings was sent off on 75 minutes for bringing down twente 's bryan ruiz on the edge of the box .
a deflected shot from nacer chadli put the dutch club ahead after 81 minutes , before a stooping header from luuk de jong sealed the win with six minutes remaining .

but as china booms , there is concern human life is being left on the wayside by power-hungry and corrupt officials . as the world expo in shanghai wound down , there was one exhibit at the chile pavilion that continued to attract the masses .
the phoenix 2 capsule , which helped rescue 33 chilean miners last month , triggered a debate about mine safety in china . one visitor said that the rescue operation in chile showed a respect for human life that china could learn from .
just days after the chilean miners were rescued , some 30 of their chinese colleagues in a mine in henan province died in an explosion . " the mine was unsafe but they don ’ t care about worker safety .
all they care about is production , " the mother of one of the dead miners said angrily . safety laws often ignored federal safety laws and directives from beijing are often ignored .
former functionaries themselves say that china ’ s economic boom is partly based on blood . " all they care about is developing the economy , " says zhou xiaozheng , a sociologist at the people ’ s university in beijing .
" they just look at gdp in order to gauge development .
that ’ s how they are judged and that ’ s what their promotions are based upon . " in its rhetoric , the central government in beijing preaches about sustainable growth , about the environment and development without waste of resources .
prime minister wen jiabao often talks about people-oriented policies .
" the government acquired its power from the people , all power goes back to the people and we have to do everything for the people , " he recently said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many chinese are getting rich but some say the poor are being sacrificed however , for many these words are like a slap in the face .
only the ruling communist party is to blame for the fact that there are no controls over those in power , that there is no transparency , no checks and balances . officials and businessmen in cahoots environmental activist wu lihong , who has long campaigned against the pollution of lake taihu , says there is a tangled web of corruption and nepotism , with officials and factory owners working hand-in-hand . " they are in cahoots and they have the same interests .
that 's why the central government never finds out the truth and does not know about local issues .
the central government has no power – that ’ s one of our system 's problems . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : migrant workers are flocking to the cities to find work but they are often subject to abuse there is also corruption at the highest level .
at the beginning of the year , a former supreme court judge was sentenced to lifetime imprisonment for taking bribes and corruption charges .
last month , the former head of china ’ s nuclear agency was expelled from the party . " power creates corruption , " says zhou xiaozheng .
" and absolute power creates absolute corruption .
