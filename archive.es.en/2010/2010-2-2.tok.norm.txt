the two south asian neighbours india and pakistan have been at loggerheads since the partition of the subcontinent in 1947 .
the conflict over kashmir and militant attacks have fuelled animosity between them for a long time . after terrorists trained in pakistan wreaked havoc in mumbai during a three day assault in november 2008 , the media in both countries took a far more hawkish stance than their governments , whipping up nationalist sentiment and emotions .
the indian government , for instance , slammed the media and even threatened to restrict press freedoms .
now , however , a year on , the times of india and pakistan 's jang group have decided to take a different approach .
their initiative ' aman ki asha ' or ' hope for peace ' aims at spreading the message of peace by utilizing the strong common bonds of music , art and literature that both countries share .
the groups ' newspapers devoted their full first page to the topic on new year 's day this year .
since then the initiative has been a regular feature of their electronic and print output .
videos show the things that people love and cherish on both sides of the border .
' like brother and sister ' this has struck a chord with many people in the subcontinent .
sneh maria kovela is a pakistani woman now married to an indian man , but her visa for india was rejected on three occasions by the indian government . " india and pakistan are two different nations , but we are like brother and sister , " she says .
" everybody fights in their home but nobody wants to prolong the fight .
if we ca n't visit our neighbors , we are nothing . "
the media campaign , which includes exchange programs in different fields , is targeted at common people .
but , says ranjan roy , coordinator of the initiative from the times of india , it will also put pressure on delhi and islamabad to get back to the negotiating table .
he stresses that the initiative is not affecting the way his paper covers news on a daily basis : " this is not impinging on our news coverage .
this is very different from the way we cover the day to day news . "
he says there could be further initiatives in the future like building up a news pool to share content .
at the moment , the state of diplomatic ties between the two countries does not allow either side to have full time correspondents on the other side of the mutual border .
a ' publicity blitz ' ? but critics in india and pakistan say the initiative is all just a big publicity campaign .
seema mustafa , a reputed commentator on political affairs from india , says it is hard to believe that the two media organisations , which have a record of jingoism , are now suddenly gearing up for a peace initiative : " obviously this has n't come from the media houses .
this has been delivered to them as part of what washington , new delhi and islamabad hope will be a big publicity blitz , under which they can then promote peace or at least talk of peace , while america focuses on the afghanistan-pakistan border . "
thousands of facebook followers but salima hashmi , a renowned painter and peace activist from lahore , is more upbeat .
she says the time has come for both the governments to find ways to bring peace in the subcontinent .
" both governments have been guilty in different parts of their respective countries of breeding people who use violence as a political weapon .
i think there must be a realisation that this is a common enemy . "
despite the criticism regarding the media-led peace initiative ' aman ki asha ' , facebook , the social networking site , records more than 8,000 followers on the project 's page .
this goes to show that a growing number of young people in india and pakistan sincerely want the media to make a positive contribution towards achieving a relaxation of tensions between the two countries .

the two south asian neighbours india and pakistan have been at loggerheads since the partition of the subcontinent in 1947 .
the conflict over kashmir and militant attacks have fuelled animosity between them for a long time . after terrorists trained in pakistan wreaked havoc in mumbai during a three day assault in november 2008 , the media in both countries took a far more hawkish stance than their governments , whipping up nationalist sentiment and emotions .
the indian government , for instance , slammed the media and even threatened to restrict press freedoms .
now , however , a year on , the times of india and pakistan 's jang group have decided to take a different approach .
their initiative ' aman ki asha ' or ' hope for peace ' aims at spreading the message of peace by utilizing the strong common bonds of music , art and literature that both countries share .
the groups ' newspapers devoted their full first page to the topic on new year 's day this year .
since then the initiative has been a regular feature of their electronic and print output .
videos show the things that people love and cherish on both sides of the border .
' like brother and sister ' this has struck a chord with many people in the subcontinent .
sneh maria kovela is a pakistani woman now married to an indian man , but her visa for india was rejected on three occasions by the indian government . " india and pakistan are two different nations , but we are like brother and sister , " she says .
" everybody fights in their home but nobody wants to prolong the fight .
if we ca n't visit our neighbors , we are nothing . "
the media campaign , which includes exchange programs in different fields , is targeted at common people .
but , says ranjan roy , coordinator of the initiative from the times of india , it will also put pressure on delhi and islamabad to get back to the negotiating table .
he stresses that the initiative is not affecting the way his paper covers news on a daily basis : " this is not impinging on our news coverage .
this is very different from the way we cover the day to day news . "
he says there could be further initiatives in the future like building up a news pool to share content .
at the moment , the state of diplomatic ties between the two countries does not allow either side to have full time correspondents on the other side of the mutual border .
a ' publicity blitz ' ? but critics in india and pakistan say the initiative is all just a big publicity campaign .
seema mustafa , a reputed commentator on political affairs from india , says it is hard to believe that the two media organisations , which have a record of jingoism , are now suddenly gearing up for a peace initiative : " obviously this has n't come from the media houses .
this has been delivered to them as part of what washington , new delhi and islamabad hope will be a big publicity blitz , under which they can then promote peace or at least talk of peace , while america focuses on the afghanistan-pakistan border . "
thousands of facebook followers but salima hashmi , a renowned painter and peace activist from lahore , is more upbeat .
she says the time has come for both the governments to find ways to bring peace in the subcontinent .
" both governments have been guilty in different parts of their respective countries of breeding people who use violence as a political weapon .
i think there must be a realisation that this is a common enemy . "
despite the criticism regarding the media-led peace initiative ' aman ki asha ' , facebook , the social networking site , records more than 8,000 followers on the project 's page .
this goes to show that a growing number of young people in india and pakistan sincerely want the media to make a positive contribution towards achieving a relaxation of tensions between the two countries .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de terrorism -pipe- 02.02.2010 prosecutors prepare closing arguments in major geman terror trial großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german fritz gelowicz led the " sauerland group " the trial of four men who planned attacks on us military targets in germany is drawing to an end .
the " sauerland cell , " uncovered and arrested in 2007 , was germany 's first example of home-grown islamist terrorism . the geman-born leader of the so-called sauerland cell , fritz gelowicz , showed germany that islamist terror was a problem in its own back yard .
the 30-year-old islam convert and his three accomplices , german daniel schneider , turkish-german attila selek , and turk adem yilmaz were captured in the west german region of sauerland in 2007 , with vast stockpiles of hydrogen peroxide , suitable for making car bombs and other explosives .
they said they planned to attack us military targets based in germany , and that events in the so-called " war on terror " had motivated them to take up arms .
" my client said that this decision came in 2004 , " gelowicz 's lawyer dirk uden told the regional high court in dusseldorf .
he explained that the us arrest and torture of a dual nationality german-lebanese car dealer chalid el-masri – who was not involved in terrorist activity – was the main reason gelowicz decided to begin working for the islamic jihad union , a splinter terror group with its roots in uzbekistan .
" he saw the pictures of abu ghraib , the pictures from guantanamo bay , and especially the fate of chalid el-masri , which he heard about through personal connections before it became common knowledge , and these things really influenced him .
these events supported his decision to embark upon an armed jihad . "
historic plea bargain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this hydrogen peroxide was to be made into lethal bombs in exchange for shortened sentences , the group 's members agreed to discuss their plans , and their time at a terror training camp in pakistani region of waziristan , close to the afghan border .
" the confessions of the accused were the most comprehensive talks concerning terrorism ever heard in a german court of law , " the director of the institute of terrorism research and security policy in essen , rolf tophoven , told deutsche welle .
" they gave an exact description of what was going on in the terror training camps in pakistan . "
it 's unclear how the group will plead , but daniel schneider has indicated he will probably plead guilty on attempted murder charges for shooting at a policeman trying to arrest him , acknowledging that the skirmish could easily " have had a deadly ending . "
a final verdict in the trial , which has lasted roughly nine months so far , is expected in march .
terror concerns in germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daniel schneider has admitted to trying to kill a policeman there has not yet been a successful islamist terror attack in germany , however , experts concur that the country 's military engagement in afghanistan means it is considered a viable target .
" we are in the sights of islamists because of the 4,500 soldiers posted in afghanistan , and our other anti-terrorist operations , " said tophoven .
" from the point of view of the terrorists , there are good reasons to attack germany , and were an attack here ever to succeed , i am sure that the mission in afghanistan would be used as justification for it . "
tophoven also says it should come as no surprise that the sauerland cell was a home-grown organization , led by german converts to islam .
" a minority of converts to a new religion want to prove that they are tougher than the people born into the religion .
they want to establish themselves and prove their conviction in their new faith , and this can lead to extremism . "

the " sauerland cell , " uncovered and arrested in 2007 , was germany 's first example of home-grown islamist terrorism . the geman-born leader of the so-called sauerland cell , fritz gelowicz , showed germany that islamist terror was a problem in its own back yard .
the 30-year-old islam convert and his three accomplices , german daniel schneider , turkish-german attila selek , and turk adem yilmaz were captured in the west german region of sauerland in 2007 , with vast stockpiles of hydrogen peroxide , suitable for making car bombs and other explosives .
they said they planned to attack us military targets based in germany , and that events in the so-called " war on terror " had motivated them to take up arms .
" my client said that this decision came in 2004 , " gelowicz 's lawyer dirk uden told the regional high court in dusseldorf .
he explained that the us arrest and torture of a dual nationality german-lebanese car dealer chalid el-masri – who was not involved in terrorist activity – was the main reason gelowicz decided to begin working for the islamic jihad union , a splinter terror group with its roots in uzbekistan .
" he saw the pictures of abu ghraib , the pictures from guantanamo bay , and especially the fate of chalid el-masri , which he heard about through personal connections before it became common knowledge , and these things really influenced him .
these events supported his decision to embark upon an armed jihad . "
historic plea bargain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this hydrogen peroxide was to be made into lethal bombs in exchange for shortened sentences , the group 's members agreed to discuss their plans , and their time at a terror training camp in pakistani region of waziristan , close to the afghan border .
" the confessions of the accused were the most comprehensive talks concerning terrorism ever heard in a german court of law , " the director of the institute of terrorism research and security policy in essen , rolf tophoven , told deutsche welle .
" they gave an exact description of what was going on in the terror training camps in pakistan . "
it 's unclear how the group will plead , but daniel schneider has indicated he will probably plead guilty on attempted murder charges for shooting at a policeman trying to arrest him , acknowledging that the skirmish could easily " have had a deadly ending . "
a final verdict in the trial , which has lasted roughly nine months so far , is expected in march .
terror concerns in germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daniel schneider has admitted to trying to kill a policeman there has not yet been a successful islamist terror attack in germany , however , experts concur that the country 's military engagement in afghanistan means it is considered a viable target .
" we are in the sights of islamists because of the 4,500 soldiers posted in afghanistan , and our other anti-terrorist operations , " said tophoven .
" from the point of view of the terrorists , there are good reasons to attack germany , and were an attack here ever to succeed , i am sure that the mission in afghanistan would be used as justification for it . "
tophoven also says it should come as no surprise that the sauerland cell was a home-grown organization , led by german converts to islam .
" a minority of converts to a new religion want to prove that they are tougher than the people born into the religion .
they want to establish themselves and prove their conviction in their new faith , and this can lead to extremism . "

" from the point of view of the terrorists , there are good reasons to attack germany , and were an attack here ever to succeed , i am sure that the mission in afghanistan would be used as justification for it . "
tophoven also says it should come as no surprise that the sauerland cell was a home-grown organization , led by german converts to islam .
" a minority of converts to a new religion want to prove that they are tougher than the people born into the religion .
they want to establish themselves and prove their conviction in their new faith , and this can lead to extremism . "

the " sauerland cell , " uncovered and arrested in 2007 , was germany 's first example of home-grown islamist terrorism . the geman-born leader of the so-called sauerland cell , fritz gelowicz , showed germany that islamist terror was a problem in its own back yard .
the 30-year-old islam convert and his three accomplices , german daniel schneider , turkish-german attila selek , and turk adem yilmaz were captured in the west german region of sauerland in 2007 , with vast stockpiles of hydrogen peroxide , suitable for making car bombs and other explosives .
they said they planned to attack us military targets based in germany , and that events in the so-called " war on terror " had motivated them to take up arms .
" my client said that this decision came in 2004 , " gelowicz 's lawyer dirk uden told the regional high court in dusseldorf .
he explained that the us arrest and torture of a dual nationality german-lebanese car dealer chalid el-masri – who was not involved in terrorist activity – was the main reason gelowicz decided to begin working for the islamic jihad union , a splinter terror group with its roots in uzbekistan .
" he saw the pictures of abu ghraib , the pictures from guantanamo bay , and especially the fate of chalid el-masri , which he heard about through personal connections before it became common knowledge , and these things really influenced him .
these events supported his decision to embark upon an armed jihad . "
historic plea bargain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this hydrogen peroxide was to be made into lethal bombs in exchange for shortened sentences , the group 's members agreed to discuss their plans , and their time at a terror training camp in pakistani region of waziristan , close to the afghan border .
" the confessions of the accused were the most comprehensive talks concerning terrorism ever heard in a german court of law , " the director of the institute of terrorism research and security policy in essen , rolf tophoven , told deutsche welle .
" they gave an exact description of what was going on in the terror training camps in pakistan . "
it 's unclear how the group will plead , but daniel schneider has indicated he will probably plead guilty on attempted murder charges for shooting at a policeman trying to arrest him , acknowledging that the skirmish could easily " have had a deadly ending . "
a final verdict in the trial , which has lasted roughly nine months so far , is expected in march .

theft sparked outrage the five-meter -lrb- 16 feet -rrb- wrought iron sign - the german words on which translate as " work sets you free " - was stolen in december from above the gate to the concentration camp .
the sign , a worldwide symbol of the atrocities of nazi germany , was later found by police cut into three pieces . the theft of the sign sparked international outrage , especially in israel .
up to 1.5 million people , mostly jews , died at auschwitz during nazi germany 's occupation of poland in world war ii .
the recovered sign is now being repaired . a replica had to be put up last week at the ceremonies commemorating the 65th liberation of auschwitz by soviet troops . mm / afp / dpa / reuters editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but opel management says unions are twisting the figures as its parent company gm looks to secure government funding . opel 's european works council says general motors ' decision to restructure the german-based carmaker may require even more layoffs than previously expected . following a meeting with the company 's chief executive nick reilly , labor leaders said in a statement that the number of jobs at risk throughout europe is 2,000 higher than the 8,300 positions already on the chopping block .

opel management has rejected the labor leaders ' criticism as unreasonable , arguing that the 2,000 ' additional ' losses were actually early retirement deals unrelated to restructuring efforts . a company spokesman told the german press agency dpa that opel was sticking to its original plan to cut 8,300 jobs across europe as it reduces production by 20 percent in response to weakened demand for vehicles .

gm has also asked for 2.7 billion euros in state aid in the form of either loans or loan guarantees to help finance the 3.3 billion euro revamp .
reilly said that all countries that host major opel manufacturing sites , with the exception of belgium , have indicated they remain open in principle to extending state funding .

washingon , however , insists the move is not meant as a snub against brussels . the white house on monday said us president barack obama had no plans to attend the annual eu-us summit scheduled for may in spain .
washington however stressed that the decision should not be interpreted as a snub to the european union .
" the president is committed to a strong us-eu partnership , and with europe in general , " national security council spokesman mike hammer said .
obama is increasingly facing challenges implementing his domestic reform agenda and has indicated that in 2010 he will spend more time on home soil .
his approval ratings in the us have dropped as the economic recovery has been slow to translate onto the job market .
officials in brussels reacted with disappointment to the news .
" it is normally the case that the summits are summits precisely because they are attended by heads of state and government , " eu commission spokeswoman pia ahrenkilde hanson told reporters .
according to newsagency afp , sources close to the spanish government have indicated that the summit might be postponed following washington 's announcement .

gordon stressed that the us president remained committed to close transatlantic ties with a keen eye on cooperation on afghanistan , counter-terrorism , the global economic crisis and climate change .
" the president as you all know has travelled to europe in his first year more than any president has ever done in the past , " gordon said .
obama travelled six times to europe last year , most recently to the copenhagen climate summit in december .
yet with congressional polls coming up in november , he is expected to travel mainly within the us in support for democratic candidates fearing a republican rebound .
since 1997 , the european union and the us have held annual meetings .

the two south asian neighbours india and pakistan have been at loggerheads since the partition of the subcontinent in 1947 .
the conflict over kashmir and militant attacks have fuelled animosity between them for a long time . after terrorists trained in pakistan wreaked havoc in mumbai during a three day assault in november 2008 , the media in both countries took a far more hawkish stance than their governments , whipping up nationalist sentiment and emotions .
the indian government , for instance , slammed the media and even threatened to restrict press freedoms .
now , however , a year on , the times of india and pakistan 's jang group have decided to take a different approach .
their initiative ' aman ki asha ' or ' hope for peace ' aims at spreading the message of peace by utilizing the strong common bonds of music , art and literature that both countries share .
the groups ' newspapers devoted their full first page to the topic on new year 's day this year .
since then the initiative has been a regular feature of their electronic and print output .
videos show the things that people love and cherish on both sides of the border .
' like brother and sister ' this has struck a chord with many people in the subcontinent .
sneh maria kovela is a pakistani woman now married to an indian man , but her visa for india was rejected on three occasions by the indian government . " india and pakistan are two different nations , but we are like brother and sister , " she says .
" everybody fights in their home but nobody wants to prolong the fight .
if we ca n't visit our neighbors , we are nothing . "
the media campaign , which includes exchange programs in different fields , is targeted at common people .
but , says ranjan roy , coordinator of the initiative from the times of india , it will also put pressure on delhi and islamabad to get back to the negotiating table .
he stresses that the initiative is not affecting the way his paper covers news on a daily basis : " this is not impinging on our news coverage .
this is very different from the way we cover the day to day news . "
he says there could be further initiatives in the future like building up a news pool to share content .
at the moment , the state of diplomatic ties between the two countries does not allow either side to have full time correspondents on the other side of the mutual border .
a ' publicity blitz ' ? but critics in india and pakistan say the initiative is all just a big publicity campaign .
seema mustafa , a reputed commentator on political affairs from india , says it is hard to believe that the two media organisations , which have a record of jingoism , are now suddenly gearing up for a peace initiative : " obviously this has n't come from the media houses .
this has been delivered to them as part of what washington , new delhi and islamabad hope will be a big publicity blitz , under which they can then promote peace or at least talk of peace , while america focuses on the afghanistan-pakistan border . "
thousands of facebook followers but salima hashmi , a renowned painter and peace activist from lahore , is more upbeat .
she says the time has come for both the governments to find ways to bring peace in the subcontinent .
" both governments have been guilty in different parts of their respective countries of breeding people who use violence as a political weapon .
i think there must be a realisation that this is a common enemy . "
despite the criticism regarding the media-led peace initiative ' aman ki asha ' , facebook , the social networking site , records more than 8,000 followers on the project 's page .
this goes to show that a growing number of young people in india and pakistan sincerely want the media to make a positive contribution towards achieving a relaxation of tensions between the two countries .

the two south asian neighbours india and pakistan have been at loggerheads since the partition of the subcontinent in 1947 .
the conflict over kashmir and militant attacks have fuelled animosity between them for a long time . after terrorists trained in pakistan wreaked havoc in mumbai during a three day assault in november 2008 , the media in both countries took a far more hawkish stance than their governments , whipping up nationalist sentiment and emotions .
the indian government , for instance , slammed the media and even threatened to restrict press freedoms .
now , however , a year on , the times of india and pakistan 's jang group have decided to take a different approach .
their initiative ' aman ki asha ' or ' hope for peace ' aims at spreading the message of peace by utilizing the strong common bonds of music , art and literature that both countries share .
the groups ' newspapers devoted their full first page to the topic on new year 's day this year .
since then the initiative has been a regular feature of their electronic and print output .
videos show the things that people love and cherish on both sides of the border .
' like brother and sister ' this has struck a chord with many people in the subcontinent .
sneh maria kovela is a pakistani woman now married to an indian man , but her visa for india was rejected on three occasions by the indian government . " india and pakistan are two different nations , but we are like brother and sister , " she says .
" everybody fights in their home but nobody wants to prolong the fight .
if we ca n't visit our neighbors , we are nothing . "
the media campaign , which includes exchange programs in different fields , is targeted at common people .
but , says ranjan roy , coordinator of the initiative from the times of india , it will also put pressure on delhi and islamabad to get back to the negotiating table .
he stresses that the initiative is not affecting the way his paper covers news on a daily basis : " this is not impinging on our news coverage .
this is very different from the way we cover the day to day news . "
he says there could be further initiatives in the future like building up a news pool to share content .
at the moment , the state of diplomatic ties between the two countries does not allow either side to have full time correspondents on the other side of the mutual border .
a ' publicity blitz ' ? but critics in india and pakistan say the initiative is all just a big publicity campaign .
seema mustafa , a reputed commentator on political affairs from india , says it is hard to believe that the two media organisations , which have a record of jingoism , are now suddenly gearing up for a peace initiative : " obviously this has n't come from the media houses .
this has been delivered to them as part of what washington , new delhi and islamabad hope will be a big publicity blitz , under which they can then promote peace or at least talk of peace , while america focuses on the afghanistan-pakistan border . "
thousands of facebook followers but salima hashmi , a renowned painter and peace activist from lahore , is more upbeat .
she says the time has come for both the governments to find ways to bring peace in the subcontinent .
" both governments have been guilty in different parts of their respective countries of breeding people who use violence as a political weapon .
i think there must be a realisation that this is a common enemy . "
despite the criticism regarding the media-led peace initiative ' aman ki asha ' , facebook , the social networking site , records more than 8,000 followers on the project 's page .
this goes to show that a growing number of young people in india and pakistan sincerely want the media to make a positive contribution towards achieving a relaxation of tensions between the two countries .

washingon , however , insists the move is not meant as a snub against brussels . the white house on monday said us president barack obama had no plans to attend the annual eu-us summit scheduled for may in spain .
washington however stressed that the decision should not be interpreted as a snub to the european union .
" the president is committed to a strong us-eu partnership , and with europe in general , " national security council spokesman mike hammer said .
obama is increasingly facing challenges implementing his domestic reform agenda and has indicated that in 2010 he will spend more time on home soil .
his approval ratings in the us have dropped as the economic recovery has been slow to translate onto the job market .
officials in brussels reacted with disappointment to the news .
" it is normally the case that the summits are summits precisely because they are attended by heads of state and government , " eu commission spokeswoman pia ahrenkilde hanson told reporters .
according to newsagency afp , sources close to the spanish government have indicated that the summit might be postponed following washington 's announcement .
spain currently holds the rotating eu presidency and is to host the summit .
domestic challenges bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama yet has to meet with new eu president van rompuy us assistant secretary of state philip gordon on monday told reporters that it never had been on obama 's agenda to attend the spanish summit .
gordon stressed that the us president remained committed to close transatlantic ties with a keen eye on cooperation on afghanistan , counter-terrorism , the global economic crisis and climate change .
" the president as you all know has travelled to europe in his first year more than any president has ever done in the past , " gordon said .
obama travelled six times to europe last year , most recently to the copenhagen climate summit in december .
yet with congressional polls coming up in november , he is expected to travel mainly within the us in support for democratic candidates fearing a republican rebound .
since 1997 , the european union and the us have held annual meetings .
this year 's summit is scheduled for may 24 .
obama 's absence at the summit would likely be regarded as a blow for brussels .

at 80 , he 's been awarded the sonning prize , denmark 's most respected literary award . enzensberg on tuesday received the 2010 sonning prize at a ceremony in copenhagen .
the biennial prize , which is intended to honor work that benefits european culture , is worth 134,000 euros -lrb- $ 187,000 -rrb- . the bavarian-born writer has left " considerable footprints in literature , essays and journalism , " said copenhagen university , which has awarded the sonning prize since 1950 . born on november 11 , 1929 , in kaufbeuren , enzensberger grew up in the southern german city of nuremberg , where the nazis regularly held their conventions .
at a young age , he witnessed the rise and fall of the third reich and the victory of the allies - experiences which would leave an impression on him . after the second world war , enzensberger was employed as an interpreter for american soldiers ; studied philosophy and literature in germany and france and lived for a time in norway .
later , he worked as a radio journalist , a dramatist and a college lecturer . a prominent figure in the 1968 student movement , enzensberger published an influential magazine , kursbuch , which became a kind of cult publication among young revolutionaries . a say in every debate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : enzensberger is pictured with guenter grass and peter ruehmkorf , who were also members of gruppe 47 by that time he had already established himself as a successful writer .
he was welcomed into the politically and culturally influential literary society " gruppe 47 " early on and was awarded the buechner prize in 1963 . later , however , the writer distanced himself from the radical politics of the 1968 movement and became a vocal critic of what he called the " linker gemütlichkeit " -lrb- roughly , " comfortable left " -rrb- , as the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung wrote in the late 1980s . even in recent years , enzensberger has remained both outspoken and prolific .
he made headlines in 2003 by publically defending the invasion of iraq , comparing the iraqi dictator saddam hussein to adolf hitler . and in the last two years alone , he published a children 's book , " bibs , " two essays and a piece of prose entitled " the silences of hammerstein . "
the latter is a partly fictional , partly factual account of a real-life nazi general and the few who refused to share in the party 's spoils . enzensberger joins a long line of prestigious sonning prize winners , including winston churchill -lrb- 1950 -rrb- , theologian karl barth -lrb- 1963 -rrb- , publicist hannah arendt -lrb- 1975 -rrb- , philosopher juergen habermas -lrb- 1987 -rrb- and writer guenter grass -lrb- 1996 -rrb- . click on the links below to read samples of enzensberger 's work in english . kjb / dpad / epd / kna / ap editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

polish authorities have already arrested five local men in the case , but they have previously identified hoegstroem as the mastermind behind the theft .
the european arrest warrant obliges any european union member state to hand over hoegstroem within 90 days of his arrest . the measure replaces the traditional extradition process , which in the past could take years of legal stalling . the measure has been on the eu books since 2005 , but this is throught to be the first major case in which it is being put to use .
theft sparked outrage the five-meter -lrb- 16 feet -rrb- wrought iron sign - the german words on which translate as " work sets you free " - was stolen in december from above the gate to the concentration camp .
the sign , a worldwide symbol of the atrocities of nazi germany , was later found by police cut into three pieces . the theft of the sign sparked international outrage , especially in israel .
up to 1.5 million people , mostly jews , died at auschwitz during nazi germany 's occupation of poland in world war ii .

at 80 , he 's been awarded the sonning prize , denmark 's most respected literary award . enzensberg on tuesday received the 2010 sonning prize at a ceremony in copenhagen .
the biennial prize , which is intended to honor work that benefits european culture , is worth 134,000 euros -lrb- $ 187,000 -rrb- . the bavarian-born writer has left " considerable footprints in literature , essays and journalism , " said copenhagen university , which has awarded the sonning prize since 1950 . born on november 11 , 1929 , in kaufbeuren , enzensberger grew up in the southern german city of nuremberg , where the nazis regularly held their conventions .
at a young age , he witnessed the rise and fall of the third reich and the victory of the allies - experiences which would leave an impression on him . after the second world war , enzensberger was employed as an interpreter for american soldiers ; studied philosophy and literature in germany and france and lived for a time in norway .
later , he worked as a radio journalist , a dramatist and a college lecturer . a prominent figure in the 1968 student movement , enzensberger published an influential magazine , kursbuch , which became a kind of cult publication among young revolutionaries . a say in every debate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : enzensberger is pictured with guenter grass and peter ruehmkorf , who were also members of gruppe 47 by that time he had already established himself as a successful writer .
he was welcomed into the politically and culturally influential literary society " gruppe 47 " early on and was awarded the buechner prize in 1963 . later , however , the writer distanced himself from the radical politics of the 1968 movement and became a vocal critic of what he called the " linker gemütlichkeit " -lrb- roughly , " comfortable left " -rrb- , as the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung wrote in the late 1980s . even in recent years , enzensberger has remained both outspoken and prolific .
he made headlines in 2003 by publically defending the invasion of iraq , comparing the iraqi dictator saddam hussein to adolf hitler . and in the last two years alone , he published a children 's book , " bibs , " two essays and a piece of prose entitled " the silences of hammerstein . "
the latter is a partly fictional , partly factual account of a real-life nazi general and the few who refused to share in the party 's spoils . enzensberger joins a long line of prestigious sonning prize winners , including winston churchill -lrb- 1950 -rrb- , theologian karl barth -lrb- 1963 -rrb- , publicist hannah arendt -lrb- 1975 -rrb- , philosopher juergen habermas -lrb- 1987 -rrb- and writer guenter grass -lrb- 1996 -rrb- . click on the links below to read samples of enzensberger 's work in english . kjb / dpad / epd / kna / ap editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

washingon , however , insists the move is not meant as a snub against brussels . the white house on monday said us president barack obama had no plans to attend the annual eu-us summit scheduled for may in spain .
washington however stressed that the decision should not be interpreted as a snub to the european union .
" the president is committed to a strong us-eu partnership , and with europe in general , " national security council spokesman mike hammer said .
obama is increasingly facing challenges implementing his domestic reform agenda and has indicated that in 2010 he will spend more time on home soil .
his approval ratings in the us have dropped as the economic recovery has been slow to translate onto the job market .
officials in brussels reacted with disappointment to the news .
" it is normally the case that the summits are summits precisely because they are attended by heads of state and government , " eu commission spokeswoman pia ahrenkilde hanson told reporters .
according to newsagency afp , sources close to the spanish government have indicated that the summit might be postponed following washington 's announcement .
spain currently holds the rotating eu presidency and is to host the summit .
domestic challenges bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama yet has to meet with new eu president van rompuy us assistant secretary of state philip gordon on monday told reporters that it never had been on obama 's agenda to attend the spanish summit .
gordon stressed that the us president remained committed to close transatlantic ties with a keen eye on cooperation on afghanistan , counter-terrorism , the global economic crisis and climate change .
" the president as you all know has travelled to europe in his first year more than any president has ever done in the past , " gordon said .
obama travelled six times to europe last year , most recently to the copenhagen climate summit in december .
yet with congressional polls coming up in november , he is expected to travel mainly within the us in support for democratic candidates fearing a republican rebound .
since 1997 , the european union and the us have held annual meetings .
this year 's summit is scheduled for may 24 .
obama 's absence at the summit would likely be regarded as a blow for brussels .
the new president of the european council , herman van rompuy , has yet to formally meet with obama. ai / dpa / afp editor : rob turner send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

at 80 , he 's been awarded the sonning prize , denmark 's most respected literary award . enzensberg on tuesday received the 2010 sonning prize at a ceremony in copenhagen .
the biennial prize , which is intended to honor work that benefits european culture , is worth 134,000 euros -lrb- $ 187,000 -rrb- . the bavarian-born writer has left " considerable footprints in literature , essays and journalism , " said copenhagen university , which has awarded the sonning prize since 1950 . born on november 11 , 1929 , in kaufbeuren , enzensberger grew up in the southern german city of nuremberg , where the nazis regularly held their conventions .

he made headlines in 2003 by publically defending the invasion of iraq , comparing the iraqi dictator saddam hussein to adolf hitler . and in the last two years alone , he published a children 's book , " bibs , " two essays and a piece of prose entitled " the silences of hammerstein . "

but opel management says unions are twisting the figures as its parent company gm looks to secure government funding . opel 's european works council says general motors ' decision to restructure the german-based carmaker may require even more layoffs than previously expected . following a meeting with the company 's chief executive nick reilly , labor leaders said in a statement that the number of jobs at risk throughout europe is 2,000 higher than the 8,300 positions already on the chopping block .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opel ceo nick reilly wants a downsizing agreement by mid-february unions say germany and belgium are likely to be hit the hardest in terms of total number of cuts under the revised plan . some 4,800 people would be laid off in germany , including members of management , while the closure of the opel manufacturing plant in antwerp would cost another 2,600 jobs .
opel management has rejected the labor leaders ' criticism as unreasonable , arguing that the 2,000 ' additional ' losses were actually early retirement deals unrelated to restructuring efforts . a company spokesman told the german press agency dpa that opel was sticking to its original plan to cut 8,300 jobs across europe as it reduces production by 20 percent in response to weakened demand for vehicles .
looking for loans reuters news agency quoted labor leaders who said they learned in the meeting with reilly that opel no longer planned to reduce management costs by 35 percent and that , on the contrary , new management staff has been hired .
last week ceo reilly announced he wanted to reach an agreement with the works council by mid-february on a plan to help the carmaker shrink to a profitable size .
however , labor leaders have frozen negotiations with gm over the automaker 's proposal to make 265 million euros -lrb- $ 372.1 million -rrb- in annual wage cuts across the continent over the next five years , insisting that the antwerp plant should stay open .
gm has also asked for 2.7 billion euros in state aid in the form of either loans or loan guarantees to help finance the 3.3 billion euro revamp .
reilly said that all countries that host major opel manufacturing sites , with the exception of belgium , have indicated they remain open in principle to extending state funding .
opel is expected to submit a formal aid application to germany within the next few days , once the company obtains the required independent expert opinion on the viability of reilly 's plan .
reilly has said that opel currently has enough liquidity to operate " well into the second quarter . " mrm / reuters / dpa editor : sam edmonds send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the " sauerland cell , " uncovered and arrested in 2007 , was germany 's first example of home-grown islamist terrorism . the geman-born leader of the so-called sauerland cell , fritz gelowicz , showed germany that islamist terror was a problem in its own back yard .
the 30-year-old islam convert and his three accomplices , german daniel schneider , turkish-german attila selek , and turk adem yilmaz were captured in the west german region of sauerland in 2007 , with vast stockpiles of hydrogen peroxide , suitable for making car bombs and other explosives .
they said they planned to attack us military targets based in germany , and that events in the so-called " war on terror " had motivated them to take up arms .
" my client said that this decision came in 2004 , " gelowicz 's lawyer dirk uden told the regional high court in dusseldorf .
he explained that the us arrest and torture of a dual nationality german-lebanese car dealer chalid el-masri – who was not involved in terrorist activity – was the main reason gelowicz decided to begin working for the islamic jihad union , a splinter terror group with its roots in uzbekistan .
" he saw the pictures of abu ghraib , the pictures from guantanamo bay , and especially the fate of chalid el-masri , which he heard about through personal connections before it became common knowledge , and these things really influenced him .
these events supported his decision to embark upon an armed jihad . "
historic plea bargain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this hydrogen peroxide was to be made into lethal bombs in exchange for shortened sentences , the group 's members agreed to discuss their plans , and their time at a terror training camp in pakistani region of waziristan , close to the afghan border .
" the confessions of the accused were the most comprehensive talks concerning terrorism ever heard in a german court of law , " the director of the institute of terrorism research and security policy in essen , rolf tophoven , told deutsche welle .
" they gave an exact description of what was going on in the terror training camps in pakistan . "
it 's unclear how the group will plead , but daniel schneider has indicated he will probably plead guilty on attempted murder charges for shooting at a policeman trying to arrest him , acknowledging that the skirmish could easily " have had a deadly ending . "
a final verdict in the trial , which has lasted roughly nine months so far , is expected in march .
terror concerns in germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daniel schneider has admitted to trying to kill a policeman there has not yet been a successful islamist terror attack in germany , however , experts concur that the country 's military engagement in afghanistan means it is considered a viable target .
" we are in the sights of islamists because of the 4,500 soldiers posted in afghanistan , and our other anti-terrorist operations , " said tophoven .
" from the point of view of the terrorists , there are good reasons to attack germany , and were an attack here ever to succeed , i am sure that the mission in afghanistan would be used as justification for it . "
tophoven also says it should come as no surprise that the sauerland cell was a home-grown organization , led by german converts to islam .
" a minority of converts to a new religion want to prove that they are tougher than the people born into the religion .
they want to establish themselves and prove their conviction in their new faith , and this can lead to extremism . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de asia -pipe- 02.02.2010 media propagate ' hope for peace ' in south asia großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people-to-people contacts : indian sikhs on the way to pakistan the ' times of india ' and the pakistani ' jang ' group have come up with a peace initiative between india and pakistan - a first time the media have taken such a step .
the two south asian neighbours india and pakistan have been at loggerheads since the partition of the subcontinent in 1947 .
the conflict over kashmir and militant attacks have fuelled animosity between them for a long time . after terrorists trained in pakistan wreaked havoc in mumbai during a three day assault in november 2008 , the media in both countries took a far more hawkish stance than their governments , whipping up nationalist sentiment and emotions .
the indian government , for instance , slammed the media and even threatened to restrict press freedoms .
now , however , a year on , the times of india and pakistan 's jang group have decided to take a different approach .
their initiative ' aman ki asha ' or ' hope for peace ' aims at spreading the message of peace by utilizing the strong common bonds of music , art and literature that both countries share .
the groups ' newspapers devoted their full first page to the topic on new year 's day this year .
since then the initiative has been a regular feature of their electronic and print output .
videos show the things that people love and cherish on both sides of the border .
' like brother and sister ' this has struck a chord with many people in the subcontinent .
sneh maria kovela is a pakistani woman now married to an indian man , but her visa for india was rejected on three occasions by the indian government . " india and pakistan are two different nations , but we are like brother and sister , " she says .
" everybody fights in their home but nobody wants to prolong the fight .
if we ca n't visit our neighbors , we are nothing . "
the media campaign , which includes exchange programs in different fields , is targeted at common people .
but , says ranjan roy , coordinator of the initiative from the times of india , it will also put pressure on delhi and islamabad to get back to the negotiating table .
he stresses that the initiative is not affecting the way his paper covers news on a daily basis : " this is not impinging on our news coverage .
this is very different from the way we cover the day to day news . "
he says there could be further initiatives in the future like building up a news pool to share content .
at the moment , the state of diplomatic ties between the two countries does not allow either side to have full time correspondents on the other side of the mutual border .
a ' publicity blitz ' ? but critics in india and pakistan say the initiative is all just a big publicity campaign .
seema mustafa , a reputed commentator on political affairs from india , says it is hard to believe that the two media organisations , which have a record of jingoism , are now suddenly gearing up for a peace initiative : " obviously this has n't come from the media houses .
this has been delivered to them as part of what washington , new delhi and islamabad hope will be a big publicity blitz , under which they can then promote peace or at least talk of peace , while america focuses on the afghanistan-pakistan border . "
thousands of facebook followers but salima hashmi , a renowned painter and peace activist from lahore , is more upbeat .
she says the time has come for both the governments to find ways to bring peace in the subcontinent .
" both governments have been guilty in different parts of their respective countries of breeding people who use violence as a political weapon .
i think there must be a realisation that this is a common enemy . "
despite the criticism regarding the media-led peace initiative ' aman ki asha ' , facebook , the social networking site , records more than 8,000 followers on the project 's page .
this goes to show that a growing number of young people in india and pakistan sincerely want the media to make a positive contribution towards achieving a relaxation of tensions between the two countries .

the " sauerland cell , " uncovered and arrested in 2007 , was germany 's first example of home-grown islamist terrorism . the geman-born leader of the so-called sauerland cell , fritz gelowicz , showed germany that islamist terror was a problem in its own back yard .
the 30-year-old islam convert and his three accomplices , german daniel schneider , turkish-german attila selek , and turk adem yilmaz were captured in the west german region of sauerland in 2007 , with vast stockpiles of hydrogen peroxide , suitable for making car bombs and other explosives .
they said they planned to attack us military targets based in germany , and that events in the so-called " war on terror " had motivated them to take up arms .
" my client said that this decision came in 2004 , " gelowicz 's lawyer dirk uden told the regional high court in dusseldorf .
he explained that the us arrest and torture of a dual nationality german-lebanese car dealer chalid el-masri – who was not involved in terrorist activity – was the main reason gelowicz decided to begin working for the islamic jihad union , a splinter terror group with its roots in uzbekistan .
" he saw the pictures of abu ghraib , the pictures from guantanamo bay , and especially the fate of chalid el-masri , which he heard about through personal connections before it became common knowledge , and these things really influenced him .
these events supported his decision to embark upon an armed jihad . "
historic plea bargain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this hydrogen peroxide was to be made into lethal bombs in exchange for shortened sentences , the group 's members agreed to discuss their plans , and their time at a terror training camp in pakistani region of waziristan , close to the afghan border .
" the confessions of the accused were the most comprehensive talks concerning terrorism ever heard in a german court of law , " the director of the institute of terrorism research and security policy in essen , rolf tophoven , told deutsche welle .
" they gave an exact description of what was going on in the terror training camps in pakistan . "
it 's unclear how the group will plead , but daniel schneider has indicated he will probably plead guilty on attempted murder charges for shooting at a policeman trying to arrest him , acknowledging that the skirmish could easily " have had a deadly ending . "
a final verdict in the trial , which has lasted roughly nine months so far , is expected in march .
terror concerns in germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daniel schneider has admitted to trying to kill a policeman there has not yet been a successful islamist terror attack in germany , however , experts concur that the country 's military engagement in afghanistan means it is considered a viable target .
" we are in the sights of islamists because of the 4,500 soldiers posted in afghanistan , and our other anti-terrorist operations , " said tophoven .
" from the point of view of the terrorists , there are good reasons to attack germany , and were an attack here ever to succeed , i am sure that the mission in afghanistan would be used as justification for it . "
tophoven also says it should come as no surprise that the sauerland cell was a home-grown organization , led by german converts to islam .
" a minority of converts to a new religion want to prove that they are tougher than the people born into the religion .
they want to establish themselves and prove their conviction in their new faith , and this can lead to extremism . "

the two south asian neighbours india and pakistan have been at loggerheads since the partition of the subcontinent in 1947 .
the conflict over kashmir and militant attacks have fuelled animosity between them for a long time . after terrorists trained in pakistan wreaked havoc in mumbai during a three day assault in november 2008 , the media in both countries took a far more hawkish stance than their governments , whipping up nationalist sentiment and emotions .
the indian government , for instance , slammed the media and even threatened to restrict press freedoms .
now , however , a year on , the times of india and pakistan 's jang group have decided to take a different approach .
their initiative ' aman ki asha ' or ' hope for peace ' aims at spreading the message of peace by utilizing the strong common bonds of music , art and literature that both countries share .
the groups ' newspapers devoted their full first page to the topic on new year 's day this year .
since then the initiative has been a regular feature of their electronic and print output .
videos show the things that people love and cherish on both sides of the border .
' like brother and sister ' this has struck a chord with many people in the subcontinent .
sneh maria kovela is a pakistani woman now married to an indian man , but her visa for india was rejected on three occasions by the indian government . " india and pakistan are two different nations , but we are like brother and sister , " she says .
" everybody fights in their home but nobody wants to prolong the fight .
if we ca n't visit our neighbors , we are nothing . "
the media campaign , which includes exchange programs in different fields , is targeted at common people .
but , says ranjan roy , coordinator of the initiative from the times of india , it will also put pressure on delhi and islamabad to get back to the negotiating table .
he stresses that the initiative is not affecting the way his paper covers news on a daily basis : " this is not impinging on our news coverage .
this is very different from the way we cover the day to day news . "
he says there could be further initiatives in the future like building up a news pool to share content .
at the moment , the state of diplomatic ties between the two countries does not allow either side to have full time correspondents on the other side of the mutual border .
a ' publicity blitz ' ? but critics in india and pakistan say the initiative is all just a big publicity campaign .
seema mustafa , a reputed commentator on political affairs from india , says it is hard to believe that the two media organisations , which have a record of jingoism , are now suddenly gearing up for a peace initiative : " obviously this has n't come from the media houses .
this has been delivered to them as part of what washington , new delhi and islamabad hope will be a big publicity blitz , under which they can then promote peace or at least talk of peace , while america focuses on the afghanistan-pakistan border . "
thousands of facebook followers but salima hashmi , a renowned painter and peace activist from lahore , is more upbeat .
she says the time has come for both the governments to find ways to bring peace in the subcontinent .
" both governments have been guilty in different parts of their respective countries of breeding people who use violence as a political weapon .
i think there must be a realisation that this is a common enemy . "
despite the criticism regarding the media-led peace initiative ' aman ki asha ' , facebook , the social networking site , records more than 8,000 followers on the project 's page .
this goes to show that a growing number of young people in india and pakistan sincerely want the media to make a positive contribution towards achieving a relaxation of tensions between the two countries .

the two south asian neighbours india and pakistan have been at loggerheads since the partition of the subcontinent in 1947 .
the conflict over kashmir and militant attacks have fuelled animosity between them for a long time . after terrorists trained in pakistan wreaked havoc in mumbai during a three day assault in november 2008 , the media in both countries took a far more hawkish stance than their governments , whipping up nationalist sentiment and emotions .
the indian government , for instance , slammed the media and even threatened to restrict press freedoms .
now , however , a year on , the times of india and pakistan 's jang group have decided to take a different approach .
their initiative ' aman ki asha ' or ' hope for peace ' aims at spreading the message of peace by utilizing the strong common bonds of music , art and literature that both countries share .
the groups ' newspapers devoted their full first page to the topic on new year 's day this year .
since then the initiative has been a regular feature of their electronic and print output .
videos show the things that people love and cherish on both sides of the border .
' like brother and sister ' this has struck a chord with many people in the subcontinent .
sneh maria kovela is a pakistani woman now married to an indian man , but her visa for india was rejected on three occasions by the indian government . " india and pakistan are two different nations , but we are like brother and sister , " she says .
" everybody fights in their home but nobody wants to prolong the fight .
if we ca n't visit our neighbors , we are nothing . "
the media campaign , which includes exchange programs in different fields , is targeted at common people .
but , says ranjan roy , coordinator of the initiative from the times of india , it will also put pressure on delhi and islamabad to get back to the negotiating table .
he stresses that the initiative is not affecting the way his paper covers news on a daily basis : " this is not impinging on our news coverage .
this is very different from the way we cover the day to day news . "
he says there could be further initiatives in the future like building up a news pool to share content .
at the moment , the state of diplomatic ties between the two countries does not allow either side to have full time correspondents on the other side of the mutual border .
a ' publicity blitz ' ? but critics in india and pakistan say the initiative is all just a big publicity campaign .
seema mustafa , a reputed commentator on political affairs from india , says it is hard to believe that the two media organisations , which have a record of jingoism , are now suddenly gearing up for a peace initiative : " obviously this has n't come from the media houses .
this has been delivered to them as part of what washington , new delhi and islamabad hope will be a big publicity blitz , under which they can then promote peace or at least talk of peace , while america focuses on the afghanistan-pakistan border . "
thousands of facebook followers but salima hashmi , a renowned painter and peace activist from lahore , is more upbeat .
she says the time has come for both the governments to find ways to bring peace in the subcontinent .
" both governments have been guilty in different parts of their respective countries of breeding people who use violence as a political weapon .
i think there must be a realisation that this is a common enemy . "
despite the criticism regarding the media-led peace initiative ' aman ki asha ' , facebook , the social networking site , records more than 8,000 followers on the project 's page .
this goes to show that a growing number of young people in india and pakistan sincerely want the media to make a positive contribution towards achieving a relaxation of tensions between the two countries .

the " sauerland cell , " uncovered and arrested in 2007 , was germany 's first example of home-grown islamist terrorism . the geman-born leader of the so-called sauerland cell , fritz gelowicz , showed germany that islamist terror was a problem in its own back yard .
the 30-year-old islam convert and his three accomplices , german daniel schneider , turkish-german attila selek , and turk adem yilmaz were captured in the west german region of sauerland in 2007 , with vast stockpiles of hydrogen peroxide , suitable for making car bombs and other explosives .
they said they planned to attack us military targets based in germany , and that events in the so-called " war on terror " had motivated them to take up arms .
" my client said that this decision came in 2004 , " gelowicz 's lawyer dirk uden told the regional high court in dusseldorf .
he explained that the us arrest and torture of a dual nationality german-lebanese car dealer chalid el-masri – who was not involved in terrorist activity – was the main reason gelowicz decided to begin working for the islamic jihad union , a splinter terror group with its roots in uzbekistan .
" he saw the pictures of abu ghraib , the pictures from guantanamo bay , and especially the fate of chalid el-masri , which he heard about through personal connections before it became common knowledge , and these things really influenced him .
these events supported his decision to embark upon an armed jihad . "
historic plea bargain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this hydrogen peroxide was to be made into lethal bombs in exchange for shortened sentences , the group 's members agreed to discuss their plans , and their time at a terror training camp in pakistani region of waziristan , close to the afghan border .
" the confessions of the accused were the most comprehensive talks concerning terrorism ever heard in a german court of law , " the director of the institute of terrorism research and security policy in essen , rolf tophoven , told deutsche welle .
" they gave an exact description of what was going on in the terror training camps in pakistan . "
it 's unclear how the group will plead , but daniel schneider has indicated he will probably plead guilty on attempted murder charges for shooting at a policeman trying to arrest him , acknowledging that the skirmish could easily " have had a deadly ending . "
a final verdict in the trial , which has lasted roughly nine months so far , is expected in march .
terror concerns in germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daniel schneider has admitted to trying to kill a policeman there has not yet been a successful islamist terror attack in germany , however , experts concur that the country 's military engagement in afghanistan means it is considered a viable target .
" we are in the sights of islamists because of the 4,500 soldiers posted in afghanistan , and our other anti-terrorist operations , " said tophoven .
" from the point of view of the terrorists , there are good reasons to attack germany , and were an attack here ever to succeed , i am sure that the mission in afghanistan would be used as justification for it . "
tophoven also says it should come as no surprise that the sauerland cell was a home-grown organization , led by german converts to islam .
" a minority of converts to a new religion want to prove that they are tougher than the people born into the religion .
they want to establish themselves and prove their conviction in their new faith , and this can lead to extremism . "

the " sauerland cell , " uncovered and arrested in 2007 , was germany 's first example of home-grown islamist terrorism . the geman-born leader of the so-called sauerland cell , fritz gelowicz , showed germany that islamist terror was a problem in its own back yard .
the 30-year-old islam convert and his three accomplices , german daniel schneider , turkish-german attila selek , and turk adem yilmaz were captured in the west german region of sauerland in 2007 , with vast stockpiles of hydrogen peroxide , suitable for making car bombs and other explosives .
they said they planned to attack us military targets based in germany , and that events in the so-called " war on terror " had motivated them to take up arms .
" my client said that this decision came in 2004 , " gelowicz 's lawyer dirk uden told the regional high court in dusseldorf .
he explained that the us arrest and torture of a dual nationality german-lebanese car dealer chalid el-masri – who was not involved in terrorist activity – was the main reason gelowicz decided to begin working for the islamic jihad union , a splinter terror group with its roots in uzbekistan .
" he saw the pictures of abu ghraib , the pictures from guantanamo bay , and especially the fate of chalid el-masri , which he heard about through personal connections before it became common knowledge , and these things really influenced him .
these events supported his decision to embark upon an armed jihad . "
historic plea bargain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this hydrogen peroxide was to be made into lethal bombs in exchange for shortened sentences , the group 's members agreed to discuss their plans , and their time at a terror training camp in pakistani region of waziristan , close to the afghan border .
" the confessions of the accused were the most comprehensive talks concerning terrorism ever heard in a german court of law , " the director of the institute of terrorism research and security policy in essen , rolf tophoven , told deutsche welle .
" they gave an exact description of what was going on in the terror training camps in pakistan . "
it 's unclear how the group will plead , but daniel schneider has indicated he will probably plead guilty on attempted murder charges for shooting at a policeman trying to arrest him , acknowledging that the skirmish could easily " have had a deadly ending . "
a final verdict in the trial , which has lasted roughly nine months so far , is expected in march .
terror concerns in germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daniel schneider has admitted to trying to kill a policeman there has not yet been a successful islamist terror attack in germany , however , experts concur that the country 's military engagement in afghanistan means it is considered a viable target .
" we are in the sights of islamists because of the 4,500 soldiers posted in afghanistan , and our other anti-terrorist operations , " said tophoven .
" from the point of view of the terrorists , there are good reasons to attack germany , and were an attack here ever to succeed , i am sure that the mission in afghanistan would be used as justification for it . "
tophoven also says it should come as no surprise that the sauerland cell was a home-grown organization , led by german converts to islam .
" a minority of converts to a new religion want to prove that they are tougher than the people born into the religion .
they want to establish themselves and prove their conviction in their new faith , and this can lead to extremism . "

but opel management says unions are twisting the figures as its parent company gm looks to secure government funding . opel 's european works council says general motors ' decision to restructure the german-based carmaker may require even more layoffs than previously expected . following a meeting with the company 's chief executive nick reilly , labor leaders said in a statement that the number of jobs at risk throughout europe is 2,000 higher than the 8,300 positions already on the chopping block .

opel management has rejected the labor leaders ' criticism as unreasonable , arguing that the 2,000 ' additional ' losses were actually early retirement deals unrelated to restructuring efforts . a company spokesman told the german press agency dpa that opel was sticking to its original plan to cut 8,300 jobs across europe as it reduces production by 20 percent in response to weakened demand for vehicles .

reilly said that all countries that host major opel manufacturing sites , with the exception of belgium , have indicated they remain open in principle to extending state funding .
opel is expected to submit a formal aid application to germany within the next few days , once the company obtains the required independent expert opinion on the viability of reilly 's plan .

opel management has rejected the labor leaders ' criticism as unreasonable , arguing that the 2,000 ' additional ' losses were actually early retirement deals unrelated to restructuring efforts . a company spokesman told the german press agency dpa that opel was sticking to its original plan to cut 8,300 jobs across europe as it reduces production by 20 percent in response to weakened demand for vehicles .

washingon , however , insists the move is not meant as a snub against brussels . the white house on monday said us president barack obama had no plans to attend the annual eu-us summit scheduled for may in spain .
washington however stressed that the decision should not be interpreted as a snub to the european union .
" the president is committed to a strong us-eu partnership , and with europe in general , " national security council spokesman mike hammer said .
obama is increasingly facing challenges implementing his domestic reform agenda and has indicated that in 2010 he will spend more time on home soil .
his approval ratings in the us have dropped as the economic recovery has been slow to translate onto the job market .
officials in brussels reacted with disappointment to the news .
" it is normally the case that the summits are summits precisely because they are attended by heads of state and government , " eu commission spokeswoman pia ahrenkilde hanson told reporters .
according to newsagency afp , sources close to the spanish government have indicated that the summit might be postponed following washington 's announcement .
spain currently holds the rotating eu presidency and is to host the summit .
domestic challenges bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama yet has to meet with new eu president van rompuy us assistant secretary of state philip gordon on monday told reporters that it never had been on obama 's agenda to attend the spanish summit .
gordon stressed that the us president remained committed to close transatlantic ties with a keen eye on cooperation on afghanistan , counter-terrorism , the global economic crisis and climate change .
" the president as you all know has travelled to europe in his first year more than any president has ever done in the past , " gordon said .
obama travelled six times to europe last year , most recently to the copenhagen climate summit in december .
yet with congressional polls coming up in november , he is expected to travel mainly within the us in support for democratic candidates fearing a republican rebound .
since 1997 , the european union and the us have held annual meetings .
this year 's summit is scheduled for may 24 .
obama 's absence at the summit would likely be regarded as a blow for brussels .

but new research suggests the price war may soon end as the chains exhaust opportunities for domestic growth . according to german market researcher gfk , lidl was able to increase its share of the country 's 150-billion-euro food market by only 0.1 percent in 2009 to 9.8 percent .
archrival aldi was hit even harder : the discounter saw its market share drop last year to 18.4 percent from 19 percent .
revenue was down four percent – perhaps the biggest sales dip in the company 's history . the reasons for the stagnation are n't just the economic and financial crisis , which has forced numerous consumers to spend less and spend wisely .
the discounters , which include penny and the newly merged plus and netto group , have squeezed prices for numerous fast-moving consumer products to record lows and expanded store networks massively in large and small cities alike .
there are fewer and fewer opportunities to achieve a competitive edge in both areas , according to gfk food retail specialist wolfgang twardawa . “ every household in germany is within 10 minutes of a discounter by car , ” twardawa said .
“ and just look at butter prices .
penny has lowered its price from 99 cents for a 250-gram package to 80 cents .
nobody in the production chain is going to make money at that price . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cheap milk helps aldi attracts customers " brutal food retail market " independent retail consultant ulrich eggert says germany “ is a brutal food retail market . ” food prices in the country , he notes , are 15 percent below the european average .
“ nowhere in europe can consumers buy food more cheaply than they can in germany , ” he said . not surprisingly , sales margins of german discounters are low .
market researcher twardawa puts them at between 1-2 percent .
the one exception , he said , is aldi , with margins believed to be around 4 percent .
by comparison , sales margins in the uk are between 6-7 percent . until now , german discounters have experienced only growth .
with more than 16,000 stores across the country , they currently control 46.4 percent of the country 's food market .
that growth is largely the result of aggressive pricing .
aldi was the first grocer to feature rock-bottom pricing by offering a limited inventory and squeezing out all necessary costs , from butcher shops to fancy displays .
around 15 years later , lidl entered the market with a similar strategy . supermarkets under pressure much of the discounters ' growth has come at the expense of german supermarkets , in particular edeka and rewe .
both , however , have pursued a dual-pronged strategy to counter the competition . on the one hand , they have sought to win back customers willing to spend a little more money with service , ambience and a broad assortment of high-quality products , including fresh produce .
and they appear to be succeeding : their market share in 2009 rose slightly for the first time in years to 23.7 percent , according to gfk . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : supermarkets like rewe offer a wider product range than the discounters on the other hand , with an eye to consumers who need to spend even less , the two supermarkets have adopted the attitude “ if you can beat ‘ em , join ‘ em . ” both edeka and rewe have entered the discount fray with their own dedicated chains .
consultant eggert said he expects the newly merged plus and netto discount stores , owned by edeka , will emerge as a major challenger to aldi and lidl . a threat to diversity ? the increased competition could lead to even greater price pressure on suppliers , warns matthias horst , president of the federation of german food and drink industries -lrb- bve -rrb- .
“ we can see that the last round of price cuts has n't really done anything for aldi and lidl , ” he said . “ we are concerned about the negative impact that these endless price wars could have on the some 5,000 food suppliers in germany .
many of them may no longer be able to meet the conditions of the big discounters .
there could be consolidation and we could lose the rich diversity we currently have in the supplier sector . ” the new discounters do n't seem to be too worried as they scramble for market share in germany .
nor do the established giants aldi and lidl ; as they continue to slug it out and try to stay ahead of the newcomers by expanding outside the country , where they face not only less competition but also fatter sales margins . for sure , german discounters are providing consumers – for better or for worse – plenty of food for thought . author : john blau editor : sam edmonds send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

idealists say its focus should be on artists , not revenue .
but can talent alone keep the industry afloat ? among the first to go digital , the music industry is now scrambling for creative strategies to keep up with web pirates and illegal downloaders .
in the meantime , some analysts in the sector are banking on live performance as the ticket to success - after all , the " live experience " ca n't be digitized . there may be a broad spectrum of revenue-protecting strategies out there , but many experts on the stage and behind it agree on one thing : going back to the basics - that is , finding and developing good artists - is the only sure-fire way to weather the storm and promote growth . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lieberberg has been in the live music business for 40 years " i think the state of the industry currently is worse than it ever was , " concert organizer marek lieberberg said recently at midem , the industry 's largest international congress in cannes , france . lieberberg founded his frankfurt-based agency more than 40 years ago .
it focuses on open air festivals and organizes some of europe 's most popular events , including rock am ring at the nuerburgring race track and rock im park in nuremberg . the most recent statistics available from the federal association for the german music industry show that sales suffered a setback of 4.7 percent in 2008 , and have fallen 41 percent since 1999 . " i think the major malfunction is that record companies have a real problem finding the acts , " added lieberberg .
" the talent has dried out and it needs to be redeveloped . " bildunterschrift : rock am ring is one of germany 's biggest live music events internet is not enough while some industry observers thought for a while that the internet could serve as a do-it-yourself talent filter with sites like myspace.com , that seems to be a short-lived dream . " if you look around the world , maybe there are not even half a dozen bands or artists who have really achieved fame , just by emerging from the internet , " said edgar berger , ceo of sony music gsa -lrb- germany , switzerland and austria -rrb- . in germany , unlike in the us , people still buy compact discs , according to berger .
in 2008 , cds accoutned for 81 percent of music sold in germany - a level that has been stable for the past five years , according to the federal association for the german music industry .
clearly , the cd album is still high on the agendas of german music executives . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans music lovers have proven more loyal to the cd than their us counterparts germany accounts for 6.6 percent of global music sales and is therefore the world 's fourth largest music market . it comes in behind the us -lrb- with 36.2 percent -rrb- , japan -lrb- 16.6 percent -rrb- and great britain -lrb- 10.2 percent -rrb- . back to the roots both berger and lieberberg argued that it is not just the responsibility of that industry to get back to its roots - that is , the artists and their music - but also its ticket to survival in unstable economic times . " it 's the bigger companies that are investing significant amounts of money in new talents , " said berger .
he added that mergers within the industry - including the one announced just last week in the us between the world 's largest concert promoter live nation and ticketmaster - could lead to a kind of " renaissance . " with turnovers of 110 million euros -lrb- $ 153 million -rrb- and nearly 300 million euros last year respectively , however , the marek lieberberg concert agency and sony music gsa are indeed speaking from privileged positions and have the resources to take risks on new talent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berger predicted that the finance crisis would affect music consumers ' choices this year " we have to bring back music into the minds and into the hearts of the people , " said lieberberg .
" what i was raised on was music being a trigger for the liberation of society .
music was our release to dreams that we had - socially , politically , sexually .
all of this was triggered by music .
for us , music paved the way for a more liberal , a better life that awarded more rights to young people . " born in 1946 , the self-made impresario began his career in 1970 - on the heels of the 1968 student protests - with a concert by the who in muenster , germany . idealism or capitalism ? " we can not rule art in the same way we rule the rest of the economy , " said lieberberg .
but whether the search for the next chart-busting musician is more about art than profit remains to be seen . either way , music lovers in germany can still expect to find cds by the new stars , at least for a few more years . author : kate bowen editor : sam edmonds send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

following a meeting with greek prime minister george papandreou , westerwelle expressed germany 's support for the efforts of the greek government .
" i 'm convinced that these consolidation , reform , and growth programs deserve a chance and they will work , " westerwelle said .
" and that 's the reason i 'm here : we 're standing by greece . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greece is struggling with a mountain of debt however , last week the german government made a point of flatly rejecting any direct fiscal aid to finance the greek deficit .
german finance minister , wolfgang schaeuble , has insisted that the 16 eurozone countries were not obliged to bail out greece from its financial troubles .
eu heaping pressure on greece athens is feeling the heat from the european union and has seen its credit rating downgraded by all three major rating agencies .
the european commission is expected to make an official announcement about the greek deficit on wednesday , but said already on monday that greece 's plans to tackle its mountain of debt were " achievable . "
it warned however that " additional measures " were necessary .
eu commission spokeswoman , amelia torres , said greece would likely be given four months to reach " very precise objectives " under close surveillance by brussels .
early last year , the eu commission launched disciplinary action against greece because it had allowed its deficit to exceed the eu limit of three percent of gross domestic product , and it has since complained that the greek government has taken no effective steps to rein in its deficit . however , greek finance minister george papaconstantinou said the problem was not unique to his country . " following greece , there are other countries , like spain and portugal -lsb- in a similar situation -rsb- , " said papaconstantinou at an economic conference in athens on tuesday .
" this is why the greek issue , despite its particular greek characteristics , is also a euro zone issue . " he pledged athens ' support to the idea of selling eurozone bonds as possible solution . greek pm outlines cost-cutting plans bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greece is n't alone : 20 out of 27 eu nations have deficits that are too high as the pressure mounts , greek prime minister george papandreou has said that his government was ready " to draw blood " to beat the corruption , waste and mismanagement responsible for the debt crisis .
he has outlined sweeping public sector cuts to bring greece 's deficit in line with eurozone requirements by 2013 , including a cut in welfare spending , tax reform , and a public sector wage freeze .
papandreou has also proposed major curbs on public hiring , a 10 percent cut in social security and a " significant reduction " in military spending .
on top of that , he has also called for a 90 percent tax on bank bonuses . twenty of the eu 's 27 member nations are currently running deficits above the three-percent threshold. mz / gb / dpa / ap / afp / reuters editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de retail -pipe- 02.02.2010 german discount grocers struggle to sustain growth großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lidl is trying to steal market share from aldi with bargain-basement prices german food prices are the lowest in europe thanks to fierce competition from discounters like aldi and lidl .
but new research suggests the price war may soon end as the chains exhaust opportunities for domestic growth . according to german market researcher gfk , lidl was able to increase its share of the country 's 150-billion-euro food market by only 0.1 percent in 2009 to 9.8 percent .
archrival aldi was hit even harder : the discounter saw its market share drop last year to 18.4 percent from 19 percent .
revenue was down four percent – perhaps the biggest sales dip in the company 's history . the reasons for the stagnation are n't just the economic and financial crisis , which has forced numerous consumers to spend less and spend wisely .
the discounters , which include penny and the newly merged plus and netto group , have squeezed prices for numerous fast-moving consumer products to record lows and expanded store networks massively in large and small cities alike .
there are fewer and fewer opportunities to achieve a competitive edge in both areas , according to gfk food retail specialist wolfgang twardawa . “ every household in germany is within 10 minutes of a discounter by car , ” twardawa said .
“ and just look at butter prices .
penny has lowered its price from 99 cents for a 250-gram package to 80 cents .
nobody in the production chain is going to make money at that price . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cheap milk helps aldi attracts customers " brutal food retail market " independent retail consultant ulrich eggert says germany “ is a brutal food retail market . ” food prices in the country , he notes , are 15 percent below the european average .
“ nowhere in europe can consumers buy food more cheaply than they can in germany , ” he said . not surprisingly , sales margins of german discounters are low .
market researcher twardawa puts them at between 1-2 percent .
the one exception , he said , is aldi , with margins believed to be around 4 percent .
by comparison , sales margins in the uk are between 6-7 percent . until now , german discounters have experienced only growth .
with more than 16,000 stores across the country , they currently control 46.4 percent of the country 's food market .
that growth is largely the result of aggressive pricing .
aldi was the first grocer to feature rock-bottom pricing by offering a limited inventory and squeezing out all necessary costs , from butcher shops to fancy displays .
around 15 years later , lidl entered the market with a similar strategy . supermarkets under pressure much of the discounters ' growth has come at the expense of german supermarkets , in particular edeka and rewe .
both , however , have pursued a dual-pronged strategy to counter the competition . on the one hand , they have sought to win back customers willing to spend a little more money with service , ambience and a broad assortment of high-quality products , including fresh produce .
and they appear to be succeeding : their market share in 2009 rose slightly for the first time in years to 23.7 percent , according to gfk . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : supermarkets like rewe offer a wider product range than the discounters on the other hand , with an eye to consumers who need to spend even less , the two supermarkets have adopted the attitude “ if you can beat ‘ em , join ‘ em . ” both edeka and rewe have entered the discount fray with their own dedicated chains .
consultant eggert said he expects the newly merged plus and netto discount stores , owned by edeka , will emerge as a major challenger to aldi and lidl . a threat to diversity ? the increased competition could lead to even greater price pressure on suppliers , warns matthias horst , president of the federation of german food and drink industries -lrb- bve -rrb- .
“ we can see that the last round of price cuts has n't really done anything for aldi and lidl , ” he said . “ we are concerned about the negative impact that these endless price wars could have on the some 5,000 food suppliers in germany .
many of them may no longer be able to meet the conditions of the big discounters .
there could be consolidation and we could lose the rich diversity we currently have in the supplier sector . ” the new discounters do n't seem to be too worried as they scramble for market share in germany .
nor do the established giants aldi and lidl ; as they continue to slug it out and try to stay ahead of the newcomers by expanding outside the country , where they face not only less competition but also fatter sales margins . for sure , german discounters are providing consumers – for better or for worse – plenty of food for thought . author : john blau editor : sam edmonds send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but new research suggests the price war may soon end as the chains exhaust opportunities for domestic growth . according to german market researcher gfk , lidl was able to increase its share of the country 's 150-billion-euro food market by only 0.1 percent in 2009 to 9.8 percent .
archrival aldi was hit even harder : the discounter saw its market share drop last year to 18.4 percent from 19 percent .
revenue was down four percent – perhaps the biggest sales dip in the company 's history . the reasons for the stagnation are n't just the economic and financial crisis , which has forced numerous consumers to spend less and spend wisely .
the discounters , which include penny and the newly merged plus and netto group , have squeezed prices for numerous fast-moving consumer products to record lows and expanded store networks massively in large and small cities alike .
there are fewer and fewer opportunities to achieve a competitive edge in both areas , according to gfk food retail specialist wolfgang twardawa . “ every household in germany is within 10 minutes of a discounter by car , ” twardawa said .
“ and just look at butter prices .
penny has lowered its price from 99 cents for a 250-gram package to 80 cents .
nobody in the production chain is going to make money at that price . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cheap milk helps aldi attracts customers " brutal food retail market " independent retail consultant ulrich eggert says germany “ is a brutal food retail market . ” food prices in the country , he notes , are 15 percent below the european average .
“ nowhere in europe can consumers buy food more cheaply than they can in germany , ” he said . not surprisingly , sales margins of german discounters are low .
market researcher twardawa puts them at between 1-2 percent .
the one exception , he said , is aldi , with margins believed to be around 4 percent .
by comparison , sales margins in the uk are between 6-7 percent . until now , german discounters have experienced only growth .
with more than 16,000 stores across the country , they currently control 46.4 percent of the country 's food market .
that growth is largely the result of aggressive pricing .
aldi was the first grocer to feature rock-bottom pricing by offering a limited inventory and squeezing out all necessary costs , from butcher shops to fancy displays .
around 15 years later , lidl entered the market with a similar strategy . supermarkets under pressure much of the discounters ' growth has come at the expense of german supermarkets , in particular edeka and rewe .
both , however , have pursued a dual-pronged strategy to counter the competition . on the one hand , they have sought to win back customers willing to spend a little more money with service , ambience and a broad assortment of high-quality products , including fresh produce .
and they appear to be succeeding : their market share in 2009 rose slightly for the first time in years to 23.7 percent , according to gfk . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : supermarkets like rewe offer a wider product range than the discounters on the other hand , with an eye to consumers who need to spend even less , the two supermarkets have adopted the attitude “ if you can beat ‘ em , join ‘ em . ” both edeka and rewe have entered the discount fray with their own dedicated chains .
consultant eggert said he expects the newly merged plus and netto discount stores , owned by edeka , will emerge as a major challenger to aldi and lidl . a threat to diversity ? the increased competition could lead to even greater price pressure on suppliers , warns matthias horst , president of the federation of german food and drink industries -lrb- bve -rrb- .
“ we can see that the last round of price cuts has n't really done anything for aldi and lidl , ” he said . “ we are concerned about the negative impact that these endless price wars could have on the some 5,000 food suppliers in germany .
many of them may no longer be able to meet the conditions of the big discounters .
there could be consolidation and we could lose the rich diversity we currently have in the supplier sector . ” the new discounters do n't seem to be too worried as they scramble for market share in germany .
nor do the established giants aldi and lidl ; as they continue to slug it out and try to stay ahead of the newcomers by expanding outside the country , where they face not only less competition but also fatter sales margins . for sure , german discounters are providing consumers – for better or for worse – plenty of food for thought . author : john blau editor : sam edmonds send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

following a meeting with greek prime minister george papandreou , westerwelle expressed germany 's support for the efforts of the greek government .
" i 'm convinced that these consolidation , reform , and growth programs deserve a chance and they will work , " westerwelle said .
" and that 's the reason i 'm here : we 're standing by greece . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greece is struggling with a mountain of debt however , last week the german government made a point of flatly rejecting any direct fiscal aid to finance the greek deficit .
german finance minister , wolfgang schaeuble , has insisted that the 16 eurozone countries were not obliged to bail out greece from its financial troubles .
eu heaping pressure on greece athens is feeling the heat from the european union and has seen its credit rating downgraded by all three major rating agencies .
the european commission is expected to make an official announcement about the greek deficit on wednesday , but said already on monday that greece 's plans to tackle its mountain of debt were " achievable . "
it warned however that " additional measures " were necessary .
eu commission spokeswoman , amelia torres , said greece would likely be given four months to reach " very precise objectives " under close surveillance by brussels .
early last year , the eu commission launched disciplinary action against greece because it had allowed its deficit to exceed the eu limit of three percent of gross domestic product , and it has since complained that the greek government has taken no effective steps to rein in its deficit . however , greek finance minister george papaconstantinou said the problem was not unique to his country . " following greece , there are other countries , like spain and portugal -lsb- in a similar situation -rsb- , " said papaconstantinou at an economic conference in athens on tuesday .
" this is why the greek issue , despite its particular greek characteristics , is also a euro zone issue .

idealists say its focus should be on artists , not revenue .
but can talent alone keep the industry afloat ? among the first to go digital , the music industry is now scrambling for creative strategies to keep up with web pirates and illegal downloaders .
in the meantime , some analysts in the sector are banking on live performance as the ticket to success - after all , the " live experience " ca n't be digitized . there may be a broad spectrum of revenue-protecting strategies out there , but many experts on the stage and behind it agree on one thing : going back to the basics - that is , finding and developing good artists - is the only sure-fire way to weather the storm and promote growth . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lieberberg has been in the live music business for 40 years " i think the state of the industry currently is worse than it ever was , " concert organizer marek lieberberg said recently at midem , the industry 's largest international congress in cannes , france . lieberberg founded his frankfurt-based agency more than 40 years ago .
it focuses on open air festivals and organizes some of europe 's most popular events , including rock am ring at the nuerburgring race track and rock im park in nuremberg . the most recent statistics available from the federal association for the german music industry show that sales suffered a setback of 4.7 percent in 2008 , and have fallen 41 percent since 1999 . " i think the major malfunction is that record companies have a real problem finding the acts , " added lieberberg .
" the talent has dried out and it needs to be redeveloped . " bildunterschrift : rock am ring is one of germany 's biggest live music events internet is not enough while some industry observers thought for a while that the internet could serve as a do-it-yourself talent filter with sites like myspace.com , that seems to be a short-lived dream . " if you look around the world , maybe there are not even half a dozen bands or artists who have really achieved fame , just by emerging from the internet , " said edgar berger , ceo of sony music gsa -lrb- germany , switzerland and austria -rrb- . in germany , unlike in the us , people still buy compact discs , according to berger .
in 2008 , cds accoutned for 81 percent of music sold in germany - a level that has been stable for the past five years , according to the federal association for the german music industry .
clearly , the cd album is still high on the agendas of german music executives . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans music lovers have proven more loyal to the cd than their us counterparts germany accounts for 6.6 percent of global music sales and is therefore the world 's fourth largest music market . it comes in behind the us -lrb- with 36.2 percent -rrb- , japan -lrb- 16.6 percent -rrb- and great britain -lrb- 10.2 percent -rrb- . back to the roots both berger and lieberberg argued that it is not just the responsibility of that industry to get back to its roots - that is , the artists and their music - but also its ticket to survival in unstable economic times . " it 's the bigger companies that are investing significant amounts of money in new talents , " said berger .
he added that mergers within the industry - including the one announced just last week in the us between the world 's largest concert promoter live nation and ticketmaster - could lead to a kind of " renaissance . " with turnovers of 110 million euros -lrb- $ 153 million -rrb- and nearly 300 million euros last year respectively , however , the marek lieberberg concert agency and sony music gsa are indeed speaking from privileged positions and have the resources to take risks on new talent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berger predicted that the finance crisis would affect music consumers ' choices this year " we have to bring back music into the minds and into the hearts of the people , " said lieberberg .
" what i was raised on was music being a trigger for the liberation of society .

but new research suggests the price war may soon end as the chains exhaust opportunities for domestic growth . according to german market researcher gfk , lidl was able to increase its share of the country 's 150-billion-euro food market by only 0.1 percent in 2009 to 9.8 percent .
archrival aldi was hit even harder : the discounter saw its market share drop last year to 18.4 percent from 19 percent .
revenue was down four percent – perhaps the biggest sales dip in the company 's history . the reasons for the stagnation are n't just the economic and financial crisis , which has forced numerous consumers to spend less and spend wisely .
the discounters , which include penny and the newly merged plus and netto group , have squeezed prices for numerous fast-moving consumer products to record lows and expanded store networks massively in large and small cities alike .
there are fewer and fewer opportunities to achieve a competitive edge in both areas , according to gfk food retail specialist wolfgang twardawa . “ every household in germany is within 10 minutes of a discounter by car , ” twardawa said .
“ and just look at butter prices .
penny has lowered its price from 99 cents for a 250-gram package to 80 cents .
nobody in the production chain is going to make money at that price . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cheap milk helps aldi attracts customers " brutal food retail market " independent retail consultant ulrich eggert says germany “ is a brutal food retail market . ” food prices in the country , he notes , are 15 percent below the european average .
“ nowhere in europe can consumers buy food more cheaply than they can in germany , ” he said . not surprisingly , sales margins of german discounters are low .
market researcher twardawa puts them at between 1-2 percent .
the one exception , he said , is aldi , with margins believed to be around 4 percent .
by comparison , sales margins in the uk are between 6-7 percent . until now , german discounters have experienced only growth .
with more than 16,000 stores across the country , they currently control 46.4 percent of the country 's food market .
that growth is largely the result of aggressive pricing .
aldi was the first grocer to feature rock-bottom pricing by offering a limited inventory and squeezing out all necessary costs , from butcher shops to fancy displays .
around 15 years later , lidl entered the market with a similar strategy . supermarkets under pressure much of the discounters ' growth has come at the expense of german supermarkets , in particular edeka and rewe .
both , however , have pursued a dual-pronged strategy to counter the competition . on the one hand , they have sought to win back customers willing to spend a little more money with service , ambience and a broad assortment of high-quality products , including fresh produce .
and they appear to be succeeding : their market share in 2009 rose slightly for the first time in years to 23.7 percent , according to gfk . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : supermarkets like rewe offer a wider product range than the discounters on the other hand , with an eye to consumers who need to spend even less , the two supermarkets have adopted the attitude “ if you can beat ‘ em , join ‘ em . ” both edeka and rewe have entered the discount fray with their own dedicated chains .
consultant eggert said he expects the newly merged plus and netto discount stores , owned by edeka , will emerge as a major challenger to aldi and lidl . a threat to diversity ? the increased competition could lead to even greater price pressure on suppliers , warns matthias horst , president of the federation of german food and drink industries -lrb- bve -rrb- .
“ we can see that the last round of price cuts has n't really done anything for aldi and lidl , ” he said . “ we are concerned about the negative impact that these endless price wars could have on the some 5,000 food suppliers in germany .
many of them may no longer be able to meet the conditions of the big discounters .
there could be consolidation and we could lose the rich diversity we currently have in the supplier sector . ” the new discounters do n't seem to be too worried as they scramble for market share in germany .
nor do the established giants aldi and lidl ; as they continue to slug it out and try to stay ahead of the newcomers by expanding outside the country , where they face not only less competition but also fatter sales margins . for sure , german discounters are providing consumers – for better or for worse – plenty of food for thought . author : john blau editor : sam edmonds send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but new research suggests the price war may soon end as the chains exhaust opportunities for domestic growth . according to german market researcher gfk , lidl was able to increase its share of the country 's 150-billion-euro food market by only 0.1 percent in 2009 to 9.8 percent .
archrival aldi was hit even harder : the discounter saw its market share drop last year to 18.4 percent from 19 percent .
revenue was down four percent – perhaps the biggest sales dip in the company 's history . the reasons for the stagnation are n't just the economic and financial crisis , which has forced numerous consumers to spend less and spend wisely .
the discounters , which include penny and the newly merged plus and netto group , have squeezed prices for numerous fast-moving consumer products to record lows and expanded store networks massively in large and small cities alike .
there are fewer and fewer opportunities to achieve a competitive edge in both areas , according to gfk food retail specialist wolfgang twardawa . “ every household in germany is within 10 minutes of a discounter by car , ” twardawa said .
“ and just look at butter prices .
penny has lowered its price from 99 cents for a 250-gram package to 80 cents .
nobody in the production chain is going to make money at that price . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cheap milk helps aldi attracts customers " brutal food retail market " independent retail consultant ulrich eggert says germany “ is a brutal food retail market . ” food prices in the country , he notes , are 15 percent below the european average .
“ nowhere in europe can consumers buy food more cheaply than they can in germany , ” he said . not surprisingly , sales margins of german discounters are low .
market researcher twardawa puts them at between 1-2 percent .
the one exception , he said , is aldi , with margins believed to be around 4 percent .
by comparison , sales margins in the uk are between 6-7 percent . until now , german discounters have experienced only growth .
with more than 16,000 stores across the country , they currently control 46.4 percent of the country 's food market .
that growth is largely the result of aggressive pricing .
aldi was the first grocer to feature rock-bottom pricing by offering a limited inventory and squeezing out all necessary costs , from butcher shops to fancy displays .
around 15 years later , lidl entered the market with a similar strategy . supermarkets under pressure much of the discounters ' growth has come at the expense of german supermarkets , in particular edeka and rewe .
both , however , have pursued a dual-pronged strategy to counter the competition . on the one hand , they have sought to win back customers willing to spend a little more money with service , ambience and a broad assortment of high-quality products , including fresh produce .
and they appear to be succeeding : their market share in 2009 rose slightly for the first time in years to 23.7 percent , according to gfk . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : supermarkets like rewe offer a wider product range than the discounters on the other hand , with an eye to consumers who need to spend even less , the two supermarkets have adopted the attitude “ if you can beat ‘ em , join ‘ em . ” both edeka and rewe have entered the discount fray with their own dedicated chains .
consultant eggert said he expects the newly merged plus and netto discount stores , owned by edeka , will emerge as a major challenger to aldi and lidl . a threat to diversity ? the increased competition could lead to even greater price pressure on suppliers , warns matthias horst , president of the federation of german food and drink industries -lrb- bve -rrb- .
“ we can see that the last round of price cuts has n't really done anything for aldi and lidl , ” he said . “ we are concerned about the negative impact that these endless price wars could have on the some 5,000 food suppliers in germany .
many of them may no longer be able to meet the conditions of the big discounters .
there could be consolidation and we could lose the rich diversity we currently have in the supplier sector . ” the new discounters do n't seem to be too worried as they scramble for market share in germany .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de retail -pipe- 02.02.2010 german discount grocers struggle to sustain growth großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lidl is trying to steal market share from aldi with bargain-basement prices german food prices are the lowest in europe thanks to fierce competition from discounters like aldi and lidl .
but new research suggests the price war may soon end as the chains exhaust opportunities for domestic growth . according to german market researcher gfk , lidl was able to increase its share of the country 's 150-billion-euro food market by only 0.1 percent in 2009 to 9.8 percent .
archrival aldi was hit even harder : the discounter saw its market share drop last year to 18.4 percent from 19 percent .
revenue was down four percent – perhaps the biggest sales dip in the company 's history . the reasons for the stagnation are n't just the economic and financial crisis , which has forced numerous consumers to spend less and spend wisely .
the discounters , which include penny and the newly merged plus and netto group , have squeezed prices for numerous fast-moving consumer products to record lows and expanded store networks massively in large and small cities alike .
there are fewer and fewer opportunities to achieve a competitive edge in both areas , according to gfk food retail specialist wolfgang twardawa . “ every household in germany is within 10 minutes of a discounter by car , ” twardawa said .
“ and just look at butter prices .
penny has lowered its price from 99 cents for a 250-gram package to 80 cents .
nobody in the production chain is going to make money at that price . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cheap milk helps aldi attracts customers " brutal food retail market " independent retail consultant ulrich eggert says germany “ is a brutal food retail market . ” food prices in the country , he notes , are 15 percent below the european average .
“ nowhere in europe can consumers buy food more cheaply than they can in germany , ” he said . not surprisingly , sales margins of german discounters are low .
market researcher twardawa puts them at between 1-2 percent .
the one exception , he said , is aldi , with margins believed to be around 4 percent .
by comparison , sales margins in the uk are between 6-7 percent . until now , german discounters have experienced only growth .
with more than 16,000 stores across the country , they currently control 46.4 percent of the country 's food market .
that growth is largely the result of aggressive pricing .
aldi was the first grocer to feature rock-bottom pricing by offering a limited inventory and squeezing out all necessary costs , from butcher shops to fancy displays .
around 15 years later , lidl entered the market with a similar strategy . supermarkets under pressure much of the discounters ' growth has come at the expense of german supermarkets , in particular edeka and rewe .
both , however , have pursued a dual-pronged strategy to counter the competition . on the one hand , they have sought to win back customers willing to spend a little more money with service , ambience and a broad assortment of high-quality products , including fresh produce .
and they appear to be succeeding : their market share in 2009 rose slightly for the first time in years to 23.7 percent , according to gfk . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : supermarkets like rewe offer a wider product range than the discounters on the other hand , with an eye to consumers who need to spend even less , the two supermarkets have adopted the attitude “ if you can beat ‘ em , join ‘ em . ” both edeka and rewe have entered the discount fray with their own dedicated chains .
consultant eggert said he expects the newly merged plus and netto discount stores , owned by edeka , will emerge as a major challenger to aldi and lidl . a threat to diversity ? the increased competition could lead to even greater price pressure on suppliers , warns matthias horst , president of the federation of german food and drink industries -lrb- bve -rrb- .
“ we can see that the last round of price cuts has n't really done anything for aldi and lidl , ” he said . “ we are concerned about the negative impact that these endless price wars could have on the some 5,000 food suppliers in germany .
many of them may no longer be able to meet the conditions of the big discounters .
there could be consolidation and we could lose the rich diversity we currently have in the supplier sector . ” the new discounters do n't seem to be too worried as they scramble for market share in germany .
nor do the established giants aldi and lidl ; as they continue to slug it out and try to stay ahead of the newcomers by expanding outside the country , where they face not only less competition but also fatter sales margins . for sure , german discounters are providing consumers – for better or for worse – plenty of food for thought . author : john blau editor : sam edmonds send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

at 80 , he 's been awarded the sonning prize , denmark 's most respected literary award . enzensberg on tuesday received the 2010 sonning prize at a ceremony in copenhagen .
the biennial prize , which is intended to honor work that benefits european culture , is worth 134,000 euros -lrb- $ 187,000 -rrb- . the bavarian-born writer has left " considerable footprints in literature , essays and journalism , " said copenhagen university , which has awarded the sonning prize since 1950 . born on november 11 , 1929 , in kaufbeuren , enzensberger grew up in the southern german city of nuremberg , where the nazis regularly held their conventions .
at a young age , he witnessed the rise and fall of the third reich and the victory of the allies - experiences which would leave an impression on him . after the second world war , enzensberger was employed as an interpreter for american soldiers ; studied philosophy and literature in germany and france and lived for a time in norway .
later , he worked as a radio journalist , a dramatist and a college lecturer . a prominent figure in the 1968 student movement , enzensberger published an influential magazine , kursbuch , which became a kind of cult publication among young revolutionaries . a say in every debate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : enzensberger is pictured with guenter grass and peter ruehmkorf , who were also members of gruppe 47 by that time he had already established himself as a successful writer .
he was welcomed into the politically and culturally influential literary society " gruppe 47 " early on and was awarded the buechner prize in 1963 . later , however , the writer distanced himself from the radical politics of the 1968 movement and became a vocal critic of what he called the " linker gemütlichkeit " -lrb- roughly , " comfortable left " -rrb- , as the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung wrote in the late 1980s . even in recent years , enzensberger has remained both outspoken and prolific .
he made headlines in 2003 by publically defending the invasion of iraq , comparing the iraqi dictator saddam hussein to adolf hitler . and in the last two years alone , he published a children 's book , " bibs , " two essays and a piece of prose entitled " the silences of hammerstein . "
the latter is a partly fictional , partly factual account of a real-life nazi general and the few who refused to share in the party 's spoils . enzensberger joins a long line of prestigious sonning prize winners , including winston churchill -lrb- 1950 -rrb- , theologian karl barth -lrb- 1963 -rrb- , publicist hannah arendt -lrb- 1975 -rrb- , philosopher juergen habermas -lrb- 1987 -rrb- and writer guenter grass -lrb- 1996 -rrb- . click on the links below to read samples of enzensberger 's work in english . kjb / dpad / epd / kna / ap editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

polish authorities have already arrested five local men in the case , but they have previously identified hoegstroem as the mastermind behind the theft .
the european arrest warrant obliges any european union member state to hand over hoegstroem within 90 days of his arrest . the measure replaces the traditional extradition process , which in the past could take years of legal stalling . the measure has been on the eu books since 2005 , but this is throught to be the first major case in which it is being put to use .
theft sparked outrage the five-meter -lrb- 16 feet -rrb- wrought iron sign - the german words on which translate as " work sets you free " - was stolen in december from above the gate to the concentration camp .
the sign , a worldwide symbol of the atrocities of nazi germany , was later found by police cut into three pieces . the theft of the sign sparked international outrage , especially in israel .
up to 1.5 million people , mostly jews , died at auschwitz during nazi germany 's occupation of poland in world war ii .

at 80 , he 's been awarded the sonning prize , denmark 's most respected literary award . enzensberg on tuesday received the 2010 sonning prize at a ceremony in copenhagen .
the biennial prize , which is intended to honor work that benefits european culture , is worth 134,000 euros -lrb- $ 187,000 -rrb- . the bavarian-born writer has left " considerable footprints in literature , essays and journalism , " said copenhagen university , which has awarded the sonning prize since 1950 . born on november 11 , 1929 , in kaufbeuren , enzensberger grew up in the southern german city of nuremberg , where the nazis regularly held their conventions .
at a young age , he witnessed the rise and fall of the third reich and the victory of the allies - experiences which would leave an impression on him . after the second world war , enzensberger was employed as an interpreter for american soldiers ; studied philosophy and literature in germany and france and lived for a time in norway .

he made headlines in 2003 by publically defending the invasion of iraq , comparing the iraqi dictator saddam hussein to adolf hitler . and in the last two years alone , he published a children 's book , " bibs , " two essays and a piece of prose entitled " the silences of hammerstein . "
the latter is a partly fictional , partly factual account of a real-life nazi general and the few who refused to share in the party 's spoils . enzensberger joins a long line of prestigious sonning prize winners , including winston churchill -lrb- 1950 -rrb- , theologian karl barth -lrb- 1963 -rrb- , publicist hannah arendt -lrb- 1975 -rrb- , philosopher juergen habermas -lrb- 1987 -rrb- and writer guenter grass -lrb- 1996 -rrb- . click on the links below to read samples of enzensberger 's work in english . kjb / dpad / epd / kna / ap editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

polish authorities have already arrested five local men in the case , but they have previously identified hoegstroem as the mastermind behind the theft .
the european arrest warrant obliges any european union member state to hand over hoegstroem within 90 days of his arrest . the measure replaces the traditional extradition process , which in the past could take years of legal stalling . the measure has been on the eu books since 2005 , but this is throught to be the first major case in which it is being put to use .
theft sparked outrage the five-meter -lrb- 16 feet -rrb- wrought iron sign - the german words on which translate as " work sets you free " - was stolen in december from above the gate to the concentration camp .
the sign , a worldwide symbol of the atrocities of nazi germany , was later found by police cut into three pieces . the theft of the sign sparked international outrage , especially in israel .
up to 1.5 million people , mostly jews , died at auschwitz during nazi germany 's occupation of poland in world war ii .
the recovered sign is now being repaired . a replica had to be put up last week at the ceremonies commemorating the 65th liberation of auschwitz by soviet troops . mm / afp / dpa / reuters editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de literature -pipe- 02.02.2010 german writer enzensberger receives prestigious danish award großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : enzensberger left his mark in nearly every genre hans magnus enzensberger , a german essayist and poet , is known for his outspoken views .
at 80 , he 's been awarded the sonning prize , denmark 's most respected literary award . enzensberg on tuesday received the 2010 sonning prize at a ceremony in copenhagen .
the biennial prize , which is intended to honor work that benefits european culture , is worth 134,000 euros -lrb- $ 187,000 -rrb- . the bavarian-born writer has left " considerable footprints in literature , essays and journalism , " said copenhagen university , which has awarded the sonning prize since 1950 . born on november 11 , 1929 , in kaufbeuren , enzensberger grew up in the southern german city of nuremberg , where the nazis regularly held their conventions .
at a young age , he witnessed the rise and fall of the third reich and the victory of the allies - experiences which would leave an impression on him . after the second world war , enzensberger was employed as an interpreter for american soldiers ; studied philosophy and literature in germany and france and lived for a time in norway .
later , he worked as a radio journalist , a dramatist and a college lecturer . a prominent figure in the 1968 student movement , enzensberger published an influential magazine , kursbuch , which became a kind of cult publication among young revolutionaries . a say in every debate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : enzensberger is pictured with guenter grass and peter ruehmkorf , who were also members of gruppe 47 by that time he had already established himself as a successful writer .
he was welcomed into the politically and culturally influential literary society " gruppe 47 " early on and was awarded the buechner prize in 1963 . later , however , the writer distanced himself from the radical politics of the 1968 movement and became a vocal critic of what he called the " linker gemütlichkeit " -lrb- roughly , " comfortable left " -rrb- , as the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung wrote in the late 1980s . even in recent years , enzensberger has remained both outspoken and prolific .

polish authorities have already arrested five local men in the case , but they have previously identified hoegstroem as the mastermind behind the theft .
the european arrest warrant obliges any european union member state to hand over hoegstroem within 90 days of his arrest . the measure replaces the traditional extradition process , which in the past could take years of legal stalling . the measure has been on the eu books since 2005 , but this is throught to be the first major case in which it is being put to use .
theft sparked outrage the five-meter -lrb- 16 feet -rrb- wrought iron sign - the german words on which translate as " work sets you free " - was stolen in december from above the gate to the concentration camp .
the sign , a worldwide symbol of the atrocities of nazi germany , was later found by police cut into three pieces . the theft of the sign sparked international outrage , especially in israel .
up to 1.5 million people , mostly jews , died at auschwitz during nazi germany 's occupation of poland in world war ii .
the recovered sign is now being repaired . a replica had to be put up last week at the ceremonies commemorating the 65th liberation of auschwitz by soviet troops . mm / afp / dpa / reuters editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

polish authorities have already arrested five local men in the case , but they have previously identified hoegstroem as the mastermind behind the theft .
the european arrest warrant obliges any european union member state to hand over hoegstroem within 90 days of his arrest . the measure replaces the traditional extradition process , which in the past could take years of legal stalling . the measure has been on the eu books since 2005 , but this is throught to be the first major case in which it is being put to use .
theft sparked outrage the five-meter -lrb- 16 feet -rrb- wrought iron sign - the german words on which translate as " work sets you free " - was stolen in december from above the gate to the concentration camp .
the sign , a worldwide symbol of the atrocities of nazi germany , was later found by police cut into three pieces . the theft of the sign sparked international outrage , especially in israel .
up to 1.5 million people , mostly jews , died at auschwitz during nazi germany 's occupation of poland in world war ii .
the recovered sign is now being repaired . a replica had to be put up last week at the ceremonies commemorating the 65th liberation of auschwitz by soviet troops . mm / afp / dpa / reuters editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

at 80 , he 's been awarded the sonning prize , denmark 's most respected literary award . enzensberg on tuesday received the 2010 sonning prize at a ceremony in copenhagen .
the biennial prize , which is intended to honor work that benefits european culture , is worth 134,000 euros -lrb- $ 187,000 -rrb- . the bavarian-born writer has left " considerable footprints in literature , essays and journalism , " said copenhagen university , which has awarded the sonning prize since 1950 . born on november 11 , 1929 , in kaufbeuren , enzensberger grew up in the southern german city of nuremberg , where the nazis regularly held their conventions .
at a young age , he witnessed the rise and fall of the third reich and the victory of the allies - experiences which would leave an impression on him . after the second world war , enzensberger was employed as an interpreter for american soldiers ; studied philosophy and literature in germany and france and lived for a time in norway .
later , he worked as a radio journalist , a dramatist and a college lecturer . a prominent figure in the 1968 student movement , enzensberger published an influential magazine , kursbuch , which became a kind of cult publication among young revolutionaries . a say in every debate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : enzensberger is pictured with guenter grass and peter ruehmkorf , who were also members of gruppe 47 by that time he had already established himself as a successful writer .
he was welcomed into the politically and culturally influential literary society " gruppe 47 " early on and was awarded the buechner prize in 1963 . later , however , the writer distanced himself from the radical politics of the 1968 movement and became a vocal critic of what he called the " linker gemütlichkeit " -lrb- roughly , " comfortable left " -rrb- , as the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung wrote in the late 1980s . even in recent years , enzensberger has remained both outspoken and prolific .
he made headlines in 2003 by publically defending the invasion of iraq , comparing the iraqi dictator saddam hussein to adolf hitler . and in the last two years alone , he published a children 's book , " bibs , " two essays and a piece of prose entitled " the silences of hammerstein . "
the latter is a partly fictional , partly factual account of a real-life nazi general and the few who refused to share in the party 's spoils . enzensberger joins a long line of prestigious sonning prize winners , including winston churchill -lrb- 1950 -rrb- , theologian karl barth -lrb- 1963 -rrb- , publicist hannah arendt -lrb- 1975 -rrb- , philosopher juergen habermas -lrb- 1987 -rrb- and writer guenter grass -lrb- 1996 -rrb- . click on the links below to read samples of enzensberger 's work in english . kjb / dpad / epd / kna / ap editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the " sauerland cell , " uncovered and arrested in 2007 , was germany 's first example of home-grown islamist terrorism . the geman-born leader of the so-called sauerland cell , fritz gelowicz , showed germany that islamist terror was a problem in its own back yard .
the 30-year-old islam convert and his three accomplices , german daniel schneider , turkish-german attila selek , and turk adem yilmaz were captured in the west german region of sauerland in 2007 , with vast stockpiles of hydrogen peroxide , suitable for making car bombs and other explosives .
they said they planned to attack us military targets based in germany , and that events in the so-called " war on terror " had motivated them to take up arms .
" my client said that this decision came in 2004 , " gelowicz 's lawyer dirk uden told the regional high court in dusseldorf .
he explained that the us arrest and torture of a dual nationality german-lebanese car dealer chalid el-masri – who was not involved in terrorist activity – was the main reason gelowicz decided to begin working for the islamic jihad union , a splinter terror group with its roots in uzbekistan .
" he saw the pictures of abu ghraib , the pictures from guantanamo bay , and especially the fate of chalid el-masri , which he heard about through personal connections before it became common knowledge , and these things really influenced him .
these events supported his decision to embark upon an armed jihad . "
historic plea bargain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this hydrogen peroxide was to be made into lethal bombs in exchange for shortened sentences , the group 's members agreed to discuss their plans , and their time at a terror training camp in pakistani region of waziristan , close to the afghan border .
" the confessions of the accused were the most comprehensive talks concerning terrorism ever heard in a german court of law , " the director of the institute of terrorism research and security policy in essen , rolf tophoven , told deutsche welle .
" they gave an exact description of what was going on in the terror training camps in pakistan . "
it 's unclear how the group will plead , but daniel schneider has indicated he will probably plead guilty on attempted murder charges for shooting at a policeman trying to arrest him , acknowledging that the skirmish could easily " have had a deadly ending . "
a final verdict in the trial , which has lasted roughly nine months so far , is expected in march .
terror concerns in germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daniel schneider has admitted to trying to kill a policeman there has not yet been a successful islamist terror attack in germany , however , experts concur that the country 's military engagement in afghanistan means it is considered a viable target .
" we are in the sights of islamists because of the 4,500 soldiers posted in afghanistan , and our other anti-terrorist operations , " said tophoven .
" from the point of view of the terrorists , there are good reasons to attack germany , and were an attack here ever to succeed , i am sure that the mission in afghanistan would be used as justification for it . "
tophoven also says it should come as no surprise that the sauerland cell was a home-grown organization , led by german converts to islam .
" a minority of converts to a new religion want to prove that they are tougher than the people born into the religion .
they want to establish themselves and prove their conviction in their new faith , and this can lead to extremism . "

the " sauerland cell , " uncovered and arrested in 2007 , was germany 's first example of home-grown islamist terrorism . the geman-born leader of the so-called sauerland cell , fritz gelowicz , showed germany that islamist terror was a problem in its own back yard .
the 30-year-old islam convert and his three accomplices , german daniel schneider , turkish-german attila selek , and turk adem yilmaz were captured in the west german region of sauerland in 2007 , with vast stockpiles of hydrogen peroxide , suitable for making car bombs and other explosives .
they said they planned to attack us military targets based in germany , and that events in the so-called " war on terror " had motivated them to take up arms .
" my client said that this decision came in 2004 , " gelowicz 's lawyer dirk uden told the regional high court in dusseldorf .
he explained that the us arrest and torture of a dual nationality german-lebanese car dealer chalid el-masri – who was not involved in terrorist activity – was the main reason gelowicz decided to begin working for the islamic jihad union , a splinter terror group with its roots in uzbekistan .
" he saw the pictures of abu ghraib , the pictures from guantanamo bay , and especially the fate of chalid el-masri , which he heard about through personal connections before it became common knowledge , and these things really influenced him .
these events supported his decision to embark upon an armed jihad . "
historic plea bargain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this hydrogen peroxide was to be made into lethal bombs in exchange for shortened sentences , the group 's members agreed to discuss their plans , and their time at a terror training camp in pakistani region of waziristan , close to the afghan border .
" the confessions of the accused were the most comprehensive talks concerning terrorism ever heard in a german court of law , " the director of the institute of terrorism research and security policy in essen , rolf tophoven , told deutsche welle .
" they gave an exact description of what was going on in the terror training camps in pakistan . "
it 's unclear how the group will plead , but daniel schneider has indicated he will probably plead guilty on attempted murder charges for shooting at a policeman trying to arrest him , acknowledging that the skirmish could easily " have had a deadly ending . "
a final verdict in the trial , which has lasted roughly nine months so far , is expected in march .
terror concerns in germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daniel schneider has admitted to trying to kill a policeman there has not yet been a successful islamist terror attack in germany , however , experts concur that the country 's military engagement in afghanistan means it is considered a viable target .
" we are in the sights of islamists because of the 4,500 soldiers posted in afghanistan , and our other anti-terrorist operations , " said tophoven .
" from the point of view of the terrorists , there are good reasons to attack germany , and were an attack here ever to succeed , i am sure that the mission in afghanistan would be used as justification for it . "
tophoven also says it should come as no surprise that the sauerland cell was a home-grown organization , led by german converts to islam .
" a minority of converts to a new religion want to prove that they are tougher than the people born into the religion .
they want to establish themselves and prove their conviction in their new faith , and this can lead to extremism . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de literature -pipe- 02.02.2010 german writer enzensberger receives prestigious danish award großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : enzensberger left his mark in nearly every genre hans magnus enzensberger , a german essayist and poet , is known for his outspoken views .
at 80 , he 's been awarded the sonning prize , denmark 's most respected literary award . enzensberg on tuesday received the 2010 sonning prize at a ceremony in copenhagen .
the biennial prize , which is intended to honor work that benefits european culture , is worth 134,000 euros -lrb- $ 187,000 -rrb- . the bavarian-born writer has left " considerable footprints in literature , essays and journalism , " said copenhagen university , which has awarded the sonning prize since 1950 . born on november 11 , 1929 , in kaufbeuren , enzensberger grew up in the southern german city of nuremberg , where the nazis regularly held their conventions .
at a young age , he witnessed the rise and fall of the third reich and the victory of the allies - experiences which would leave an impression on him . after the second world war , enzensberger was employed as an interpreter for american soldiers ; studied philosophy and literature in germany and france and lived for a time in norway .
later , he worked as a radio journalist , a dramatist and a college lecturer . a prominent figure in the 1968 student movement , enzensberger published an influential magazine , kursbuch , which became a kind of cult publication among young revolutionaries . a say in every debate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : enzensberger is pictured with guenter grass and peter ruehmkorf , who were also members of gruppe 47 by that time he had already established himself as a successful writer .
he was welcomed into the politically and culturally influential literary society " gruppe 47 " early on and was awarded the buechner prize in 1963 . later , however , the writer distanced himself from the radical politics of the 1968 movement and became a vocal critic of what he called the " linker gemütlichkeit " -lrb- roughly , " comfortable left " -rrb- , as the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung wrote in the late 1980s . even in recent years , enzensberger has remained both outspoken and prolific .
he made headlines in 2003 by publically defending the invasion of iraq , comparing the iraqi dictator saddam hussein to adolf hitler . and in the last two years alone , he published a children 's book , " bibs , " two essays and a piece of prose entitled " the silences of hammerstein . "
the latter is a partly fictional , partly factual account of a real-life nazi general and the few who refused to share in the party 's spoils . enzensberger joins a long line of prestigious sonning prize winners , including winston churchill -lrb- 1950 -rrb- , theologian karl barth -lrb- 1963 -rrb- , publicist hannah arendt -lrb- 1975 -rrb- , philosopher juergen habermas -lrb- 1987 -rrb- and writer guenter grass -lrb- 1996 -rrb- . click on the links below to read samples of enzensberger 's work in english . kjb / dpad / epd / kna / ap editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the " sauerland cell , " uncovered and arrested in 2007 , was germany 's first example of home-grown islamist terrorism . the geman-born leader of the so-called sauerland cell , fritz gelowicz , showed germany that islamist terror was a problem in its own back yard .
the 30-year-old islam convert and his three accomplices , german daniel schneider , turkish-german attila selek , and turk adem yilmaz were captured in the west german region of sauerland in 2007 , with vast stockpiles of hydrogen peroxide , suitable for making car bombs and other explosives .
they said they planned to attack us military targets based in germany , and that events in the so-called " war on terror " had motivated them to take up arms .
" my client said that this decision came in 2004 , " gelowicz 's lawyer dirk uden told the regional high court in dusseldorf .
he explained that the us arrest and torture of a dual nationality german-lebanese car dealer chalid el-masri – who was not involved in terrorist activity – was the main reason gelowicz decided to begin working for the islamic jihad union , a splinter terror group with its roots in uzbekistan .
" he saw the pictures of abu ghraib , the pictures from guantanamo bay , and especially the fate of chalid el-masri , which he heard about through personal connections before it became common knowledge , and these things really influenced him .
these events supported his decision to embark upon an armed jihad . "
historic plea bargain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this hydrogen peroxide was to be made into lethal bombs in exchange for shortened sentences , the group 's members agreed to discuss their plans , and their time at a terror training camp in pakistani region of waziristan , close to the afghan border .
" the confessions of the accused were the most comprehensive talks concerning terrorism ever heard in a german court of law , " the director of the institute of terrorism research and security policy in essen , rolf tophoven , told deutsche welle .
" they gave an exact description of what was going on in the terror training camps in pakistan . "
it 's unclear how the group will plead , but daniel schneider has indicated he will probably plead guilty on attempted murder charges for shooting at a policeman trying to arrest him , acknowledging that the skirmish could easily " have had a deadly ending . "
a final verdict in the trial , which has lasted roughly nine months so far , is expected in march .
terror concerns in germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daniel schneider has admitted to trying to kill a policeman there has not yet been a successful islamist terror attack in germany , however , experts concur that the country 's military engagement in afghanistan means it is considered a viable target .
" we are in the sights of islamists because of the 4,500 soldiers posted in afghanistan , and our other anti-terrorist operations , " said tophoven .
" from the point of view of the terrorists , there are good reasons to attack germany , and were an attack here ever to succeed , i am sure that the mission in afghanistan would be used as justification for it . "
tophoven also says it should come as no surprise that the sauerland cell was a home-grown organization , led by german converts to islam .
" a minority of converts to a new religion want to prove that they are tougher than the people born into the religion .
they want to establish themselves and prove their conviction in their new faith , and this can lead to extremism . "

the " sauerland cell , " uncovered and arrested in 2007 , was germany 's first example of home-grown islamist terrorism . the geman-born leader of the so-called sauerland cell , fritz gelowicz , showed germany that islamist terror was a problem in its own back yard .
the 30-year-old islam convert and his three accomplices , german daniel schneider , turkish-german attila selek , and turk adem yilmaz were captured in the west german region of sauerland in 2007 , with vast stockpiles of hydrogen peroxide , suitable for making car bombs and other explosives .
they said they planned to attack us military targets based in germany , and that events in the so-called " war on terror " had motivated them to take up arms .
" my client said that this decision came in 2004 , " gelowicz 's lawyer dirk uden told the regional high court in dusseldorf .
he explained that the us arrest and torture of a dual nationality german-lebanese car dealer chalid el-masri – who was not involved in terrorist activity – was the main reason gelowicz decided to begin working for the islamic jihad union , a splinter terror group with its roots in uzbekistan .
" he saw the pictures of abu ghraib , the pictures from guantanamo bay , and especially the fate of chalid el-masri , which he heard about through personal connections before it became common knowledge , and these things really influenced him .
these events supported his decision to embark upon an armed jihad . "

at 80 , he 's been awarded the sonning prize , denmark 's most respected literary award . enzensberg on tuesday received the 2010 sonning prize at a ceremony in copenhagen .
the biennial prize , which is intended to honor work that benefits european culture , is worth 134,000 euros -lrb- $ 187,000 -rrb- . the bavarian-born writer has left " considerable footprints in literature , essays and journalism , " said copenhagen university , which has awarded the sonning prize since 1950 . born on november 11 , 1929 , in kaufbeuren , enzensberger grew up in the southern german city of nuremberg , where the nazis regularly held their conventions .
at a young age , he witnessed the rise and fall of the third reich and the victory of the allies - experiences which would leave an impression on him . after the second world war , enzensberger was employed as an interpreter for american soldiers ; studied philosophy and literature in germany and france and lived for a time in norway .
later , he worked as a radio journalist , a dramatist and a college lecturer . a prominent figure in the 1968 student movement , enzensberger published an influential magazine , kursbuch , which became a kind of cult publication among young revolutionaries . a say in every debate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : enzensberger is pictured with guenter grass and peter ruehmkorf , who were also members of gruppe 47 by that time he had already established himself as a successful writer .
he was welcomed into the politically and culturally influential literary society " gruppe 47 " early on and was awarded the buechner prize in 1963 . later , however , the writer distanced himself from the radical politics of the 1968 movement and became a vocal critic of what he called the " linker gemütlichkeit " -lrb- roughly , " comfortable left " -rrb- , as the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung wrote in the late 1980s . even in recent years , enzensberger has remained both outspoken and prolific .
he made headlines in 2003 by publically defending the invasion of iraq , comparing the iraqi dictator saddam hussein to adolf hitler . and in the last two years alone , he published a children 's book , " bibs , " two essays and a piece of prose entitled " the silences of hammerstein . "
the latter is a partly fictional , partly factual account of a real-life nazi general and the few who refused to share in the party 's spoils . enzensberger joins a long line of prestigious sonning prize winners , including winston churchill -lrb- 1950 -rrb- , theologian karl barth -lrb- 1963 -rrb- , publicist hannah arendt -lrb- 1975 -rrb- , philosopher juergen habermas -lrb- 1987 -rrb- and writer guenter grass -lrb- 1996 -rrb- . click on the links below to read samples of enzensberger 's work in english . kjb / dpad / epd / kna / ap editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

idealists say its focus should be on artists , not revenue .
but can talent alone keep the industry afloat ? among the first to go digital , the music industry is now scrambling for creative strategies to keep up with web pirates and illegal downloaders .
in the meantime , some analysts in the sector are banking on live performance as the ticket to success - after all , the " live experience " ca n't be digitized . there may be a broad spectrum of revenue-protecting strategies out there , but many experts on the stage and behind it agree on one thing : going back to the basics - that is , finding and developing good artists - is the only sure-fire way to weather the storm and promote growth . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lieberberg has been in the live music business for 40 years " i think the state of the industry currently is worse than it ever was , " concert organizer marek lieberberg said recently at midem , the industry 's largest international congress in cannes , france . lieberberg founded his frankfurt-based agency more than 40 years ago .
it focuses on open air festivals and organizes some of europe 's most popular events , including rock am ring at the nuerburgring race track and rock im park in nuremberg . the most recent statistics available from the federal association for the german music industry show that sales suffered a setback of 4.7 percent in 2008 , and have fallen 41 percent since 1999 .

the two south asian neighbours india and pakistan have been at loggerheads since the partition of the subcontinent in 1947 .
the conflict over kashmir and militant attacks have fuelled animosity between them for a long time . after terrorists trained in pakistan wreaked havoc in mumbai during a three day assault in november 2008 , the media in both countries took a far more hawkish stance than their governments , whipping up nationalist sentiment and emotions .
the indian government , for instance , slammed the media and even threatened to restrict press freedoms .
now , however , a year on , the times of india and pakistan 's jang group have decided to take a different approach .
their initiative ' aman ki asha ' or ' hope for peace ' aims at spreading the message of peace by utilizing the strong common bonds of music , art and literature that both countries share .
the groups ' newspapers devoted their full first page to the topic on new year 's day this year .
since then the initiative has been a regular feature of their electronic and print output .
videos show the things that people love and cherish on both sides of the border .
' like brother and sister ' this has struck a chord with many people in the subcontinent .
sneh maria kovela is a pakistani woman now married to an indian man , but her visa for india was rejected on three occasions by the indian government . " india and pakistan are two different nations , but we are like brother and sister , " she says .
" everybody fights in their home but nobody wants to prolong the fight .
if we ca n't visit our neighbors , we are nothing . "
the media campaign , which includes exchange programs in different fields , is targeted at common people .
but , says ranjan roy , coordinator of the initiative from the times of india , it will also put pressure on delhi and islamabad to get back to the negotiating table .
he stresses that the initiative is not affecting the way his paper covers news on a daily basis : " this is not impinging on our news coverage .
this is very different from the way we cover the day to day news . "
he says there could be further initiatives in the future like building up a news pool to share content .
at the moment , the state of diplomatic ties between the two countries does not allow either side to have full time correspondents on the other side of the mutual border .
a ' publicity blitz ' ? but critics in india and pakistan say the initiative is all just a big publicity campaign .
seema mustafa , a reputed commentator on political affairs from india , says it is hard to believe that the two media organisations , which have a record of jingoism , are now suddenly gearing up for a peace initiative : " obviously this has n't come from the media houses .
this has been delivered to them as part of what washington , new delhi and islamabad hope will be a big publicity blitz , under which they can then promote peace or at least talk of peace , while america focuses on the afghanistan-pakistan border . "
thousands of facebook followers but salima hashmi , a renowned painter and peace activist from lahore , is more upbeat .
she says the time has come for both the governments to find ways to bring peace in the subcontinent .
" both governments have been guilty in different parts of their respective countries of breeding people who use violence as a political weapon .
i think there must be a realisation that this is a common enemy . "
despite the criticism regarding the media-led peace initiative ' aman ki asha ' , facebook , the social networking site , records more than 8,000 followers on the project 's page .
this goes to show that a growing number of young people in india and pakistan sincerely want the media to make a positive contribution towards achieving a relaxation of tensions between the two countries .

the german clocked the third fastest lap time of 1min 12.947 sec behind brazilian ferrari driver felipe massa -lrb- 1:12.574 -rrb- and spaniard pedro de la rosa of sauber -lrb- 1:12.784 -rrb- . massa insisted on monday he felt no fear as he returned to the track for the first time after being seriously injured in an accident at last year 's hungarian grand prix .
massa suffered severe head injuries when he was struck by a spring that flew from another car during last july 's race .

" when i came into f1 , i was shocked in the first lap and i was extremely excited in the second .
it 's exactly the same today .
today i feel like a young boy that has a toy in his hand and just enjoys himself . "
schumacher also admitted it was a strange feeling to be lining up against his old ferrari team .
" yes , naturally i suddenly see my car , my old car , on the track and i 'm not sitting in it .
it 's a strange sensation , " he said .
mercedes took over the brawn gp team , with whom britain 's jenson button won the 2009 world drivers ' title , following the end of last season .
schumacher has now teamed up with former team owner ross brawn , the 55-year-old briton who was in schumacher 's pits for all seven of his world title wins - two at benetton and five at ferrari .
brawn is now responsible for making mercedes ' silver arrow car ready for the new season .

he has made no secret of his desire to win an eighth world drivers ' championship title for the german auto giant .
" i feel very good .
i have worked out very well .
i have prepared myself extremely precisely , " said schumacher , whose attempted return to formula one last year was hampered by a neck injury .

following a meeting with greek prime minister george papandreou , westerwelle expressed germany 's support for the efforts of the greek government .
" i 'm convinced that these consolidation , reform , and growth programs deserve a chance and they will work , " westerwelle said .
" and that 's the reason i 'm here : we 're standing by greece . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greece is struggling with a mountain of debt however , last week the german government made a point of flatly rejecting any direct fiscal aid to finance the greek deficit .
german finance minister , wolfgang schaeuble , has insisted that the 16 eurozone countries were not obliged to bail out greece from its financial troubles .
eu heaping pressure on greece athens is feeling the heat from the european union and has seen its credit rating downgraded by all three major rating agencies .
the european commission is expected to make an official announcement about the greek deficit on wednesday , but said already on monday that greece 's plans to tackle its mountain of debt were " achievable . "
it warned however that " additional measures " were necessary .
eu commission spokeswoman , amelia torres , said greece would likely be given four months to reach " very precise objectives " under close surveillance by brussels .
early last year , the eu commission launched disciplinary action against greece because it had allowed its deficit to exceed the eu limit of three percent of gross domestic product , and it has since complained that the greek government has taken no effective steps to rein in its deficit . however , greek finance minister george papaconstantinou said the problem was not unique to his country . " following greece , there are other countries , like spain and portugal -lsb- in a similar situation -rsb- , " said papaconstantinou at an economic conference in athens on tuesday .
" this is why the greek issue , despite its particular greek characteristics , is also a euro zone issue . " he pledged athens ' support to the idea of selling eurozone bonds as possible solution . greek pm outlines cost-cutting plans bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greece is n't alone : 20 out of 27 eu nations have deficits that are too high as the pressure mounts , greek prime minister george papandreou has said that his government was ready " to draw blood " to beat the corruption , waste and mismanagement responsible for the debt crisis .
he has outlined sweeping public sector cuts to bring greece 's deficit in line with eurozone requirements by 2013 , including a cut in welfare spending , tax reform , and a public sector wage freeze .
papandreou has also proposed major curbs on public hiring , a 10 percent cut in social security and a " significant reduction " in military spending .
on top of that , he has also called for a 90 percent tax on bank bonuses . twenty of the eu 's 27 member nations are currently running deficits above the three-percent threshold. mz / gb / dpa / ap / afp / reuters editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but new research suggests the price war may soon end as the chains exhaust opportunities for domestic growth . according to german market researcher gfk , lidl was able to increase its share of the country 's 150-billion-euro food market by only 0.1 percent in 2009 to 9.8 percent .
archrival aldi was hit even harder : the discounter saw its market share drop last year to 18.4 percent from 19 percent .
revenue was down four percent – perhaps the biggest sales dip in the company 's history . the reasons for the stagnation are n't just the economic and financial crisis , which has forced numerous consumers to spend less and spend wisely .
the discounters , which include penny and the newly merged plus and netto group , have squeezed prices for numerous fast-moving consumer products to record lows and expanded store networks massively in large and small cities alike .
there are fewer and fewer opportunities to achieve a competitive edge in both areas , according to gfk food retail specialist wolfgang twardawa . “ every household in germany is within 10 minutes of a discounter by car , ” twardawa said .
“ and just look at butter prices .
penny has lowered its price from 99 cents for a 250-gram package to 80 cents .
nobody in the production chain is going to make money at that price . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cheap milk helps aldi attracts customers " brutal food retail market " independent retail consultant ulrich eggert says germany “ is a brutal food retail market . ” food prices in the country , he notes , are 15 percent below the european average .
“ nowhere in europe can consumers buy food more cheaply than they can in germany , ” he said . not surprisingly , sales margins of german discounters are low .
market researcher twardawa puts them at between 1-2 percent .
the one exception , he said , is aldi , with margins believed to be around 4 percent .
by comparison , sales margins in the uk are between 6-7 percent . until now , german discounters have experienced only growth .
with more than 16,000 stores across the country , they currently control 46.4 percent of the country 's food market .
that growth is largely the result of aggressive pricing .
aldi was the first grocer to feature rock-bottom pricing by offering a limited inventory and squeezing out all necessary costs , from butcher shops to fancy displays .
around 15 years later , lidl entered the market with a similar strategy . supermarkets under pressure much of the discounters ' growth has come at the expense of german supermarkets , in particular edeka and rewe .
both , however , have pursued a dual-pronged strategy to counter the competition . on the one hand , they have sought to win back customers willing to spend a little more money with service , ambience and a broad assortment of high-quality products , including fresh produce .
and they appear to be succeeding : their market share in 2009 rose slightly for the first time in years to 23.7 percent , according to gfk . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : supermarkets like rewe offer a wider product range than the discounters on the other hand , with an eye to consumers who need to spend even less , the two supermarkets have adopted the attitude “ if you can beat ‘ em , join ‘ em . ” both edeka and rewe have entered the discount fray with their own dedicated chains .
consultant eggert said he expects the newly merged plus and netto discount stores , owned by edeka , will emerge as a major challenger to aldi and lidl . a threat to diversity ? the increased competition could lead to even greater price pressure on suppliers , warns matthias horst , president of the federation of german food and drink industries -lrb- bve -rrb- .
“ we can see that the last round of price cuts has n't really done anything for aldi and lidl , ” he said . “ we are concerned about the negative impact that these endless price wars could have on the some 5,000 food suppliers in germany .
many of them may no longer be able to meet the conditions of the big discounters .
there could be consolidation and we could lose the rich diversity we currently have in the supplier sector . ” the new discounters do n't seem to be too worried as they scramble for market share in germany .
nor do the established giants aldi and lidl ; as they continue to slug it out and try to stay ahead of the newcomers by expanding outside the country , where they face not only less competition but also fatter sales margins . for sure , german discounters are providing consumers – for better or for worse – plenty of food for thought . author : john blau editor : sam edmonds send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de music industry -pipe- 02.02.2010 germany 's flailing music industry seeks new talent großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : music consumption is up , says sony music battered by the economic crisis , digitization and piracy , the music industry is struggling to find new direction .
idealists say its focus should be on artists , not revenue .
but can talent alone keep the industry afloat ? among the first to go digital , the music industry is now scrambling for creative strategies to keep up with web pirates and illegal downloaders .
in the meantime , some analysts in the sector are banking on live performance as the ticket to success - after all , the " live experience " ca n't be digitized . there may be a broad spectrum of revenue-protecting strategies out there , but many experts on the stage and behind it agree on one thing : going back to the basics - that is , finding and developing good artists - is the only sure-fire way to weather the storm and promote growth . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lieberberg has been in the live music business for 40 years " i think the state of the industry currently is worse than it ever was , " concert organizer marek lieberberg said recently at midem , the industry 's largest international congress in cannes , france . lieberberg founded his frankfurt-based agency more than 40 years ago .
it focuses on open air festivals and organizes some of europe 's most popular events , including rock am ring at the nuerburgring race track and rock im park in nuremberg . the most recent statistics available from the federal association for the german music industry show that sales suffered a setback of 4.7 percent in 2008 , and have fallen 41 percent since 1999 . " i think the major malfunction is that record companies have a real problem finding the acts , " added lieberberg .
" the talent has dried out and it needs to be redeveloped . " bildunterschrift : rock am ring is one of germany 's biggest live music events internet is not enough while some industry observers thought for a while that the internet could serve as a do-it-yourself talent filter with sites like myspace.com , that seems to be a short-lived dream . " if you look around the world , maybe there are not even half a dozen bands or artists who have really achieved fame , just by emerging from the internet , " said edgar berger , ceo of sony music gsa -lrb- germany , switzerland and austria -rrb- . in germany , unlike in the us , people still buy compact discs , according to berger .
in 2008 , cds accoutned for 81 percent of music sold in germany - a level that has been stable for the past five years , according to the federal association for the german music industry .
clearly , the cd album is still high on the agendas of german music executives . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans music lovers have proven more loyal to the cd than their us counterparts germany accounts for 6.6 percent of global music sales and is therefore the world 's fourth largest music market . it comes in behind the us -lrb- with 36.2 percent -rrb- , japan -lrb- 16.6 percent -rrb- and great britain -lrb- 10.2 percent -rrb- . back to the roots both berger and lieberberg argued that it is not just the responsibility of that industry to get back to its roots - that is , the artists and their music - but also its ticket to survival in unstable economic times . " it 's the bigger companies that are investing significant amounts of money in new talents , " said berger .
he added that mergers within the industry - including the one announced just last week in the us between the world 's largest concert promoter live nation and ticketmaster - could lead to a kind of " renaissance . " with turnovers of 110 million euros -lrb- $ 153 million -rrb- and nearly 300 million euros last year respectively , however , the marek lieberberg concert agency and sony music gsa are indeed speaking from privileged positions and have the resources to take risks on new talent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berger predicted that the finance crisis would affect music consumers ' choices this year " we have to bring back music into the minds and into the hearts of the people , " said lieberberg .
" what i was raised on was music being a trigger for the liberation of society .
music was our release to dreams that we had - socially , politically , sexually .
all of this was triggered by music .
for us , music paved the way for a more liberal , a better life that awarded more rights to young people . " born in 1946 , the self-made impresario began his career in 1970 - on the heels of the 1968 student protests - with a concert by the who in muenster , germany . idealism or capitalism ? " we can not rule art in the same way we rule the rest of the economy , " said lieberberg .
but whether the search for the next chart-busting musician is more about art than profit remains to be seen . either way , music lovers in germany can still expect to find cds by the new stars , at least for a few more years . author : kate bowen editor : sam edmonds send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the two south asian neighbours india and pakistan have been at loggerheads since the partition of the subcontinent in 1947 .
the conflict over kashmir and militant attacks have fuelled animosity between them for a long time . after terrorists trained in pakistan wreaked havoc in mumbai during a three day assault in november 2008 , the media in both countries took a far more hawkish stance than their governments , whipping up nationalist sentiment and emotions .
the indian government , for instance , slammed the media and even threatened to restrict press freedoms .
now , however , a year on , the times of india and pakistan 's jang group have decided to take a different approach .
their initiative ' aman ki asha ' or ' hope for peace ' aims at spreading the message of peace by utilizing the strong common bonds of music , art and literature that both countries share .
the groups ' newspapers devoted their full first page to the topic on new year 's day this year .
since then the initiative has been a regular feature of their electronic and print output .
videos show the things that people love and cherish on both sides of the border .
' like brother and sister ' this has struck a chord with many people in the subcontinent .
sneh maria kovela is a pakistani woman now married to an indian man , but her visa for india was rejected on three occasions by the indian government . " india and pakistan are two different nations , but we are like brother and sister , " she says .
" everybody fights in their home but nobody wants to prolong the fight .
if we ca n't visit our neighbors , we are nothing . "
the media campaign , which includes exchange programs in different fields , is targeted at common people .
but , says ranjan roy , coordinator of the initiative from the times of india , it will also put pressure on delhi and islamabad to get back to the negotiating table .
he stresses that the initiative is not affecting the way his paper covers news on a daily basis : " this is not impinging on our news coverage .
this is very different from the way we cover the day to day news . "
he says there could be further initiatives in the future like building up a news pool to share content .
at the moment , the state of diplomatic ties between the two countries does not allow either side to have full time correspondents on the other side of the mutual border .
a ' publicity blitz ' ? but critics in india and pakistan say the initiative is all just a big publicity campaign .
seema mustafa , a reputed commentator on political affairs from india , says it is hard to believe that the two media organisations , which have a record of jingoism , are now suddenly gearing up for a peace initiative : " obviously this has n't come from the media houses .
this has been delivered to them as part of what washington , new delhi and islamabad hope will be a big publicity blitz , under which they can then promote peace or at least talk of peace , while america focuses on the afghanistan-pakistan border . "
thousands of facebook followers but salima hashmi , a renowned painter and peace activist from lahore , is more upbeat .
she says the time has come for both the governments to find ways to bring peace in the subcontinent .
" both governments have been guilty in different parts of their respective countries of breeding people who use violence as a political weapon .
i think there must be a realisation that this is a common enemy . "
despite the criticism regarding the media-led peace initiative ' aman ki asha ' , facebook , the social networking site , records more than 8,000 followers on the project 's page .
this goes to show that a growing number of young people in india and pakistan sincerely want the media to make a positive contribution towards achieving a relaxation of tensions between the two countries .

the move has been criticized by the opposition as a further curbing of freedom of speech and information under the authoritarian regime . belarusian president alexander lukashenko has signed an order to further monitor internet use in the country dubbed by critics as europe 's last dictatorship .

the move has been criticized by the opposition as a further curbing of freedom of speech and information under the authoritarian regime . belarusian president alexander lukashenko has signed an order to further monitor internet use in the country dubbed by critics as europe 's last dictatorship .
" to ensure the security of the state and it 's citizens , from july 1 , 2010 internet service providers will be required to identify devices used to connect to the internet and keep information on those devices and the services provided , " the new decree reads .
under the decree personal data and profiles of internet users will be collected and service providers can be asked to block access to any website within 24 hours .
the country 's authoritarian regime has justified its decision by quoting a need to " fight against everything illegal and to improve the security of the this country and its citizens . "
the country 's opposition has denounced the move as yet another attack on the freedom of speech and information designed to shut them out from any media access ahead of next year 's election .
' an enemy of the internet ' the move further tightens the government 's grip on communications in the country .
in january , lukashenko authorized an analysis center to define what information could be made available on the internet and to monitor traffic .
reporters without borders has strongly criticized the analysis center , saying the move would make the country " fall to the level of north korea and china … as an enemy of the internet . "
the internet has been a key source of information in belarus as most independent newspapers , television and radio stations have been closed down during lukashenko 's 15 years in power. ai / dpa / afp editor : rob turner send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but opel management says unions are twisting the figures as its parent company gm looks to secure government funding . opel 's european works council says general motors ' decision to restructure the german-based carmaker may require even more layoffs than previously expected . following a meeting with the company 's chief executive nick reilly , labor leaders said in a statement that the number of jobs at risk throughout europe is 2,000 higher than the 8,300 positions already on the chopping block .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opel ceo nick reilly wants a downsizing agreement by mid-february unions say germany and belgium are likely to be hit the hardest in terms of total number of cuts under the revised plan . some 4,800 people would be laid off in germany , including members of management , while the closure of the opel manufacturing plant in antwerp would cost another 2,600 jobs .
opel management has rejected the labor leaders ' criticism as unreasonable , arguing that the 2,000 ' additional ' losses were actually early retirement deals unrelated to restructuring efforts . a company spokesman told the german press agency dpa that opel was sticking to its original plan to cut 8,300 jobs across europe as it reduces production by 20 percent in response to weakened demand for vehicles .
looking for loans reuters news agency quoted labor leaders who said they learned in the meeting with reilly that opel no longer planned to reduce management costs by 35 percent and that , on the contrary , new management staff has been hired .
last week ceo reilly announced he wanted to reach an agreement with the works council by mid-february on a plan to help the carmaker shrink to a profitable size .
however , labor leaders have frozen negotiations with gm over the automaker 's proposal to make 265 million euros -lrb- $ 372.1 million -rrb- in annual wage cuts across the continent over the next five years , insisting that the antwerp plant should stay open .
gm has also asked for 2.7 billion euros in state aid in the form of either loans or loan guarantees to help finance the 3.3 billion euro revamp .
reilly said that all countries that host major opel manufacturing sites , with the exception of belgium , have indicated they remain open in principle to extending state funding .
opel is expected to submit a formal aid application to germany within the next few days , once the company obtains the required independent expert opinion on the viability of reilly 's plan .
reilly has said that opel currently has enough liquidity to operate " well into the second quarter . " mrm / reuters / dpa editor : sam edmonds send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de asia -pipe- 02.02.2010 media propagate ' hope for peace ' in south asia großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people-to-people contacts : indian sikhs on the way to pakistan the ' times of india ' and the pakistani ' jang ' group have come up with a peace initiative between india and pakistan - a first time the media have taken such a step .
the two south asian neighbours india and pakistan have been at loggerheads since the partition of the subcontinent in 1947 .
the conflict over kashmir and militant attacks have fuelled animosity between them for a long time . after terrorists trained in pakistan wreaked havoc in mumbai during a three day assault in november 2008 , the media in both countries took a far more hawkish stance than their governments , whipping up nationalist sentiment and emotions .
the indian government , for instance , slammed the media and even threatened to restrict press freedoms .
now , however , a year on , the times of india and pakistan 's jang group have decided to take a different approach .
their initiative ' aman ki asha ' or ' hope for peace ' aims at spreading the message of peace by utilizing the strong common bonds of music , art and literature that both countries share .
the groups ' newspapers devoted their full first page to the topic on new year 's day this year .
since then the initiative has been a regular feature of their electronic and print output .
videos show the things that people love and cherish on both sides of the border .
' like brother and sister ' this has struck a chord with many people in the subcontinent .
sneh maria kovela is a pakistani woman now married to an indian man , but her visa for india was rejected on three occasions by the indian government . " india and pakistan are two different nations , but we are like brother and sister , " she says .
" everybody fights in their home but nobody wants to prolong the fight .
if we ca n't visit our neighbors , we are nothing . "
the media campaign , which includes exchange programs in different fields , is targeted at common people .
but , says ranjan roy , coordinator of the initiative from the times of india , it will also put pressure on delhi and islamabad to get back to the negotiating table .
he stresses that the initiative is not affecting the way his paper covers news on a daily basis : " this is not impinging on our news coverage .
this is very different from the way we cover the day to day news . "
he says there could be further initiatives in the future like building up a news pool to share content .
at the moment , the state of diplomatic ties between the two countries does not allow either side to have full time correspondents on the other side of the mutual border .
a ' publicity blitz ' ? but critics in india and pakistan say the initiative is all just a big publicity campaign .
seema mustafa , a reputed commentator on political affairs from india , says it is hard to believe that the two media organisations , which have a record of jingoism , are now suddenly gearing up for a peace initiative : " obviously this has n't come from the media houses .
this has been delivered to them as part of what washington , new delhi and islamabad hope will be a big publicity blitz , under which they can then promote peace or at least talk of peace , while america focuses on the afghanistan-pakistan border . "
thousands of facebook followers but salima hashmi , a renowned painter and peace activist from lahore , is more upbeat .
she says the time has come for both the governments to find ways to bring peace in the subcontinent .
" both governments have been guilty in different parts of their respective countries of breeding people who use violence as a political weapon .
i think there must be a realisation that this is a common enemy . "
despite the criticism regarding the media-led peace initiative ' aman ki asha ' , facebook , the social networking site , records more than 8,000 followers on the project 's page .
this goes to show that a growing number of young people in india and pakistan sincerely want the media to make a positive contribution towards achieving a relaxation of tensions between the two countries .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de terrorism -pipe- 02.02.2010 prosecutors prepare closing arguments in major geman terror trial großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german fritz gelowicz led the " sauerland group " the trial of four men who planned attacks on us military targets in germany is drawing to an end .
the " sauerland cell , " uncovered and arrested in 2007 , was germany 's first example of home-grown islamist terrorism . the geman-born leader of the so-called sauerland cell , fritz gelowicz , showed germany that islamist terror was a problem in its own back yard .
the 30-year-old islam convert and his three accomplices , german daniel schneider , turkish-german attila selek , and turk adem yilmaz were captured in the west german region of sauerland in 2007 , with vast stockpiles of hydrogen peroxide , suitable for making car bombs and other explosives .
they said they planned to attack us military targets based in germany , and that events in the so-called " war on terror " had motivated them to take up arms .
" my client said that this decision came in 2004 , " gelowicz 's lawyer dirk uden told the regional high court in dusseldorf .
he explained that the us arrest and torture of a dual nationality german-lebanese car dealer chalid el-masri – who was not involved in terrorist activity – was the main reason gelowicz decided to begin working for the islamic jihad union , a splinter terror group with its roots in uzbekistan .
" he saw the pictures of abu ghraib , the pictures from guantanamo bay , and especially the fate of chalid el-masri , which he heard about through personal connections before it became common knowledge , and these things really influenced him .
these events supported his decision to embark upon an armed jihad . "
historic plea bargain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this hydrogen peroxide was to be made into lethal bombs in exchange for shortened sentences , the group 's members agreed to discuss their plans , and their time at a terror training camp in pakistani region of waziristan , close to the afghan border .
" the confessions of the accused were the most comprehensive talks concerning terrorism ever heard in a german court of law , " the director of the institute of terrorism research and security policy in essen , rolf tophoven , told deutsche welle .
" they gave an exact description of what was going on in the terror training camps in pakistan . "
it 's unclear how the group will plead , but daniel schneider has indicated he will probably plead guilty on attempted murder charges for shooting at a policeman trying to arrest him , acknowledging that the skirmish could easily " have had a deadly ending . "
a final verdict in the trial , which has lasted roughly nine months so far , is expected in march .
terror concerns in germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daniel schneider has admitted to trying to kill a policeman there has not yet been a successful islamist terror attack in germany , however , experts concur that the country 's military engagement in afghanistan means it is considered a viable target .
" we are in the sights of islamists because of the 4,500 soldiers posted in afghanistan , and our other anti-terrorist operations , " said tophoven .
" from the point of view of the terrorists , there are good reasons to attack germany , and were an attack here ever to succeed , i am sure that the mission in afghanistan would be used as justification for it . "
tophoven also says it should come as no surprise that the sauerland cell was a home-grown organization , led by german converts to islam .
" a minority of converts to a new religion want to prove that they are tougher than the people born into the religion .
they want to establish themselves and prove their conviction in their new faith , and this can lead to extremism . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de music industry -pipe- 02.02.2010 germany 's flailing music industry seeks new talent großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : music consumption is up , says sony music battered by the economic crisis , digitization and piracy , the music industry is struggling to find new direction .
idealists say its focus should be on artists , not revenue .
but can talent alone keep the industry afloat ? among the first to go digital , the music industry is now scrambling for creative strategies to keep up with web pirates and illegal downloaders .
in the meantime , some analysts in the sector are banking on live performance as the ticket to success - after all , the " live experience " ca n't be digitized . there may be a broad spectrum of revenue-protecting strategies out there , but many experts on the stage and behind it agree on one thing : going back to the basics - that is , finding and developing good artists - is the only sure-fire way to weather the storm and promote growth . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lieberberg has been in the live music business for 40 years " i think the state of the industry currently is worse than it ever was , " concert organizer marek lieberberg said recently at midem , the industry 's largest international congress in cannes , france . lieberberg founded his frankfurt-based agency more than 40 years ago .
it focuses on open air festivals and organizes some of europe 's most popular events , including rock am ring at the nuerburgring race track and rock im park in nuremberg . the most recent statistics available from the federal association for the german music industry show that sales suffered a setback of 4.7 percent in 2008 , and have fallen 41 percent since 1999 . " i think the major malfunction is that record companies have a real problem finding the acts , " added lieberberg .
" the talent has dried out and it needs to be redeveloped . " bildunterschrift : rock am ring is one of germany 's biggest live music events internet is not enough while some industry observers thought for a while that the internet could serve as a do-it-yourself talent filter with sites like myspace.com , that seems to be a short-lived dream . " if you look around the world , maybe there are not even half a dozen bands or artists who have really achieved fame , just by emerging from the internet , " said edgar berger , ceo of sony music gsa -lrb- germany , switzerland and austria -rrb- . in germany , unlike in the us , people still buy compact discs , according to berger .
in 2008 , cds accoutned for 81 percent of music sold in germany - a level that has been stable for the past five years , according to the federal association for the german music industry .
clearly , the cd album is still high on the agendas of german music executives . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans music lovers have proven more loyal to the cd than their us counterparts germany accounts for 6.6 percent of global music sales and is therefore the world 's fourth largest music market . it comes in behind the us -lrb- with 36.2 percent -rrb- , japan -lrb- 16.6 percent -rrb- and great britain -lrb- 10.2 percent -rrb- . back to the roots both berger and lieberberg argued that it is not just the responsibility of that industry to get back to its roots - that is , the artists and their music - but also its ticket to survival in unstable economic times . " it 's the bigger companies that are investing significant amounts of money in new talents , " said berger .
he added that mergers within the industry - including the one announced just last week in the us between the world 's largest concert promoter live nation and ticketmaster - could lead to a kind of " renaissance . " with turnovers of 110 million euros -lrb- $ 153 million -rrb- and nearly 300 million euros last year respectively , however , the marek lieberberg concert agency and sony music gsa are indeed speaking from privileged positions and have the resources to take risks on new talent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berger predicted that the finance crisis would affect music consumers ' choices this year " we have to bring back music into the minds and into the hearts of the people , " said lieberberg .
" what i was raised on was music being a trigger for the liberation of society .
music was our release to dreams that we had - socially , politically , sexually .
all of this was triggered by music .
for us , music paved the way for a more liberal , a better life that awarded more rights to young people . " born in 1946 , the self-made impresario began his career in 1970 - on the heels of the 1968 student protests - with a concert by the who in muenster , germany . idealism or capitalism ? " we can not rule art in the same way we rule the rest of the economy , " said lieberberg .
but whether the search for the next chart-busting musician is more about art than profit remains to be seen . either way , music lovers in germany can still expect to find cds by the new stars , at least for a few more years . author : kate bowen editor : sam edmonds send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

following a meeting with greek prime minister george papandreou , westerwelle expressed germany 's support for the efforts of the greek government .
" i 'm convinced that these consolidation , reform , and growth programs deserve a chance and they will work , " westerwelle said .
" and that 's the reason i 'm here : we 're standing by greece . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greece is struggling with a mountain of debt however , last week the german government made a point of flatly rejecting any direct fiscal aid to finance the greek deficit .
german finance minister , wolfgang schaeuble , has insisted that the 16 eurozone countries were not obliged to bail out greece from its financial troubles .
eu heaping pressure on greece athens is feeling the heat from the european union and has seen its credit rating downgraded by all three major rating agencies .
the european commission is expected to make an official announcement about the greek deficit on wednesday , but said already on monday that greece 's plans to tackle its mountain of debt were " achievable . "
it warned however that " additional measures " were necessary .
eu commission spokeswoman , amelia torres , said greece would likely be given four months to reach " very precise objectives " under close surveillance by brussels .
early last year , the eu commission launched disciplinary action against greece because it had allowed its deficit to exceed the eu limit of three percent of gross domestic product , and it has since complained that the greek government has taken no effective steps to rein in its deficit . however , greek finance minister george papaconstantinou said the problem was not unique to his country . " following greece , there are other countries , like spain and portugal -lsb- in a similar situation -rsb- , " said papaconstantinou at an economic conference in athens on tuesday .
" this is why the greek issue , despite its particular greek characteristics , is also a euro zone issue . " he pledged athens ' support to the idea of selling eurozone bonds as possible solution . greek pm outlines cost-cutting plans bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greece is n't alone : 20 out of 27 eu nations have deficits that are too high as the pressure mounts , greek prime minister george papandreou has said that his government was ready " to draw blood " to beat the corruption , waste and mismanagement responsible for the debt crisis .
he has outlined sweeping public sector cuts to bring greece 's deficit in line with eurozone requirements by 2013 , including a cut in welfare spending , tax reform , and a public sector wage freeze .
papandreou has also proposed major curbs on public hiring , a 10 percent cut in social security and a " significant reduction " in military spending .
on top of that , he has also called for a 90 percent tax on bank bonuses . twenty of the eu 's 27 member nations are currently running deficits above the three-percent threshold. mz / gb / dpa / ap / afp / reuters editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

following a meeting with greek prime minister george papandreou , westerwelle expressed germany 's support for the efforts of the greek government .

the european commission is expected to make an official announcement about the greek deficit on wednesday , but said already on monday that greece 's plans to tackle its mountain of debt were " achievable . "
it warned however that " additional measures " were necessary .
eu commission spokeswoman , amelia torres , said greece would likely be given four months to reach " very precise objectives " under close surveillance by brussels .
early last year , the eu commission launched disciplinary action against greece because it had allowed its deficit to exceed the eu limit of three percent of gross domestic product , and it has since complained that the greek government has taken no effective steps to rein in its deficit . however , greek finance minister george papaconstantinou said the problem was not unique to his country . " following greece , there are other countries , like spain and portugal -lsb- in a similar situation -rsb- , " said papaconstantinou at an economic conference in athens on tuesday .

he has outlined sweeping public sector cuts to bring greece 's deficit in line with eurozone requirements by 2013 , including a cut in welfare spending , tax reform , and a public sector wage freeze .
papandreou has also proposed major curbs on public hiring , a 10 percent cut in social security and a " significant reduction " in military spending .
on top of that , he has also called for a 90 percent tax on bank bonuses . twenty of the eu 's 27 member nations are currently running deficits above the three-percent threshold. mz / gb / dpa / ap / afp / reuters editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but new research suggests the price war may soon end as the chains exhaust opportunities for domestic growth . according to german market researcher gfk , lidl was able to increase its share of the country 's 150-billion-euro food market by only 0.1 percent in 2009 to 9.8 percent .
archrival aldi was hit even harder : the discounter saw its market share drop last year to 18.4 percent from 19 percent .
revenue was down four percent – perhaps the biggest sales dip in the company 's history . the reasons for the stagnation are n't just the economic and financial crisis , which has forced numerous consumers to spend less and spend wisely .
the discounters , which include penny and the newly merged plus and netto group , have squeezed prices for numerous fast-moving consumer products to record lows and expanded store networks massively in large and small cities alike .
there are fewer and fewer opportunities to achieve a competitive edge in both areas , according to gfk food retail specialist wolfgang twardawa . “ every household in germany is within 10 minutes of a discounter by car , ” twardawa said .
“ and just look at butter prices .
penny has lowered its price from 99 cents for a 250-gram package to 80 cents .
nobody in the production chain is going to make money at that price . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cheap milk helps aldi attracts customers " brutal food retail market " independent retail consultant ulrich eggert says germany “ is a brutal food retail market . ” food prices in the country , he notes , are 15 percent below the european average .
“ nowhere in europe can consumers buy food more cheaply than they can in germany , ” he said . not surprisingly , sales margins of german discounters are low .
market researcher twardawa puts them at between 1-2 percent .
the one exception , he said , is aldi , with margins believed to be around 4 percent .
by comparison , sales margins in the uk are between 6-7 percent . until now , german discounters have experienced only growth .
with more than 16,000 stores across the country , they currently control 46.4 percent of the country 's food market .
that growth is largely the result of aggressive pricing .
aldi was the first grocer to feature rock-bottom pricing by offering a limited inventory and squeezing out all necessary costs , from butcher shops to fancy displays .
around 15 years later , lidl entered the market with a similar strategy . supermarkets under pressure much of the discounters ' growth has come at the expense of german supermarkets , in particular edeka and rewe .
both , however , have pursued a dual-pronged strategy to counter the competition . on the one hand , they have sought to win back customers willing to spend a little more money with service , ambience and a broad assortment of high-quality products , including fresh produce .
and they appear to be succeeding : their market share in 2009 rose slightly for the first time in years to 23.7 percent , according to gfk . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : supermarkets like rewe offer a wider product range than the discounters on the other hand , with an eye to consumers who need to spend even less , the two supermarkets have adopted the attitude “ if you can beat ‘ em , join ‘ em . ” both edeka and rewe have entered the discount fray with their own dedicated chains .
consultant eggert said he expects the newly merged plus and netto discount stores , owned by edeka , will emerge as a major challenger to aldi and lidl . a threat to diversity ? the increased competition could lead to even greater price pressure on suppliers , warns matthias horst , president of the federation of german food and drink industries -lrb- bve -rrb- .
“ we can see that the last round of price cuts has n't really done anything for aldi and lidl , ” he said . “ we are concerned about the negative impact that these endless price wars could have on the some 5,000 food suppliers in germany .
many of them may no longer be able to meet the conditions of the big discounters .
there could be consolidation and we could lose the rich diversity we currently have in the supplier sector . ” the new discounters do n't seem to be too worried as they scramble for market share in germany .

but new research suggests the price war may soon end as the chains exhaust opportunities for domestic growth . according to german market researcher gfk , lidl was able to increase its share of the country 's 150-billion-euro food market by only 0.1 percent in 2009 to 9.8 percent .
archrival aldi was hit even harder : the discounter saw its market share drop last year to 18.4 percent from 19 percent .
revenue was down four percent – perhaps the biggest sales dip in the company 's history . the reasons for the stagnation are n't just the economic and financial crisis , which has forced numerous consumers to spend less and spend wisely .
the discounters , which include penny and the newly merged plus and netto group , have squeezed prices for numerous fast-moving consumer products to record lows and expanded store networks massively in large and small cities alike .
there are fewer and fewer opportunities to achieve a competitive edge in both areas , according to gfk food retail specialist wolfgang twardawa . “ every household in germany is within 10 minutes of a discounter by car , ” twardawa said .
“ and just look at butter prices .
penny has lowered its price from 99 cents for a 250-gram package to 80 cents .
nobody in the production chain is going to make money at that price . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cheap milk helps aldi attracts customers " brutal food retail market " independent retail consultant ulrich eggert says germany “ is a brutal food retail market . ” food prices in the country , he notes , are 15 percent below the european average .
“ nowhere in europe can consumers buy food more cheaply than they can in germany , ” he said . not surprisingly , sales margins of german discounters are low .
market researcher twardawa puts them at between 1-2 percent .
the one exception , he said , is aldi , with margins believed to be around 4 percent .
by comparison , sales margins in the uk are between 6-7 percent . until now , german discounters have experienced only growth .
with more than 16,000 stores across the country , they currently control 46.4 percent of the country 's food market .

clearly , the cd album is still high on the agendas of german music executives . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans music lovers have proven more loyal to the cd than their us counterparts germany accounts for 6.6 percent of global music sales and is therefore the world 's fourth largest music market . it comes in behind the us -lrb- with 36.2 percent -rrb- , japan -lrb- 16.6 percent -rrb- and great britain -lrb- 10.2 percent -rrb- . back to the roots both berger and lieberberg argued that it is not just the responsibility of that industry to get back to its roots - that is , the artists and their music - but also its ticket to survival in unstable economic times . " it 's the bigger companies that are investing significant amounts of money in new talents , " said berger .
he added that mergers within the industry - including the one announced just last week in the us between the world 's largest concert promoter live nation and ticketmaster - could lead to a kind of " renaissance . " with turnovers of 110 million euros -lrb- $ 153 million -rrb- and nearly 300 million euros last year respectively , however , the marek lieberberg concert agency and sony music gsa are indeed speaking from privileged positions and have the resources to take risks on new talent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berger predicted that the finance crisis would affect music consumers ' choices this year " we have to bring back music into the minds and into the hearts of the people , " said lieberberg .
" what i was raised on was music being a trigger for the liberation of society .
music was our release to dreams that we had - socially , politically , sexually .
all of this was triggered by music .
for us , music paved the way for a more liberal , a better life that awarded more rights to young people . " born in 1946 , the self-made impresario began his career in 1970 - on the heels of the 1968 student protests - with a concert by the who in muenster , germany . idealism or capitalism ? " we can not rule art in the same way we rule the rest of the economy , " said lieberberg .
but whether the search for the next chart-busting musician is more about art than profit remains to be seen . either way , music lovers in germany can still expect to find cds by the new stars , at least for a few more years . author : kate bowen editor : sam edmonds send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

following a meeting with greek prime minister george papandreou , westerwelle expressed germany 's support for the efforts of the greek government .
" i 'm convinced that these consolidation , reform , and growth programs deserve a chance and they will work , " westerwelle said .
" and that 's the reason i 'm here : we 're standing by greece . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greece is struggling with a mountain of debt however , last week the german government made a point of flatly rejecting any direct fiscal aid to finance the greek deficit .
german finance minister , wolfgang schaeuble , has insisted that the 16 eurozone countries were not obliged to bail out greece from its financial troubles .
eu heaping pressure on greece athens is feeling the heat from the european union and has seen its credit rating downgraded by all three major rating agencies .
the european commission is expected to make an official announcement about the greek deficit on wednesday , but said already on monday that greece 's plans to tackle its mountain of debt were " achievable . "
it warned however that " additional measures " were necessary .
eu commission spokeswoman , amelia torres , said greece would likely be given four months to reach " very precise objectives " under close surveillance by brussels .
early last year , the eu commission launched disciplinary action against greece because it had allowed its deficit to exceed the eu limit of three percent of gross domestic product , and it has since complained that the greek government has taken no effective steps to rein in its deficit . however , greek finance minister george papaconstantinou said the problem was not unique to his country . " following greece , there are other countries , like spain and portugal -lsb- in a similar situation -rsb- , " said papaconstantinou at an economic conference in athens on tuesday .
" this is why the greek issue , despite its particular greek characteristics , is also a euro zone issue . " he pledged athens ' support to the idea of selling eurozone bonds as possible solution . greek pm outlines cost-cutting plans bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greece is n't alone : 20 out of 27 eu nations have deficits that are too high as the pressure mounts , greek prime minister george papandreou has said that his government was ready " to draw blood " to beat the corruption , waste and mismanagement responsible for the debt crisis .
he has outlined sweeping public sector cuts to bring greece 's deficit in line with eurozone requirements by 2013 , including a cut in welfare spending , tax reform , and a public sector wage freeze .
papandreou has also proposed major curbs on public hiring , a 10 percent cut in social security and a " significant reduction " in military spending .
on top of that , he has also called for a 90 percent tax on bank bonuses . twenty of the eu 's 27 member nations are currently running deficits above the three-percent threshold. mz / gb / dpa / ap / afp / reuters editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de retail -pipe- 02.02.2010 german discount grocers struggle to sustain growth großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lidl is trying to steal market share from aldi with bargain-basement prices german food prices are the lowest in europe thanks to fierce competition from discounters like aldi and lidl .
but new research suggests the price war may soon end as the chains exhaust opportunities for domestic growth . according to german market researcher gfk , lidl was able to increase its share of the country 's 150-billion-euro food market by only 0.1 percent in 2009 to 9.8 percent .
archrival aldi was hit even harder : the discounter saw its market share drop last year to 18.4 percent from 19 percent .
revenue was down four percent – perhaps the biggest sales dip in the company 's history . the reasons for the stagnation are n't just the economic and financial crisis , which has forced numerous consumers to spend less and spend wisely .
the discounters , which include penny and the newly merged plus and netto group , have squeezed prices for numerous fast-moving consumer products to record lows and expanded store networks massively in large and small cities alike .
there are fewer and fewer opportunities to achieve a competitive edge in both areas , according to gfk food retail specialist wolfgang twardawa . “ every household in germany is within 10 minutes of a discounter by car , ” twardawa said .
“ and just look at butter prices .
penny has lowered its price from 99 cents for a 250-gram package to 80 cents .
nobody in the production chain is going to make money at that price . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cheap milk helps aldi attracts customers " brutal food retail market " independent retail consultant ulrich eggert says germany “ is a brutal food retail market . ” food prices in the country , he notes , are 15 percent below the european average .
“ nowhere in europe can consumers buy food more cheaply than they can in germany , ” he said . not surprisingly , sales margins of german discounters are low .
market researcher twardawa puts them at between 1-2 percent .
the one exception , he said , is aldi , with margins believed to be around 4 percent .
by comparison , sales margins in the uk are between 6-7 percent . until now , german discounters have experienced only growth .
with more than 16,000 stores across the country , they currently control 46.4 percent of the country 's food market .
that growth is largely the result of aggressive pricing .
aldi was the first grocer to feature rock-bottom pricing by offering a limited inventory and squeezing out all necessary costs , from butcher shops to fancy displays .
around 15 years later , lidl entered the market with a similar strategy . supermarkets under pressure much of the discounters ' growth has come at the expense of german supermarkets , in particular edeka and rewe .
both , however , have pursued a dual-pronged strategy to counter the competition . on the one hand , they have sought to win back customers willing to spend a little more money with service , ambience and a broad assortment of high-quality products , including fresh produce .
and they appear to be succeeding : their market share in 2009 rose slightly for the first time in years to 23.7 percent , according to gfk . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : supermarkets like rewe offer a wider product range than the discounters on the other hand , with an eye to consumers who need to spend even less , the two supermarkets have adopted the attitude “ if you can beat ‘ em , join ‘ em . ” both edeka and rewe have entered the discount fray with their own dedicated chains .
consultant eggert said he expects the newly merged plus and netto discount stores , owned by edeka , will emerge as a major challenger to aldi and lidl . a threat to diversity ? the increased competition could lead to even greater price pressure on suppliers , warns matthias horst , president of the federation of german food and drink industries -lrb- bve -rrb- .
“ we can see that the last round of price cuts has n't really done anything for aldi and lidl , ” he said . “ we are concerned about the negative impact that these endless price wars could have on the some 5,000 food suppliers in germany .
many of them may no longer be able to meet the conditions of the big discounters .
there could be consolidation and we could lose the rich diversity we currently have in the supplier sector . ” the new discounters do n't seem to be too worried as they scramble for market share in germany .
nor do the established giants aldi and lidl ; as they continue to slug it out and try to stay ahead of the newcomers by expanding outside the country , where they face not only less competition but also fatter sales margins . for sure , german discounters are providing consumers – for better or for worse – plenty of food for thought . author : john blau editor : sam edmonds send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the two south asian neighbours india and pakistan have been at loggerheads since the partition of the subcontinent in 1947 .
the conflict over kashmir and militant attacks have fuelled animosity between them for a long time . after terrorists trained in pakistan wreaked havoc in mumbai during a three day assault in november 2008 , the media in both countries took a far more hawkish stance than their governments , whipping up nationalist sentiment and emotions .
the indian government , for instance , slammed the media and even threatened to restrict press freedoms .
now , however , a year on , the times of india and pakistan 's jang group have decided to take a different approach .
their initiative ' aman ki asha ' or ' hope for peace ' aims at spreading the message of peace by utilizing the strong common bonds of music , art and literature that both countries share .
the groups ' newspapers devoted their full first page to the topic on new year 's day this year .
since then the initiative has been a regular feature of their electronic and print output .
videos show the things that people love and cherish on both sides of the border .

polish authorities have already arrested five local men in the case , but they have previously identified hoegstroem as the mastermind behind the theft .
the european arrest warrant obliges any european union member state to hand over hoegstroem within 90 days of his arrest . the measure replaces the traditional extradition process , which in the past could take years of legal stalling . the measure has been on the eu books since 2005 , but this is throught to be the first major case in which it is being put to use .
theft sparked outrage the five-meter -lrb- 16 feet -rrb- wrought iron sign - the german words on which translate as " work sets you free " - was stolen in december from above the gate to the concentration camp .
the sign , a worldwide symbol of the atrocities of nazi germany , was later found by police cut into three pieces . the theft of the sign sparked international outrage , especially in israel .
up to 1.5 million people , mostly jews , died at auschwitz during nazi germany 's occupation of poland in world war ii .
the recovered sign is now being repaired . a replica had to be put up last week at the ceremonies commemorating the 65th liberation of auschwitz by soviet troops . mm / afp / dpa / reuters editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de retail -pipe- 02.02.2010 german discount grocers struggle to sustain growth großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lidl is trying to steal market share from aldi with bargain-basement prices german food prices are the lowest in europe thanks to fierce competition from discounters like aldi and lidl .
but new research suggests the price war may soon end as the chains exhaust opportunities for domestic growth . according to german market researcher gfk , lidl was able to increase its share of the country 's 150-billion-euro food market by only 0.1 percent in 2009 to 9.8 percent .
archrival aldi was hit even harder : the discounter saw its market share drop last year to 18.4 percent from 19 percent .
revenue was down four percent – perhaps the biggest sales dip in the company 's history . the reasons for the stagnation are n't just the economic and financial crisis , which has forced numerous consumers to spend less and spend wisely .
the discounters , which include penny and the newly merged plus and netto group , have squeezed prices for numerous fast-moving consumer products to record lows and expanded store networks massively in large and small cities alike .
there are fewer and fewer opportunities to achieve a competitive edge in both areas , according to gfk food retail specialist wolfgang twardawa . “ every household in germany is within 10 minutes of a discounter by car , ” twardawa said .
“ and just look at butter prices .
penny has lowered its price from 99 cents for a 250-gram package to 80 cents .
nobody in the production chain is going to make money at that price . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cheap milk helps aldi attracts customers " brutal food retail market " independent retail consultant ulrich eggert says germany “ is a brutal food retail market . ” food prices in the country , he notes , are 15 percent below the european average .
“ nowhere in europe can consumers buy food more cheaply than they can in germany , ” he said . not surprisingly , sales margins of german discounters are low .
market researcher twardawa puts them at between 1-2 percent .
the one exception , he said , is aldi , with margins believed to be around 4 percent .
by comparison , sales margins in the uk are between 6-7 percent . until now , german discounters have experienced only growth .
with more than 16,000 stores across the country , they currently control 46.4 percent of the country 's food market .
that growth is largely the result of aggressive pricing .
aldi was the first grocer to feature rock-bottom pricing by offering a limited inventory and squeezing out all necessary costs , from butcher shops to fancy displays .
around 15 years later , lidl entered the market with a similar strategy . supermarkets under pressure much of the discounters ' growth has come at the expense of german supermarkets , in particular edeka and rewe .
both , however , have pursued a dual-pronged strategy to counter the competition . on the one hand , they have sought to win back customers willing to spend a little more money with service , ambience and a broad assortment of high-quality products , including fresh produce .
and they appear to be succeeding : their market share in 2009 rose slightly for the first time in years to 23.7 percent , according to gfk . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : supermarkets like rewe offer a wider product range than the discounters on the other hand , with an eye to consumers who need to spend even less , the two supermarkets have adopted the attitude “ if you can beat ‘ em , join ‘ em . ” both edeka and rewe have entered the discount fray with their own dedicated chains .
consultant eggert said he expects the newly merged plus and netto discount stores , owned by edeka , will emerge as a major challenger to aldi and lidl . a threat to diversity ? the increased competition could lead to even greater price pressure on suppliers , warns matthias horst , president of the federation of german food and drink industries -lrb- bve -rrb- .
“ we can see that the last round of price cuts has n't really done anything for aldi and lidl , ” he said . “ we are concerned about the negative impact that these endless price wars could have on the some 5,000 food suppliers in germany .
many of them may no longer be able to meet the conditions of the big discounters .
there could be consolidation and we could lose the rich diversity we currently have in the supplier sector . ” the new discounters do n't seem to be too worried as they scramble for market share in germany .
nor do the established giants aldi and lidl ; as they continue to slug it out and try to stay ahead of the newcomers by expanding outside the country , where they face not only less competition but also fatter sales margins . for sure , german discounters are providing consumers – for better or for worse – plenty of food for thought . author : john blau editor : sam edmonds send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

washingon , however , insists the move is not meant as a snub against brussels . the white house on monday said us president barack obama had no plans to attend the annual eu-us summit scheduled for may in spain .
washington however stressed that the decision should not be interpreted as a snub to the european union .
" the president is committed to a strong us-eu partnership , and with europe in general , " national security council spokesman mike hammer said .
obama is increasingly facing challenges implementing his domestic reform agenda and has indicated that in 2010 he will spend more time on home soil .
his approval ratings in the us have dropped as the economic recovery has been slow to translate onto the job market .
officials in brussels reacted with disappointment to the news .
" it is normally the case that the summits are summits precisely because they are attended by heads of state and government , " eu commission spokeswoman pia ahrenkilde hanson told reporters .
according to newsagency afp , sources close to the spanish government have indicated that the summit might be postponed following washington 's announcement .
spain currently holds the rotating eu presidency and is to host the summit .
domestic challenges bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama yet has to meet with new eu president van rompuy us assistant secretary of state philip gordon on monday told reporters that it never had been on obama 's agenda to attend the spanish summit .
gordon stressed that the us president remained committed to close transatlantic ties with a keen eye on cooperation on afghanistan , counter-terrorism , the global economic crisis and climate change .
" the president as you all know has travelled to europe in his first year more than any president has ever done in the past , " gordon said .
obama travelled six times to europe last year , most recently to the copenhagen climate summit in december .
yet with congressional polls coming up in november , he is expected to travel mainly within the us in support for democratic candidates fearing a republican rebound .
since 1997 , the european union and the us have held annual meetings .
this year 's summit is scheduled for may 24 .
obama 's absence at the summit would likely be regarded as a blow for brussels .
the new president of the european council , herman van rompuy , has yet to formally meet with obama. ai / dpa / afp editor : rob turner send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but new research suggests the price war may soon end as the chains exhaust opportunities for domestic growth . according to german market researcher gfk , lidl was able to increase its share of the country 's 150-billion-euro food market by only 0.1 percent in 2009 to 9.8 percent .
archrival aldi was hit even harder : the discounter saw its market share drop last year to 18.4 percent from 19 percent .
revenue was down four percent – perhaps the biggest sales dip in the company 's history . the reasons for the stagnation are n't just the economic and financial crisis , which has forced numerous consumers to spend less and spend wisely .
the discounters , which include penny and the newly merged plus and netto group , have squeezed prices for numerous fast-moving consumer products to record lows and expanded store networks massively in large and small cities alike .
there are fewer and fewer opportunities to achieve a competitive edge in both areas , according to gfk food retail specialist wolfgang twardawa . “ every household in germany is within 10 minutes of a discounter by car , ” twardawa said .
“ and just look at butter prices .

nobody in the production chain is going to make money at that price . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cheap milk helps aldi attracts customers " brutal food retail market " independent retail consultant ulrich eggert says germany “ is a brutal food retail market . ” food prices in the country , he notes , are 15 percent below the european average .
“ nowhere in europe can consumers buy food more cheaply than they can in germany , ” he said . not surprisingly , sales margins of german discounters are low .
market researcher twardawa puts them at between 1-2 percent .
the one exception , he said , is aldi , with margins believed to be around 4 percent .
by comparison , sales margins in the uk are between 6-7 percent . until now , german discounters have experienced only growth .
with more than 16,000 stores across the country , they currently control 46.4 percent of the country 's food market .
that growth is largely the result of aggressive pricing .
aldi was the first grocer to feature rock-bottom pricing by offering a limited inventory and squeezing out all necessary costs , from butcher shops to fancy displays .
around 15 years later , lidl entered the market with a similar strategy . supermarkets under pressure much of the discounters ' growth has come at the expense of german supermarkets , in particular edeka and rewe .
both , however , have pursued a dual-pronged strategy to counter the competition . on the one hand , they have sought to win back customers willing to spend a little more money with service , ambience and a broad assortment of high-quality products , including fresh produce .
and they appear to be succeeding : their market share in 2009 rose slightly for the first time in years to 23.7 percent , according to gfk . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : supermarkets like rewe offer a wider product range than the discounters on the other hand , with an eye to consumers who need to spend even less , the two supermarkets have adopted the attitude “ if you can beat ‘ em , join ‘ em . ” both edeka and rewe have entered the discount fray with their own dedicated chains .
consultant eggert said he expects the newly merged plus and netto discount stores , owned by edeka , will emerge as a major challenger to aldi and lidl . a threat to diversity ? the increased competition could lead to even greater price pressure on suppliers , warns matthias horst , president of the federation of german food and drink industries -lrb- bve -rrb- .
“ we can see that the last round of price cuts has n't really done anything for aldi and lidl , ” he said . “ we are concerned about the negative impact that these endless price wars could have on the some 5,000 food suppliers in germany .
many of them may no longer be able to meet the conditions of the big discounters .
there could be consolidation and we could lose the rich diversity we currently have in the supplier sector . ” the new discounters do n't seem to be too worried as they scramble for market share in germany .

around 15 years later , lidl entered the market with a similar strategy . supermarkets under pressure much of the discounters ' growth has come at the expense of german supermarkets , in particular edeka and rewe .
both , however , have pursued a dual-pronged strategy to counter the competition . on the one hand , they have sought to win back customers willing to spend a little more money with service , ambience and a broad assortment of high-quality products , including fresh produce .
and they appear to be succeeding : their market share in 2009 rose slightly for the first time in years to 23.7 percent , according to gfk . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : supermarkets like rewe offer a wider product range than the discounters on the other hand , with an eye to consumers who need to spend even less , the two supermarkets have adopted the attitude “ if you can beat ‘ em , join ‘ em . ” both edeka and rewe have entered the discount fray with their own dedicated chains .
consultant eggert said he expects the newly merged plus and netto discount stores , owned by edeka , will emerge as a major challenger to aldi and lidl . a threat to diversity ? the increased competition could lead to even greater price pressure on suppliers , warns matthias horst , president of the federation of german food and drink industries -lrb- bve -rrb- .
“ we can see that the last round of price cuts has n't really done anything for aldi and lidl , ” he said . “ we are concerned about the negative impact that these endless price wars could have on the some 5,000 food suppliers in germany .
many of them may no longer be able to meet the conditions of the big discounters .
there could be consolidation and we could lose the rich diversity we currently have in the supplier sector . ” the new discounters do n't seem to be too worried as they scramble for market share in germany .
nor do the established giants aldi and lidl ; as they continue to slug it out and try to stay ahead of the newcomers by expanding outside the country , where they face not only less competition but also fatter sales margins . for sure , german discounters are providing consumers – for better or for worse – plenty of food for thought . author : john blau editor : sam edmonds send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

polish authorities have already arrested five local men in the case , but they have previously identified hoegstroem as the mastermind behind the theft .
the european arrest warrant obliges any european union member state to hand over hoegstroem within 90 days of his arrest . the measure replaces the traditional extradition process , which in the past could take years of legal stalling . the measure has been on the eu books since 2005 , but this is throught to be the first major case in which it is being put to use .
theft sparked outrage the five-meter -lrb- 16 feet -rrb- wrought iron sign - the german words on which translate as " work sets you free " - was stolen in december from above the gate to the concentration camp .
the sign , a worldwide symbol of the atrocities of nazi germany , was later found by police cut into three pieces . the theft of the sign sparked international outrage , especially in israel .
up to 1.5 million people , mostly jews , died at auschwitz during nazi germany 's occupation of poland in world war ii .
the recovered sign is now being repaired . a replica had to be put up last week at the ceremonies commemorating the 65th liberation of auschwitz by soviet troops . mm / afp / dpa / reuters editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

polish authorities have already arrested five local men in the case , but they have previously identified hoegstroem as the mastermind behind the theft .
the european arrest warrant obliges any european union member state to hand over hoegstroem within 90 days of his arrest . the measure replaces the traditional extradition process , which in the past could take years of legal stalling . the measure has been on the eu books since 2005 , but this is throught to be the first major case in which it is being put to use .
theft sparked outrage the five-meter -lrb- 16 feet -rrb- wrought iron sign - the german words on which translate as " work sets you free " - was stolen in december from above the gate to the concentration camp .
the sign , a worldwide symbol of the atrocities of nazi germany , was later found by police cut into three pieces . the theft of the sign sparked international outrage , especially in israel .
up to 1.5 million people , mostly jews , died at auschwitz during nazi germany 's occupation of poland in world war ii .
the recovered sign is now being repaired . a replica had to be put up last week at the ceremonies commemorating the 65th liberation of auschwitz by soviet troops . mm / afp / dpa / reuters editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the " sauerland cell , " uncovered and arrested in 2007 , was germany 's first example of home-grown islamist terrorism . the geman-born leader of the so-called sauerland cell , fritz gelowicz , showed germany that islamist terror was a problem in its own back yard .
the 30-year-old islam convert and his three accomplices , german daniel schneider , turkish-german attila selek , and turk adem yilmaz were captured in the west german region of sauerland in 2007 , with vast stockpiles of hydrogen peroxide , suitable for making car bombs and other explosives .
they said they planned to attack us military targets based in germany , and that events in the so-called " war on terror " had motivated them to take up arms .
" my client said that this decision came in 2004 , " gelowicz 's lawyer dirk uden told the regional high court in dusseldorf .
he explained that the us arrest and torture of a dual nationality german-lebanese car dealer chalid el-masri – who was not involved in terrorist activity – was the main reason gelowicz decided to begin working for the islamic jihad union , a splinter terror group with its roots in uzbekistan .
" he saw the pictures of abu ghraib , the pictures from guantanamo bay , and especially the fate of chalid el-masri , which he heard about through personal connections before it became common knowledge , and these things really influenced him .
these events supported his decision to embark upon an armed jihad . "
historic plea bargain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this hydrogen peroxide was to be made into lethal bombs in exchange for shortened sentences , the group 's members agreed to discuss their plans , and their time at a terror training camp in pakistani region of waziristan , close to the afghan border .
" the confessions of the accused were the most comprehensive talks concerning terrorism ever heard in a german court of law , " the director of the institute of terrorism research and security policy in essen , rolf tophoven , told deutsche welle .
" they gave an exact description of what was going on in the terror training camps in pakistan . "
it 's unclear how the group will plead , but daniel schneider has indicated he will probably plead guilty on attempted murder charges for shooting at a policeman trying to arrest him , acknowledging that the skirmish could easily " have had a deadly ending . "
a final verdict in the trial , which has lasted roughly nine months so far , is expected in march .
terror concerns in germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daniel schneider has admitted to trying to kill a policeman there has not yet been a successful islamist terror attack in germany , however , experts concur that the country 's military engagement in afghanistan means it is considered a viable target .
" we are in the sights of islamists because of the 4,500 soldiers posted in afghanistan , and our other anti-terrorist operations , " said tophoven .
" from the point of view of the terrorists , there are good reasons to attack germany , and were an attack here ever to succeed , i am sure that the mission in afghanistan would be used as justification for it . "
tophoven also says it should come as no surprise that the sauerland cell was a home-grown organization , led by german converts to islam .
" a minority of converts to a new religion want to prove that they are tougher than the people born into the religion .
they want to establish themselves and prove their conviction in their new faith , and this can lead to extremism . "

terror concerns in germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daniel schneider has admitted to trying to kill a policeman there has not yet been a successful islamist terror attack in germany , however , experts concur that the country 's military engagement in afghanistan means it is considered a viable target .
" we are in the sights of islamists because of the 4,500 soldiers posted in afghanistan , and our other anti-terrorist operations , " said tophoven .
" from the point of view of the terrorists , there are good reasons to attack germany , and were an attack here ever to succeed , i am sure that the mission in afghanistan would be used as justification for it . "
tophoven also says it should come as no surprise that the sauerland cell was a home-grown organization , led by german converts to islam .
" a minority of converts to a new religion want to prove that they are tougher than the people born into the religion .
they want to establish themselves and prove their conviction in their new faith , and this can lead to extremism . "

he was welcomed into the politically and culturally influential literary society " gruppe 47 " early on and was awarded the buechner prize in 1963 . later , however , the writer distanced himself from the radical politics of the 1968 movement and became a vocal critic of what he called the " linker gemütlichkeit " -lrb- roughly , " comfortable left " -rrb- , as the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung wrote in the late 1980s . even in recent years , enzensberger has remained both outspoken and prolific .
he made headlines in 2003 by publically defending the invasion of iraq , comparing the iraqi dictator saddam hussein to adolf hitler . and in the last two years alone , he published a children 's book , " bibs , " two essays and a piece of prose entitled " the silences of hammerstein . "
the latter is a partly fictional , partly factual account of a real-life nazi general and the few who refused to share in the party 's spoils . enzensberger joins a long line of prestigious sonning prize winners , including winston churchill -lrb- 1950 -rrb- , theologian karl barth -lrb- 1963 -rrb- , publicist hannah arendt -lrb- 1975 -rrb- , philosopher juergen habermas -lrb- 1987 -rrb- and writer guenter grass -lrb- 1996 -rrb- . click on the links below to read samples of enzensberger 's work in english . kjb / dpad / epd / kna / ap editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the " sauerland cell , " uncovered and arrested in 2007 , was germany 's first example of home-grown islamist terrorism . the geman-born leader of the so-called sauerland cell , fritz gelowicz , showed germany that islamist terror was a problem in its own back yard .
the 30-year-old islam convert and his three accomplices , german daniel schneider , turkish-german attila selek , and turk adem yilmaz were captured in the west german region of sauerland in 2007 , with vast stockpiles of hydrogen peroxide , suitable for making car bombs and other explosives .
they said they planned to attack us military targets based in germany , and that events in the so-called " war on terror " had motivated them to take up arms .
" my client said that this decision came in 2004 , " gelowicz 's lawyer dirk uden told the regional high court in dusseldorf .
he explained that the us arrest and torture of a dual nationality german-lebanese car dealer chalid el-masri – who was not involved in terrorist activity – was the main reason gelowicz decided to begin working for the islamic jihad union , a splinter terror group with its roots in uzbekistan .
" he saw the pictures of abu ghraib , the pictures from guantanamo bay , and especially the fate of chalid el-masri , which he heard about through personal connections before it became common knowledge , and these things really influenced him .
these events supported his decision to embark upon an armed jihad . "
historic plea bargain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this hydrogen peroxide was to be made into lethal bombs in exchange for shortened sentences , the group 's members agreed to discuss their plans , and their time at a terror training camp in pakistani region of waziristan , close to the afghan border .
" the confessions of the accused were the most comprehensive talks concerning terrorism ever heard in a german court of law , " the director of the institute of terrorism research and security policy in essen , rolf tophoven , told deutsche welle .
" they gave an exact description of what was going on in the terror training camps in pakistan . "
it 's unclear how the group will plead , but daniel schneider has indicated he will probably plead guilty on attempted murder charges for shooting at a policeman trying to arrest him , acknowledging that the skirmish could easily " have had a deadly ending . "
a final verdict in the trial , which has lasted roughly nine months so far , is expected in march .
terror concerns in germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daniel schneider has admitted to trying to kill a policeman there has not yet been a successful islamist terror attack in germany , however , experts concur that the country 's military engagement in afghanistan means it is considered a viable target .
" we are in the sights of islamists because of the 4,500 soldiers posted in afghanistan , and our other anti-terrorist operations , " said tophoven .
" from the point of view of the terrorists , there are good reasons to attack germany , and were an attack here ever to succeed , i am sure that the mission in afghanistan would be used as justification for it . "
tophoven also says it should come as no surprise that the sauerland cell was a home-grown organization , led by german converts to islam .
" a minority of converts to a new religion want to prove that they are tougher than the people born into the religion .
they want to establish themselves and prove their conviction in their new faith , and this can lead to extremism . "

washingon , however , insists the move is not meant as a snub against brussels . the white house on monday said us president barack obama had no plans to attend the annual eu-us summit scheduled for may in spain .
washington however stressed that the decision should not be interpreted as a snub to the european union .
" the president is committed to a strong us-eu partnership , and with europe in general , " national security council spokesman mike hammer said .
obama is increasingly facing challenges implementing his domestic reform agenda and has indicated that in 2010 he will spend more time on home soil .
his approval ratings in the us have dropped as the economic recovery has been slow to translate onto the job market .
officials in brussels reacted with disappointment to the news .
" it is normally the case that the summits are summits precisely because they are attended by heads of state and government , " eu commission spokeswoman pia ahrenkilde hanson told reporters .
according to newsagency afp , sources close to the spanish government have indicated that the summit might be postponed following washington 's announcement .

but opel management says unions are twisting the figures as its parent company gm looks to secure government funding . opel 's european works council says general motors ' decision to restructure the german-based carmaker may require even more layoffs than previously expected . following a meeting with the company 's chief executive nick reilly , labor leaders said in a statement that the number of jobs at risk throughout europe is 2,000 higher than the 8,300 positions already on the chopping block .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opel ceo nick reilly wants a downsizing agreement by mid-february unions say germany and belgium are likely to be hit the hardest in terms of total number of cuts under the revised plan . some 4,800 people would be laid off in germany , including members of management , while the closure of the opel manufacturing plant in antwerp would cost another 2,600 jobs .
opel management has rejected the labor leaders ' criticism as unreasonable , arguing that the 2,000 ' additional ' losses were actually early retirement deals unrelated to restructuring efforts . a company spokesman told the german press agency dpa that opel was sticking to its original plan to cut 8,300 jobs across europe as it reduces production by 20 percent in response to weakened demand for vehicles .
looking for loans reuters news agency quoted labor leaders who said they learned in the meeting with reilly that opel no longer planned to reduce management costs by 35 percent and that , on the contrary , new management staff has been hired .
last week ceo reilly announced he wanted to reach an agreement with the works council by mid-february on a plan to help the carmaker shrink to a profitable size .
however , labor leaders have frozen negotiations with gm over the automaker 's proposal to make 265 million euros -lrb- $ 372.1 million -rrb- in annual wage cuts across the continent over the next five years , insisting that the antwerp plant should stay open .
gm has also asked for 2.7 billion euros in state aid in the form of either loans or loan guarantees to help finance the 3.3 billion euro revamp .
reilly said that all countries that host major opel manufacturing sites , with the exception of belgium , have indicated they remain open in principle to extending state funding .
opel is expected to submit a formal aid application to germany within the next few days , once the company obtains the required independent expert opinion on the viability of reilly 's plan .

but opel management says unions are twisting the figures as its parent company gm looks to secure government funding . opel 's european works council says general motors ' decision to restructure the german-based carmaker may require even more layoffs than previously expected . following a meeting with the company 's chief executive nick reilly , labor leaders said in a statement that the number of jobs at risk throughout europe is 2,000 higher than the 8,300 positions already on the chopping block .

reilly said that all countries that host major opel manufacturing sites , with the exception of belgium , have indicated they remain open in principle to extending state funding .

the move has been criticized by the opposition as a further curbing of freedom of speech and information under the authoritarian regime . belarusian president alexander lukashenko has signed an order to further monitor internet use in the country dubbed by critics as europe 's last dictatorship .
" to ensure the security of the state and it 's citizens , from july 1 , 2010 internet service providers will be required to identify devices used to connect to the internet and keep information on those devices and the services provided , " the new decree reads .
under the decree personal data and profiles of internet users will be collected and service providers can be asked to block access to any website within 24 hours .
the country 's authoritarian regime has justified its decision by quoting a need to " fight against everything illegal and to improve the security of the this country and its citizens . "
the country 's opposition has denounced the move as yet another attack on the freedom of speech and information designed to shut them out from any media access ahead of next year 's election .
' an enemy of the internet ' the move further tightens the government 's grip on communications in the country .
in january , lukashenko authorized an analysis center to define what information could be made available on the internet and to monitor traffic .
reporters without borders has strongly criticized the analysis center , saying the move would make the country " fall to the level of north korea and china … as an enemy of the internet . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de retail -pipe- 02.02.2010 german discount grocers struggle to sustain growth großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lidl is trying to steal market share from aldi with bargain-basement prices german food prices are the lowest in europe thanks to fierce competition from discounters like aldi and lidl .
but new research suggests the price war may soon end as the chains exhaust opportunities for domestic growth . according to german market researcher gfk , lidl was able to increase its share of the country 's 150-billion-euro food market by only 0.1 percent in 2009 to 9.8 percent .
archrival aldi was hit even harder : the discounter saw its market share drop last year to 18.4 percent from 19 percent .
revenue was down four percent – perhaps the biggest sales dip in the company 's history . the reasons for the stagnation are n't just the economic and financial crisis , which has forced numerous consumers to spend less and spend wisely .
the discounters , which include penny and the newly merged plus and netto group , have squeezed prices for numerous fast-moving consumer products to record lows and expanded store networks massively in large and small cities alike .
there are fewer and fewer opportunities to achieve a competitive edge in both areas , according to gfk food retail specialist wolfgang twardawa . “ every household in germany is within 10 minutes of a discounter by car , ” twardawa said .
“ and just look at butter prices .
penny has lowered its price from 99 cents for a 250-gram package to 80 cents .
nobody in the production chain is going to make money at that price . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cheap milk helps aldi attracts customers " brutal food retail market " independent retail consultant ulrich eggert says germany “ is a brutal food retail market . ” food prices in the country , he notes , are 15 percent below the european average .
“ nowhere in europe can consumers buy food more cheaply than they can in germany , ” he said . not surprisingly , sales margins of german discounters are low .
market researcher twardawa puts them at between 1-2 percent .
the one exception , he said , is aldi , with margins believed to be around 4 percent .
by comparison , sales margins in the uk are between 6-7 percent . until now , german discounters have experienced only growth .
with more than 16,000 stores across the country , they currently control 46.4 percent of the country 's food market .
that growth is largely the result of aggressive pricing .
aldi was the first grocer to feature rock-bottom pricing by offering a limited inventory and squeezing out all necessary costs , from butcher shops to fancy displays .
around 15 years later , lidl entered the market with a similar strategy . supermarkets under pressure much of the discounters ' growth has come at the expense of german supermarkets , in particular edeka and rewe .
both , however , have pursued a dual-pronged strategy to counter the competition . on the one hand , they have sought to win back customers willing to spend a little more money with service , ambience and a broad assortment of high-quality products , including fresh produce .
and they appear to be succeeding : their market share in 2009 rose slightly for the first time in years to 23.7 percent , according to gfk . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : supermarkets like rewe offer a wider product range than the discounters on the other hand , with an eye to consumers who need to spend even less , the two supermarkets have adopted the attitude “ if you can beat ‘ em , join ‘ em . ” both edeka and rewe have entered the discount fray with their own dedicated chains .
consultant eggert said he expects the newly merged plus and netto discount stores , owned by edeka , will emerge as a major challenger to aldi and lidl . a threat to diversity ? the increased competition could lead to even greater price pressure on suppliers , warns matthias horst , president of the federation of german food and drink industries -lrb- bve -rrb- .
“ we can see that the last round of price cuts has n't really done anything for aldi and lidl , ” he said . “ we are concerned about the negative impact that these endless price wars could have on the some 5,000 food suppliers in germany .
many of them may no longer be able to meet the conditions of the big discounters .
there could be consolidation and we could lose the rich diversity we currently have in the supplier sector . ” the new discounters do n't seem to be too worried as they scramble for market share in germany .
nor do the established giants aldi and lidl ; as they continue to slug it out and try to stay ahead of the newcomers by expanding outside the country , where they face not only less competition but also fatter sales margins . for sure , german discounters are providing consumers – for better or for worse – plenty of food for thought . author : john blau editor : sam edmonds send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but new research suggests the price war may soon end as the chains exhaust opportunities for domestic growth . according to german market researcher gfk , lidl was able to increase its share of the country 's 150-billion-euro food market by only 0.1 percent in 2009 to 9.8 percent .
archrival aldi was hit even harder : the discounter saw its market share drop last year to 18.4 percent from 19 percent .
revenue was down four percent – perhaps the biggest sales dip in the company 's history . the reasons for the stagnation are n't just the economic and financial crisis , which has forced numerous consumers to spend less and spend wisely .
the discounters , which include penny and the newly merged plus and netto group , have squeezed prices for numerous fast-moving consumer products to record lows and expanded store networks massively in large and small cities alike .
there are fewer and fewer opportunities to achieve a competitive edge in both areas , according to gfk food retail specialist wolfgang twardawa . “ every household in germany is within 10 minutes of a discounter by car , ” twardawa said .
“ and just look at butter prices .
penny has lowered its price from 99 cents for a 250-gram package to 80 cents .
nobody in the production chain is going to make money at that price . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cheap milk helps aldi attracts customers " brutal food retail market " independent retail consultant ulrich eggert says germany “ is a brutal food retail market . ” food prices in the country , he notes , are 15 percent below the european average .
“ nowhere in europe can consumers buy food more cheaply than they can in germany , ” he said . not surprisingly , sales margins of german discounters are low .
market researcher twardawa puts them at between 1-2 percent .
the one exception , he said , is aldi , with margins believed to be around 4 percent .
by comparison , sales margins in the uk are between 6-7 percent . until now , german discounters have experienced only growth .
with more than 16,000 stores across the country , they currently control 46.4 percent of the country 's food market .
that growth is largely the result of aggressive pricing .
aldi was the first grocer to feature rock-bottom pricing by offering a limited inventory and squeezing out all necessary costs , from butcher shops to fancy displays .
around 15 years later , lidl entered the market with a similar strategy . supermarkets under pressure much of the discounters ' growth has come at the expense of german supermarkets , in particular edeka and rewe .
both , however , have pursued a dual-pronged strategy to counter the competition . on the one hand , they have sought to win back customers willing to spend a little more money with service , ambience and a broad assortment of high-quality products , including fresh produce .
and they appear to be succeeding : their market share in 2009 rose slightly for the first time in years to 23.7 percent , according to gfk . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : supermarkets like rewe offer a wider product range than the discounters on the other hand , with an eye to consumers who need to spend even less , the two supermarkets have adopted the attitude “ if you can beat ‘ em , join ‘ em . ” both edeka and rewe have entered the discount fray with their own dedicated chains .
consultant eggert said he expects the newly merged plus and netto discount stores , owned by edeka , will emerge as a major challenger to aldi and lidl . a threat to diversity ? the increased competition could lead to even greater price pressure on suppliers , warns matthias horst , president of the federation of german food and drink industries -lrb- bve -rrb- .
“ we can see that the last round of price cuts has n't really done anything for aldi and lidl , ” he said . “ we are concerned about the negative impact that these endless price wars could have on the some 5,000 food suppliers in germany .
many of them may no longer be able to meet the conditions of the big discounters .
there could be consolidation and we could lose the rich diversity we currently have in the supplier sector . ” the new discounters do n't seem to be too worried as they scramble for market share in germany .
nor do the established giants aldi and lidl ; as they continue to slug it out and try to stay ahead of the newcomers by expanding outside the country , where they face not only less competition but also fatter sales margins . for sure , german discounters are providing consumers – for better or for worse – plenty of food for thought . author : john blau editor : sam edmonds send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but new research suggests the price war may soon end as the chains exhaust opportunities for domestic growth . according to german market researcher gfk , lidl was able to increase its share of the country 's 150-billion-euro food market by only 0.1 percent in 2009 to 9.8 percent .
archrival aldi was hit even harder : the discounter saw its market share drop last year to 18.4 percent from 19 percent .
revenue was down four percent – perhaps the biggest sales dip in the company 's history . the reasons for the stagnation are n't just the economic and financial crisis , which has forced numerous consumers to spend less and spend wisely .
the discounters , which include penny and the newly merged plus and netto group , have squeezed prices for numerous fast-moving consumer products to record lows and expanded store networks massively in large and small cities alike .

washingon , however , insists the move is not meant as a snub against brussels . the white house on monday said us president barack obama had no plans to attend the annual eu-us summit scheduled for may in spain .
washington however stressed that the decision should not be interpreted as a snub to the european union .
" the president is committed to a strong us-eu partnership , and with europe in general , " national security council spokesman mike hammer said .
obama is increasingly facing challenges implementing his domestic reform agenda and has indicated that in 2010 he will spend more time on home soil .
his approval ratings in the us have dropped as the economic recovery has been slow to translate onto the job market .
officials in brussels reacted with disappointment to the news .
" it is normally the case that the summits are summits precisely because they are attended by heads of state and government , " eu commission spokeswoman pia ahrenkilde hanson told reporters .
according to newsagency afp , sources close to the spanish government have indicated that the summit might be postponed following washington 's announcement .
spain currently holds the rotating eu presidency and is to host the summit .
domestic challenges bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama yet has to meet with new eu president van rompuy us assistant secretary of state philip gordon on monday told reporters that it never had been on obama 's agenda to attend the spanish summit .
gordon stressed that the us president remained committed to close transatlantic ties with a keen eye on cooperation on afghanistan , counter-terrorism , the global economic crisis and climate change .
" the president as you all know has travelled to europe in his first year more than any president has ever done in the past , " gordon said .
obama travelled six times to europe last year , most recently to the copenhagen climate summit in december .
yet with congressional polls coming up in november , he is expected to travel mainly within the us in support for democratic candidates fearing a republican rebound .
since 1997 , the european union and the us have held annual meetings .
this year 's summit is scheduled for may 24 .
obama 's absence at the summit would likely be regarded as a blow for brussels .
the new president of the european council , herman van rompuy , has yet to formally meet with obama. ai / dpa / afp editor : rob turner send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

-lrb- 19.01.2010 -rrb- press review : reality catches up with president obama a year after us president barak obama took office , german editorial writers agree that whether obama will go down in history as a great or an average president is still undecided .

but new research suggests the price war may soon end as the chains exhaust opportunities for domestic growth . according to german market researcher gfk , lidl was able to increase its share of the country 's 150-billion-euro food market by only 0.1 percent in 2009 to 9.8 percent .
archrival aldi was hit even harder : the discounter saw its market share drop last year to 18.4 percent from 19 percent .
revenue was down four percent – perhaps the biggest sales dip in the company 's history . the reasons for the stagnation are n't just the economic and financial crisis , which has forced numerous consumers to spend less and spend wisely .
the discounters , which include penny and the newly merged plus and netto group , have squeezed prices for numerous fast-moving consumer products to record lows and expanded store networks massively in large and small cities alike .
there are fewer and fewer opportunities to achieve a competitive edge in both areas , according to gfk food retail specialist wolfgang twardawa . “ every household in germany is within 10 minutes of a discounter by car , ” twardawa said .
“ and just look at butter prices .
penny has lowered its price from 99 cents for a 250-gram package to 80 cents .
nobody in the production chain is going to make money at that price . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cheap milk helps aldi attracts customers " brutal food retail market " independent retail consultant ulrich eggert says germany “ is a brutal food retail market . ” food prices in the country , he notes , are 15 percent below the european average .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de music industry -pipe- 02.02.2010 germany 's flailing music industry seeks new talent großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : music consumption is up , says sony music battered by the economic crisis , digitization and piracy , the music industry is struggling to find new direction .
idealists say its focus should be on artists , not revenue .
but can talent alone keep the industry afloat ? among the first to go digital , the music industry is now scrambling for creative strategies to keep up with web pirates and illegal downloaders .
in the meantime , some analysts in the sector are banking on live performance as the ticket to success - after all , the " live experience " ca n't be digitized . there may be a broad spectrum of revenue-protecting strategies out there , but many experts on the stage and behind it agree on one thing : going back to the basics - that is , finding and developing good artists - is the only sure-fire way to weather the storm and promote growth . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lieberberg has been in the live music business for 40 years " i think the state of the industry currently is worse than it ever was , " concert organizer marek lieberberg said recently at midem , the industry 's largest international congress in cannes , france . lieberberg founded his frankfurt-based agency more than 40 years ago .
it focuses on open air festivals and organizes some of europe 's most popular events , including rock am ring at the nuerburgring race track and rock im park in nuremberg . the most recent statistics available from the federal association for the german music industry show that sales suffered a setback of 4.7 percent in 2008 , and have fallen 41 percent since 1999 . " i think the major malfunction is that record companies have a real problem finding the acts , " added lieberberg .
" the talent has dried out and it needs to be redeveloped . " bildunterschrift : rock am ring is one of germany 's biggest live music events internet is not enough while some industry observers thought for a while that the internet could serve as a do-it-yourself talent filter with sites like myspace.com , that seems to be a short-lived dream . " if you look around the world , maybe there are not even half a dozen bands or artists who have really achieved fame , just by emerging from the internet , " said edgar berger , ceo of sony music gsa -lrb- germany , switzerland and austria -rrb- . in germany , unlike in the us , people still buy compact discs , according to berger .
in 2008 , cds accoutned for 81 percent of music sold in germany - a level that has been stable for the past five years , according to the federal association for the german music industry .
clearly , the cd album is still high on the agendas of german music executives . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans music lovers have proven more loyal to the cd than their us counterparts germany accounts for 6.6 percent of global music sales and is therefore the world 's fourth largest music market . it comes in behind the us -lrb- with 36.2 percent -rrb- , japan -lrb- 16.6 percent -rrb- and great britain -lrb- 10.2 percent -rrb- . back to the roots both berger and lieberberg argued that it is not just the responsibility of that industry to get back to its roots - that is , the artists and their music - but also its ticket to survival in unstable economic times . " it 's the bigger companies that are investing significant amounts of money in new talents , " said berger .
he added that mergers within the industry - including the one announced just last week in the us between the world 's largest concert promoter live nation and ticketmaster - could lead to a kind of " renaissance . " with turnovers of 110 million euros -lrb- $ 153 million -rrb- and nearly 300 million euros last year respectively , however , the marek lieberberg concert agency and sony music gsa are indeed speaking from privileged positions and have the resources to take risks on new talent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berger predicted that the finance crisis would affect music consumers ' choices this year " we have to bring back music into the minds and into the hearts of the people , " said lieberberg .
" what i was raised on was music being a trigger for the liberation of society .
music was our release to dreams that we had - socially , politically , sexually .
all of this was triggered by music .
for us , music paved the way for a more liberal , a better life that awarded more rights to young people . " born in 1946 , the self-made impresario began his career in 1970 - on the heels of the 1968 student protests - with a concert by the who in muenster , germany . idealism or capitalism ? " we can not rule art in the same way we rule the rest of the economy , " said lieberberg .
but whether the search for the next chart-busting musician is more about art than profit remains to be seen . either way , music lovers in germany can still expect to find cds by the new stars , at least for a few more years . author : kate bowen editor : sam edmonds send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the two south asian neighbours india and pakistan have been at loggerheads since the partition of the subcontinent in 1947 .
the conflict over kashmir and militant attacks have fuelled animosity between them for a long time . after terrorists trained in pakistan wreaked havoc in mumbai during a three day assault in november 2008 , the media in both countries took a far more hawkish stance than their governments , whipping up nationalist sentiment and emotions .
the indian government , for instance , slammed the media and even threatened to restrict press freedoms .
now , however , a year on , the times of india and pakistan 's jang group have decided to take a different approach .
their initiative ' aman ki asha ' or ' hope for peace ' aims at spreading the message of peace by utilizing the strong common bonds of music , art and literature that both countries share .
the groups ' newspapers devoted their full first page to the topic on new year 's day this year .
since then the initiative has been a regular feature of their electronic and print output .
videos show the things that people love and cherish on both sides of the border .
' like brother and sister ' this has struck a chord with many people in the subcontinent .
sneh maria kovela is a pakistani woman now married to an indian man , but her visa for india was rejected on three occasions by the indian government . " india and pakistan are two different nations , but we are like brother and sister , " she says .
" everybody fights in their home but nobody wants to prolong the fight .
if we ca n't visit our neighbors , we are nothing . "
the media campaign , which includes exchange programs in different fields , is targeted at common people .
but , says ranjan roy , coordinator of the initiative from the times of india , it will also put pressure on delhi and islamabad to get back to the negotiating table .
he stresses that the initiative is not affecting the way his paper covers news on a daily basis : " this is not impinging on our news coverage .
this is very different from the way we cover the day to day news . "
he says there could be further initiatives in the future like building up a news pool to share content .
at the moment , the state of diplomatic ties between the two countries does not allow either side to have full time correspondents on the other side of the mutual border .
a ' publicity blitz ' ? but critics in india and pakistan say the initiative is all just a big publicity campaign .
seema mustafa , a reputed commentator on political affairs from india , says it is hard to believe that the two media organisations , which have a record of jingoism , are now suddenly gearing up for a peace initiative : " obviously this has n't come from the media houses .
this has been delivered to them as part of what washington , new delhi and islamabad hope will be a big publicity blitz , under which they can then promote peace or at least talk of peace , while america focuses on the afghanistan-pakistan border . "
thousands of facebook followers but salima hashmi , a renowned painter and peace activist from lahore , is more upbeat .
she says the time has come for both the governments to find ways to bring peace in the subcontinent .
" both governments have been guilty in different parts of their respective countries of breeding people who use violence as a political weapon .
i think there must be a realisation that this is a common enemy . "
despite the criticism regarding the media-led peace initiative ' aman ki asha ' , facebook , the social networking site , records more than 8,000 followers on the project 's page .
this goes to show that a growing number of young people in india and pakistan sincerely want the media to make a positive contribution towards achieving a relaxation of tensions between the two countries .

the two south asian neighbours india and pakistan have been at loggerheads since the partition of the subcontinent in 1947 .
the conflict over kashmir and militant attacks have fuelled animosity between them for a long time . after terrorists trained in pakistan wreaked havoc in mumbai during a three day assault in november 2008 , the media in both countries took a far more hawkish stance than their governments , whipping up nationalist sentiment and emotions .
the indian government , for instance , slammed the media and even threatened to restrict press freedoms .
now , however , a year on , the times of india and pakistan 's jang group have decided to take a different approach .
their initiative ' aman ki asha ' or ' hope for peace ' aims at spreading the message of peace by utilizing the strong common bonds of music , art and literature that both countries share .
the groups ' newspapers devoted their full first page to the topic on new year 's day this year .
since then the initiative has been a regular feature of their electronic and print output .
videos show the things that people love and cherish on both sides of the border .
' like brother and sister ' this has struck a chord with many people in the subcontinent .
sneh maria kovela is a pakistani woman now married to an indian man , but her visa for india was rejected on three occasions by the indian government . " india and pakistan are two different nations , but we are like brother and sister , " she says .
" everybody fights in their home but nobody wants to prolong the fight .
if we ca n't visit our neighbors , we are nothing . "
the media campaign , which includes exchange programs in different fields , is targeted at common people .
but , says ranjan roy , coordinator of the initiative from the times of india , it will also put pressure on delhi and islamabad to get back to the negotiating table .
he stresses that the initiative is not affecting the way his paper covers news on a daily basis : " this is not impinging on our news coverage .
this is very different from the way we cover the day to day news . "
he says there could be further initiatives in the future like building up a news pool to share content .
at the moment , the state of diplomatic ties between the two countries does not allow either side to have full time correspondents on the other side of the mutual border .
a ' publicity blitz ' ? but critics in india and pakistan say the initiative is all just a big publicity campaign .
seema mustafa , a reputed commentator on political affairs from india , says it is hard to believe that the two media organisations , which have a record of jingoism , are now suddenly gearing up for a peace initiative : " obviously this has n't come from the media houses .
this has been delivered to them as part of what washington , new delhi and islamabad hope will be a big publicity blitz , under which they can then promote peace or at least talk of peace , while america focuses on the afghanistan-pakistan border . "
thousands of facebook followers but salima hashmi , a renowned painter and peace activist from lahore , is more upbeat .
she says the time has come for both the governments to find ways to bring peace in the subcontinent .
" both governments have been guilty in different parts of their respective countries of breeding people who use violence as a political weapon .
i think there must be a realisation that this is a common enemy . "
despite the criticism regarding the media-led peace initiative ' aman ki asha ' , facebook , the social networking site , records more than 8,000 followers on the project 's page .
this goes to show that a growing number of young people in india and pakistan sincerely want the media to make a positive contribution towards achieving a relaxation of tensions between the two countries .

at 80 , he 's been awarded the sonning prize , denmark 's most respected literary award . enzensberg on tuesday received the 2010 sonning prize at a ceremony in copenhagen .
the biennial prize , which is intended to honor work that benefits european culture , is worth 134,000 euros -lrb- $ 187,000 -rrb- . the bavarian-born writer has left " considerable footprints in literature , essays and journalism , " said copenhagen university , which has awarded the sonning prize since 1950 . born on november 11 , 1929 , in kaufbeuren , enzensberger grew up in the southern german city of nuremberg , where the nazis regularly held their conventions .
at a young age , he witnessed the rise and fall of the third reich and the victory of the allies - experiences which would leave an impression on him . after the second world war , enzensberger was employed as an interpreter for american soldiers ; studied philosophy and literature in germany and france and lived for a time in norway .

he made headlines in 2003 by publically defending the invasion of iraq , comparing the iraqi dictator saddam hussein to adolf hitler . and in the last two years alone , he published a children 's book , " bibs , " two essays and a piece of prose entitled " the silences of hammerstein . "
the latter is a partly fictional , partly factual account of a real-life nazi general and the few who refused to share in the party 's spoils . enzensberger joins a long line of prestigious sonning prize winners , including winston churchill -lrb- 1950 -rrb- , theologian karl barth -lrb- 1963 -rrb- , publicist hannah arendt -lrb- 1975 -rrb- , philosopher juergen habermas -lrb- 1987 -rrb- and writer guenter grass -lrb- 1996 -rrb- . click on the links below to read samples of enzensberger 's work in english . kjb / dpad / epd / kna / ap editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

polish authorities have already arrested five local men in the case , but they have previously identified hoegstroem as the mastermind behind the theft .
the european arrest warrant obliges any european union member state to hand over hoegstroem within 90 days of his arrest . the measure replaces the traditional extradition process , which in the past could take years of legal stalling . the measure has been on the eu books since 2005 , but this is throught to be the first major case in which it is being put to use .

the sign , a worldwide symbol of the atrocities of nazi germany , was later found by police cut into three pieces . the theft of the sign sparked international outrage , especially in israel .
up to 1.5 million people , mostly jews , died at auschwitz during nazi germany 's occupation of poland in world war ii .

the " sauerland cell , " uncovered and arrested in 2007 , was germany 's first example of home-grown islamist terrorism . the geman-born leader of the so-called sauerland cell , fritz gelowicz , showed germany that islamist terror was a problem in its own back yard .
the 30-year-old islam convert and his three accomplices , german daniel schneider , turkish-german attila selek , and turk adem yilmaz were captured in the west german region of sauerland in 2007 , with vast stockpiles of hydrogen peroxide , suitable for making car bombs and other explosives .
they said they planned to attack us military targets based in germany , and that events in the so-called " war on terror " had motivated them to take up arms .
" my client said that this decision came in 2004 , " gelowicz 's lawyer dirk uden told the regional high court in dusseldorf .
he explained that the us arrest and torture of a dual nationality german-lebanese car dealer chalid el-masri – who was not involved in terrorist activity – was the main reason gelowicz decided to begin working for the islamic jihad union , a splinter terror group with its roots in uzbekistan .
" he saw the pictures of abu ghraib , the pictures from guantanamo bay , and especially the fate of chalid el-masri , which he heard about through personal connections before it became common knowledge , and these things really influenced him .
these events supported his decision to embark upon an armed jihad . "
historic plea bargain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this hydrogen peroxide was to be made into lethal bombs in exchange for shortened sentences , the group 's members agreed to discuss their plans , and their time at a terror training camp in pakistani region of waziristan , close to the afghan border .
" the confessions of the accused were the most comprehensive talks concerning terrorism ever heard in a german court of law , " the director of the institute of terrorism research and security policy in essen , rolf tophoven , told deutsche welle .
" they gave an exact description of what was going on in the terror training camps in pakistan . "
it 's unclear how the group will plead , but daniel schneider has indicated he will probably plead guilty on attempted murder charges for shooting at a policeman trying to arrest him , acknowledging that the skirmish could easily " have had a deadly ending . "
a final verdict in the trial , which has lasted roughly nine months so far , is expected in march .
terror concerns in germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daniel schneider has admitted to trying to kill a policeman there has not yet been a successful islamist terror attack in germany , however , experts concur that the country 's military engagement in afghanistan means it is considered a viable target .
" we are in the sights of islamists because of the 4,500 soldiers posted in afghanistan , and our other anti-terrorist operations , " said tophoven .
" from the point of view of the terrorists , there are good reasons to attack germany , and were an attack here ever to succeed , i am sure that the mission in afghanistan would be used as justification for it . "
tophoven also says it should come as no surprise that the sauerland cell was a home-grown organization , led by german converts to islam .
" a minority of converts to a new religion want to prove that they are tougher than the people born into the religion .
they want to establish themselves and prove their conviction in their new faith , and this can lead to extremism . "

the " sauerland cell , " uncovered and arrested in 2007 , was germany 's first example of home-grown islamist terrorism . the geman-born leader of the so-called sauerland cell , fritz gelowicz , showed germany that islamist terror was a problem in its own back yard .
the 30-year-old islam convert and his three accomplices , german daniel schneider , turkish-german attila selek , and turk adem yilmaz were captured in the west german region of sauerland in 2007 , with vast stockpiles of hydrogen peroxide , suitable for making car bombs and other explosives .
they said they planned to attack us military targets based in germany , and that events in the so-called " war on terror " had motivated them to take up arms .
" my client said that this decision came in 2004 , " gelowicz 's lawyer dirk uden told the regional high court in dusseldorf .
he explained that the us arrest and torture of a dual nationality german-lebanese car dealer chalid el-masri – who was not involved in terrorist activity – was the main reason gelowicz decided to begin working for the islamic jihad union , a splinter terror group with its roots in uzbekistan .
" he saw the pictures of abu ghraib , the pictures from guantanamo bay , and especially the fate of chalid el-masri , which he heard about through personal connections before it became common knowledge , and these things really influenced him .
these events supported his decision to embark upon an armed jihad . "
historic plea bargain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this hydrogen peroxide was to be made into lethal bombs in exchange for shortened sentences , the group 's members agreed to discuss their plans , and their time at a terror training camp in pakistani region of waziristan , close to the afghan border .
" the confessions of the accused were the most comprehensive talks concerning terrorism ever heard in a german court of law , " the director of the institute of terrorism research and security policy in essen , rolf tophoven , told deutsche welle .
" they gave an exact description of what was going on in the terror training camps in pakistan . "
it 's unclear how the group will plead , but daniel schneider has indicated he will probably plead guilty on attempted murder charges for shooting at a policeman trying to arrest him , acknowledging that the skirmish could easily " have had a deadly ending . "
a final verdict in the trial , which has lasted roughly nine months so far , is expected in march .
terror concerns in germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daniel schneider has admitted to trying to kill a policeman there has not yet been a successful islamist terror attack in germany , however , experts concur that the country 's military engagement in afghanistan means it is considered a viable target .
" we are in the sights of islamists because of the 4,500 soldiers posted in afghanistan , and our other anti-terrorist operations , " said tophoven .
" from the point of view of the terrorists , there are good reasons to attack germany , and were an attack here ever to succeed , i am sure that the mission in afghanistan would be used as justification for it . "
tophoven also says it should come as no surprise that the sauerland cell was a home-grown organization , led by german converts to islam .
" a minority of converts to a new religion want to prove that they are tougher than the people born into the religion .
they want to establish themselves and prove their conviction in their new faith , and this can lead to extremism . "

but new research suggests the price war may soon end as the chains exhaust opportunities for domestic growth . according to german market researcher gfk , lidl was able to increase its share of the country 's 150-billion-euro food market by only 0.1 percent in 2009 to 9.8 percent .
archrival aldi was hit even harder : the discounter saw its market share drop last year to 18.4 percent from 19 percent .
revenue was down four percent – perhaps the biggest sales dip in the company 's history . the reasons for the stagnation are n't just the economic and financial crisis , which has forced numerous consumers to spend less and spend wisely .
the discounters , which include penny and the newly merged plus and netto group , have squeezed prices for numerous fast-moving consumer products to record lows and expanded store networks massively in large and small cities alike .
there are fewer and fewer opportunities to achieve a competitive edge in both areas , according to gfk food retail specialist wolfgang twardawa . “ every household in germany is within 10 minutes of a discounter by car , ” twardawa said .
“ and just look at butter prices .
penny has lowered its price from 99 cents for a 250-gram package to 80 cents .
nobody in the production chain is going to make money at that price . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cheap milk helps aldi attracts customers " brutal food retail market " independent retail consultant ulrich eggert says germany “ is a brutal food retail market . ” food prices in the country , he notes , are 15 percent below the european average .
“ nowhere in europe can consumers buy food more cheaply than they can in germany , ” he said . not surprisingly , sales margins of german discounters are low .
market researcher twardawa puts them at between 1-2 percent .
the one exception , he said , is aldi , with margins believed to be around 4 percent .
by comparison , sales margins in the uk are between 6-7 percent . until now , german discounters have experienced only growth .
with more than 16,000 stores across the country , they currently control 46.4 percent of the country 's food market .
that growth is largely the result of aggressive pricing .
aldi was the first grocer to feature rock-bottom pricing by offering a limited inventory and squeezing out all necessary costs , from butcher shops to fancy displays .
around 15 years later , lidl entered the market with a similar strategy . supermarkets under pressure much of the discounters ' growth has come at the expense of german supermarkets , in particular edeka and rewe .
both , however , have pursued a dual-pronged strategy to counter the competition . on the one hand , they have sought to win back customers willing to spend a little more money with service , ambience and a broad assortment of high-quality products , including fresh produce .
and they appear to be succeeding : their market share in 2009 rose slightly for the first time in years to 23.7 percent , according to gfk . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : supermarkets like rewe offer a wider product range than the discounters on the other hand , with an eye to consumers who need to spend even less , the two supermarkets have adopted the attitude “ if you can beat ‘ em , join ‘ em . ” both edeka and rewe have entered the discount fray with their own dedicated chains .
consultant eggert said he expects the newly merged plus and netto discount stores , owned by edeka , will emerge as a major challenger to aldi and lidl . a threat to diversity ? the increased competition could lead to even greater price pressure on suppliers , warns matthias horst , president of the federation of german food and drink industries -lrb- bve -rrb- .
“ we can see that the last round of price cuts has n't really done anything for aldi and lidl , ” he said . “ we are concerned about the negative impact that these endless price wars could have on the some 5,000 food suppliers in germany .
many of them may no longer be able to meet the conditions of the big discounters .
there could be consolidation and we could lose the rich diversity we currently have in the supplier sector . ” the new discounters do n't seem to be too worried as they scramble for market share in germany .
nor do the established giants aldi and lidl ; as they continue to slug it out and try to stay ahead of the newcomers by expanding outside the country , where they face not only less competition but also fatter sales margins . for sure , german discounters are providing consumers – for better or for worse – plenty of food for thought . author : john blau editor : sam edmonds send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but new research suggests the price war may soon end as the chains exhaust opportunities for domestic growth . according to german market researcher gfk , lidl was able to increase its share of the country 's 150-billion-euro food market by only 0.1 percent in 2009 to 9.8 percent .
archrival aldi was hit even harder : the discounter saw its market share drop last year to 18.4 percent from 19 percent .
revenue was down four percent – perhaps the biggest sales dip in the company 's history . the reasons for the stagnation are n't just the economic and financial crisis , which has forced numerous consumers to spend less and spend wisely .
the discounters , which include penny and the newly merged plus and netto group , have squeezed prices for numerous fast-moving consumer products to record lows and expanded store networks massively in large and small cities alike .
there are fewer and fewer opportunities to achieve a competitive edge in both areas , according to gfk food retail specialist wolfgang twardawa . “ every household in germany is within 10 minutes of a discounter by car , ” twardawa said .
“ and just look at butter prices .
penny has lowered its price from 99 cents for a 250-gram package to 80 cents .
nobody in the production chain is going to make money at that price . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cheap milk helps aldi attracts customers " brutal food retail market " independent retail consultant ulrich eggert says germany “ is a brutal food retail market . ” food prices in the country , he notes , are 15 percent below the european average .
“ nowhere in europe can consumers buy food more cheaply than they can in germany , ” he said . not surprisingly , sales margins of german discounters are low .
market researcher twardawa puts them at between 1-2 percent .
the one exception , he said , is aldi , with margins believed to be around 4 percent .
by comparison , sales margins in the uk are between 6-7 percent . until now , german discounters have experienced only growth .
with more than 16,000 stores across the country , they currently control 46.4 percent of the country 's food market .
that growth is largely the result of aggressive pricing .
aldi was the first grocer to feature rock-bottom pricing by offering a limited inventory and squeezing out all necessary costs , from butcher shops to fancy displays .
around 15 years later , lidl entered the market with a similar strategy . supermarkets under pressure much of the discounters ' growth has come at the expense of german supermarkets , in particular edeka and rewe .
both , however , have pursued a dual-pronged strategy to counter the competition . on the one hand , they have sought to win back customers willing to spend a little more money with service , ambience and a broad assortment of high-quality products , including fresh produce .
and they appear to be succeeding : their market share in 2009 rose slightly for the first time in years to 23.7 percent , according to gfk . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : supermarkets like rewe offer a wider product range than the discounters on the other hand , with an eye to consumers who need to spend even less , the two supermarkets have adopted the attitude “ if you can beat ‘ em , join ‘ em . ” both edeka and rewe have entered the discount fray with their own dedicated chains .
consultant eggert said he expects the newly merged plus and netto discount stores , owned by edeka , will emerge as a major challenger to aldi and lidl . a threat to diversity ? the increased competition could lead to even greater price pressure on suppliers , warns matthias horst , president of the federation of german food and drink industries -lrb- bve -rrb- .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de asia -pipe- 02.02.2010 media propagate ' hope for peace ' in south asia großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people-to-people contacts : indian sikhs on the way to pakistan the ' times of india ' and the pakistani ' jang ' group have come up with a peace initiative between india and pakistan - a first time the media have taken such a step .
the two south asian neighbours india and pakistan have been at loggerheads since the partition of the subcontinent in 1947 .
the conflict over kashmir and militant attacks have fuelled animosity between them for a long time . after terrorists trained in pakistan wreaked havoc in mumbai during a three day assault in november 2008 , the media in both countries took a far more hawkish stance than their governments , whipping up nationalist sentiment and emotions .
the indian government , for instance , slammed the media and even threatened to restrict press freedoms .
now , however , a year on , the times of india and pakistan 's jang group have decided to take a different approach .
their initiative ' aman ki asha ' or ' hope for peace ' aims at spreading the message of peace by utilizing the strong common bonds of music , art and literature that both countries share .
the groups ' newspapers devoted their full first page to the topic on new year 's day this year .
since then the initiative has been a regular feature of their electronic and print output .
videos show the things that people love and cherish on both sides of the border .
' like brother and sister ' this has struck a chord with many people in the subcontinent .
sneh maria kovela is a pakistani woman now married to an indian man , but her visa for india was rejected on three occasions by the indian government . " india and pakistan are two different nations , but we are like brother and sister , " she says .
" everybody fights in their home but nobody wants to prolong the fight .
if we ca n't visit our neighbors , we are nothing . "
the media campaign , which includes exchange programs in different fields , is targeted at common people .
but , says ranjan roy , coordinator of the initiative from the times of india , it will also put pressure on delhi and islamabad to get back to the negotiating table .
he stresses that the initiative is not affecting the way his paper covers news on a daily basis : " this is not impinging on our news coverage .
this is very different from the way we cover the day to day news . "
he says there could be further initiatives in the future like building up a news pool to share content .
at the moment , the state of diplomatic ties between the two countries does not allow either side to have full time correspondents on the other side of the mutual border .
a ' publicity blitz ' ? but critics in india and pakistan say the initiative is all just a big publicity campaign .
seema mustafa , a reputed commentator on political affairs from india , says it is hard to believe that the two media organisations , which have a record of jingoism , are now suddenly gearing up for a peace initiative : " obviously this has n't come from the media houses .
this has been delivered to them as part of what washington , new delhi and islamabad hope will be a big publicity blitz , under which they can then promote peace or at least talk of peace , while america focuses on the afghanistan-pakistan border . "
thousands of facebook followers but salima hashmi , a renowned painter and peace activist from lahore , is more upbeat .
she says the time has come for both the governments to find ways to bring peace in the subcontinent .
" both governments have been guilty in different parts of their respective countries of breeding people who use violence as a political weapon .
i think there must be a realisation that this is a common enemy . "
despite the criticism regarding the media-led peace initiative ' aman ki asha ' , facebook , the social networking site , records more than 8,000 followers on the project 's page .

the two south asian neighbours india and pakistan have been at loggerheads since the partition of the subcontinent in 1947 .
the conflict over kashmir and militant attacks have fuelled animosity between them for a long time . after terrorists trained in pakistan wreaked havoc in mumbai during a three day assault in november 2008 , the media in both countries took a far more hawkish stance than their governments , whipping up nationalist sentiment and emotions .
the indian government , for instance , slammed the media and even threatened to restrict press freedoms .
now , however , a year on , the times of india and pakistan 's jang group have decided to take a different approach .
their initiative ' aman ki asha ' or ' hope for peace ' aims at spreading the message of peace by utilizing the strong common bonds of music , art and literature that both countries share .
the groups ' newspapers devoted their full first page to the topic on new year 's day this year .
since then the initiative has been a regular feature of their electronic and print output .
videos show the things that people love and cherish on both sides of the border .
' like brother and sister ' this has struck a chord with many people in the subcontinent .
sneh maria kovela is a pakistani woman now married to an indian man , but her visa for india was rejected on three occasions by the indian government . " india and pakistan are two different nations , but we are like brother and sister , " she says .
" everybody fights in their home but nobody wants to prolong the fight .
if we ca n't visit our neighbors , we are nothing . "
the media campaign , which includes exchange programs in different fields , is targeted at common people .
but , says ranjan roy , coordinator of the initiative from the times of india , it will also put pressure on delhi and islamabad to get back to the negotiating table .
he stresses that the initiative is not affecting the way his paper covers news on a daily basis : " this is not impinging on our news coverage .
this is very different from the way we cover the day to day news . "
he says there could be further initiatives in the future like building up a news pool to share content .
at the moment , the state of diplomatic ties between the two countries does not allow either side to have full time correspondents on the other side of the mutual border .
a ' publicity blitz ' ? but critics in india and pakistan say the initiative is all just a big publicity campaign .
seema mustafa , a reputed commentator on political affairs from india , says it is hard to believe that the two media organisations , which have a record of jingoism , are now suddenly gearing up for a peace initiative : " obviously this has n't come from the media houses .
this has been delivered to them as part of what washington , new delhi and islamabad hope will be a big publicity blitz , under which they can then promote peace or at least talk of peace , while america focuses on the afghanistan-pakistan border . "
thousands of facebook followers but salima hashmi , a renowned painter and peace activist from lahore , is more upbeat .
she says the time has come for both the governments to find ways to bring peace in the subcontinent .
" both governments have been guilty in different parts of their respective countries of breeding people who use violence as a political weapon .
i think there must be a realisation that this is a common enemy . "

the move has been criticized by the opposition as a further curbing of freedom of speech and information under the authoritarian regime . belarusian president alexander lukashenko has signed an order to further monitor internet use in the country dubbed by critics as europe 's last dictatorship .
" to ensure the security of the state and it 's citizens , from july 1 , 2010 internet service providers will be required to identify devices used to connect to the internet and keep information on those devices and the services provided , " the new decree reads .
under the decree personal data and profiles of internet users will be collected and service providers can be asked to block access to any website within 24 hours .
the country 's authoritarian regime has justified its decision by quoting a need to " fight against everything illegal and to improve the security of the this country and its citizens . "
the country 's opposition has denounced the move as yet another attack on the freedom of speech and information designed to shut them out from any media access ahead of next year 's election .
' an enemy of the internet ' the move further tightens the government 's grip on communications in the country .
in january , lukashenko authorized an analysis center to define what information could be made available on the internet and to monitor traffic .
reporters without borders has strongly criticized the analysis center , saying the move would make the country " fall to the level of north korea and china … as an enemy of the internet . "
the internet has been a key source of information in belarus as most independent newspapers , television and radio stations have been closed down during lukashenko 's 15 years in power. ai / dpa / afp editor : rob turner send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

polish authorities have already arrested five local men in the case , but they have previously identified hoegstroem as the mastermind behind the theft .
the european arrest warrant obliges any european union member state to hand over hoegstroem within 90 days of his arrest . the measure replaces the traditional extradition process , which in the past could take years of legal stalling . the measure has been on the eu books since 2005 , but this is throught to be the first major case in which it is being put to use .
theft sparked outrage the five-meter -lrb- 16 feet -rrb- wrought iron sign - the german words on which translate as " work sets you free " - was stolen in december from above the gate to the concentration camp .
the sign , a worldwide symbol of the atrocities of nazi germany , was later found by police cut into three pieces . the theft of the sign sparked international outrage , especially in israel .
up to 1.5 million people , mostly jews , died at auschwitz during nazi germany 's occupation of poland in world war ii .
the recovered sign is now being repaired . a replica had to be put up last week at the ceremonies commemorating the 65th liberation of auschwitz by soviet troops . mm / afp / dpa / reuters editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the move has been criticized by the opposition as a further curbing of freedom of speech and information under the authoritarian regime . belarusian president alexander lukashenko has signed an order to further monitor internet use in the country dubbed by critics as europe 's last dictatorship .

under the decree personal data and profiles of internet users will be collected and service providers can be asked to block access to any website within 24 hours .
the country 's authoritarian regime has justified its decision by quoting a need to " fight against everything illegal and to improve the security of the this country and its citizens . "
the country 's opposition has denounced the move as yet another attack on the freedom of speech and information designed to shut them out from any media access ahead of next year 's election .
' an enemy of the internet ' the move further tightens the government 's grip on communications in the country .
in january , lukashenko authorized an analysis center to define what information could be made available on the internet and to monitor traffic .
reporters without borders has strongly criticized the analysis center , saying the move would make the country " fall to the level of north korea and china … as an enemy of the internet . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de terrorism -pipe- 02.02.2010 prosecutors prepare closing arguments in major geman terror trial großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german fritz gelowicz led the " sauerland group " the trial of four men who planned attacks on us military targets in germany is drawing to an end .
the " sauerland cell , " uncovered and arrested in 2007 , was germany 's first example of home-grown islamist terrorism . the geman-born leader of the so-called sauerland cell , fritz gelowicz , showed germany that islamist terror was a problem in its own back yard .
the 30-year-old islam convert and his three accomplices , german daniel schneider , turkish-german attila selek , and turk adem yilmaz were captured in the west german region of sauerland in 2007 , with vast stockpiles of hydrogen peroxide , suitable for making car bombs and other explosives .
they said they planned to attack us military targets based in germany , and that events in the so-called " war on terror " had motivated them to take up arms .
" my client said that this decision came in 2004 , " gelowicz 's lawyer dirk uden told the regional high court in dusseldorf .
he explained that the us arrest and torture of a dual nationality german-lebanese car dealer chalid el-masri – who was not involved in terrorist activity – was the main reason gelowicz decided to begin working for the islamic jihad union , a splinter terror group with its roots in uzbekistan .
" he saw the pictures of abu ghraib , the pictures from guantanamo bay , and especially the fate of chalid el-masri , which he heard about through personal connections before it became common knowledge , and these things really influenced him .
these events supported his decision to embark upon an armed jihad . "
historic plea bargain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this hydrogen peroxide was to be made into lethal bombs in exchange for shortened sentences , the group 's members agreed to discuss their plans , and their time at a terror training camp in pakistani region of waziristan , close to the afghan border .
" the confessions of the accused were the most comprehensive talks concerning terrorism ever heard in a german court of law , " the director of the institute of terrorism research and security policy in essen , rolf tophoven , told deutsche welle .
" they gave an exact description of what was going on in the terror training camps in pakistan . "
it 's unclear how the group will plead , but daniel schneider has indicated he will probably plead guilty on attempted murder charges for shooting at a policeman trying to arrest him , acknowledging that the skirmish could easily " have had a deadly ending . "
a final verdict in the trial , which has lasted roughly nine months so far , is expected in march .
terror concerns in germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daniel schneider has admitted to trying to kill a policeman there has not yet been a successful islamist terror attack in germany , however , experts concur that the country 's military engagement in afghanistan means it is considered a viable target .
" we are in the sights of islamists because of the 4,500 soldiers posted in afghanistan , and our other anti-terrorist operations , " said tophoven .
" from the point of view of the terrorists , there are good reasons to attack germany , and were an attack here ever to succeed , i am sure that the mission in afghanistan would be used as justification for it . "
tophoven also says it should come as no surprise that the sauerland cell was a home-grown organization , led by german converts to islam .
" a minority of converts to a new religion want to prove that they are tougher than the people born into the religion .
they want to establish themselves and prove their conviction in their new faith , and this can lead to extremism . "

the " sauerland cell , " uncovered and arrested in 2007 , was germany 's first example of home-grown islamist terrorism . the geman-born leader of the so-called sauerland cell , fritz gelowicz , showed germany that islamist terror was a problem in its own back yard .
the 30-year-old islam convert and his three accomplices , german daniel schneider , turkish-german attila selek , and turk adem yilmaz were captured in the west german region of sauerland in 2007 , with vast stockpiles of hydrogen peroxide , suitable for making car bombs and other explosives .
they said they planned to attack us military targets based in germany , and that events in the so-called " war on terror " had motivated them to take up arms .
" my client said that this decision came in 2004 , " gelowicz 's lawyer dirk uden told the regional high court in dusseldorf .
he explained that the us arrest and torture of a dual nationality german-lebanese car dealer chalid el-masri – who was not involved in terrorist activity – was the main reason gelowicz decided to begin working for the islamic jihad union , a splinter terror group with its roots in uzbekistan .
" he saw the pictures of abu ghraib , the pictures from guantanamo bay , and especially the fate of chalid el-masri , which he heard about through personal connections before it became common knowledge , and these things really influenced him .
these events supported his decision to embark upon an armed jihad . "
historic plea bargain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this hydrogen peroxide was to be made into lethal bombs in exchange for shortened sentences , the group 's members agreed to discuss their plans , and their time at a terror training camp in pakistani region of waziristan , close to the afghan border .
" the confessions of the accused were the most comprehensive talks concerning terrorism ever heard in a german court of law , " the director of the institute of terrorism research and security policy in essen , rolf tophoven , told deutsche welle .
" they gave an exact description of what was going on in the terror training camps in pakistan . "
it 's unclear how the group will plead , but daniel schneider has indicated he will probably plead guilty on attempted murder charges for shooting at a policeman trying to arrest him , acknowledging that the skirmish could easily " have had a deadly ending . "
a final verdict in the trial , which has lasted roughly nine months so far , is expected in march .
terror concerns in germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daniel schneider has admitted to trying to kill a policeman there has not yet been a successful islamist terror attack in germany , however , experts concur that the country 's military engagement in afghanistan means it is considered a viable target .
" we are in the sights of islamists because of the 4,500 soldiers posted in afghanistan , and our other anti-terrorist operations , " said tophoven .
" from the point of view of the terrorists , there are good reasons to attack germany , and were an attack here ever to succeed , i am sure that the mission in afghanistan would be used as justification for it . "
tophoven also says it should come as no surprise that the sauerland cell was a home-grown organization , led by german converts to islam .
" a minority of converts to a new religion want to prove that they are tougher than the people born into the religion .
they want to establish themselves and prove their conviction in their new faith , and this can lead to extremism . "

the " sauerland cell , " uncovered and arrested in 2007 , was germany 's first example of home-grown islamist terrorism . the geman-born leader of the so-called sauerland cell , fritz gelowicz , showed germany that islamist terror was a problem in its own back yard .
the 30-year-old islam convert and his three accomplices , german daniel schneider , turkish-german attila selek , and turk adem yilmaz were captured in the west german region of sauerland in 2007 , with vast stockpiles of hydrogen peroxide , suitable for making car bombs and other explosives .
they said they planned to attack us military targets based in germany , and that events in the so-called " war on terror " had motivated them to take up arms .
" my client said that this decision came in 2004 , " gelowicz 's lawyer dirk uden told the regional high court in dusseldorf .
he explained that the us arrest and torture of a dual nationality german-lebanese car dealer chalid el-masri – who was not involved in terrorist activity – was the main reason gelowicz decided to begin working for the islamic jihad union , a splinter terror group with its roots in uzbekistan .
" he saw the pictures of abu ghraib , the pictures from guantanamo bay , and especially the fate of chalid el-masri , which he heard about through personal connections before it became common knowledge , and these things really influenced him .
these events supported his decision to embark upon an armed jihad . "
historic plea bargain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this hydrogen peroxide was to be made into lethal bombs in exchange for shortened sentences , the group 's members agreed to discuss their plans , and their time at a terror training camp in pakistani region of waziristan , close to the afghan border .
" the confessions of the accused were the most comprehensive talks concerning terrorism ever heard in a german court of law , " the director of the institute of terrorism research and security policy in essen , rolf tophoven , told deutsche welle .
" they gave an exact description of what was going on in the terror training camps in pakistan . "
it 's unclear how the group will plead , but daniel schneider has indicated he will probably plead guilty on attempted murder charges for shooting at a policeman trying to arrest him , acknowledging that the skirmish could easily " have had a deadly ending . "
a final verdict in the trial , which has lasted roughly nine months so far , is expected in march .
terror concerns in germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daniel schneider has admitted to trying to kill a policeman there has not yet been a successful islamist terror attack in germany , however , experts concur that the country 's military engagement in afghanistan means it is considered a viable target .
" we are in the sights of islamists because of the 4,500 soldiers posted in afghanistan , and our other anti-terrorist operations , " said tophoven .
" from the point of view of the terrorists , there are good reasons to attack germany , and were an attack here ever to succeed , i am sure that the mission in afghanistan would be used as justification for it . "
tophoven also says it should come as no surprise that the sauerland cell was a home-grown organization , led by german converts to islam .
" a minority of converts to a new religion want to prove that they are tougher than the people born into the religion .
they want to establish themselves and prove their conviction in their new faith , and this can lead to extremism . "

the move has been criticized by the opposition as a further curbing of freedom of speech and information under the authoritarian regime . belarusian president alexander lukashenko has signed an order to further monitor internet use in the country dubbed by critics as europe 's last dictatorship .
" to ensure the security of the state and it 's citizens , from july 1 , 2010 internet service providers will be required to identify devices used to connect to the internet and keep information on those devices and the services provided , " the new decree reads .
under the decree personal data and profiles of internet users will be collected and service providers can be asked to block access to any website within 24 hours .
the country 's authoritarian regime has justified its decision by quoting a need to " fight against everything illegal and to improve the security of the this country and its citizens . "
the country 's opposition has denounced the move as yet another attack on the freedom of speech and information designed to shut them out from any media access ahead of next year 's election .
' an enemy of the internet ' the move further tightens the government 's grip on communications in the country .
in january , lukashenko authorized an analysis center to define what information could be made available on the internet and to monitor traffic .
reporters without borders has strongly criticized the analysis center , saying the move would make the country " fall to the level of north korea and china … as an enemy of the internet . "
the internet has been a key source of information in belarus as most independent newspapers , television and radio stations have been closed down during lukashenko 's 15 years in power. ai / dpa / afp editor : rob turner send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

at 80 , he 's been awarded the sonning prize , denmark 's most respected literary award . enzensberg on tuesday received the 2010 sonning prize at a ceremony in copenhagen .
the biennial prize , which is intended to honor work that benefits european culture , is worth 134,000 euros -lrb- $ 187,000 -rrb- . the bavarian-born writer has left " considerable footprints in literature , essays and journalism , " said copenhagen university , which has awarded the sonning prize since 1950 . born on november 11 , 1929 , in kaufbeuren , enzensberger grew up in the southern german city of nuremberg , where the nazis regularly held their conventions .
at a young age , he witnessed the rise and fall of the third reich and the victory of the allies - experiences which would leave an impression on him . after the second world war , enzensberger was employed as an interpreter for american soldiers ; studied philosophy and literature in germany and france and lived for a time in norway .

he made headlines in 2003 by publically defending the invasion of iraq , comparing the iraqi dictator saddam hussein to adolf hitler . and in the last two years alone , he published a children 's book , " bibs , " two essays and a piece of prose entitled " the silences of hammerstein . "

the move has been criticized by the opposition as a further curbing of freedom of speech and information under the authoritarian regime . belarusian president alexander lukashenko has signed an order to further monitor internet use in the country dubbed by critics as europe 's last dictatorship .
" to ensure the security of the state and it 's citizens , from july 1 , 2010 internet service providers will be required to identify devices used to connect to the internet and keep information on those devices and the services provided , " the new decree reads .
under the decree personal data and profiles of internet users will be collected and service providers can be asked to block access to any website within 24 hours .
the country 's authoritarian regime has justified its decision by quoting a need to " fight against everything illegal and to improve the security of the this country and its citizens . "
the country 's opposition has denounced the move as yet another attack on the freedom of speech and information designed to shut them out from any media access ahead of next year 's election .

but opel management says unions are twisting the figures as its parent company gm looks to secure government funding . opel 's european works council says general motors ' decision to restructure the german-based carmaker may require even more layoffs than previously expected . following a meeting with the company 's chief executive nick reilly , labor leaders said in a statement that the number of jobs at risk throughout europe is 2,000 higher than the 8,300 positions already on the chopping block .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opel ceo nick reilly wants a downsizing agreement by mid-february unions say germany and belgium are likely to be hit the hardest in terms of total number of cuts under the revised plan . some 4,800 people would be laid off in germany , including members of management , while the closure of the opel manufacturing plant in antwerp would cost another 2,600 jobs .
opel management has rejected the labor leaders ' criticism as unreasonable , arguing that the 2,000 ' additional ' losses were actually early retirement deals unrelated to restructuring efforts . a company spokesman told the german press agency dpa that opel was sticking to its original plan to cut 8,300 jobs across europe as it reduces production by 20 percent in response to weakened demand for vehicles .
looking for loans reuters news agency quoted labor leaders who said they learned in the meeting with reilly that opel no longer planned to reduce management costs by 35 percent and that , on the contrary , new management staff has been hired .
last week ceo reilly announced he wanted to reach an agreement with the works council by mid-february on a plan to help the carmaker shrink to a profitable size .
however , labor leaders have frozen negotiations with gm over the automaker 's proposal to make 265 million euros -lrb- $ 372.1 million -rrb- in annual wage cuts across the continent over the next five years , insisting that the antwerp plant should stay open .
gm has also asked for 2.7 billion euros in state aid in the form of either loans or loan guarantees to help finance the 3.3 billion euro revamp .
reilly said that all countries that host major opel manufacturing sites , with the exception of belgium , have indicated they remain open in principle to extending state funding .
opel is expected to submit a formal aid application to germany within the next few days , once the company obtains the required independent expert opinion on the viability of reilly 's plan .
reilly has said that opel currently has enough liquidity to operate " well into the second quarter . " mrm / reuters / dpa editor : sam edmonds send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the move has been criticized by the opposition as a further curbing of freedom of speech and information under the authoritarian regime . belarusian president alexander lukashenko has signed an order to further monitor internet use in the country dubbed by critics as europe 's last dictatorship .
" to ensure the security of the state and it 's citizens , from july 1 , 2010 internet service providers will be required to identify devices used to connect to the internet and keep information on those devices and the services provided , " the new decree reads .
under the decree personal data and profiles of internet users will be collected and service providers can be asked to block access to any website within 24 hours .
the country 's authoritarian regime has justified its decision by quoting a need to " fight against everything illegal and to improve the security of the this country and its citizens . "
the country 's opposition has denounced the move as yet another attack on the freedom of speech and information designed to shut them out from any media access ahead of next year 's election .
' an enemy of the internet ' the move further tightens the government 's grip on communications in the country .
in january , lukashenko authorized an analysis center to define what information could be made available on the internet and to monitor traffic .
reporters without borders has strongly criticized the analysis center , saying the move would make the country " fall to the level of north korea and china … as an enemy of the internet . "

but new research suggests the price war may soon end as the chains exhaust opportunities for domestic growth . according to german market researcher gfk , lidl was able to increase its share of the country 's 150-billion-euro food market by only 0.1 percent in 2009 to 9.8 percent .
archrival aldi was hit even harder : the discounter saw its market share drop last year to 18.4 percent from 19 percent .
revenue was down four percent – perhaps the biggest sales dip in the company 's history . the reasons for the stagnation are n't just the economic and financial crisis , which has forced numerous consumers to spend less and spend wisely .
the discounters , which include penny and the newly merged plus and netto group , have squeezed prices for numerous fast-moving consumer products to record lows and expanded store networks massively in large and small cities alike .
there are fewer and fewer opportunities to achieve a competitive edge in both areas , according to gfk food retail specialist wolfgang twardawa . “ every household in germany is within 10 minutes of a discounter by car , ” twardawa said .
“ and just look at butter prices .
penny has lowered its price from 99 cents for a 250-gram package to 80 cents .
nobody in the production chain is going to make money at that price . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cheap milk helps aldi attracts customers " brutal food retail market " independent retail consultant ulrich eggert says germany “ is a brutal food retail market . ” food prices in the country , he notes , are 15 percent below the european average .
“ nowhere in europe can consumers buy food more cheaply than they can in germany , ” he said . not surprisingly , sales margins of german discounters are low .
market researcher twardawa puts them at between 1-2 percent .
the one exception , he said , is aldi , with margins believed to be around 4 percent .
by comparison , sales margins in the uk are between 6-7 percent . until now , german discounters have experienced only growth .
with more than 16,000 stores across the country , they currently control 46.4 percent of the country 's food market .
that growth is largely the result of aggressive pricing .
aldi was the first grocer to feature rock-bottom pricing by offering a limited inventory and squeezing out all necessary costs , from butcher shops to fancy displays .
around 15 years later , lidl entered the market with a similar strategy . supermarkets under pressure much of the discounters ' growth has come at the expense of german supermarkets , in particular edeka and rewe .
both , however , have pursued a dual-pronged strategy to counter the competition . on the one hand , they have sought to win back customers willing to spend a little more money with service , ambience and a broad assortment of high-quality products , including fresh produce .
and they appear to be succeeding : their market share in 2009 rose slightly for the first time in years to 23.7 percent , according to gfk . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : supermarkets like rewe offer a wider product range than the discounters on the other hand , with an eye to consumers who need to spend even less , the two supermarkets have adopted the attitude “ if you can beat ‘ em , join ‘ em . ” both edeka and rewe have entered the discount fray with their own dedicated chains .
consultant eggert said he expects the newly merged plus and netto discount stores , owned by edeka , will emerge as a major challenger to aldi and lidl . a threat to diversity ? the increased competition could lead to even greater price pressure on suppliers , warns matthias horst , president of the federation of german food and drink industries -lrb- bve -rrb- .
“ we can see that the last round of price cuts has n't really done anything for aldi and lidl , ” he said . “ we are concerned about the negative impact that these endless price wars could have on the some 5,000 food suppliers in germany .
many of them may no longer be able to meet the conditions of the big discounters .
there could be consolidation and we could lose the rich diversity we currently have in the supplier sector . ” the new discounters do n't seem to be too worried as they scramble for market share in germany .
nor do the established giants aldi and lidl ; as they continue to slug it out and try to stay ahead of the newcomers by expanding outside the country , where they face not only less competition but also fatter sales margins . for sure , german discounters are providing consumers – for better or for worse – plenty of food for thought . author : john blau editor : sam edmonds send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

schumacher also admitted it was a strange feeling to be lining up against his old ferrari team .
" yes , naturally i suddenly see my car , my old car , on the track and i 'm not sitting in it .
it 's a strange sensation , " he said .
mercedes took over the brawn gp team , with whom britain 's jenson button won the 2009 world drivers ' title , following the end of last season .
schumacher has now teamed up with former team owner ross brawn , the 55-year-old briton who was in schumacher 's pits for all seven of his world title wins - two at benetton and five at ferrari .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de retail -pipe- 02.02.2010 german discount grocers struggle to sustain growth großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lidl is trying to steal market share from aldi with bargain-basement prices german food prices are the lowest in europe thanks to fierce competition from discounters like aldi and lidl .
but new research suggests the price war may soon end as the chains exhaust opportunities for domestic growth . according to german market researcher gfk , lidl was able to increase its share of the country 's 150-billion-euro food market by only 0.1 percent in 2009 to 9.8 percent .
archrival aldi was hit even harder : the discounter saw its market share drop last year to 18.4 percent from 19 percent .
revenue was down four percent – perhaps the biggest sales dip in the company 's history . the reasons for the stagnation are n't just the economic and financial crisis , which has forced numerous consumers to spend less and spend wisely .
the discounters , which include penny and the newly merged plus and netto group , have squeezed prices for numerous fast-moving consumer products to record lows and expanded store networks massively in large and small cities alike .
there are fewer and fewer opportunities to achieve a competitive edge in both areas , according to gfk food retail specialist wolfgang twardawa . “ every household in germany is within 10 minutes of a discounter by car , ” twardawa said .
“ and just look at butter prices .
penny has lowered its price from 99 cents for a 250-gram package to 80 cents .
nobody in the production chain is going to make money at that price . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cheap milk helps aldi attracts customers " brutal food retail market " independent retail consultant ulrich eggert says germany “ is a brutal food retail market . ” food prices in the country , he notes , are 15 percent below the european average .
“ nowhere in europe can consumers buy food more cheaply than they can in germany , ” he said . not surprisingly , sales margins of german discounters are low .
market researcher twardawa puts them at between 1-2 percent .
the one exception , he said , is aldi , with margins believed to be around 4 percent .
by comparison , sales margins in the uk are between 6-7 percent . until now , german discounters have experienced only growth .
with more than 16,000 stores across the country , they currently control 46.4 percent of the country 's food market .
that growth is largely the result of aggressive pricing .
aldi was the first grocer to feature rock-bottom pricing by offering a limited inventory and squeezing out all necessary costs , from butcher shops to fancy displays .
around 15 years later , lidl entered the market with a similar strategy . supermarkets under pressure much of the discounters ' growth has come at the expense of german supermarkets , in particular edeka and rewe .
both , however , have pursued a dual-pronged strategy to counter the competition . on the one hand , they have sought to win back customers willing to spend a little more money with service , ambience and a broad assortment of high-quality products , including fresh produce .
and they appear to be succeeding : their market share in 2009 rose slightly for the first time in years to 23.7 percent , according to gfk . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : supermarkets like rewe offer a wider product range than the discounters on the other hand , with an eye to consumers who need to spend even less , the two supermarkets have adopted the attitude “ if you can beat ‘ em , join ‘ em . ” both edeka and rewe have entered the discount fray with their own dedicated chains .
consultant eggert said he expects the newly merged plus and netto discount stores , owned by edeka , will emerge as a major challenger to aldi and lidl . a threat to diversity ? the increased competition could lead to even greater price pressure on suppliers , warns matthias horst , president of the federation of german food and drink industries -lrb- bve -rrb- .
“ we can see that the last round of price cuts has n't really done anything for aldi and lidl , ” he said . “ we are concerned about the negative impact that these endless price wars could have on the some 5,000 food suppliers in germany .
many of them may no longer be able to meet the conditions of the big discounters .
there could be consolidation and we could lose the rich diversity we currently have in the supplier sector . ” the new discounters do n't seem to be too worried as they scramble for market share in germany .
nor do the established giants aldi and lidl ; as they continue to slug it out and try to stay ahead of the newcomers by expanding outside the country , where they face not only less competition but also fatter sales margins . for sure , german discounters are providing consumers – for better or for worse – plenty of food for thought . author : john blau editor : sam edmonds send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but new research suggests the price war may soon end as the chains exhaust opportunities for domestic growth . according to german market researcher gfk , lidl was able to increase its share of the country 's 150-billion-euro food market by only 0.1 percent in 2009 to 9.8 percent .
archrival aldi was hit even harder : the discounter saw its market share drop last year to 18.4 percent from 19 percent .
revenue was down four percent – perhaps the biggest sales dip in the company 's history . the reasons for the stagnation are n't just the economic and financial crisis , which has forced numerous consumers to spend less and spend wisely .
the discounters , which include penny and the newly merged plus and netto group , have squeezed prices for numerous fast-moving consumer products to record lows and expanded store networks massively in large and small cities alike .
there are fewer and fewer opportunities to achieve a competitive edge in both areas , according to gfk food retail specialist wolfgang twardawa . “ every household in germany is within 10 minutes of a discounter by car , ” twardawa said .
“ and just look at butter prices .
penny has lowered its price from 99 cents for a 250-gram package to 80 cents .
nobody in the production chain is going to make money at that price . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cheap milk helps aldi attracts customers " brutal food retail market " independent retail consultant ulrich eggert says germany “ is a brutal food retail market . ” food prices in the country , he notes , are 15 percent below the european average .
“ nowhere in europe can consumers buy food more cheaply than they can in germany , ” he said . not surprisingly , sales margins of german discounters are low .
market researcher twardawa puts them at between 1-2 percent .
the one exception , he said , is aldi , with margins believed to be around 4 percent .
by comparison , sales margins in the uk are between 6-7 percent . until now , german discounters have experienced only growth .
with more than 16,000 stores across the country , they currently control 46.4 percent of the country 's food market .
that growth is largely the result of aggressive pricing .
aldi was the first grocer to feature rock-bottom pricing by offering a limited inventory and squeezing out all necessary costs , from butcher shops to fancy displays .
around 15 years later , lidl entered the market with a similar strategy . supermarkets under pressure much of the discounters ' growth has come at the expense of german supermarkets , in particular edeka and rewe .
