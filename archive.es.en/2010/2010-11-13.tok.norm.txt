signs of waning support by former loyalists could mean his days in office are numbered . italy 's largest opposition party has stepped up in its promise to seek a no-confidence vote on prime minister silvio berlusconi , setting the scene for a fight in parliament that could end the 74-year-old media mogul 's political career .
the opposition democratic party , led by dario franceschini , submitted the no-confidence motion friday in the lower chamber of deputies with the support of the allied italy of values party .
the date of the vote has not yet been set .
" berlusconi 's days are numbered , " said italy of values politician leoluca orlando .
" soon italy will free itself from a cancer that has destroyed its national economy , covered it with filth and thrown its moral value into the dirt . "
berlusconi 's ally-turned-rival and speaker of parliament gianfranco fini , who recently created his own future and freedom for italy party , called on the prime minister to resign at a party conference on sunday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fini will be key when the confidence vote comes berlusconi has repeatedly refused to leave office unless he loses a no-confidence vote , despite a number of sex scandals that have caused his popularity to sink to an all-time low .
ministers to resign intensifying berlusconi 's political troubles , italian media reported on friday that four government ministers loyal to fini would submit their resignations to the prime minister next week .
italo bocchino , spokesman for future and freedom for italy , repeated fini 's calls for the prime minister to resign .
" on monday berlusconi will find on his desk the resignation papers of our ministers , " he said on a news program .
" he should take note and resign . "
balance of power such resignations would leave berlusconi without sufficient support , bocchino added , meaning the prime minister would ultimately have to ask italian president giorgio napolitano for his resignation as well .
this would not be obligatory , but the resignations would at least force a reshuffle of berlusconi 's cabinet .
berlusconi survived a confidence vote in september with the support of fini 's party , which appears to hold the balance of power ahead of the upcoming vote .
in a sign of waning loyalty for the prime minister , fini loyalists withheld support on an immigration bill sponsored by the government earlier in the week .
the current parliament 's mandate expires in 2013 , but losing the confidence vote could bring about snap parliamentary elections .
parliament is still obligated to pass the 2011 budget law by year 's end , which may force the confidence vote to be delayed .

several thousand jubilant supporters streamed to her residence . myanmar democracy leader aung san suu kyi appeared at the gate of her house on saturday waving and smiling after being officially released from house arrest , a detention that lasted 15 of the past 21 years . " we must work together in unison , " she told the sea of jubilant supporters , suggesting she has no intention of giving up her long fight for democracy in what is one of the world 's oldest dictatorships . police cars arrived at suu kyi 's compound about 5:30 p.m. local time and sent officials in to deliver her release papers . global rejoice her release has been welcomed by several world leaders , including german chancellor angela merkel , un secretary general ban ki-moon , us president barack obama and british prime minister david cameron . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a supporter of myanmar 's detained opposition leader cheers merkel voiced her relief at suu kyi 's release , saying she was " a symbol of the worldwide fight to apply human rights . " " her non-violence and persistence have made her into a much-admired example , " merkel remarked , while also calling on myanmar 's ruling junta to release more than 2,000 other political prisoners in the country . european commission president jose manuel barroso said he was " delighted " at suu kyi 's release and also urged the " unconditional release " of all other political prisoners . earlier , crowds of suu kyi supporters had come to her lakeside home , where she has spent much of the past two decades under house arrest . armed police stood by as over a thousand people gathered near the crumbling mansion in the hope of catching a glimpse of the 65-year-old nobel peace prize winner . hundreds more gathered at her party 's headquarters , many wearing t-shirts bearing her image and the words : " we stand with aung san suu kyi . " release viewed as junta 's attempt to tame critics suu kyi is still seen as the biggest threat to the junta after almost five decades of military dictatorship in myanmar , which was formerly known as burma . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : myanmar junta leader than shwe has seen to it that suu kyi remained locked away some observers believe her release could come with restrictions to ensure she can not threaten the generals or the military-backed government . us-based advocacy group freedom now , which serves as suu kyi 's international counsel , welcomed her release , but said it was " virtually meaningless until the junta enters into an irreversible process of dialog resulting in national reconciliation between the junta , -lsb- suu kyi 's -rsb- national league for democracy and ethnic groups , and a restoration of democracy to -lsb- myanmar -rsb- . " the group 's head , jared genser , pointed out that suu kyi has been released three times previously " and nothing fundamental changed in the country . " human rights watchdog amnesty international , meanwhile , said suu kyi 's freedom " is by no means a concession on the part of the authorities . " " the fact remains that the authorities should never have arrested her or the many other prisoners of conscience in burma in the first place , locking them out of the political process , " an amnesty statement said . reactive move bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there is still a groundswell of support for suu kyi 's national league for democracy party suu kyi 's freedom is seen by international observers as an effort by the regime to dampen widespread condemnation of sunday 's election , the first since 1990 when the national league for democracy won 392 of 485 parliamentary seats . the military refused to relinquish power , however , and placed the charismatic and popular suu kyi under house arrest for " endangering the state . " despite international condemnation and numerous calls for her release , suu kyi has been in prison or under house arrest for 15 years . her sentence was extended in 2009 after an american man swam uninvited across the lake next to her house and stayed for two nights .
critics say the charges were used to keep suu kyi 's influence out of the 2010 election . western nations and pro-democracy activists have criticized the poll as anything but free and fair following widespread reports of intimidation and fraud . initial results show that the army-backed union solidarity and development party has already won a majority of the parliamentary seats available . author : gabriel borrud , darren mara -lrb- reuters , ap -rrb- editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

several thousand jubilant supporters streamed to her residence . myanmar democracy leader aung san suu kyi appeared at the gate of her house on saturday waving and smiling after being officially released from house arrest , a detention that lasted 15 of the past 21 years . " we must work together in unison , " she told the sea of jubilant supporters , suggesting she has no intention of giving up her long fight for democracy in what is one of the world 's oldest dictatorships . police cars arrived at suu kyi 's compound about 5:30 p.m. local time and sent officials in to deliver her release papers . global rejoice her release has been welcomed by several world leaders , including german chancellor angela merkel , un secretary general ban ki-moon , us president barack obama and british prime minister david cameron . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a supporter of myanmar 's detained opposition leader cheers merkel voiced her relief at suu kyi 's release , saying she was " a symbol of the worldwide fight to apply human rights . " " her non-violence and persistence have made her into a much-admired example , " merkel remarked , while also calling on myanmar 's ruling junta to release more than 2,000 other political prisoners in the country . european commission president jose manuel barroso said he was " delighted " at suu kyi 's release and also urged the " unconditional release " of all other political prisoners . earlier , crowds of suu kyi supporters had come to her lakeside home , where she has spent much of the past two decades under house arrest . armed police stood by as over a thousand people gathered near the crumbling mansion in the hope of catching a glimpse of the 65-year-old nobel peace prize winner . hundreds more gathered at her party 's headquarters , many wearing t-shirts bearing her image and the words : " we stand with aung san suu kyi . " release viewed as junta 's attempt to tame critics suu kyi is still seen as the biggest threat to the junta after almost five decades of military dictatorship in myanmar , which was formerly known as burma . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : myanmar junta leader than shwe has seen to it that suu kyi remained locked away some observers believe her release could come with restrictions to ensure she can not threaten the generals or the military-backed government . us-based advocacy group freedom now , which serves as suu kyi 's international counsel , welcomed her release , but said it was " virtually meaningless until the junta enters into an irreversible process of dialog resulting in national reconciliation between the junta , -lsb- suu kyi 's -rsb- national league for democracy and ethnic groups , and a restoration of democracy to -lsb- myanmar -rsb- . " the group 's head , jared genser , pointed out that suu kyi has been released three times previously " and nothing fundamental changed in the country . " human rights watchdog amnesty international , meanwhile , said suu kyi 's freedom " is by no means a concession on the part of the authorities . " " the fact remains that the authorities should never have arrested her or the many other prisoners of conscience in burma in the first place , locking them out of the political process , " an amnesty statement said . reactive move bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there is still a groundswell of support for suu kyi 's national league for democracy party suu kyi 's freedom is seen by international observers as an effort by the regime to dampen widespread condemnation of sunday 's election , the first since 1990 when the national league for democracy won 392 of 485 parliamentary seats . the military refused to relinquish power , however , and placed the charismatic and popular suu kyi under house arrest for " endangering the state . " despite international condemnation and numerous calls for her release , suu kyi has been in prison or under house arrest for 15 years . her sentence was extended in 2009 after an american man swam uninvited across the lake next to her house and stayed for two nights .
critics say the charges were used to keep suu kyi 's influence out of the 2010 election . western nations and pro-democracy activists have criticized the poll as anything but free and fair following widespread reports of intimidation and fraud . initial results show that the army-backed union solidarity and development party has already won a majority of the parliamentary seats available . author : gabriel borrud , darren mara -lrb- reuters , ap -rrb- editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the money was meant for growth-enhancing projects . investigators are looking into a possible misuse of european union funds after italian officials spent 720,000 euros -lrb- $ 985,000 -rrb- in development aid for a concert last year featuring elton john .
" we want to know right now about why this concert would need such funding , " eu regional funding spokesman ton van lierop said on friday , stressing that the funds were typically used to boost the economies of the eu 's poorer regions .
elton john performed in naples on september 11 , 2009 .
the show was part of the piedigrotta festival costing over 2.2 million euros , half of which came from eu regional funds .
it was not known whether john , one of the world 's most successful popular artists , was paid for the concert .
the case was brought to the attention of brussels authorities by mario borghezio , a european parliament deputy from the northern league , a party that has advocated secession of northern italy from the poorer south .
" it is time for certain southern regions to learn the lesson and realize that - in cases where the commission does not act on its own - we from the league will be ready to report to relevant eu authorities instances of misspending , " he borghezio said , referring to the " shameful misuse " of eu funds by the campania regional authority .
the eu allocates millions to help poorer regions catch up with more prosperous areas in the bloc .
for projects costing up to 50 million euros , funding decisions are up to local authorities .
in a written reply to a parliamentary question , eu regional funds commissioner johannes hahn told borghezio that if campania authorities fail to give satisfactory answers " they will have to de-certify the sums in question and deduct them from their next payment request . "

several thousand jubilant supporters streamed to her residence . myanmar democracy leader aung san suu kyi appeared at the gate of her house on saturday waving and smiling after being officially released from house arrest , a detention that lasted 15 of the past 21 years . " we must work together in unison , " she told the sea of jubilant supporters , suggesting she has no intention of giving up her long fight for democracy in what is one of the world 's oldest dictatorships . police cars arrived at suu kyi 's compound about 5:30 p.m. local time and sent officials in to deliver her release papers . global rejoice her release has been welcomed by several world leaders , including german chancellor angela merkel , un secretary general ban ki-moon , us president barack obama and british prime minister david cameron . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a supporter of myanmar 's detained opposition leader cheers merkel voiced her relief at suu kyi 's release , saying she was " a symbol of the worldwide fight to apply human rights . " " her non-violence and persistence have made her into a much-admired example , " merkel remarked , while also calling on myanmar 's ruling junta to release more than 2,000 other political prisoners in the country . european commission president jose manuel barroso said he was " delighted " at suu kyi 's release and also urged the " unconditional release " of all other political prisoners . earlier , crowds of suu kyi supporters had come to her lakeside home , where she has spent much of the past two decades under house arrest . armed police stood by as over a thousand people gathered near the crumbling mansion in the hope of catching a glimpse of the 65-year-old nobel peace prize winner . hundreds more gathered at her party 's headquarters , many wearing t-shirts bearing her image and the words : " we stand with aung san suu kyi . " release viewed as junta 's attempt to tame critics suu kyi is still seen as the biggest threat to the junta after almost five decades of military dictatorship in myanmar , which was formerly known as burma . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : myanmar junta leader than shwe has seen to it that suu kyi remained locked away some observers believe her release could come with restrictions to ensure she can not threaten the generals or the military-backed government . us-based advocacy group freedom now , which serves as suu kyi 's international counsel , welcomed her release , but said it was " virtually meaningless until the junta enters into an irreversible process of dialog resulting in national reconciliation between the junta , -lsb- suu kyi 's -rsb- national league for democracy and ethnic groups , and a restoration of democracy to -lsb- myanmar -rsb- . " the group 's head , jared genser , pointed out that suu kyi has been released three times previously " and nothing fundamental changed in the country . " human rights watchdog amnesty international , meanwhile , said suu kyi 's freedom " is by no means a concession on the part of the authorities . " " the fact remains that the authorities should never have arrested her or the many other prisoners of conscience in burma in the first place , locking them out of the political process , " an amnesty statement said . reactive move bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there is still a groundswell of support for suu kyi 's national league for democracy party suu kyi 's freedom is seen by international observers as an effort by the regime to dampen widespread condemnation of sunday 's election , the first since 1990 when the national league for democracy won 392 of 485 parliamentary seats . the military refused to relinquish power , however , and placed the charismatic and popular suu kyi under house arrest for " endangering the state . " despite international condemnation and numerous calls for her release , suu kyi has been in prison or under house arrest for 15 years . her sentence was extended in 2009 after an american man swam uninvited across the lake next to her house and stayed for two nights .
critics say the charges were used to keep suu kyi 's influence out of the 2010 election . western nations and pro-democracy activists have criticized the poll as anything but free and fair following widespread reports of intimidation and fraud . initial results show that the army-backed union solidarity and development party has already won a majority of the parliamentary seats available . author : gabriel borrud , darren mara -lrb- reuters , ap -rrb- editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the money was meant for growth-enhancing projects . investigators are looking into a possible misuse of european union funds after italian officials spent 720,000 euros -lrb- $ 985,000 -rrb- in development aid for a concert last year featuring elton john .
" we want to know right now about why this concert would need such funding , " eu regional funding spokesman ton van lierop said on friday , stressing that the funds were typically used to boost the economies of the eu 's poorer regions .
elton john performed in naples on september 11 , 2009 .
the show was part of the piedigrotta festival costing over 2.2 million euros , half of which came from eu regional funds .
it was not known whether john , one of the world 's most successful popular artists , was paid for the concert .
the case was brought to the attention of brussels authorities by mario borghezio , a european parliament deputy from the northern league , a party that has advocated secession of northern italy from the poorer south .
" it is time for certain southern regions to learn the lesson and realize that - in cases where the commission does not act on its own - we from the league will be ready to report to relevant eu authorities instances of misspending , " he borghezio said , referring to the " shameful misuse " of eu funds by the campania regional authority .
the eu allocates millions to help poorer regions catch up with more prosperous areas in the bloc .
for projects costing up to 50 million euros , funding decisions are up to local authorities .
in a written reply to a parliamentary question , eu regional funds commissioner johannes hahn told borghezio that if campania authorities fail to give satisfactory answers " they will have to de-certify the sums in question and deduct them from their next payment request . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de music -pipe- 13.11.2010 estonians keep their musical tradition alive großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : singing is an important art form for estonians with a long history of song festivals , estonia is a country where singing has served the purpose of both entertainment and political protest .
today 's young estonians are keeping up this tradition . the small baltic country of estonia has hundreds of choirs , which meet at schools , churches and even factories . many towns hold regular music festivals of their own , but the vocal climax for the country is the estonian song festival , which takes place every five years .
first held in 1869 , the event continued throughout estonia 's tumultuous history and now attracts tens of thousands of participants . music as a political tool at 34 , accomplished singer tomi rahula is too young to remember the worst of the soviet rule over estonia , which lasted from 1944 to 1991 , but he clearly recalls occasions when estonians used song to defy the soviet censors . " there were songs that we were supposed to sing about lenin and stalin , but when that singing ended people did n't go away - they started to sing songs that they were n't allowed to sing , " said rahula .
" -lsb- the authorities -rsb- could n't do anything because there were like 80,000 people . " with its strong economy and highly educated workforce , estonia has become the envy of many former soviet republics since its independence . even in the two decades since the fall of the soviet union , singing has not lost its significance in the republic . bildunterschrift : when the weather is good , music is taken outside across the spectrum rahula is the concertmaster and conductor of the tallinn boys choir , which was founded by his mother , lydia rahula , in 1988 .
the two of them work well together , in spite of - or perhaps because of - the family connection . " we feel the music very well -lsb- together -rsb- , " said lydia rahula .
" we can just look at each other and know .
it works - we have the same understanding , the same heart , although we have two heads . " the choir , made up of men and boys aged six to 36 , rehearses several times a week and performs more than 30 concerts per year .
everything from ave maria to african spirituals is included in their repertoire . as a child , tomi rahula was a choir boy , but also a composer .
in 1998 , he penned the tune estonia took to eurovision song contest , " the children of the sea . "
these days , he juggles his choir duties with his other role as keyboardist in the successful rock band the sun . " i perform in churches and in clubs and i see very intelligent people and very drunk people , " said rahula , laughing .
by living out his music career on both ends of the spectrum , he says he never gets bored . enduring passion while his style of music might change from day to day , fame has not changed him much , according to his friend and fellow choir member ants aguraiuja . " we were at the same school and he was one or two years younger , " said aguraiuja .
" we 've been singing with him for almost 30 years .
he 's the same . " at 36 , aguraiuja is the veteran of the tallinn boys choir .
he was scouted by lydia rahula at the tender age of six , and has followed her ever since .
" it has been a pleasure to sing and music gives my soul something that i need , " said aguraiuja . if the rest of estonia shares his sentiment , there is sure to be plenty of singing involved at next year 's celebrations of the country 's 20th anniversary of independence . author : karen percy , tallinn -lrb- ew -rrb- editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de music -pipe- 13.11.2010 estonians keep their musical tradition alive großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : singing is an important art form for estonians with a long history of song festivals , estonia is a country where singing has served the purpose of both entertainment and political protest .
today 's young estonians are keeping up this tradition . the small baltic country of estonia has hundreds of choirs , which meet at schools , churches and even factories . many towns hold regular music festivals of their own , but the vocal climax for the country is the estonian song festival , which takes place every five years .
first held in 1869 , the event continued throughout estonia 's tumultuous history and now attracts tens of thousands of participants . music as a political tool at 34 , accomplished singer tomi rahula is too young to remember the worst of the soviet rule over estonia , which lasted from 1944 to 1991 , but he clearly recalls occasions when estonians used song to defy the soviet censors . " there were songs that we were supposed to sing about lenin and stalin , but when that singing ended people did n't go away - they started to sing songs that they were n't allowed to sing , " said rahula .
" -lsb- the authorities -rsb- could n't do anything because there were like 80,000 people . " with its strong economy and highly educated workforce , estonia has become the envy of many former soviet republics since its independence . even in the two decades since the fall of the soviet union , singing has not lost its significance in the republic . bildunterschrift : when the weather is good , music is taken outside across the spectrum rahula is the concertmaster and conductor of the tallinn boys choir , which was founded by his mother , lydia rahula , in 1988 .
the two of them work well together , in spite of - or perhaps because of - the family connection . " we feel the music very well -lsb- together -rsb- , " said lydia rahula .
" we can just look at each other and know .
it works - we have the same understanding , the same heart , although we have two heads . " the choir , made up of men and boys aged six to 36 , rehearses several times a week and performs more than 30 concerts per year .
everything from ave maria to african spirituals is included in their repertoire . as a child , tomi rahula was a choir boy , but also a composer .
in 1998 , he penned the tune estonia took to eurovision song contest , " the children of the sea . "
these days , he juggles his choir duties with his other role as keyboardist in the successful rock band the sun . " i perform in churches and in clubs and i see very intelligent people and very drunk people , " said rahula , laughing .
by living out his music career on both ends of the spectrum , he says he never gets bored . enduring passion while his style of music might change from day to day , fame has not changed him much , according to his friend and fellow choir member ants aguraiuja . " we were at the same school and he was one or two years younger , " said aguraiuja .
" we 've been singing with him for almost 30 years .
he 's the same . " at 36 , aguraiuja is the veteran of the tallinn boys choir .
he was scouted by lydia rahula at the tender age of six , and has followed her ever since .
" it has been a pleasure to sing and music gives my soul something that i need , " said aguraiuja . if the rest of estonia shares his sentiment , there is sure to be plenty of singing involved at next year 's celebrations of the country 's 20th anniversary of independence . author : karen percy , tallinn -lrb- ew -rrb- editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 13.11.2010 italian opposition steps up in no-confidence motion on berlusconi großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there is no date yet set for berlusconi 's confidence vote things keep getting worse for italy 's prime minister silvio berlusconi , as he he faces another no-confidence vote in parliament .
signs of waning support by former loyalists could mean his days in office are numbered . italy 's largest opposition party has stepped up in its promise to seek a no-confidence vote on prime minister silvio berlusconi , setting the scene for a fight in parliament that could end the 74-year-old media mogul 's political career .
the opposition democratic party , led by dario franceschini , submitted the no-confidence motion friday in the lower chamber of deputies with the support of the allied italy of values party .
the date of the vote has not yet been set .
" berlusconi 's days are numbered , " said italy of values politician leoluca orlando .
" soon italy will free itself from a cancer that has destroyed its national economy , covered it with filth and thrown its moral value into the dirt . "
berlusconi 's ally-turned-rival and speaker of parliament gianfranco fini , who recently created his own future and freedom for italy party , called on the prime minister to resign at a party conference on sunday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fini will be key when the confidence vote comes berlusconi has repeatedly refused to leave office unless he loses a no-confidence vote , despite a number of sex scandals that have caused his popularity to sink to an all-time low .
ministers to resign intensifying berlusconi 's political troubles , italian media reported on friday that four government ministers loyal to fini would submit their resignations to the prime minister next week .
italo bocchino , spokesman for future and freedom for italy , repeated fini 's calls for the prime minister to resign .
" on monday berlusconi will find on his desk the resignation papers of our ministers , " he said on a news program .
" he should take note and resign . "
balance of power such resignations would leave berlusconi without sufficient support , bocchino added , meaning the prime minister would ultimately have to ask italian president giorgio napolitano for his resignation as well .
this would not be obligatory , but the resignations would at least force a reshuffle of berlusconi 's cabinet .
berlusconi survived a confidence vote in september with the support of fini 's party , which appears to hold the balance of power ahead of the upcoming vote .
in a sign of waning loyalty for the prime minister , fini loyalists withheld support on an immigration bill sponsored by the government earlier in the week .
the current parliament 's mandate expires in 2013 , but losing the confidence vote could bring about snap parliamentary elections .
parliament is still obligated to pass the 2011 budget law by year 's end , which may force the confidence vote to be delayed .

signs of waning support by former loyalists could mean his days in office are numbered . italy 's largest opposition party has stepped up in its promise to seek a no-confidence vote on prime minister silvio berlusconi , setting the scene for a fight in parliament that could end the 74-year-old media mogul 's political career .
the opposition democratic party , led by dario franceschini , submitted the no-confidence motion friday in the lower chamber of deputies with the support of the allied italy of values party .
the date of the vote has not yet been set .
" berlusconi 's days are numbered , " said italy of values politician leoluca orlando .
" soon italy will free itself from a cancer that has destroyed its national economy , covered it with filth and thrown its moral value into the dirt . "
berlusconi 's ally-turned-rival and speaker of parliament gianfranco fini , who recently created his own future and freedom for italy party , called on the prime minister to resign at a party conference on sunday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fini will be key when the confidence vote comes berlusconi has repeatedly refused to leave office unless he loses a no-confidence vote , despite a number of sex scandals that have caused his popularity to sink to an all-time low .
ministers to resign intensifying berlusconi 's political troubles , italian media reported on friday that four government ministers loyal to fini would submit their resignations to the prime minister next week .
italo bocchino , spokesman for future and freedom for italy , repeated fini 's calls for the prime minister to resign .
" on monday berlusconi will find on his desk the resignation papers of our ministers , " he said on a news program .
" he should take note and resign . "
balance of power such resignations would leave berlusconi without sufficient support , bocchino added , meaning the prime minister would ultimately have to ask italian president giorgio napolitano for his resignation as well .
this would not be obligatory , but the resignations would at least force a reshuffle of berlusconi 's cabinet .
berlusconi survived a confidence vote in september with the support of fini 's party , which appears to hold the balance of power ahead of the upcoming vote .
in a sign of waning loyalty for the prime minister , fini loyalists withheld support on an immigration bill sponsored by the government earlier in the week .
the current parliament 's mandate expires in 2013 , but losing the confidence vote could bring about snap parliamentary elections .
parliament is still obligated to pass the 2011 budget law by year 's end , which may force the confidence vote to be delayed .

the money was meant for growth-enhancing projects . investigators are looking into a possible misuse of european union funds after italian officials spent 720,000 euros -lrb- $ 985,000 -rrb- in development aid for a concert last year featuring elton john .
" we want to know right now about why this concert would need such funding , " eu regional funding spokesman ton van lierop said on friday , stressing that the funds were typically used to boost the economies of the eu 's poorer regions .
elton john performed in naples on september 11 , 2009 .
the show was part of the piedigrotta festival costing over 2.2 million euros , half of which came from eu regional funds .
it was not known whether john , one of the world 's most successful popular artists , was paid for the concert .
the case was brought to the attention of brussels authorities by mario borghezio , a european parliament deputy from the northern league , a party that has advocated secession of northern italy from the poorer south .
" it is time for certain southern regions to learn the lesson and realize that - in cases where the commission does not act on its own - we from the league will be ready to report to relevant eu authorities instances of misspending , " he borghezio said , referring to the " shameful misuse " of eu funds by the campania regional authority .
the eu allocates millions to help poorer regions catch up with more prosperous areas in the bloc .
for projects costing up to 50 million euros , funding decisions are up to local authorities .
in a written reply to a parliamentary question , eu regional funds commissioner johannes hahn told borghezio that if campania authorities fail to give satisfactory answers " they will have to de-certify the sums in question and deduct them from their next payment request . "

nuclear energy remains deeply unpopular in germany , witnessed most recently last week when tens of thousands protested the transfer of atomic waste from france to a storage facility in the north of germany . merkel has also been criticized from the rightist faction within her own party , who believe she has not been conservative enough in her leadership of the cdu and the country . author : darren mara -lrb- dpa , afp -rrb- editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we do n't want a republic in which powerful interest groups decide the guidelines of politics with their money , their power and their influence , " berthold huber , head of ig metall , germany 's largest trade union , told demonstrators in stuttgart . the union is demanding higher wages and the introduction of a minimum wage , arguing that ordinary germans should benefit most from the country 's economic upswing following the financial crisis . pressure mounts on coalition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel 's coalition government is trailing opposition parties in polls the protests were timed to coincide with the cdu 's annual party congress , at which it 's expected merkel will be reelected to the leadership .

just over a year into merkel 's second tenure as chancellor , many germans are angry over a lack of progress on key campaign promises . her center-right coalition now trails the center-left grouping of social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and greens in opinion polls . merkel 's government has also been dogged by infighting between the cdu and their government partners , the liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- and the cdu 's bavarian sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- . most recently , the public was angered when the merkel government decided to extend the lifespan of the country 's nuclear reactors .
nuclear energy remains deeply unpopular in germany , witnessed most recently last week when tens of thousands protested the transfer of atomic waste from france to a storage facility in the north of germany . merkel has also been criticized from the rightist faction within her own party , who believe she has not been conservative enough in her leadership of the cdu and the country . author : darren mara -lrb- dpa , afp -rrb- editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

twenty minutes later , us national team player michael bradley bagged ' gladbach 's second , with igor de camargo grabbing a third goal 12 minutes later , and bobadilla scoring a second for himself one minute into injury time .
the much-needed three points lifts ' gladbach off the foot of the league ladder into 17th place on 10 points .

wolfsburg let lead slip in wolfsburg , schalke claimed a point as they fought back from 2-0 down to draw at wolfsburg after strikers edin dzeko and grafite both scored for the hosts .
with the wolves cruising at 2-0 with half an hour played , schalke hit back with goals by brazil striker edu on 39 minutes and dutch striker klaas jan huntelaar , who scored his seventh goal of the season to equalize in the second half .
the result leaves in schalke 16th on 10 points and wolfsburg in 12th on 14 points .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfsburg could n't hold onto a two-goal lead the day 's fifth early game saw bremen - who were desperate for a win after a 6-0 thumping last week to stuttgart - play out a 0-0 draw with frankfurt at home .
the point for each team means both maintain their table positions , with bremen in 11th on 15 points , and frankfurt in fourth on 20 points .
in friday night 's game , dortmund were too good at home for hamburg , running out 2-0 winners , and consolidating their position at the head of the table .

" human rights watchdog amnesty international , meanwhile , said suu kyi 's freedom " is by no means a concession on the part of the authorities . " " the fact remains that the authorities should never have arrested her or the many other prisoners of conscience in burma in the first place , locking them out of the political process , " an amnesty statement said . reactive move bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there is still a groundswell of support for suu kyi 's national league for democracy party suu kyi 's freedom is seen by international observers as an effort by the regime to dampen widespread condemnation of sunday 's election , the first since 1990 when the national league for democracy won 392 of 485 parliamentary seats . the military refused to relinquish power , however , and placed the charismatic and popular suu kyi under house arrest for " endangering the state . " despite international condemnation and numerous calls for her release , suu kyi has been in prison or under house arrest for 15 years . her sentence was extended in 2009 after an american man swam uninvited across the lake next to her house and stayed for two nights .
critics say the charges were used to keep suu kyi 's influence out of the 2010 election . western nations and pro-democracy activists have criticized the poll as anything but free and fair following widespread reports of intimidation and fraud . initial results show that the army-backed union solidarity and development party has already won a majority of the parliamentary seats available . author : gabriel borrud , darren mara -lrb- reuters , ap -rrb- editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 13.11.2010 italian opposition steps up in no-confidence motion on berlusconi großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there is no date yet set for berlusconi 's confidence vote things keep getting worse for italy 's prime minister silvio berlusconi , as he he faces another no-confidence vote in parliament .
signs of waning support by former loyalists could mean his days in office are numbered . italy 's largest opposition party has stepped up in its promise to seek a no-confidence vote on prime minister silvio berlusconi , setting the scene for a fight in parliament that could end the 74-year-old media mogul 's political career .
the opposition democratic party , led by dario franceschini , submitted the no-confidence motion friday in the lower chamber of deputies with the support of the allied italy of values party .
the date of the vote has not yet been set .
" berlusconi 's days are numbered , " said italy of values politician leoluca orlando .
" soon italy will free itself from a cancer that has destroyed its national economy , covered it with filth and thrown its moral value into the dirt . "
berlusconi 's ally-turned-rival and speaker of parliament gianfranco fini , who recently created his own future and freedom for italy party , called on the prime minister to resign at a party conference on sunday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fini will be key when the confidence vote comes berlusconi has repeatedly refused to leave office unless he loses a no-confidence vote , despite a number of sex scandals that have caused his popularity to sink to an all-time low .
ministers to resign intensifying berlusconi 's political troubles , italian media reported on friday that four government ministers loyal to fini would submit their resignations to the prime minister next week .
italo bocchino , spokesman for future and freedom for italy , repeated fini 's calls for the prime minister to resign .
" on monday berlusconi will find on his desk the resignation papers of our ministers , " he said on a news program .
" he should take note and resign . "
balance of power such resignations would leave berlusconi without sufficient support , bocchino added , meaning the prime minister would ultimately have to ask italian president giorgio napolitano for his resignation as well .
this would not be obligatory , but the resignations would at least force a reshuffle of berlusconi 's cabinet .
berlusconi survived a confidence vote in september with the support of fini 's party , which appears to hold the balance of power ahead of the upcoming vote .
in a sign of waning loyalty for the prime minister , fini loyalists withheld support on an immigration bill sponsored by the government earlier in the week .
the current parliament 's mandate expires in 2013 , but losing the confidence vote could bring about snap parliamentary elections .
parliament is still obligated to pass the 2011 budget law by year 's end , which may force the confidence vote to be delayed .

signs of waning support by former loyalists could mean his days in office are numbered . italy 's largest opposition party has stepped up in its promise to seek a no-confidence vote on prime minister silvio berlusconi , setting the scene for a fight in parliament that could end the 74-year-old media mogul 's political career .
the opposition democratic party , led by dario franceschini , submitted the no-confidence motion friday in the lower chamber of deputies with the support of the allied italy of values party .
the date of the vote has not yet been set .
" berlusconi 's days are numbered , " said italy of values politician leoluca orlando .
" soon italy will free itself from a cancer that has destroyed its national economy , covered it with filth and thrown its moral value into the dirt . "
berlusconi 's ally-turned-rival and speaker of parliament gianfranco fini , who recently created his own future and freedom for italy party , called on the prime minister to resign at a party conference on sunday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fini will be key when the confidence vote comes berlusconi has repeatedly refused to leave office unless he loses a no-confidence vote , despite a number of sex scandals that have caused his popularity to sink to an all-time low .
ministers to resign intensifying berlusconi 's political troubles , italian media reported on friday that four government ministers loyal to fini would submit their resignations to the prime minister next week .
italo bocchino , spokesman for future and freedom for italy , repeated fini 's calls for the prime minister to resign .
" on monday berlusconi will find on his desk the resignation papers of our ministers , " he said on a news program .
" he should take note and resign . "
balance of power such resignations would leave berlusconi without sufficient support , bocchino added , meaning the prime minister would ultimately have to ask italian president giorgio napolitano for his resignation as well .
this would not be obligatory , but the resignations would at least force a reshuffle of berlusconi 's cabinet .
berlusconi survived a confidence vote in september with the support of fini 's party , which appears to hold the balance of power ahead of the upcoming vote .
in a sign of waning loyalty for the prime minister , fini loyalists withheld support on an immigration bill sponsored by the government earlier in the week .
the current parliament 's mandate expires in 2013 , but losing the confidence vote could bring about snap parliamentary elections .
parliament is still obligated to pass the 2011 budget law by year 's end , which may force the confidence vote to be delayed .

signs of waning support by former loyalists could mean his days in office are numbered . italy 's largest opposition party has stepped up in its promise to seek a no-confidence vote on prime minister silvio berlusconi , setting the scene for a fight in parliament that could end the 74-year-old media mogul 's political career .
the opposition democratic party , led by dario franceschini , submitted the no-confidence motion friday in the lower chamber of deputies with the support of the allied italy of values party .
the date of the vote has not yet been set .
" berlusconi 's days are numbered , " said italy of values politician leoluca orlando .
" soon italy will free itself from a cancer that has destroyed its national economy , covered it with filth and thrown its moral value into the dirt . "
berlusconi 's ally-turned-rival and speaker of parliament gianfranco fini , who recently created his own future and freedom for italy party , called on the prime minister to resign at a party conference on sunday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fini will be key when the confidence vote comes berlusconi has repeatedly refused to leave office unless he loses a no-confidence vote , despite a number of sex scandals that have caused his popularity to sink to an all-time low .
ministers to resign intensifying berlusconi 's political troubles , italian media reported on friday that four government ministers loyal to fini would submit their resignations to the prime minister next week .
italo bocchino , spokesman for future and freedom for italy , repeated fini 's calls for the prime minister to resign .
" on monday berlusconi will find on his desk the resignation papers of our ministers , " he said on a news program .
" he should take note and resign . "
balance of power such resignations would leave berlusconi without sufficient support , bocchino added , meaning the prime minister would ultimately have to ask italian president giorgio napolitano for his resignation as well .
this would not be obligatory , but the resignations would at least force a reshuffle of berlusconi 's cabinet .
berlusconi survived a confidence vote in september with the support of fini 's party , which appears to hold the balance of power ahead of the upcoming vote .
in a sign of waning loyalty for the prime minister , fini loyalists withheld support on an immigration bill sponsored by the government earlier in the week .
the current parliament 's mandate expires in 2013 , but losing the confidence vote could bring about snap parliamentary elections .
parliament is still obligated to pass the 2011 budget law by year 's end , which may force the confidence vote to be delayed .

today 's young estonians are keeping up this tradition . the small baltic country of estonia has hundreds of choirs , which meet at schools , churches and even factories . many towns hold regular music festivals of their own , but the vocal climax for the country is the estonian song festival , which takes place every five years .
first held in 1869 , the event continued throughout estonia 's tumultuous history and now attracts tens of thousands of participants . music as a political tool at 34 , accomplished singer tomi rahula is too young to remember the worst of the soviet rule over estonia , which lasted from 1944 to 1991 , but he clearly recalls occasions when estonians used song to defy the soviet censors . " there were songs that we were supposed to sing about lenin and stalin , but when that singing ended people did n't go away - they started to sing songs that they were n't allowed to sing , " said rahula .
" -lsb- the authorities -rsb- could n't do anything because there were like 80,000 people .

" we can just look at each other and know .
it works - we have the same understanding , the same heart , although we have two heads . " the choir , made up of men and boys aged six to 36 , rehearses several times a week and performs more than 30 concerts per year .
everything from ave maria to african spirituals is included in their repertoire . as a child , tomi rahula was a choir boy , but also a composer .
in 1998 , he penned the tune estonia took to eurovision song contest , " the children of the sea . "
these days , he juggles his choir duties with his other role as keyboardist in the successful rock band the sun . " i perform in churches and in clubs and i see very intelligent people and very drunk people , " said rahula , laughing .
by living out his music career on both ends of the spectrum , he says he never gets bored . enduring passion while his style of music might change from day to day , fame has not changed him much , according to his friend and fellow choir member ants aguraiuja . " we were at the same school and he was one or two years younger , " said aguraiuja .
" we 've been singing with him for almost 30 years .
he 's the same . " at 36 , aguraiuja is the veteran of the tallinn boys choir .
he was scouted by lydia rahula at the tender age of six , and has followed her ever since .
" it has been a pleasure to sing and music gives my soul something that i need , " said aguraiuja . if the rest of estonia shares his sentiment , there is sure to be plenty of singing involved at next year 's celebrations of the country 's 20th anniversary of independence . author : karen percy , tallinn -lrb- ew -rrb- editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

today 's young estonians are keeping up this tradition . the small baltic country of estonia has hundreds of choirs , which meet at schools , churches and even factories . many towns hold regular music festivals of their own , but the vocal climax for the country is the estonian song festival , which takes place every five years .

in cologne , the home team managed to hold on without conceding for 50 minutes in their clash with borussia moenchengladbach , but the floodgates opened once the visitors scored their opener through argentinean striker raul bobadilla .
twenty minutes later , us national team player michael bradley bagged ' gladbach 's second , with igor de camargo grabbing a third goal 12 minutes later , and bobadilla scoring a second for himself one minute into injury time .
the much-needed three points lifts ' gladbach off the foot of the league ladder into 17th place on 10 points .

with the wolves cruising at 2-0 with half an hour played , schalke hit back with goals by brazil striker edu on 39 minutes and dutch striker klaas jan huntelaar , who scored his seventh goal of the season to equalize in the second half .

signs of waning support by former loyalists could mean his days in office are numbered . italy 's largest opposition party has stepped up in its promise to seek a no-confidence vote on prime minister silvio berlusconi , setting the scene for a fight in parliament that could end the 74-year-old media mogul 's political career .
the opposition democratic party , led by dario franceschini , submitted the no-confidence motion friday in the lower chamber of deputies with the support of the allied italy of values party .
the date of the vote has not yet been set .
" berlusconi 's days are numbered , " said italy of values politician leoluca orlando .
" soon italy will free itself from a cancer that has destroyed its national economy , covered it with filth and thrown its moral value into the dirt . "
berlusconi 's ally-turned-rival and speaker of parliament gianfranco fini , who recently created his own future and freedom for italy party , called on the prime minister to resign at a party conference on sunday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fini will be key when the confidence vote comes berlusconi has repeatedly refused to leave office unless he loses a no-confidence vote , despite a number of sex scandals that have caused his popularity to sink to an all-time low .
ministers to resign intensifying berlusconi 's political troubles , italian media reported on friday that four government ministers loyal to fini would submit their resignations to the prime minister next week .
italo bocchino , spokesman for future and freedom for italy , repeated fini 's calls for the prime minister to resign .
" on monday berlusconi will find on his desk the resignation papers of our ministers , " he said on a news program .
" he should take note and resign . "
balance of power such resignations would leave berlusconi without sufficient support , bocchino added , meaning the prime minister would ultimately have to ask italian president giorgio napolitano for his resignation as well .
this would not be obligatory , but the resignations would at least force a reshuffle of berlusconi 's cabinet .
berlusconi survived a confidence vote in september with the support of fini 's party , which appears to hold the balance of power ahead of the upcoming vote .
in a sign of waning loyalty for the prime minister , fini loyalists withheld support on an immigration bill sponsored by the government earlier in the week .
the current parliament 's mandate expires in 2013 , but losing the confidence vote could bring about snap parliamentary elections .
parliament is still obligated to pass the 2011 budget law by year 's end , which may force the confidence vote to be delayed .

several thousand jubilant supporters streamed to her residence . myanmar democracy leader aung san suu kyi appeared at the gate of her house on saturday waving and smiling after being officially released from house arrest , a detention that lasted 15 of the past 21 years . " we must work together in unison , " she told the sea of jubilant supporters , suggesting she has no intention of giving up her long fight for democracy in what is one of the world 's oldest dictatorships . police cars arrived at suu kyi 's compound about 5:30 p.m. local time and sent officials in to deliver her release papers . global rejoice her release has been welcomed by several world leaders , including german chancellor angela merkel , un secretary general ban ki-moon , us president barack obama and british prime minister david cameron . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a supporter of myanmar 's detained opposition leader cheers merkel voiced her relief at suu kyi 's release , saying she was " a symbol of the worldwide fight to apply human rights . " " her non-violence and persistence have made her into a much-admired example , " merkel remarked , while also calling on myanmar 's ruling junta to release more than 2,000 other political prisoners in the country . european commission president jose manuel barroso said he was " delighted " at suu kyi 's release and also urged the " unconditional release " of all other political prisoners . earlier , crowds of suu kyi supporters had come to her lakeside home , where she has spent much of the past two decades under house arrest . armed police stood by as over a thousand people gathered near the crumbling mansion in the hope of catching a glimpse of the 65-year-old nobel peace prize winner . hundreds more gathered at her party 's headquarters , many wearing t-shirts bearing her image and the words : " we stand with aung san suu kyi . " release viewed as junta 's attempt to tame critics suu kyi is still seen as the biggest threat to the junta after almost five decades of military dictatorship in myanmar , which was formerly known as burma . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : myanmar junta leader than shwe has seen to it that suu kyi remained locked away some observers believe her release could come with restrictions to ensure she can not threaten the generals or the military-backed government . us-based advocacy group freedom now , which serves as suu kyi 's international counsel , welcomed her release , but said it was " virtually meaningless until the junta enters into an irreversible process of dialog resulting in national reconciliation between the junta , -lsb- suu kyi 's -rsb- national league for democracy and ethnic groups , and a restoration of democracy to -lsb- myanmar -rsb- . " the group 's head , jared genser , pointed out that suu kyi has been released three times previously " and nothing fundamental changed in the country . " human rights watchdog amnesty international , meanwhile , said suu kyi 's freedom " is by no means a concession on the part of the authorities .

" despite international condemnation and numerous calls for her release , suu kyi has been in prison or under house arrest for 15 years . her sentence was extended in 2009 after an american man swam uninvited across the lake next to her house and stayed for two nights .
critics say the charges were used to keep suu kyi 's influence out of the 2010 election . western nations and pro-democracy activists have criticized the poll as anything but free and fair following widespread reports of intimidation and fraud . initial results show that the army-backed union solidarity and development party has already won a majority of the parliamentary seats available . author : gabriel borrud , darren mara -lrb- reuters , ap -rrb- editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we do n't want a republic in which powerful interest groups decide the guidelines of politics with their money , their power and their influence , " berthold huber , head of ig metall , germany 's largest trade union , told demonstrators in stuttgart . the union is demanding higher wages and the introduction of a minimum wage , arguing that ordinary germans should benefit most from the country 's economic upswing following the financial crisis . pressure mounts on coalition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel 's coalition government is trailing opposition parties in polls the protests were timed to coincide with the cdu 's annual party congress , at which it 's expected merkel will be reelected to the leadership .

just over a year into merkel 's second tenure as chancellor , many germans are angry over a lack of progress on key campaign promises . her center-right coalition now trails the center-left grouping of social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and greens in opinion polls . merkel 's government has also been dogged by infighting between the cdu and their government partners , the liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- and the cdu 's bavarian sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- . most recently , the public was angered when the merkel government decided to extend the lifespan of the country 's nuclear reactors .
nuclear energy remains deeply unpopular in germany , witnessed most recently last week when tens of thousands protested the transfer of atomic waste from france to a storage facility in the north of germany . merkel has also been criticized from the rightist faction within her own party , who believe she has not been conservative enough in her leadership of the cdu and the country . author : darren mara -lrb- dpa , afp -rrb- editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

signs of waning support by former loyalists could mean his days in office are numbered . italy 's largest opposition party has stepped up in its promise to seek a no-confidence vote on prime minister silvio berlusconi , setting the scene for a fight in parliament that could end the 74-year-old media mogul 's political career .
the opposition democratic party , led by dario franceschini , submitted the no-confidence motion friday in the lower chamber of deputies with the support of the allied italy of values party .
the date of the vote has not yet been set .
" berlusconi 's days are numbered , " said italy of values politician leoluca orlando .
" soon italy will free itself from a cancer that has destroyed its national economy , covered it with filth and thrown its moral value into the dirt . "
berlusconi 's ally-turned-rival and speaker of parliament gianfranco fini , who recently created his own future and freedom for italy party , called on the prime minister to resign at a party conference on sunday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fini will be key when the confidence vote comes berlusconi has repeatedly refused to leave office unless he loses a no-confidence vote , despite a number of sex scandals that have caused his popularity to sink to an all-time low .
ministers to resign intensifying berlusconi 's political troubles , italian media reported on friday that four government ministers loyal to fini would submit their resignations to the prime minister next week .
italo bocchino , spokesman for future and freedom for italy , repeated fini 's calls for the prime minister to resign .
" on monday berlusconi will find on his desk the resignation papers of our ministers , " he said on a news program .
" he should take note and resign . "
balance of power such resignations would leave berlusconi without sufficient support , bocchino added , meaning the prime minister would ultimately have to ask italian president giorgio napolitano for his resignation as well .
this would not be obligatory , but the resignations would at least force a reshuffle of berlusconi 's cabinet .
berlusconi survived a confidence vote in september with the support of fini 's party , which appears to hold the balance of power ahead of the upcoming vote .
in a sign of waning loyalty for the prime minister , fini loyalists withheld support on an immigration bill sponsored by the government earlier in the week .
the current parliament 's mandate expires in 2013 , but losing the confidence vote could bring about snap parliamentary elections .
parliament is still obligated to pass the 2011 budget law by year 's end , which may force the confidence vote to be delayed .

several thousand jubilant supporters streamed to her residence . myanmar democracy leader aung san suu kyi appeared at the gate of her house on saturday waving and smiling after being officially released from house arrest , a detention that lasted 15 of the past 21 years . " we must work together in unison , " she told the sea of jubilant supporters , suggesting she has no intention of giving up her long fight for democracy in what is one of the world 's oldest dictatorships . police cars arrived at suu kyi 's compound about 5:30 p.m. local time and sent officials in to deliver her release papers . global rejoice her release has been welcomed by several world leaders , including german chancellor angela merkel , un secretary general ban ki-moon , us president barack obama and british prime minister david cameron . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a supporter of myanmar 's detained opposition leader cheers merkel voiced her relief at suu kyi 's release , saying she was " a symbol of the worldwide fight to apply human rights . " " her non-violence and persistence have made her into a much-admired example , " merkel remarked , while also calling on myanmar 's ruling junta to release more than 2,000 other political prisoners in the country . european commission president jose manuel barroso said he was " delighted " at suu kyi 's release and also urged the " unconditional release " of all other political prisoners . earlier , crowds of suu kyi supporters had come to her lakeside home , where she has spent much of the past two decades under house arrest . armed police stood by as over a thousand people gathered near the crumbling mansion in the hope of catching a glimpse of the 65-year-old nobel peace prize winner . hundreds more gathered at her party 's headquarters , many wearing t-shirts bearing her image and the words : " we stand with aung san suu kyi . " release viewed as junta 's attempt to tame critics suu kyi is still seen as the biggest threat to the junta after almost five decades of military dictatorship in myanmar , which was formerly known as burma . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : myanmar junta leader than shwe has seen to it that suu kyi remained locked away some observers believe her release could come with restrictions to ensure she can not threaten the generals or the military-backed government . us-based advocacy group freedom now , which serves as suu kyi 's international counsel , welcomed her release , but said it was " virtually meaningless until the junta enters into an irreversible process of dialog resulting in national reconciliation between the junta , -lsb- suu kyi 's -rsb- national league for democracy and ethnic groups , and a restoration of democracy to -lsb- myanmar -rsb- . " the group 's head , jared genser , pointed out that suu kyi has been released three times previously " and nothing fundamental changed in the country . " human rights watchdog amnesty international , meanwhile , said suu kyi 's freedom " is by no means a concession on the part of the authorities . " " the fact remains that the authorities should never have arrested her or the many other prisoners of conscience in burma in the first place , locking them out of the political process , " an amnesty statement said . reactive move bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there is still a groundswell of support for suu kyi 's national league for democracy party suu kyi 's freedom is seen by international observers as an effort by the regime to dampen widespread condemnation of sunday 's election , the first since 1990 when the national league for democracy won 392 of 485 parliamentary seats . the military refused to relinquish power , however , and placed the charismatic and popular suu kyi under house arrest for " endangering the state . " despite international condemnation and numerous calls for her release , suu kyi has been in prison or under house arrest for 15 years . her sentence was extended in 2009 after an american man swam uninvited across the lake next to her house and stayed for two nights .
critics say the charges were used to keep suu kyi 's influence out of the 2010 election . western nations and pro-democracy activists have criticized the poll as anything but free and fair following widespread reports of intimidation and fraud . initial results show that the army-backed union solidarity and development party has already won a majority of the parliamentary seats available . author : gabriel borrud , darren mara -lrb- reuters , ap -rrb- editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

today 's young estonians are keeping up this tradition . the small baltic country of estonia has hundreds of choirs , which meet at schools , churches and even factories . many towns hold regular music festivals of their own , but the vocal climax for the country is the estonian song festival , which takes place every five years .
first held in 1869 , the event continued throughout estonia 's tumultuous history and now attracts tens of thousands of participants . music as a political tool at 34 , accomplished singer tomi rahula is too young to remember the worst of the soviet rule over estonia , which lasted from 1944 to 1991 , but he clearly recalls occasions when estonians used song to defy the soviet censors . " there were songs that we were supposed to sing about lenin and stalin , but when that singing ended people did n't go away - they started to sing songs that they were n't allowed to sing , " said rahula .

these days , he juggles his choir duties with his other role as keyboardist in the successful rock band the sun . " i perform in churches and in clubs and i see very intelligent people and very drunk people , " said rahula , laughing .
by living out his music career on both ends of the spectrum , he says he never gets bored . enduring passion while his style of music might change from day to day , fame has not changed him much , according to his friend and fellow choir member ants aguraiuja .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 13.11.2010 italian opposition steps up in no-confidence motion on berlusconi großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there is no date yet set for berlusconi 's confidence vote things keep getting worse for italy 's prime minister silvio berlusconi , as he he faces another no-confidence vote in parliament .
signs of waning support by former loyalists could mean his days in office are numbered . italy 's largest opposition party has stepped up in its promise to seek a no-confidence vote on prime minister silvio berlusconi , setting the scene for a fight in parliament that could end the 74-year-old media mogul 's political career .
the opposition democratic party , led by dario franceschini , submitted the no-confidence motion friday in the lower chamber of deputies with the support of the allied italy of values party .
the date of the vote has not yet been set .
" berlusconi 's days are numbered , " said italy of values politician leoluca orlando .
" soon italy will free itself from a cancer that has destroyed its national economy , covered it with filth and thrown its moral value into the dirt . "
berlusconi 's ally-turned-rival and speaker of parliament gianfranco fini , who recently created his own future and freedom for italy party , called on the prime minister to resign at a party conference on sunday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fini will be key when the confidence vote comes berlusconi has repeatedly refused to leave office unless he loses a no-confidence vote , despite a number of sex scandals that have caused his popularity to sink to an all-time low .
ministers to resign intensifying berlusconi 's political troubles , italian media reported on friday that four government ministers loyal to fini would submit their resignations to the prime minister next week .
italo bocchino , spokesman for future and freedom for italy , repeated fini 's calls for the prime minister to resign .
" on monday berlusconi will find on his desk the resignation papers of our ministers , " he said on a news program .
" he should take note and resign . "
balance of power such resignations would leave berlusconi without sufficient support , bocchino added , meaning the prime minister would ultimately have to ask italian president giorgio napolitano for his resignation as well .
this would not be obligatory , but the resignations would at least force a reshuffle of berlusconi 's cabinet .
berlusconi survived a confidence vote in september with the support of fini 's party , which appears to hold the balance of power ahead of the upcoming vote .
in a sign of waning loyalty for the prime minister , fini loyalists withheld support on an immigration bill sponsored by the government earlier in the week .
the current parliament 's mandate expires in 2013 , but losing the confidence vote could bring about snap parliamentary elections .
parliament is still obligated to pass the 2011 budget law by year 's end , which may force the confidence vote to be delayed .

several thousand jubilant supporters streamed to her residence . myanmar democracy leader aung san suu kyi appeared at the gate of her house on saturday waving and smiling after being officially released from house arrest , a detention that lasted 15 of the past 21 years . " we must work together in unison , " she told the sea of jubilant supporters , suggesting she has no intention of giving up her long fight for democracy in what is one of the world 's oldest dictatorships . police cars arrived at suu kyi 's compound about 5:30 p.m. local time and sent officials in to deliver her release papers . global rejoice her release has been welcomed by several world leaders , including german chancellor angela merkel , un secretary general ban ki-moon , us president barack obama and british prime minister david cameron . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a supporter of myanmar 's detained opposition leader cheers merkel voiced her relief at suu kyi 's release , saying she was " a symbol of the worldwide fight to apply human rights . " " her non-violence and persistence have made her into a much-admired example , " merkel remarked , while also calling on myanmar 's ruling junta to release more than 2,000 other political prisoners in the country . european commission president jose manuel barroso said he was " delighted " at suu kyi 's release and also urged the " unconditional release " of all other political prisoners . earlier , crowds of suu kyi supporters had come to her lakeside home , where she has spent much of the past two decades under house arrest . armed police stood by as over a thousand people gathered near the crumbling mansion in the hope of catching a glimpse of the 65-year-old nobel peace prize winner . hundreds more gathered at her party 's headquarters , many wearing t-shirts bearing her image and the words : " we stand with aung san suu kyi . " release viewed as junta 's attempt to tame critics suu kyi is still seen as the biggest threat to the junta after almost five decades of military dictatorship in myanmar , which was formerly known as burma . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : myanmar junta leader than shwe has seen to it that suu kyi remained locked away some observers believe her release could come with restrictions to ensure she can not threaten the generals or the military-backed government . us-based advocacy group freedom now , which serves as suu kyi 's international counsel , welcomed her release , but said it was " virtually meaningless until the junta enters into an irreversible process of dialog resulting in national reconciliation between the junta , -lsb- suu kyi 's -rsb- national league for democracy and ethnic groups , and a restoration of democracy to -lsb- myanmar -rsb- . " the group 's head , jared genser , pointed out that suu kyi has been released three times previously " and nothing fundamental changed in the country . " human rights watchdog amnesty international , meanwhile , said suu kyi 's freedom " is by no means a concession on the part of the authorities . " " the fact remains that the authorities should never have arrested her or the many other prisoners of conscience in burma in the first place , locking them out of the political process , " an amnesty statement said . reactive move bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there is still a groundswell of support for suu kyi 's national league for democracy party suu kyi 's freedom is seen by international observers as an effort by the regime to dampen widespread condemnation of sunday 's election , the first since 1990 when the national league for democracy won 392 of 485 parliamentary seats . the military refused to relinquish power , however , and placed the charismatic and popular suu kyi under house arrest for " endangering the state . " despite international condemnation and numerous calls for her release , suu kyi has been in prison or under house arrest for 15 years . her sentence was extended in 2009 after an american man swam uninvited across the lake next to her house and stayed for two nights .
critics say the charges were used to keep suu kyi 's influence out of the 2010 election . western nations and pro-democracy activists have criticized the poll as anything but free and fair following widespread reports of intimidation and fraud . initial results show that the army-backed union solidarity and development party has already won a majority of the parliamentary seats available . author : gabriel borrud , darren mara -lrb- reuters , ap -rrb- editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the money was meant for growth-enhancing projects . investigators are looking into a possible misuse of european union funds after italian officials spent 720,000 euros -lrb- $ 985,000 -rrb- in development aid for a concert last year featuring elton john .
" we want to know right now about why this concert would need such funding , " eu regional funding spokesman ton van lierop said on friday , stressing that the funds were typically used to boost the economies of the eu 's poorer regions .
elton john performed in naples on september 11 , 2009 .
the show was part of the piedigrotta festival costing over 2.2 million euros , half of which came from eu regional funds .
it was not known whether john , one of the world 's most successful popular artists , was paid for the concert .
the case was brought to the attention of brussels authorities by mario borghezio , a european parliament deputy from the northern league , a party that has advocated secession of northern italy from the poorer south .
" it is time for certain southern regions to learn the lesson and realize that - in cases where the commission does not act on its own - we from the league will be ready to report to relevant eu authorities instances of misspending , " he borghezio said , referring to the " shameful misuse " of eu funds by the campania regional authority .
the eu allocates millions to help poorer regions catch up with more prosperous areas in the bloc .
for projects costing up to 50 million euros , funding decisions are up to local authorities .
in a written reply to a parliamentary question , eu regional funds commissioner johannes hahn told borghezio that if campania authorities fail to give satisfactory answers " they will have to de-certify the sums in question and deduct them from their next payment request . "

" we must work together in unison , " she told the sea of jubilant supporters , suggesting she has no intention of giving up her long fight for democracy in what is one of the world 's oldest dictatorships . police cars arrived at suu kyi 's compound about 5:30 p.m. local time and sent officials in to deliver her release papers . global rejoice her release has been welcomed by several world leaders , including german chancellor angela merkel , un secretary general ban ki-moon , us president barack obama and british prime minister david cameron . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a supporter of myanmar 's detained opposition leader cheers merkel voiced her relief at suu kyi 's release , saying she was " a symbol of the worldwide fight to apply human rights . " " her non-violence and persistence have made her into a much-admired example , " merkel remarked , while also calling on myanmar 's ruling junta to release more than 2,000 other political prisoners in the country . european commission president jose manuel barroso said he was " delighted " at suu kyi 's release and also urged the " unconditional release " of all other political prisoners . earlier , crowds of suu kyi supporters had come to her lakeside home , where she has spent much of the past two decades under house arrest . armed police stood by as over a thousand people gathered near the crumbling mansion in the hope of catching a glimpse of the 65-year-old nobel peace prize winner . hundreds more gathered at her party 's headquarters , many wearing t-shirts bearing her image and the words : " we stand with aung san suu kyi . " release viewed as junta 's attempt to tame critics suu kyi is still seen as the biggest threat to the junta after almost five decades of military dictatorship in myanmar , which was formerly known as burma . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : myanmar junta leader than shwe has seen to it that suu kyi remained locked away some observers believe her release could come with restrictions to ensure she can not threaten the generals or the military-backed government . us-based advocacy group freedom now , which serves as suu kyi 's international counsel , welcomed her release , but said it was " virtually meaningless until the junta enters into an irreversible process of dialog resulting in national reconciliation between the junta , -lsb- suu kyi 's -rsb- national league for democracy and ethnic groups , and a restoration of democracy to -lsb- myanmar -rsb- . " the group 's head , jared genser , pointed out that suu kyi has been released three times previously " and nothing fundamental changed in the country . " human rights watchdog amnesty international , meanwhile , said suu kyi 's freedom " is by no means a concession on the part of the authorities .

" despite international condemnation and numerous calls for her release , suu kyi has been in prison or under house arrest for 15 years . her sentence was extended in 2009 after an american man swam uninvited across the lake next to her house and stayed for two nights .
critics say the charges were used to keep suu kyi 's influence out of the 2010 election . western nations and pro-democracy activists have criticized the poll as anything but free and fair following widespread reports of intimidation and fraud . initial results show that the army-backed union solidarity and development party has already won a majority of the parliamentary seats available . author : gabriel borrud , darren mara -lrb- reuters , ap -rrb- editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it was not known whether john , one of the world 's most successful popular artists , was paid for the concert .
the case was brought to the attention of brussels authorities by mario borghezio , a european parliament deputy from the northern league , a party that has advocated secession of northern italy from the poorer south .
" it is time for certain southern regions to learn the lesson and realize that - in cases where the commission does not act on its own - we from the league will be ready to report to relevant eu authorities instances of misspending , " he borghezio said , referring to the " shameful misuse " of eu funds by the campania regional authority .
the eu allocates millions to help poorer regions catch up with more prosperous areas in the bloc .
for projects costing up to 50 million euros , funding decisions are up to local authorities .
in a written reply to a parliamentary question , eu regional funds commissioner johannes hahn told borghezio that if campania authorities fail to give satisfactory answers " they will have to de-certify the sums in question and deduct them from their next payment request . "

signs of waning support by former loyalists could mean his days in office are numbered . italy 's largest opposition party has stepped up in its promise to seek a no-confidence vote on prime minister silvio berlusconi , setting the scene for a fight in parliament that could end the 74-year-old media mogul 's political career .
the opposition democratic party , led by dario franceschini , submitted the no-confidence motion friday in the lower chamber of deputies with the support of the allied italy of values party .
the date of the vote has not yet been set .
" berlusconi 's days are numbered , " said italy of values politician leoluca orlando .
" soon italy will free itself from a cancer that has destroyed its national economy , covered it with filth and thrown its moral value into the dirt . "
berlusconi 's ally-turned-rival and speaker of parliament gianfranco fini , who recently created his own future and freedom for italy party , called on the prime minister to resign at a party conference on sunday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fini will be key when the confidence vote comes berlusconi has repeatedly refused to leave office unless he loses a no-confidence vote , despite a number of sex scandals that have caused his popularity to sink to an all-time low .
ministers to resign intensifying berlusconi 's political troubles , italian media reported on friday that four government ministers loyal to fini would submit their resignations to the prime minister next week .
italo bocchino , spokesman for future and freedom for italy , repeated fini 's calls for the prime minister to resign .
" on monday berlusconi will find on his desk the resignation papers of our ministers , " he said on a news program .
" he should take note and resign . "
balance of power such resignations would leave berlusconi without sufficient support , bocchino added , meaning the prime minister would ultimately have to ask italian president giorgio napolitano for his resignation as well .
this would not be obligatory , but the resignations would at least force a reshuffle of berlusconi 's cabinet .
berlusconi survived a confidence vote in september with the support of fini 's party , which appears to hold the balance of power ahead of the upcoming vote .
in a sign of waning loyalty for the prime minister , fini loyalists withheld support on an immigration bill sponsored by the government earlier in the week .
the current parliament 's mandate expires in 2013 , but losing the confidence vote could bring about snap parliamentary elections .
parliament is still obligated to pass the 2011 budget law by year 's end , which may force the confidence vote to be delayed .

today 's young estonians are keeping up this tradition . the small baltic country of estonia has hundreds of choirs , which meet at schools , churches and even factories . many towns hold regular music festivals of their own , but the vocal climax for the country is the estonian song festival , which takes place every five years .
first held in 1869 , the event continued throughout estonia 's tumultuous history and now attracts tens of thousands of participants . music as a political tool at 34 , accomplished singer tomi rahula is too young to remember the worst of the soviet rule over estonia , which lasted from 1944 to 1991 , but he clearly recalls occasions when estonians used song to defy the soviet censors . " there were songs that we were supposed to sing about lenin and stalin , but when that singing ended people did n't go away - they started to sing songs that they were n't allowed to sing , " said rahula .
" -lsb- the authorities -rsb- could n't do anything because there were like 80,000 people . " with its strong economy and highly educated workforce , estonia has become the envy of many former soviet republics since its independence . even in the two decades since the fall of the soviet union , singing has not lost its significance in the republic . bildunterschrift : when the weather is good , music is taken outside across the spectrum rahula is the concertmaster and conductor of the tallinn boys choir , which was founded by his mother , lydia rahula , in 1988 .
the two of them work well together , in spite of - or perhaps because of - the family connection . " we feel the music very well -lsb- together -rsb- , " said lydia rahula .
" we can just look at each other and know .
it works - we have the same understanding , the same heart , although we have two heads . " the choir , made up of men and boys aged six to 36 , rehearses several times a week and performs more than 30 concerts per year .
everything from ave maria to african spirituals is included in their repertoire . as a child , tomi rahula was a choir boy , but also a composer .
in 1998 , he penned the tune estonia took to eurovision song contest , " the children of the sea . "
these days , he juggles his choir duties with his other role as keyboardist in the successful rock band the sun . " i perform in churches and in clubs and i see very intelligent people and very drunk people , " said rahula , laughing .
by living out his music career on both ends of the spectrum , he says he never gets bored . enduring passion while his style of music might change from day to day , fame has not changed him much , according to his friend and fellow choir member ants aguraiuja . " we were at the same school and he was one or two years younger , " said aguraiuja .

today 's young estonians are keeping up this tradition . the small baltic country of estonia has hundreds of choirs , which meet at schools , churches and even factories . many towns hold regular music festivals of their own , but the vocal climax for the country is the estonian song festival , which takes place every five years .
first held in 1869 , the event continued throughout estonia 's tumultuous history and now attracts tens of thousands of participants . music as a political tool at 34 , accomplished singer tomi rahula is too young to remember the worst of the soviet rule over estonia , which lasted from 1944 to 1991 , but he clearly recalls occasions when estonians used song to defy the soviet censors . " there were songs that we were supposed to sing about lenin and stalin , but when that singing ended people did n't go away - they started to sing songs that they were n't allowed to sing , " said rahula .
" -lsb- the authorities -rsb- could n't do anything because there were like 80,000 people .

" we can just look at each other and know .
it works - we have the same understanding , the same heart , although we have two heads . " the choir , made up of men and boys aged six to 36 , rehearses several times a week and performs more than 30 concerts per year .
everything from ave maria to african spirituals is included in their repertoire . as a child , tomi rahula was a choir boy , but also a composer .
in 1998 , he penned the tune estonia took to eurovision song contest , " the children of the sea . "
these days , he juggles his choir duties with his other role as keyboardist in the successful rock band the sun . " i perform in churches and in clubs and i see very intelligent people and very drunk people , " said rahula , laughing .
by living out his music career on both ends of the spectrum , he says he never gets bored . enduring passion while his style of music might change from day to day , fame has not changed him much , according to his friend and fellow choir member ants aguraiuja . " we were at the same school and he was one or two years younger , " said aguraiuja .

he was scouted by lydia rahula at the tender age of six , and has followed her ever since .

today 's young estonians are keeping up this tradition . the small baltic country of estonia has hundreds of choirs , which meet at schools , churches and even factories . many towns hold regular music festivals of their own , but the vocal climax for the country is the estonian song festival , which takes place every five years .
first held in 1869 , the event continued throughout estonia 's tumultuous history and now attracts tens of thousands of participants . music as a political tool at 34 , accomplished singer tomi rahula is too young to remember the worst of the soviet rule over estonia , which lasted from 1944 to 1991 , but he clearly recalls occasions when estonians used song to defy the soviet censors . " there were songs that we were supposed to sing about lenin and stalin , but when that singing ended people did n't go away - they started to sing songs that they were n't allowed to sing , " said rahula .
" -lsb- the authorities -rsb- could n't do anything because there were like 80,000 people . " with its strong economy and highly educated workforce , estonia has become the envy of many former soviet republics since its independence . even in the two decades since the fall of the soviet union , singing has not lost its significance in the republic . bildunterschrift : when the weather is good , music is taken outside across the spectrum rahula is the concertmaster and conductor of the tallinn boys choir , which was founded by his mother , lydia rahula , in 1988 .
the two of them work well together , in spite of - or perhaps because of - the family connection . " we feel the music very well -lsb- together -rsb- , " said lydia rahula .
" we can just look at each other and know .
it works - we have the same understanding , the same heart , although we have two heads . " the choir , made up of men and boys aged six to 36 , rehearses several times a week and performs more than 30 concerts per year .
everything from ave maria to african spirituals is included in their repertoire . as a child , tomi rahula was a choir boy , but also a composer .
in 1998 , he penned the tune estonia took to eurovision song contest , " the children of the sea . "
these days , he juggles his choir duties with his other role as keyboardist in the successful rock band the sun . " i perform in churches and in clubs and i see very intelligent people and very drunk people , " said rahula , laughing .
by living out his music career on both ends of the spectrum , he says he never gets bored . enduring passion while his style of music might change from day to day , fame has not changed him much , according to his friend and fellow choir member ants aguraiuja .
