kuranyi could more than double his salary with the move to the 10th-ranked russian team . former germany striker kevin kuranyi said on his website on sunday that he was leaving schalke for a deal with russia 's dynamo moscow .
kuranyi was one of the bundesliga 's top scorers this season with 18 goals and schalke ended the season in second place , after bayern munich .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : saturday 's match was kuranyi 's last playing for schalke " after carefully weighing all the arguments and following several discussions , i have decided to transfer to russia with dynamo moscow , " kuranyi wrote in a " letter to his fans . "
" i always said that the whole package must be right .
i have this feeling with dynamo .
one aspect is certainly the financial one , " he said .
the 28-year-old will leave on a free transfer on july 1 and is said to have signed a three-year contract paying more than 6 million euros -lrb- $ 7.6 million -rrb- per season .
that more than doubles his current salary .
despite a slow start in the russian season and a current rank of 10th in their league , dynamo should n't be underestimated , kuranyi said .
dynamo has won 11 national titles , although the most recent victory was in 1976 .
no spot on the national team despite a successful league season , kuranyi was not chosen for germany 's national squad for the world cup in south africa this june .
national coach joachim loew kicked him off the team after he walked out on the team during a world cup qualifier in october 2008 after being left off that day 's line-up .
at the time loew said he would never ask him to play again and resisted pressure to include him on the world cup team. hf / afp / dpa editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the vote is seen as a test for chancellor angela merkel ’ s federal government and polls suggest the ruling coalition is in trouble . polling stations in the german state of north rhine-westphalia -lrb- nrw -rrb- opened sunday morning in a state election widely seen as a referendum on chancellor angela merkel 's six-month-old government .
merkel 's conservative christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and coalition partner the free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- must hold onto power in germany 's most populous state in order to maintain a majority in the upper house of parliament , the bundesrat .
a defeat for the parties in the state , where they have also ruled in a center-right coalition since 2005 , would end their majority and lead to delays in delivering tax cuts and implementing other policies agreed to after last september 's federal election .
recent opinion polls suggest the cdu and the fdp lack the necessary support needed to maintain their majority .
the election comes just days after the german parliament approved a 22.4-billion-euro -lrb- $ 28.6 billion -rrb- emergency bailout for debt-stricken greece , a move that has proved deeply unpopular with voters .
in a poll published on saturday , 21 percent of nrw voters said the greek bailout would affect their ballot decision , according to the yougov survey for german daily bild .
spd looks to regain control " the issue has electrified people as seldom before and is going to play a determining role in the election , " said klaus-peter schoeppner , head of the polling institute emnid , in the online edition of the rheinische post .

the spd abstained in friday 's vote on the greek aid package , a tactical move that analysts say could give them the edge .
current polls suggest that the spd and their preferred partners , the greens , have the support of between 45 and 47 percent of voters .
current predictions estimate the cdu-fdp block winning 43 to 45 percent of the vote .
" if the cdu loses its majority with the fdp , which is to be expected , it would not be a catastrophe but it would certainly make things more complicated and difficult for the chancellor , " said gerd langguth , a political scientist at the university of bonn and biographer of merkel. cmk / afp / reuters editor : kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

kuranyi could more than double his salary with the move to the 10th-ranked russian team . former germany striker kevin kuranyi said on his website on sunday that he was leaving schalke for a deal with russia 's dynamo moscow .

despite a slow start in the russian season and a current rank of 10th in their league , dynamo should n't be underestimated , kuranyi said .
dynamo has won 11 national titles , although the most recent victory was in 1976 .
no spot on the national team despite a successful league season , kuranyi was not chosen for germany 's national squad for the world cup in south africa this june .
national coach joachim loew kicked him off the team after he walked out on the team during a world cup qualifier in october 2008 after being left off that day 's line-up .
at the time loew said he would never ask him to play again and resisted pressure to include him on the world cup team. hf / afp / dpa editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the vote is seen as a test for chancellor angela merkel ’ s federal government and polls suggest the ruling coalition is in trouble . polling stations in the german state of north rhine-westphalia -lrb- nrw -rrb- opened sunday morning in a state election widely seen as a referendum on chancellor angela merkel 's six-month-old government .
merkel 's conservative christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and coalition partner the free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- must hold onto power in germany 's most populous state in order to maintain a majority in the upper house of parliament , the bundesrat .
a defeat for the parties in the state , where they have also ruled in a center-right coalition since 2005 , would end their majority and lead to delays in delivering tax cuts and implementing other policies agreed to after last september 's federal election .
recent opinion polls suggest the cdu and the fdp lack the necessary support needed to maintain their majority .
the election comes just days after the german parliament approved a 22.4-billion-euro -lrb- $ 28.6 billion -rrb- emergency bailout for debt-stricken greece , a move that has proved deeply unpopular with voters .
in a poll published on saturday , 21 percent of nrw voters said the greek bailout would affect their ballot decision , according to the yougov survey for german daily bild .
spd looks to regain control " the issue has electrified people as seldom before and is going to play a determining role in the election , " said klaus-peter schoeppner , head of the polling institute emnid , in the online edition of the rheinische post .

the spd abstained in friday 's vote on the greek aid package , a tactical move that analysts say could give them the edge .
current polls suggest that the spd and their preferred partners , the greens , have the support of between 45 and 47 percent of voters .
current predictions estimate the cdu-fdp block winning 43 to 45 percent of the vote .
" if the cdu loses its majority with the fdp , which is to be expected , it would not be a catastrophe but it would certainly make things more complicated and difficult for the chancellor , " said gerd langguth , a political scientist at the university of bonn and biographer of merkel. cmk / afp / reuters editor : kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the vote is seen as a test for chancellor angela merkel ’ s federal government and polls suggest the ruling coalition is in trouble . polling stations in the german state of north rhine-westphalia -lrb- nrw -rrb- opened sunday morning in a state election widely seen as a referendum on chancellor angela merkel 's six-month-old government .
merkel 's conservative christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and coalition partner the free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- must hold onto power in germany 's most populous state in order to maintain a majority in the upper house of parliament , the bundesrat .
a defeat for the parties in the state , where they have also ruled in a center-right coalition since 2005 , would end their majority and lead to delays in delivering tax cuts and implementing other policies agreed to after last september 's federal election .
recent opinion polls suggest the cdu and the fdp lack the necessary support needed to maintain their majority .
the election comes just days after the german parliament approved a 22.4-billion-euro -lrb- $ 28.6 billion -rrb- emergency bailout for debt-stricken greece , a move that has proved deeply unpopular with voters .
in a poll published on saturday , 21 percent of nrw voters said the greek bailout would affect their ballot decision , according to the yougov survey for german daily bild .
spd looks to regain control " the issue has electrified people as seldom before and is going to play a determining role in the election , " said klaus-peter schoeppner , head of the polling institute emnid , in the online edition of the rheinische post .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spd leader hannelore kraft hopes to regain control of the state the rival social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , who held power for four decades until being ousted in 2005 , are looking to regain control in the influential state , home to 13.5 million eligible voters .
the spd abstained in friday 's vote on the greek aid package , a tactical move that analysts say could give them the edge .
current polls suggest that the spd and their preferred partners , the greens , have the support of between 45 and 47 percent of voters .
current predictions estimate the cdu-fdp block winning 43 to 45 percent of the vote .
" if the cdu loses its majority with the fdp , which is to be expected , it would not be a catastrophe but it would certainly make things more complicated and difficult for the chancellor , " said gerd langguth , a political scientist at the university of bonn and biographer of merkel. cmk / afp / reuters editor : kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de left party leader prepares to make history in crucial state election on may 9 , voters in north rhine-westphalia will go to the polls to elect a new parliament .
so far , no party has a clear majority , but a small socialist party with roots in east germany has opposition leaders worried .
-lrb- 07.05.2010 -rrb- crucial state vote a test for merkel 's government on the eve of elections in the western german state of north rhine-westphalia , focus has shifted to how the vote is a litmus test for the policies of chancellor angela merkel 's federal coalition government .

the long-planned talks had suffered a setback due to new israeli settlement plans . after a long hiatus and much prodding by the new us administration , israelis and palestinians have begun indirect peace negotiations .
" the proximity talks have started , " chief palestinian negotiator saeb erakat told reporters on sunday in the west bank city of ramallah after a meeting between palestinian president mahmud abbas and us envoy george mitchell .
" today , on may 9 , the negotiations have begun at the level of the president -lrb- abbas -rrb- and -lrb- israeli prime minister benjamin -rrb- netanyahu , " he added , while stressing there would be no direct contact between the parties .
" there are no negotiations between us and the israeli government , " he said .
" the discussions will be held with mitchell and the americans and they will mediate between the two sides . "
the fact that both parties could n't agree to face-to-face meetings , but instead will only participate in " proximity " talks , shows the deep rift between israelis and palestinians on the issue .
in proximity talks , the involved parties do n't meet and discuss problems directly , but rely on an intermediary to conduct the negotiations . " indirect negotiations are an invention of henry kissinger , " explains shlomo ben-ami , a former israeli foreign minister , who was a key negotiator in the israeli-palestinian talks in camp david in 2000 and taba in 2001 .
kissinger , in the wake of the 1973 yom kippur war , resorted to what has since then been called shuttle diplomacy to negotiate between the syrians , the israelis and the egyptians .
since that time it has become an established mechanism to try to mediate between parties in long-standing conflicts .
" that 's ok , but if you do not reach at a certain point direct negotiations it is useless , " said ben-ami in an interview with deutsche welle .
" there is no way they can reach an agreement through a third party . "
indirect talks as best option while direct talks between israelis and palestinians are ultimately necessary to hammer out a peace deal , at this point indirect talks are probably a better option , said álvaro de soto , who headed negotiations that ended the civil war in el salvador and served as un special coordinator for the middle east peace process until 2007 .
he said the format of proximity talks is actually a good choice for the middle east , especially in the current hostile climate between both parties .
bildunterschrift : israeli-palestinian peace efforts have a bad track record " and i think that altogether too much of a production has been made about direct talks .
proximity talks have the advantage in this case of placing a much greater responsibility on the mediator , the mediator being the united states . "
both experts agree that aside from the us there is no other actor that would be acceptable to both parties .
the palestinians know that only washington has real influence and can bring israel to agree to a peace deal .
the israelis believe that they can trust only washington not to betray them and their crucial interests as a mediator . key role for washington while it has been pretty much commonly accepted that only washington can mediate this conflict , there is at the same time concern that the us , because of its close ties with israel , ca n't really act as an honest broker .
" i am convinced that only the us can play this role and i do n't set too much store by the objection that the us has a bias in this matter , " said de soto .
" the us role , it seems to me , is unavoidable and indispensible and i am very pleased that the us is at the center . "
that , however , does n't guarantee that this round of talks , which are slated to last four months , will be any more successful than all the previous attempts to achieve a breakthrough on the israeli-palestinian issue .
" if these people get an agreement they will deserve a nobel peace prize in physics , " said ben-ami .
difficult circumstances he believes that the underlying conditions for both israelis and palestinians are so negative , that it will be practically impossible for them to overcome .
palestinian president mahmoud abbas ' authority is challenged by hamas while israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu 's ability to agree to a deal is limited through the coalition with his hard-line foreign minister avigdor lieberman .
de soto adds that no viable agreement is possible if hamas is n't somehow included in the peace process .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israel angered the us and palestinians by announcing new settlements however , the slim chances for success also have a positive side .
" low expectations is what any mediator wants at the start of a mediation , i can tell you that from a professional 's standpoint , " said de soto , who believes that us middle east envoy george mitchell is exactly the right person for this mission impossible .
how exactly george mitchell will carry out this shuttle diplomacy neither of the experts could say .
" actually , it 's not a bad thing that little is known about what 's going on in a given peace process , " says de soto .
" negotiations , and peace negotiations in particular , are like very delicate , exotic orchids .
if you expose them to inclement weather they might wilt . "

the long-planned talks had suffered a setback due to new israeli settlement plans . after a long hiatus and much prodding by the new us administration , israelis and palestinians have begun indirect peace negotiations .
" the proximity talks have started , " chief palestinian negotiator saeb erakat told reporters on sunday in the west bank city of ramallah after a meeting between palestinian president mahmud abbas and us envoy george mitchell .
" today , on may 9 , the negotiations have begun at the level of the president -lrb- abbas -rrb- and -lrb- israeli prime minister benjamin -rrb- netanyahu , " he added , while stressing there would be no direct contact between the parties .
" there are no negotiations between us and the israeli government , " he said .
" the discussions will be held with mitchell and the americans and they will mediate between the two sides . "
the fact that both parties could n't agree to face-to-face meetings , but instead will only participate in " proximity " talks , shows the deep rift between israelis and palestinians on the issue .
in proximity talks , the involved parties do n't meet and discuss problems directly , but rely on an intermediary to conduct the negotiations . " indirect negotiations are an invention of henry kissinger , " explains shlomo ben-ami , a former israeli foreign minister , who was a key negotiator in the israeli-palestinian talks in camp david in 2000 and taba in 2001 .
kissinger , in the wake of the 1973 yom kippur war , resorted to what has since then been called shuttle diplomacy to negotiate between the syrians , the israelis and the egyptians .
since that time it has become an established mechanism to try to mediate between parties in long-standing conflicts .
" that 's ok , but if you do not reach at a certain point direct negotiations it is useless , " said ben-ami in an interview with deutsche welle .
" there is no way they can reach an agreement through a third party . "
indirect talks as best option while direct talks between israelis and palestinians are ultimately necessary to hammer out a peace deal , at this point indirect talks are probably a better option , said álvaro de soto , who headed negotiations that ended the civil war in el salvador and served as un special coordinator for the middle east peace process until 2007 .
he said the format of proximity talks is actually a good choice for the middle east , especially in the current hostile climate between both parties .
bildunterschrift : israeli-palestinian peace efforts have a bad track record " and i think that altogether too much of a production has been made about direct talks .
proximity talks have the advantage in this case of placing a much greater responsibility on the mediator , the mediator being the united states . "
both experts agree that aside from the us there is no other actor that would be acceptable to both parties .
the palestinians know that only washington has real influence and can bring israel to agree to a peace deal .
the israelis believe that they can trust only washington not to betray them and their crucial interests as a mediator . key role for washington while it has been pretty much commonly accepted that only washington can mediate this conflict , there is at the same time concern that the us , because of its close ties with israel , ca n't really act as an honest broker .
" i am convinced that only the us can play this role and i do n't set too much store by the objection that the us has a bias in this matter , " said de soto .
" the us role , it seems to me , is unavoidable and indispensible and i am very pleased that the us is at the center . "
that , however , does n't guarantee that this round of talks , which are slated to last four months , will be any more successful than all the previous attempts to achieve a breakthrough on the israeli-palestinian issue .
" if these people get an agreement they will deserve a nobel peace prize in physics , " said ben-ami .
difficult circumstances he believes that the underlying conditions for both israelis and palestinians are so negative , that it will be practically impossible for them to overcome .
palestinian president mahmoud abbas ' authority is challenged by hamas while israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu 's ability to agree to a deal is limited through the coalition with his hard-line foreign minister avigdor lieberman .
de soto adds that no viable agreement is possible if hamas is n't somehow included in the peace process .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israel angered the us and palestinians by announcing new settlements however , the slim chances for success also have a positive side .
" low expectations is what any mediator wants at the start of a mediation , i can tell you that from a professional 's standpoint , " said de soto , who believes that us middle east envoy george mitchell is exactly the right person for this mission impossible .
how exactly george mitchell will carry out this shuttle diplomacy neither of the experts could say .
" actually , it 's not a bad thing that little is known about what 's going on in a given peace process , " says de soto .
" negotiations , and peace negotiations in particular , are like very delicate , exotic orchids .
if you expose them to inclement weather they might wilt . "

the long-planned talks had suffered a setback due to new israeli settlement plans . after a long hiatus and much prodding by the new us administration , israelis and palestinians have begun indirect peace negotiations .
" the proximity talks have started , " chief palestinian negotiator saeb erakat told reporters on sunday in the west bank city of ramallah after a meeting between palestinian president mahmud abbas and us envoy george mitchell .
" today , on may 9 , the negotiations have begun at the level of the president -lrb- abbas -rrb- and -lrb- israeli prime minister benjamin -rrb- netanyahu , " he added , while stressing there would be no direct contact between the parties .
" there are no negotiations between us and the israeli government , " he said .
" the discussions will be held with mitchell and the americans and they will mediate between the two sides . "
the fact that both parties could n't agree to face-to-face meetings , but instead will only participate in " proximity " talks , shows the deep rift between israelis and palestinians on the issue .
in proximity talks , the involved parties do n't meet and discuss problems directly , but rely on an intermediary to conduct the negotiations . " indirect negotiations are an invention of henry kissinger , " explains shlomo ben-ami , a former israeli foreign minister , who was a key negotiator in the israeli-palestinian talks in camp david in 2000 and taba in 2001 .
kissinger , in the wake of the 1973 yom kippur war , resorted to what has since then been called shuttle diplomacy to negotiate between the syrians , the israelis and the egyptians .
since that time it has become an established mechanism to try to mediate between parties in long-standing conflicts .
" that 's ok , but if you do not reach at a certain point direct negotiations it is useless , " said ben-ami in an interview with deutsche welle .
" there is no way they can reach an agreement through a third party . "
indirect talks as best option while direct talks between israelis and palestinians are ultimately necessary to hammer out a peace deal , at this point indirect talks are probably a better option , said álvaro de soto , who headed negotiations that ended the civil war in el salvador and served as un special coordinator for the middle east peace process until 2007 .
he said the format of proximity talks is actually a good choice for the middle east , especially in the current hostile climate between both parties .
bildunterschrift : israeli-palestinian peace efforts have a bad track record " and i think that altogether too much of a production has been made about direct talks .
proximity talks have the advantage in this case of placing a much greater responsibility on the mediator , the mediator being the united states . "
both experts agree that aside from the us there is no other actor that would be acceptable to both parties .
the palestinians know that only washington has real influence and can bring israel to agree to a peace deal .
the israelis believe that they can trust only washington not to betray them and their crucial interests as a mediator . key role for washington while it has been pretty much commonly accepted that only washington can mediate this conflict , there is at the same time concern that the us , because of its close ties with israel , ca n't really act as an honest broker .
" i am convinced that only the us can play this role and i do n't set too much store by the objection that the us has a bias in this matter , " said de soto .
" the us role , it seems to me , is unavoidable and indispensible and i am very pleased that the us is at the center . "
that , however , does n't guarantee that this round of talks , which are slated to last four months , will be any more successful than all the previous attempts to achieve a breakthrough on the israeli-palestinian issue .
" if these people get an agreement they will deserve a nobel peace prize in physics , " said ben-ami .
difficult circumstances he believes that the underlying conditions for both israelis and palestinians are so negative , that it will be practically impossible for them to overcome .
palestinian president mahmoud abbas ' authority is challenged by hamas while israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu 's ability to agree to a deal is limited through the coalition with his hard-line foreign minister avigdor lieberman .
de soto adds that no viable agreement is possible if hamas is n't somehow included in the peace process .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israel angered the us and palestinians by announcing new settlements however , the slim chances for success also have a positive side .
" low expectations is what any mediator wants at the start of a mediation , i can tell you that from a professional 's standpoint , " said de soto , who believes that us middle east envoy george mitchell is exactly the right person for this mission impossible .
how exactly george mitchell will carry out this shuttle diplomacy neither of the experts could say .
" actually , it 's not a bad thing that little is known about what 's going on in a given peace process , " says de soto .
" negotiations , and peace negotiations in particular , are like very delicate , exotic orchids .
if you expose them to inclement weather they might wilt . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de elections -pipe- 09.05.2010 voting underway in crucial german state election großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the vote in north rhine-westphalia will also be decisive for the ruling coaltion in berlin germans are casting ballots on sunday in the country 's most populous state .
the vote is seen as a test for chancellor angela merkel ’ s federal government and polls suggest the ruling coalition is in trouble . polling stations in the german state of north rhine-westphalia -lrb- nrw -rrb- opened sunday morning in a state election widely seen as a referendum on chancellor angela merkel 's six-month-old government .
merkel 's conservative christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and coalition partner the free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- must hold onto power in germany 's most populous state in order to maintain a majority in the upper house of parliament , the bundesrat .
a defeat for the parties in the state , where they have also ruled in a center-right coalition since 2005 , would end their majority and lead to delays in delivering tax cuts and implementing other policies agreed to after last september 's federal election .
recent opinion polls suggest the cdu and the fdp lack the necessary support needed to maintain their majority .
the election comes just days after the german parliament approved a 22.4-billion-euro -lrb- $ 28.6 billion -rrb- emergency bailout for debt-stricken greece , a move that has proved deeply unpopular with voters .
in a poll published on saturday , 21 percent of nrw voters said the greek bailout would affect their ballot decision , according to the yougov survey for german daily bild .
spd looks to regain control " the issue has electrified people as seldom before and is going to play a determining role in the election , " said klaus-peter schoeppner , head of the polling institute emnid , in the online edition of the rheinische post .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spd leader hannelore kraft hopes to regain control of the state the rival social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , who held power for four decades until being ousted in 2005 , are looking to regain control in the influential state , home to 13.5 million eligible voters .
the spd abstained in friday 's vote on the greek aid package , a tactical move that analysts say could give them the edge .
current polls suggest that the spd and their preferred partners , the greens , have the support of between 45 and 47 percent of voters .
current predictions estimate the cdu-fdp block winning 43 to 45 percent of the vote .
" if the cdu loses its majority with the fdp , which is to be expected , it would not be a catastrophe but it would certainly make things more complicated and difficult for the chancellor , " said gerd langguth , a political scientist at the university of bonn and biographer of merkel. cmk / afp / reuters editor : kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

kuranyi could more than double his salary with the move to the 10th-ranked russian team . former germany striker kevin kuranyi said on his website on sunday that he was leaving schalke for a deal with russia 's dynamo moscow .
kuranyi was one of the bundesliga 's top scorers this season with 18 goals and schalke ended the season in second place , after bayern munich .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : saturday 's match was kuranyi 's last playing for schalke " after carefully weighing all the arguments and following several discussions , i have decided to transfer to russia with dynamo moscow , " kuranyi wrote in a " letter to his fans . "
" i always said that the whole package must be right .
i have this feeling with dynamo .
one aspect is certainly the financial one , " he said .
the 28-year-old will leave on a free transfer on july 1 and is said to have signed a three-year contract paying more than 6 million euros -lrb- $ 7.6 million -rrb- per season .
that more than doubles his current salary .
despite a slow start in the russian season and a current rank of 10th in their league , dynamo should n't be underestimated , kuranyi said .
dynamo has won 11 national titles , although the most recent victory was in 1976 .
no spot on the national team despite a successful league season , kuranyi was not chosen for germany 's national squad for the world cup in south africa this june .
national coach joachim loew kicked him off the team after he walked out on the team during a world cup qualifier in october 2008 after being left off that day 's line-up .
at the time loew said he would never ask him to play again and resisted pressure to include him on the world cup team. hf / afp / dpa editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de literature -pipe- 09.05.2010 norwegian museum reflects love-hate relationship with author hamsun großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamsunsenteret - the knut hamsun center - is architectural eye candy in the coming weeks , a museum dedicated to knut hamsun , one of norway 's most notable authors , is due to open to the public .
organizers say the writer 's association with the nazi party will be explored in the exhibition . norwegian writer knut hamsun received the nobel prize for literature in 1920 for his epic , " growth of the soil . "
he is noted for laying the groundwork for the modern novel by developing literary styles of revealing the intricacies of the human psyche .
such techniques would find their way into works by franz kafka , james joyce and virginia wolf , to name just a few .
but hamsun was also an ardent advocate of the nazi party both before world war ii and after germany occupied norway in 1941 .
in 1943 , he sent his nobel prize to nazi propaganda minister joseph goebbels as a gift .
he later visited adolf hitler and after the nazi leader 's death , proclaimed in a may 1945 newspaper eulogy " he was a warrior , a warrior for mankind , and a prophet of the gospel of justice for all nations . "
despite his nazi association , many norwegians have renewed their respect for his literary greatness .
last year saw extensive festivities commemorating the author 's 150th birthday , peaking in the august opening of the knut hamsun center -lrb- hamsunsenteret -rrb- in hamoroy , north of the arctic circle , where the writer grew up .
the museum closed soon after , with organizers then beginning preparations of the exhibition that is to showcase hamsun 's literary talent , as well as his dark past , when the museum opens to the public on june 11th , 2010 .
deutsche welle spoke with bordil borset , director of the hamsunsenteret .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 150th anniversary of hamsun 's birth was celebrated last year deutsche welle : why was the museum built to honor the writer and nobel prize winner knut hamsun ?
bordil borset : he came here to hamoroy when he was three years old with this parents , stayed here as a child , and came back as a grown-up during different periods of his life .
and this area - nordland -lsb- province -rsb- and hamoroy are very important in his life and works .
the idea to build the museum came about in 1986 , but it was a long , complicated process before it was actually completed .
part of the problem was getting enough funding , but the long process also had to due with the controversy surrounding knut hamsun as a person and his sympathizing with the nazis before and during the second world war .
how has that controversy been played out ?
there have been a lot of restrictions about naming streets , places and monuments after hamsun in norway .
and if one considers the new museum to be a monument to knut hamsun , then the question is asked : " why would we build a monument to someone who has brought shame to norway ? "
and what 's your answer to that ?
the museum is built as a center for communicating and researching about knut hamsun 's life and literature , and it 's a museum for all aspects of the person , just like other museums devoted to writers .
what 's unique about this particular one is its architecture .
it 's designed by one of the world 's most famous architects , steven holl .
this is unique around the world , this combination - a museum devoted to a nobel prize-winning author , designed by an internationally famous architect as an interpretation of the writer 's work , literary figures and his life .
and all of it placed in this nordland landscape , with nature completely surrounding it , and which was so central in hamsun 's works .
how does the museum 's architecture reflect hamsun 's literary landscapes ?
steven holl 's idea with the building was to construct it as a human body , a figure which includes all the contradictions and themes found in hamsun 's literary characters in his novels " hunger , " " mysteries , " and so on .
the building is a place of contradictory forces - there are dark corners and big , open spaces , and labyrinths , and the changing light and seasons make it appear different each day .
it 's a complex building that is always changing , just like the psychology of hamsun 's early characters .
bildunterschrift : the exterior is supposed to represent a church tower what 's unique about hamsun 's literary works ?
he created a new way of describing the human psyche , which is quite close to what james joyce did in the early 20th century , except that knut hamsun did that 20 to 30 years before stream of consciousness or modernism or the modern novel .
he 's a predecessor of the modern novel in the 20th century .
and he invented some techniques of describing the human psyche , this new hyper-sensitivity toward the modern world .
and then his work opens up and he invents this gallery of characters .
when he wrote literature , he wrote on small pieces of paper - like sheets from a calendar - and spread them out , plotted them out in front of him , on his desk to invent this literary universe .
what is also unique is how he combines this hyper-sensitivity and complexity of characters with his love of nature and the inspiration he gleaned from that - all using his beautiful linguistic techniques .
how does that his keen sensitivity as a novelist jibe with his nazi affiliation ?
this is the big question and mystery of hamsun which has been haunting us for 50 , 60 , 70 years .
how can one of the world 's finest writers , someone who writes with such sensitivity about love , nature and the human psyche , take such a political stance as a person ?
i ca n't answer that .
it 's one of those contradictions of knut hamsun .
yes , he was one of the world 's greatest authors , and yes , he supported the terrible nazi regime , which we have absolutely no sympathy for .
did he ever offer an explanation for that ?
no .
after world war ii , he was fined a huge sum of money , which was to be paid to the norwegian state .
-lsb- editors ' note : he was to stand trial for treason , but was deemed mentally unfit due to his advanced age . -rsb-
but it could never be proved that hamsun was actually a member of the nazi party .
the subject is addressed again and again in biographies about him ; it 's a question that can not be answered .
just as his characters were complicated and contradictory , so was he .
that 's how human beings are .
there are lots of aspects about human beings that we ca n't explain .
how is hamsun 's nazi past addressed at the museum ?
in the exhibition , all aspects of hamsun 's life and literature are addressed and presented - everything from first editions of his works to the trial after world war ii .
we are also offering lectures , movies , debates , and conferences on the issue .
it will always be treated critically , and it has to be because there is no other way of learning how we are and how we behave today .
he can learn from hamsun 's life and actions and perhaps apply that to how we are today .
that 's what literature does to us , what makes it eternal , what makes it great .
the only way to handle the topic is to address it openly .
but i think there is a new generation of historians coming on stage now who are dealing with the war in a different way .
all last year , during the jubilee for hamsun 's 150th birthday , the political aspects of him were discussed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the interior is deliberately labyrinthine hamsun was actually just one of many nazi sympathizers , but because he was an important person , because he claimed to be one of the big , new norwegian writers - our national poet - , the disappointment , the betrayal people felt was all the greater .
it was a trauma for the norwegian people .
how could he do this ?
and why did he never apologize ?
or show remorse or regret after the war ?
please tell me more about the architecture of the museum .
when you enter the area around the museum , you see this big , black tower , which is reminiscent of old , wooden , norwegian churches .
but it also refers to a scene in one of hamsun 's novels .
then , on the top of the roof , you see bamboo , which is like a strange mix of hair and grass .
the building sort of leans to the side , and all this together makes it appear like a figure .
inside , it 's white , so you get this contrast of the black , wooden exterior and white , concrete interior .
in the middle of the building , there is this brass elevator .
if the building is a metaphor for the body , then this brass elevator is like the spine holding it all up ; it 's the core , the stable element .
but there are glass panels in it , so you can see the movements both inside and outside the elevator - like the nerves in the spine of human beings .
stephan holl has all these playful tricks and illusions inside the building that make it challenging , and create a dynamic between the open spaces and the darker corners .
also , on the first level , the floor is made of blackish-gray concrete and is slightly tilted , so when you move inside the building , you actually have quite a physical , special experience of working with or against the building .
and then there are funny elements in there - like a yellow balcony , which is a reference to hamsun 's novel " hunger , " or a wooden structure that symbolizes the empty violin case in " mysteries . "

the vote is seen as a test for chancellor angela merkel ’ s federal government and polls suggest the ruling coalition is in trouble . polling stations in the german state of north rhine-westphalia -lrb- nrw -rrb- opened sunday morning in a state election widely seen as a referendum on chancellor angela merkel 's six-month-old government .
merkel 's conservative christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and coalition partner the free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- must hold onto power in germany 's most populous state in order to maintain a majority in the upper house of parliament , the bundesrat .
a defeat for the parties in the state , where they have also ruled in a center-right coalition since 2005 , would end their majority and lead to delays in delivering tax cuts and implementing other policies agreed to after last september 's federal election .
recent opinion polls suggest the cdu and the fdp lack the necessary support needed to maintain their majority .
the election comes just days after the german parliament approved a 22.4-billion-euro -lrb- $ 28.6 billion -rrb- emergency bailout for debt-stricken greece , a move that has proved deeply unpopular with voters .
in a poll published on saturday , 21 percent of nrw voters said the greek bailout would affect their ballot decision , according to the yougov survey for german daily bild .

eu finance ministers will meet on sunday to discuss the plan . european union leaders are working overtime to construct new crisis defense mechanisms to safeguard the euro currency and crack down on market speculation before the asian financial markets reopen on monday .
on sunday , european union finance ministers debated proposals to set up a 600 billion euro -lrb- $ 765 billion -rrb- rescue fund for member countries states that fall into financial trouble , said diplomats in brussels .
the package would consist funds raised by the eu 's executive , the european commission , loans from eurozone states ; and money from the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- , diplomats said .
german chancellor angela merkel was holding a crisis cabinet meeting in berlin late sunday , to deal with the consequences of a prospective rescue system being negotiated in brussels , officials said .

investors are keeping a close watch on greek opposition to greek prime minister george papandreou 's austerity plans , concerned that prolonged protests could weaken his resolve to push through the cuts passed by the greek parliament on thursday .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de literature -pipe- 09.05.2010 norwegian museum reflects love-hate relationship with author hamsun großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamsunsenteret - the knut hamsun center - is architectural eye candy in the coming weeks , a museum dedicated to knut hamsun , one of norway 's most notable authors , is due to open to the public .
organizers say the writer 's association with the nazi party will be explored in the exhibition . norwegian writer knut hamsun received the nobel prize for literature in 1920 for his epic , " growth of the soil . "
he is noted for laying the groundwork for the modern novel by developing literary styles of revealing the intricacies of the human psyche .
such techniques would find their way into works by franz kafka , james joyce and virginia wolf , to name just a few .
but hamsun was also an ardent advocate of the nazi party both before world war ii and after germany occupied norway in 1941 .
in 1943 , he sent his nobel prize to nazi propaganda minister joseph goebbels as a gift .
he later visited adolf hitler and after the nazi leader 's death , proclaimed in a may 1945 newspaper eulogy " he was a warrior , a warrior for mankind , and a prophet of the gospel of justice for all nations . "
despite his nazi association , many norwegians have renewed their respect for his literary greatness .
last year saw extensive festivities commemorating the author 's 150th birthday , peaking in the august opening of the knut hamsun center -lrb- hamsunsenteret -rrb- in hamoroy , north of the arctic circle , where the writer grew up .
the museum closed soon after , with organizers then beginning preparations of the exhibition that is to showcase hamsun 's literary talent , as well as his dark past , when the museum opens to the public on june 11th , 2010 .
deutsche welle spoke with bordil borset , director of the hamsunsenteret .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 150th anniversary of hamsun 's birth was celebrated last year deutsche welle : why was the museum built to honor the writer and nobel prize winner knut hamsun ?
bordil borset : he came here to hamoroy when he was three years old with this parents , stayed here as a child , and came back as a grown-up during different periods of his life .
and this area - nordland -lsb- province -rsb- and hamoroy are very important in his life and works .
the idea to build the museum came about in 1986 , but it was a long , complicated process before it was actually completed .
part of the problem was getting enough funding , but the long process also had to due with the controversy surrounding knut hamsun as a person and his sympathizing with the nazis before and during the second world war .
how has that controversy been played out ?
there have been a lot of restrictions about naming streets , places and monuments after hamsun in norway .
and if one considers the new museum to be a monument to knut hamsun , then the question is asked : " why would we build a monument to someone who has brought shame to norway ? "
and what 's your answer to that ?
the museum is built as a center for communicating and researching about knut hamsun 's life and literature , and it 's a museum for all aspects of the person , just like other museums devoted to writers .
what 's unique about this particular one is its architecture .
it 's designed by one of the world 's most famous architects , steven holl .
this is unique around the world , this combination - a museum devoted to a nobel prize-winning author , designed by an internationally famous architect as an interpretation of the writer 's work , literary figures and his life .
and all of it placed in this nordland landscape , with nature completely surrounding it , and which was so central in hamsun 's works .
how does the museum 's architecture reflect hamsun 's literary landscapes ?
steven holl 's idea with the building was to construct it as a human body , a figure which includes all the contradictions and themes found in hamsun 's literary characters in his novels " hunger , " " mysteries , " and so on .
the building is a place of contradictory forces - there are dark corners and big , open spaces , and labyrinths , and the changing light and seasons make it appear different each day .
it 's a complex building that is always changing , just like the psychology of hamsun 's early characters .
bildunterschrift : the exterior is supposed to represent a church tower what 's unique about hamsun 's literary works ?
he created a new way of describing the human psyche , which is quite close to what james joyce did in the early 20th century , except that knut hamsun did that 20 to 30 years before stream of consciousness or modernism or the modern novel .
he 's a predecessor of the modern novel in the 20th century .
and he invented some techniques of describing the human psyche , this new hyper-sensitivity toward the modern world .
and then his work opens up and he invents this gallery of characters .
when he wrote literature , he wrote on small pieces of paper - like sheets from a calendar - and spread them out , plotted them out in front of him , on his desk to invent this literary universe .
what is also unique is how he combines this hyper-sensitivity and complexity of characters with his love of nature and the inspiration he gleaned from that - all using his beautiful linguistic techniques .
how does that his keen sensitivity as a novelist jibe with his nazi affiliation ?
this is the big question and mystery of hamsun which has been haunting us for 50 , 60 , 70 years .
how can one of the world 's finest writers , someone who writes with such sensitivity about love , nature and the human psyche , take such a political stance as a person ?
i ca n't answer that .
it 's one of those contradictions of knut hamsun .
yes , he was one of the world 's greatest authors , and yes , he supported the terrible nazi regime , which we have absolutely no sympathy for .
did he ever offer an explanation for that ?
no .
after world war ii , he was fined a huge sum of money , which was to be paid to the norwegian state .
-lsb- editors ' note : he was to stand trial for treason , but was deemed mentally unfit due to his advanced age . -rsb-
but it could never be proved that hamsun was actually a member of the nazi party .
the subject is addressed again and again in biographies about him ; it 's a question that can not be answered .
just as his characters were complicated and contradictory , so was he .
that 's how human beings are .
there are lots of aspects about human beings that we ca n't explain .
how is hamsun 's nazi past addressed at the museum ?
in the exhibition , all aspects of hamsun 's life and literature are addressed and presented - everything from first editions of his works to the trial after world war ii .
we are also offering lectures , movies , debates , and conferences on the issue .
it will always be treated critically , and it has to be because there is no other way of learning how we are and how we behave today .
he can learn from hamsun 's life and actions and perhaps apply that to how we are today .
that 's what literature does to us , what makes it eternal , what makes it great .
the only way to handle the topic is to address it openly .
but i think there is a new generation of historians coming on stage now who are dealing with the war in a different way .
all last year , during the jubilee for hamsun 's 150th birthday , the political aspects of him were discussed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the interior is deliberately labyrinthine hamsun was actually just one of many nazi sympathizers , but because he was an important person , because he claimed to be one of the big , new norwegian writers - our national poet - , the disappointment , the betrayal people felt was all the greater .
it was a trauma for the norwegian people .
how could he do this ?
and why did he never apologize ?
or show remorse or regret after the war ?
please tell me more about the architecture of the museum .
when you enter the area around the museum , you see this big , black tower , which is reminiscent of old , wooden , norwegian churches .
but it also refers to a scene in one of hamsun 's novels .
then , on the top of the roof , you see bamboo , which is like a strange mix of hair and grass .
the building sort of leans to the side , and all this together makes it appear like a figure .
inside , it 's white , so you get this contrast of the black , wooden exterior and white , concrete interior .
in the middle of the building , there is this brass elevator .
if the building is a metaphor for the body , then this brass elevator is like the spine holding it all up ; it 's the core , the stable element .
but there are glass panels in it , so you can see the movements both inside and outside the elevator - like the nerves in the spine of human beings .
stephan holl has all these playful tricks and illusions inside the building that make it challenging , and create a dynamic between the open spaces and the darker corners .
also , on the first level , the floor is made of blackish-gray concrete and is slightly tilted , so when you move inside the building , you actually have quite a physical , special experience of working with or against the building .
and then there are funny elements in there - like a yellow balcony , which is a reference to hamsun 's novel " hunger , " or a wooden structure that symbolizes the empty violin case in " mysteries . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de literature -pipe- 09.05.2010 norwegian museum reflects love-hate relationship with author hamsun großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamsunsenteret - the knut hamsun center - is architectural eye candy in the coming weeks , a museum dedicated to knut hamsun , one of norway 's most notable authors , is due to open to the public .
organizers say the writer 's association with the nazi party will be explored in the exhibition . norwegian writer knut hamsun received the nobel prize for literature in 1920 for his epic , " growth of the soil . "
he is noted for laying the groundwork for the modern novel by developing literary styles of revealing the intricacies of the human psyche .
such techniques would find their way into works by franz kafka , james joyce and virginia wolf , to name just a few .
but hamsun was also an ardent advocate of the nazi party both before world war ii and after germany occupied norway in 1941 .
in 1943 , he sent his nobel prize to nazi propaganda minister joseph goebbels as a gift .
he later visited adolf hitler and after the nazi leader 's death , proclaimed in a may 1945 newspaper eulogy " he was a warrior , a warrior for mankind , and a prophet of the gospel of justice for all nations . "
despite his nazi association , many norwegians have renewed their respect for his literary greatness .
last year saw extensive festivities commemorating the author 's 150th birthday , peaking in the august opening of the knut hamsun center -lrb- hamsunsenteret -rrb- in hamoroy , north of the arctic circle , where the writer grew up .
the museum closed soon after , with organizers then beginning preparations of the exhibition that is to showcase hamsun 's literary talent , as well as his dark past , when the museum opens to the public on june 11th , 2010 .
deutsche welle spoke with bordil borset , director of the hamsunsenteret .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 150th anniversary of hamsun 's birth was celebrated last year deutsche welle : why was the museum built to honor the writer and nobel prize winner knut hamsun ?
bordil borset : he came here to hamoroy when he was three years old with this parents , stayed here as a child , and came back as a grown-up during different periods of his life .
and this area - nordland -lsb- province -rsb- and hamoroy are very important in his life and works .
the idea to build the museum came about in 1986 , but it was a long , complicated process before it was actually completed .
part of the problem was getting enough funding , but the long process also had to due with the controversy surrounding knut hamsun as a person and his sympathizing with the nazis before and during the second world war .
how has that controversy been played out ?
there have been a lot of restrictions about naming streets , places and monuments after hamsun in norway .
and if one considers the new museum to be a monument to knut hamsun , then the question is asked : " why would we build a monument to someone who has brought shame to norway ? "
and what 's your answer to that ?
the museum is built as a center for communicating and researching about knut hamsun 's life and literature , and it 's a museum for all aspects of the person , just like other museums devoted to writers .
what 's unique about this particular one is its architecture .
it 's designed by one of the world 's most famous architects , steven holl .
this is unique around the world , this combination - a museum devoted to a nobel prize-winning author , designed by an internationally famous architect as an interpretation of the writer 's work , literary figures and his life .
and all of it placed in this nordland landscape , with nature completely surrounding it , and which was so central in hamsun 's works .
how does the museum 's architecture reflect hamsun 's literary landscapes ?
steven holl 's idea with the building was to construct it as a human body , a figure which includes all the contradictions and themes found in hamsun 's literary characters in his novels " hunger , " " mysteries , " and so on .
the building is a place of contradictory forces - there are dark corners and big , open spaces , and labyrinths , and the changing light and seasons make it appear different each day .
it 's a complex building that is always changing , just like the psychology of hamsun 's early characters .
bildunterschrift : the exterior is supposed to represent a church tower what 's unique about hamsun 's literary works ?
he created a new way of describing the human psyche , which is quite close to what james joyce did in the early 20th century , except that knut hamsun did that 20 to 30 years before stream of consciousness or modernism or the modern novel .
he 's a predecessor of the modern novel in the 20th century .
and he invented some techniques of describing the human psyche , this new hyper-sensitivity toward the modern world .
and then his work opens up and he invents this gallery of characters .
when he wrote literature , he wrote on small pieces of paper - like sheets from a calendar - and spread them out , plotted them out in front of him , on his desk to invent this literary universe .
what is also unique is how he combines this hyper-sensitivity and complexity of characters with his love of nature and the inspiration he gleaned from that - all using his beautiful linguistic techniques .
how does that his keen sensitivity as a novelist jibe with his nazi affiliation ?
this is the big question and mystery of hamsun which has been haunting us for 50 , 60 , 70 years .
how can one of the world 's finest writers , someone who writes with such sensitivity about love , nature and the human psyche , take such a political stance as a person ?
i ca n't answer that .
it 's one of those contradictions of knut hamsun .
yes , he was one of the world 's greatest authors , and yes , he supported the terrible nazi regime , which we have absolutely no sympathy for .
did he ever offer an explanation for that ?
no .
after world war ii , he was fined a huge sum of money , which was to be paid to the norwegian state .
-lsb- editors ' note : he was to stand trial for treason , but was deemed mentally unfit due to his advanced age . -rsb-
but it could never be proved that hamsun was actually a member of the nazi party .
the subject is addressed again and again in biographies about him ; it 's a question that can not be answered .
just as his characters were complicated and contradictory , so was he .
that 's how human beings are .
there are lots of aspects about human beings that we ca n't explain .
how is hamsun 's nazi past addressed at the museum ?
in the exhibition , all aspects of hamsun 's life and literature are addressed and presented - everything from first editions of his works to the trial after world war ii .
we are also offering lectures , movies , debates , and conferences on the issue .
it will always be treated critically , and it has to be because there is no other way of learning how we are and how we behave today .
he can learn from hamsun 's life and actions and perhaps apply that to how we are today .
that 's what literature does to us , what makes it eternal , what makes it great .
the only way to handle the topic is to address it openly .
but i think there is a new generation of historians coming on stage now who are dealing with the war in a different way .
all last year , during the jubilee for hamsun 's 150th birthday , the political aspects of him were discussed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the interior is deliberately labyrinthine hamsun was actually just one of many nazi sympathizers , but because he was an important person , because he claimed to be one of the big , new norwegian writers - our national poet - , the disappointment , the betrayal people felt was all the greater .
it was a trauma for the norwegian people .
how could he do this ?
and why did he never apologize ?
or show remorse or regret after the war ?
please tell me more about the architecture of the museum .
when you enter the area around the museum , you see this big , black tower , which is reminiscent of old , wooden , norwegian churches .
but it also refers to a scene in one of hamsun 's novels .
then , on the top of the roof , you see bamboo , which is like a strange mix of hair and grass .
the building sort of leans to the side , and all this together makes it appear like a figure .
inside , it 's white , so you get this contrast of the black , wooden exterior and white , concrete interior .
in the middle of the building , there is this brass elevator .
if the building is a metaphor for the body , then this brass elevator is like the spine holding it all up ; it 's the core , the stable element .
but there are glass panels in it , so you can see the movements both inside and outside the elevator - like the nerves in the spine of human beings .
stephan holl has all these playful tricks and illusions inside the building that make it challenging , and create a dynamic between the open spaces and the darker corners .
also , on the first level , the floor is made of blackish-gray concrete and is slightly tilted , so when you move inside the building , you actually have quite a physical , special experience of working with or against the building .
and then there are funny elements in there - like a yellow balcony , which is a reference to hamsun 's novel " hunger , " or a wooden structure that symbolizes the empty violin case in " mysteries . "

organizers say the writer 's association with the nazi party will be explored in the exhibition . norwegian writer knut hamsun received the nobel prize for literature in 1920 for his epic , " growth of the soil . "
he is noted for laying the groundwork for the modern novel by developing literary styles of revealing the intricacies of the human psyche .
such techniques would find their way into works by franz kafka , james joyce and virginia wolf , to name just a few .

he later visited adolf hitler and after the nazi leader 's death , proclaimed in a may 1945 newspaper eulogy " he was a warrior , a warrior for mankind , and a prophet of the gospel of justice for all nations . "
despite his nazi association , many norwegians have renewed their respect for his literary greatness .
last year saw extensive festivities commemorating the author 's 150th birthday , peaking in the august opening of the knut hamsun center -lrb- hamsunsenteret -rrb- in hamoroy , north of the arctic circle , where the writer grew up .
the museum closed soon after , with organizers then beginning preparations of the exhibition that is to showcase hamsun 's literary talent , as well as his dark past , when the museum opens to the public on june 11th , 2010 .
deutsche welle spoke with bordil borset , director of the hamsunsenteret .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 150th anniversary of hamsun 's birth was celebrated last year deutsche welle : why was the museum built to honor the writer and nobel prize winner knut hamsun ?
bordil borset : he came here to hamoroy when he was three years old with this parents , stayed here as a child , and came back as a grown-up during different periods of his life .
and this area - nordland -lsb- province -rsb- and hamoroy are very important in his life and works .
the idea to build the museum came about in 1986 , but it was a long , complicated process before it was actually completed .
part of the problem was getting enough funding , but the long process also had to due with the controversy surrounding knut hamsun as a person and his sympathizing with the nazis before and during the second world war .
how has that controversy been played out ?
there have been a lot of restrictions about naming streets , places and monuments after hamsun in norway .
and if one considers the new museum to be a monument to knut hamsun , then the question is asked : " why would we build a monument to someone who has brought shame to norway ? "
and what 's your answer to that ?
the museum is built as a center for communicating and researching about knut hamsun 's life and literature , and it 's a museum for all aspects of the person , just like other museums devoted to writers .
what 's unique about this particular one is its architecture .
it 's designed by one of the world 's most famous architects , steven holl .
this is unique around the world , this combination - a museum devoted to a nobel prize-winning author , designed by an internationally famous architect as an interpretation of the writer 's work , literary figures and his life .
and all of it placed in this nordland landscape , with nature completely surrounding it , and which was so central in hamsun 's works .
how does the museum 's architecture reflect hamsun 's literary landscapes ?
steven holl 's idea with the building was to construct it as a human body , a figure which includes all the contradictions and themes found in hamsun 's literary characters in his novels " hunger , " " mysteries , " and so on .
the building is a place of contradictory forces - there are dark corners and big , open spaces , and labyrinths , and the changing light and seasons make it appear different each day .
it 's a complex building that is always changing , just like the psychology of hamsun 's early characters .
bildunterschrift : the exterior is supposed to represent a church tower what 's unique about hamsun 's literary works ?
he created a new way of describing the human psyche , which is quite close to what james joyce did in the early 20th century , except that knut hamsun did that 20 to 30 years before stream of consciousness or modernism or the modern novel .
he 's a predecessor of the modern novel in the 20th century .
and he invented some techniques of describing the human psyche , this new hyper-sensitivity toward the modern world .
and then his work opens up and he invents this gallery of characters .
when he wrote literature , he wrote on small pieces of paper - like sheets from a calendar - and spread them out , plotted them out in front of him , on his desk to invent this literary universe .
what is also unique is how he combines this hyper-sensitivity and complexity of characters with his love of nature and the inspiration he gleaned from that - all using his beautiful linguistic techniques .
how does that his keen sensitivity as a novelist jibe with his nazi affiliation ?
this is the big question and mystery of hamsun which has been haunting us for 50 , 60 , 70 years .
how can one of the world 's finest writers , someone who writes with such sensitivity about love , nature and the human psyche , take such a political stance as a person ?
i ca n't answer that .
it 's one of those contradictions of knut hamsun .
yes , he was one of the world 's greatest authors , and yes , he supported the terrible nazi regime , which we have absolutely no sympathy for .
did he ever offer an explanation for that ?
no .
after world war ii , he was fined a huge sum of money , which was to be paid to the norwegian state .
-lsb- editors ' note : he was to stand trial for treason , but was deemed mentally unfit due to his advanced age . -rsb-
but it could never be proved that hamsun was actually a member of the nazi party .
the subject is addressed again and again in biographies about him ; it 's a question that can not be answered .
just as his characters were complicated and contradictory , so was he .
that 's how human beings are .
there are lots of aspects about human beings that we ca n't explain .
how is hamsun 's nazi past addressed at the museum ?
in the exhibition , all aspects of hamsun 's life and literature are addressed and presented - everything from first editions of his works to the trial after world war ii .
we are also offering lectures , movies , debates , and conferences on the issue .
it will always be treated critically , and it has to be because there is no other way of learning how we are and how we behave today .
he can learn from hamsun 's life and actions and perhaps apply that to how we are today .
that 's what literature does to us , what makes it eternal , what makes it great .
the only way to handle the topic is to address it openly .
but i think there is a new generation of historians coming on stage now who are dealing with the war in a different way .
all last year , during the jubilee for hamsun 's 150th birthday , the political aspects of him were discussed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the interior is deliberately labyrinthine hamsun was actually just one of many nazi sympathizers , but because he was an important person , because he claimed to be one of the big , new norwegian writers - our national poet - , the disappointment , the betrayal people felt was all the greater .
it was a trauma for the norwegian people .
how could he do this ?
and why did he never apologize ?
or show remorse or regret after the war ?
please tell me more about the architecture of the museum .
when you enter the area around the museum , you see this big , black tower , which is reminiscent of old , wooden , norwegian churches .
but it also refers to a scene in one of hamsun 's novels .
then , on the top of the roof , you see bamboo , which is like a strange mix of hair and grass .
the building sort of leans to the side , and all this together makes it appear like a figure .
inside , it 's white , so you get this contrast of the black , wooden exterior and white , concrete interior .
in the middle of the building , there is this brass elevator .
if the building is a metaphor for the body , then this brass elevator is like the spine holding it all up ; it 's the core , the stable element .
but there are glass panels in it , so you can see the movements both inside and outside the elevator - like the nerves in the spine of human beings .
stephan holl has all these playful tricks and illusions inside the building that make it challenging , and create a dynamic between the open spaces and the darker corners .
also , on the first level , the floor is made of blackish-gray concrete and is slightly tilted , so when you move inside the building , you actually have quite a physical , special experience of working with or against the building .
and then there are funny elements in there - like a yellow balcony , which is a reference to hamsun 's novel " hunger , " or a wooden structure that symbolizes the empty violin case in " mysteries . "

the vote is seen as a test for chancellor angela merkel ’ s federal government and polls suggest the ruling coalition is in trouble . polling stations in the german state of north rhine-westphalia -lrb- nrw -rrb- opened sunday morning in a state election widely seen as a referendum on chancellor angela merkel 's six-month-old government .
merkel 's conservative christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and coalition partner the free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- must hold onto power in germany 's most populous state in order to maintain a majority in the upper house of parliament , the bundesrat .
a defeat for the parties in the state , where they have also ruled in a center-right coalition since 2005 , would end their majority and lead to delays in delivering tax cuts and implementing other policies agreed to after last september 's federal election .
recent opinion polls suggest the cdu and the fdp lack the necessary support needed to maintain their majority .
the election comes just days after the german parliament approved a 22.4-billion-euro -lrb- $ 28.6 billion -rrb- emergency bailout for debt-stricken greece , a move that has proved deeply unpopular with voters .
in a poll published on saturday , 21 percent of nrw voters said the greek bailout would affect their ballot decision , according to the yougov survey for german daily bild .
spd looks to regain control " the issue has electrified people as seldom before and is going to play a determining role in the election , " said klaus-peter schoeppner , head of the polling institute emnid , in the online edition of the rheinische post .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spd leader hannelore kraft hopes to regain control of the state the rival social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , who held power for four decades until being ousted in 2005 , are looking to regain control in the influential state , home to 13.5 million eligible voters .
the spd abstained in friday 's vote on the greek aid package , a tactical move that analysts say could give them the edge .
current polls suggest that the spd and their preferred partners , the greens , have the support of between 45 and 47 percent of voters .
current predictions estimate the cdu-fdp block winning 43 to 45 percent of the vote .
" if the cdu loses its majority with the fdp , which is to be expected , it would not be a catastrophe but it would certainly make things more complicated and difficult for the chancellor , " said gerd langguth , a political scientist at the university of bonn and biographer of merkel. cmk / afp / reuters editor : kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

organizers say the writer 's association with the nazi party will be explored in the exhibition . norwegian writer knut hamsun received the nobel prize for literature in 1920 for his epic , " growth of the soil . "
he is noted for laying the groundwork for the modern novel by developing literary styles of revealing the intricacies of the human psyche .
such techniques would find their way into works by franz kafka , james joyce and virginia wolf , to name just a few .
but hamsun was also an ardent advocate of the nazi party both before world war ii and after germany occupied norway in 1941 .
in 1943 , he sent his nobel prize to nazi propaganda minister joseph goebbels as a gift .
he later visited adolf hitler and after the nazi leader 's death , proclaimed in a may 1945 newspaper eulogy " he was a warrior , a warrior for mankind , and a prophet of the gospel of justice for all nations . "

eu finance ministers will meet on sunday to discuss the plan . european union leaders are working overtime to construct new crisis defense mechanisms to safeguard the euro currency and crack down on market speculation before the asian financial markets reopen on monday .
on sunday , european union finance ministers debated proposals to set up a 600 billion euro -lrb- $ 765 billion -rrb- rescue fund for member countries states that fall into financial trouble , said diplomats in brussels .
the package would consist funds raised by the eu 's executive , the european commission , loans from eurozone states ; and money from the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- , diplomats said .
german chancellor angela merkel was holding a crisis cabinet meeting in berlin late sunday , to deal with the consequences of a prospective rescue system being negotiated in brussels , officials said .
a clear signal " taking into account the exceptional circumstances , the european commission will propose a european stabilization mechanism to preserve financial stability in europe , " herman van rompuy , the president of the eu , said in a statement released in the early hours of saturday morning .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and sarkozy both want to protect the euro from speculators german chancellor angela merkel said the move will send " a very clear signal " to market speculators by creating a common fund to support economies in difficulty . the european portion of the bailout will amount to some 80 billion euros -lrb- $ 102 billion -rrb- over three years , with germany set to provide the lion 's share.the imf has approved 30 billion euro loan for greece .
despite the 110 billion euro bailout , financial markets reacted negatively to the continued uncertainty , prompting eu leaders to consider new steps to prevent similar financial chaos from spreading to other member states .
the unprecedented greek bailout is due to be transferred to athens within days .
greeks oppose cuts the emergency summit in brussels coincided with ceremonies to commemorate the end of world war ii in europe , forcing some european leaders to cancel their plans to attend the events .
french president nicolas sarkozy and italian prime minister silvio berlusconi have both pulled out of sunday 's war commemorations in russia to deal with the financial crisis , but german chancellor angela merkel has arrived in moscow and will attend the ceremonies .
investors are keeping a close watch on greek opposition to greek prime minister george papandreou 's austerity plans , concerned that prolonged protests could weaken his resolve to push through the cuts passed by the greek parliament on thursday .
on saturday , opinion polls showed a majority of greeks support further protests against the austerity measures. smh / afp / ap / dpa editor : rick demarest send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

kuranyi could more than double his salary with the move to the 10th-ranked russian team . former germany striker kevin kuranyi said on his website on sunday that he was leaving schalke for a deal with russia 's dynamo moscow .
kuranyi was one of the bundesliga 's top scorers this season with 18 goals and schalke ended the season in second place , after bayern munich .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : saturday 's match was kuranyi 's last playing for schalke " after carefully weighing all the arguments and following several discussions , i have decided to transfer to russia with dynamo moscow , " kuranyi wrote in a " letter to his fans . "
" i always said that the whole package must be right .
i have this feeling with dynamo .
one aspect is certainly the financial one , " he said .
the 28-year-old will leave on a free transfer on july 1 and is said to have signed a three-year contract paying more than 6 million euros -lrb- $ 7.6 million -rrb- per season .
that more than doubles his current salary .
despite a slow start in the russian season and a current rank of 10th in their league , dynamo should n't be underestimated , kuranyi said .
dynamo has won 11 national titles , although the most recent victory was in 1976 .
no spot on the national team despite a successful league season , kuranyi was not chosen for germany 's national squad for the world cup in south africa this june .
national coach joachim loew kicked him off the team after he walked out on the team during a world cup qualifier in october 2008 after being left off that day 's line-up .
at the time loew said he would never ask him to play again and resisted pressure to include him on the world cup team. hf / afp / dpa editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the long-planned talks had suffered a setback due to new israeli settlement plans . after a long hiatus and much prodding by the new us administration , israelis and palestinians have begun indirect peace negotiations .
" the proximity talks have started , " chief palestinian negotiator saeb erakat told reporters on sunday in the west bank city of ramallah after a meeting between palestinian president mahmud abbas and us envoy george mitchell .
" today , on may 9 , the negotiations have begun at the level of the president -lrb- abbas -rrb- and -lrb- israeli prime minister benjamin -rrb- netanyahu , " he added , while stressing there would be no direct contact between the parties .
" there are no negotiations between us and the israeli government , " he said .
" the discussions will be held with mitchell and the americans and they will mediate between the two sides . "
the fact that both parties could n't agree to face-to-face meetings , but instead will only participate in " proximity " talks , shows the deep rift between israelis and palestinians on the issue .
in proximity talks , the involved parties do n't meet and discuss problems directly , but rely on an intermediary to conduct the negotiations . " indirect negotiations are an invention of henry kissinger , " explains shlomo ben-ami , a former israeli foreign minister , who was a key negotiator in the israeli-palestinian talks in camp david in 2000 and taba in 2001 .
kissinger , in the wake of the 1973 yom kippur war , resorted to what has since then been called shuttle diplomacy to negotiate between the syrians , the israelis and the egyptians .
since that time it has become an established mechanism to try to mediate between parties in long-standing conflicts .
" that 's ok , but if you do not reach at a certain point direct negotiations it is useless , " said ben-ami in an interview with deutsche welle .
" there is no way they can reach an agreement through a third party . "
indirect talks as best option while direct talks between israelis and palestinians are ultimately necessary to hammer out a peace deal , at this point indirect talks are probably a better option , said álvaro de soto , who headed negotiations that ended the civil war in el salvador and served as un special coordinator for the middle east peace process until 2007 .
he said the format of proximity talks is actually a good choice for the middle east , especially in the current hostile climate between both parties .
bildunterschrift : israeli-palestinian peace efforts have a bad track record " and i think that altogether too much of a production has been made about direct talks .
proximity talks have the advantage in this case of placing a much greater responsibility on the mediator , the mediator being the united states . "
both experts agree that aside from the us there is no other actor that would be acceptable to both parties .
the palestinians know that only washington has real influence and can bring israel to agree to a peace deal .
the israelis believe that they can trust only washington not to betray them and their crucial interests as a mediator . key role for washington while it has been pretty much commonly accepted that only washington can mediate this conflict , there is at the same time concern that the us , because of its close ties with israel , ca n't really act as an honest broker .
" i am convinced that only the us can play this role and i do n't set too much store by the objection that the us has a bias in this matter , " said de soto .
" the us role , it seems to me , is unavoidable and indispensible and i am very pleased that the us is at the center . "
that , however , does n't guarantee that this round of talks , which are slated to last four months , will be any more successful than all the previous attempts to achieve a breakthrough on the israeli-palestinian issue .
" if these people get an agreement they will deserve a nobel peace prize in physics , " said ben-ami .
difficult circumstances he believes that the underlying conditions for both israelis and palestinians are so negative , that it will be practically impossible for them to overcome .
palestinian president mahmoud abbas ' authority is challenged by hamas while israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu 's ability to agree to a deal is limited through the coalition with his hard-line foreign minister avigdor lieberman .
de soto adds that no viable agreement is possible if hamas is n't somehow included in the peace process .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israel angered the us and palestinians by announcing new settlements however , the slim chances for success also have a positive side .
" low expectations is what any mediator wants at the start of a mediation , i can tell you that from a professional 's standpoint , " said de soto , who believes that us middle east envoy george mitchell is exactly the right person for this mission impossible .
how exactly george mitchell will carry out this shuttle diplomacy neither of the experts could say .
" actually , it 's not a bad thing that little is known about what 's going on in a given peace process , " says de soto .
" negotiations , and peace negotiations in particular , are like very delicate , exotic orchids .
if you expose them to inclement weather they might wilt . "

it was also the first time that nato forces participated . foreign troops from four nato member states marched on moscow 's red square for the first time on sunday as part of a parade marking the 65th anniversary of the end of world war ii .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian military jets fly in formation over red square on sunday around 1,000 troops from britain , france , poland and the united states took part in the military parade , alongside some 10,000 members of the russian army and soldiers from ex-soviet countries armenia , belarus , kazakhstan , kyrgyzstan , moldova , tajikistan , turkmenistan and ukraine .
" sixty-five years ago , nazism was defeated and a machine that was exterminating whole peoples was halted , " russian president dmitry medvedev said in his speech .
" there was one choice – either victory or to become slaves .
the war made us a strong nation . "
german chancellor angela merkel arrived in moscow on saturday to take part in the commemoration , joining medvedev , chinese president hu jintao and around two dozen other world leaders at the military parade .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british military personnel marching in the the largest-ever post-soviet military parade french president nicolas sarkozy and italian prime minister silvio berlusconi pulled out of the event to instead concentrate on the european financial crisis .
in an interview with the russian itar-tass news agency , merkel said the invitation to the victory celebration was a great honor .
she said the gesture showed that russia and germany had learned from history and could live in peace and friendship .
in 2005 , gerhard schroeder became the first german chancellor to be invited to the red square victory celebration .
protests planned bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel is the second german chancellor to be invited to the victory day commemorations russia 's communists , the country 's biggest opposition party , were planning to hold a protest march in central moscow after the parade .
they were angry that nato troops had been given permission to march on the square , home to the embalmed body of their revolutionary hero , vladimir lenin .
" foreign troops have never appeared on red square .
it 's a violation of tradition , " said sergei obukhov , a member of the party 's central committee .
" the presence of foreign troops with weapons in their hands is ... an unnecessary reminder that we lost the cold war . "
mine explosion the celebrations were overshadowed by two methane gas explosions at a coal mine in the siberian region of kemerova , which hours earlier killed at least 12 people , injured dozens and trapped more than 80 miners and rescuers .
the first explosion occurred late saturday night , with the second following a few hours later as a rescue operation was underway .
renewed rescue operations continue , but the high concentration of methane gas poses a risk of further explosions .
russian prime minister vladimir putin described the situation as " difficult " and " tragic " and urged authorities to do everything possible to rescue those still trapped underground. cmk / afp / dpa / reuters editor : kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

they were angry that nato troops had been given permission to march on the square , home to the embalmed body of their revolutionary hero , vladimir lenin .
" foreign troops have never appeared on red square .
it 's a violation of tradition , " said sergei obukhov , a member of the party 's central committee .
" the presence of foreign troops with weapons in their hands is ... an unnecessary reminder that we lost the cold war . "
mine explosion the celebrations were overshadowed by two methane gas explosions at a coal mine in the siberian region of kemerova , which hours earlier killed at least 12 people , injured dozens and trapped more than 80 miners and rescuers .
the first explosion occurred late saturday night , with the second following a few hours later as a rescue operation was underway .
renewed rescue operations continue , but the high concentration of methane gas poses a risk of further explosions .
russian prime minister vladimir putin described the situation as " difficult " and " tragic " and urged authorities to do everything possible to rescue those still trapped underground. cmk / afp / dpa / reuters editor : kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the package would consist funds raised by the eu 's executive , the european commission , loans from eurozone states ; and money from the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- , diplomats said .

the vote is seen as a test for chancellor angela merkel ’ s federal government and polls suggest the ruling coalition is in trouble . polling stations in the german state of north rhine-westphalia -lrb- nrw -rrb- opened sunday morning in a state election widely seen as a referendum on chancellor angela merkel 's six-month-old government .
merkel 's conservative christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and coalition partner the free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- must hold onto power in germany 's most populous state in order to maintain a majority in the upper house of parliament , the bundesrat .
a defeat for the parties in the state , where they have also ruled in a center-right coalition since 2005 , would end their majority and lead to delays in delivering tax cuts and implementing other policies agreed to after last september 's federal election .
recent opinion polls suggest the cdu and the fdp lack the necessary support needed to maintain their majority .
the election comes just days after the german parliament approved a 22.4-billion-euro -lrb- $ 28.6 billion -rrb- emergency bailout for debt-stricken greece , a move that has proved deeply unpopular with voters .
in a poll published on saturday , 21 percent of nrw voters said the greek bailout would affect their ballot decision , according to the yougov survey for german daily bild .
spd looks to regain control " the issue has electrified people as seldom before and is going to play a determining role in the election , " said klaus-peter schoeppner , head of the polling institute emnid , in the online edition of the rheinische post .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spd leader hannelore kraft hopes to regain control of the state the rival social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , who held power for four decades until being ousted in 2005 , are looking to regain control in the influential state , home to 13.5 million eligible voters .
the spd abstained in friday 's vote on the greek aid package , a tactical move that analysts say could give them the edge .
current polls suggest that the spd and their preferred partners , the greens , have the support of between 45 and 47 percent of voters .
current predictions estimate the cdu-fdp block winning 43 to 45 percent of the vote .
" if the cdu loses its majority with the fdp , which is to be expected , it would not be a catastrophe but it would certainly make things more complicated and difficult for the chancellor , " said gerd langguth , a political scientist at the university of bonn and biographer of merkel. cmk / afp / reuters editor : kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

-lrb- 07.05.2010 -rrb- crucial state vote a test for merkel 's government on the eve of elections in the western german state of north rhine-westphalia , focus has shifted to how the vote is a litmus test for the policies of chancellor angela merkel 's federal coalition government .

eu finance ministers will meet on sunday to discuss the plan . european union leaders are working overtime to construct new crisis defense mechanisms to safeguard the euro currency and crack down on market speculation before the asian financial markets reopen on monday .
on sunday , european union finance ministers debated proposals to set up a 600 billion euro -lrb- $ 765 billion -rrb- rescue fund for member countries states that fall into financial trouble , said diplomats in brussels .
the package would consist funds raised by the eu 's executive , the european commission , loans from eurozone states ; and money from the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- , diplomats said .
german chancellor angela merkel was holding a crisis cabinet meeting in berlin late sunday , to deal with the consequences of a prospective rescue system being negotiated in brussels , officials said .
a clear signal " taking into account the exceptional circumstances , the european commission will propose a european stabilization mechanism to preserve financial stability in europe , " herman van rompuy , the president of the eu , said in a statement released in the early hours of saturday morning .

despite the 110 billion euro bailout , financial markets reacted negatively to the continued uncertainty , prompting eu leaders to consider new steps to prevent similar financial chaos from spreading to other member states .
the unprecedented greek bailout is due to be transferred to athens within days .
greeks oppose cuts the emergency summit in brussels coincided with ceremonies to commemorate the end of world war ii in europe , forcing some european leaders to cancel their plans to attend the events .
french president nicolas sarkozy and italian prime minister silvio berlusconi have both pulled out of sunday 's war commemorations in russia to deal with the financial crisis , but german chancellor angela merkel has arrived in moscow and will attend the ceremonies .
investors are keeping a close watch on greek opposition to greek prime minister george papandreou 's austerity plans , concerned that prolonged protests could weaken his resolve to push through the cuts passed by the greek parliament on thursday .
on saturday , opinion polls showed a majority of greeks support further protests against the austerity measures. smh / afp / ap / dpa editor : rick demarest send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

kuranyi could more than double his salary with the move to the 10th-ranked russian team . former germany striker kevin kuranyi said on his website on sunday that he was leaving schalke for a deal with russia 's dynamo moscow .
kuranyi was one of the bundesliga 's top scorers this season with 18 goals and schalke ended the season in second place , after bayern munich .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : saturday 's match was kuranyi 's last playing for schalke " after carefully weighing all the arguments and following several discussions , i have decided to transfer to russia with dynamo moscow , " kuranyi wrote in a " letter to his fans . "
" i always said that the whole package must be right .
i have this feeling with dynamo .
one aspect is certainly the financial one , " he said .
the 28-year-old will leave on a free transfer on july 1 and is said to have signed a three-year contract paying more than 6 million euros -lrb- $ 7.6 million -rrb- per season .
that more than doubles his current salary .
despite a slow start in the russian season and a current rank of 10th in their league , dynamo should n't be underestimated , kuranyi said .
dynamo has won 11 national titles , although the most recent victory was in 1976 .
no spot on the national team despite a successful league season , kuranyi was not chosen for germany 's national squad for the world cup in south africa this june .
national coach joachim loew kicked him off the team after he walked out on the team during a world cup qualifier in october 2008 after being left off that day 's line-up .
at the time loew said he would never ask him to play again and resisted pressure to include him on the world cup team. hf / afp / dpa editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the vote is seen as a test for chancellor angela merkel ’ s federal government and polls suggest the ruling coalition is in trouble . polling stations in the german state of north rhine-westphalia -lrb- nrw -rrb- opened sunday morning in a state election widely seen as a referendum on chancellor angela merkel 's six-month-old government .
merkel 's conservative christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and coalition partner the free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- must hold onto power in germany 's most populous state in order to maintain a majority in the upper house of parliament , the bundesrat .
a defeat for the parties in the state , where they have also ruled in a center-right coalition since 2005 , would end their majority and lead to delays in delivering tax cuts and implementing other policies agreed to after last september 's federal election .
recent opinion polls suggest the cdu and the fdp lack the necessary support needed to maintain their majority .
the election comes just days after the german parliament approved a 22.4-billion-euro -lrb- $ 28.6 billion -rrb- emergency bailout for debt-stricken greece , a move that has proved deeply unpopular with voters .
in a poll published on saturday , 21 percent of nrw voters said the greek bailout would affect their ballot decision , according to the yougov survey for german daily bild .
spd looks to regain control " the issue has electrified people as seldom before and is going to play a determining role in the election , " said klaus-peter schoeppner , head of the polling institute emnid , in the online edition of the rheinische post .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spd leader hannelore kraft hopes to regain control of the state the rival social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , who held power for four decades until being ousted in 2005 , are looking to regain control in the influential state , home to 13.5 million eligible voters .
the spd abstained in friday 's vote on the greek aid package , a tactical move that analysts say could give them the edge .
current polls suggest that the spd and their preferred partners , the greens , have the support of between 45 and 47 percent of voters .
current predictions estimate the cdu-fdp block winning 43 to 45 percent of the vote .
" if the cdu loses its majority with the fdp , which is to be expected , it would not be a catastrophe but it would certainly make things more complicated and difficult for the chancellor , " said gerd langguth , a political scientist at the university of bonn and biographer of merkel. cmk / afp / reuters editor : kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" sixty-five years ago , nazism was defeated and a machine that was exterminating whole peoples was halted , " russian president dmitry medvedev said in his speech .
" there was one choice – either victory or to become slaves .
the war made us a strong nation . "

" foreign troops have never appeared on red square .

the first explosion occurred late saturday night , with the second following a few hours later as a rescue operation was underway .
renewed rescue operations continue , but the high concentration of methane gas poses a risk of further explosions .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de literature -pipe- 09.05.2010 norwegian museum reflects love-hate relationship with author hamsun großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamsunsenteret - the knut hamsun center - is architectural eye candy in the coming weeks , a museum dedicated to knut hamsun , one of norway 's most notable authors , is due to open to the public .
organizers say the writer 's association with the nazi party will be explored in the exhibition . norwegian writer knut hamsun received the nobel prize for literature in 1920 for his epic , " growth of the soil . "
he is noted for laying the groundwork for the modern novel by developing literary styles of revealing the intricacies of the human psyche .
such techniques would find their way into works by franz kafka , james joyce and virginia wolf , to name just a few .
but hamsun was also an ardent advocate of the nazi party both before world war ii and after germany occupied norway in 1941 .
in 1943 , he sent his nobel prize to nazi propaganda minister joseph goebbels as a gift .
he later visited adolf hitler and after the nazi leader 's death , proclaimed in a may 1945 newspaper eulogy " he was a warrior , a warrior for mankind , and a prophet of the gospel of justice for all nations . "
despite his nazi association , many norwegians have renewed their respect for his literary greatness .
last year saw extensive festivities commemorating the author 's 150th birthday , peaking in the august opening of the knut hamsun center -lrb- hamsunsenteret -rrb- in hamoroy , north of the arctic circle , where the writer grew up .
the museum closed soon after , with organizers then beginning preparations of the exhibition that is to showcase hamsun 's literary talent , as well as his dark past , when the museum opens to the public on june 11th , 2010 .
deutsche welle spoke with bordil borset , director of the hamsunsenteret .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 150th anniversary of hamsun 's birth was celebrated last year deutsche welle : why was the museum built to honor the writer and nobel prize winner knut hamsun ?
bordil borset : he came here to hamoroy when he was three years old with this parents , stayed here as a child , and came back as a grown-up during different periods of his life .
and this area - nordland -lsb- province -rsb- and hamoroy are very important in his life and works .
the idea to build the museum came about in 1986 , but it was a long , complicated process before it was actually completed .
part of the problem was getting enough funding , but the long process also had to due with the controversy surrounding knut hamsun as a person and his sympathizing with the nazis before and during the second world war .
how has that controversy been played out ?
there have been a lot of restrictions about naming streets , places and monuments after hamsun in norway .
and if one considers the new museum to be a monument to knut hamsun , then the question is asked : " why would we build a monument to someone who has brought shame to norway ? "
and what 's your answer to that ?
the museum is built as a center for communicating and researching about knut hamsun 's life and literature , and it 's a museum for all aspects of the person , just like other museums devoted to writers .
what 's unique about this particular one is its architecture .
it 's designed by one of the world 's most famous architects , steven holl .
this is unique around the world , this combination - a museum devoted to a nobel prize-winning author , designed by an internationally famous architect as an interpretation of the writer 's work , literary figures and his life .
and all of it placed in this nordland landscape , with nature completely surrounding it , and which was so central in hamsun 's works .
how does the museum 's architecture reflect hamsun 's literary landscapes ?
steven holl 's idea with the building was to construct it as a human body , a figure which includes all the contradictions and themes found in hamsun 's literary characters in his novels " hunger , " " mysteries , " and so on .
the building is a place of contradictory forces - there are dark corners and big , open spaces , and labyrinths , and the changing light and seasons make it appear different each day .
it 's a complex building that is always changing , just like the psychology of hamsun 's early characters .
bildunterschrift : the exterior is supposed to represent a church tower what 's unique about hamsun 's literary works ?
he created a new way of describing the human psyche , which is quite close to what james joyce did in the early 20th century , except that knut hamsun did that 20 to 30 years before stream of consciousness or modernism or the modern novel .
he 's a predecessor of the modern novel in the 20th century .
and he invented some techniques of describing the human psyche , this new hyper-sensitivity toward the modern world .
and then his work opens up and he invents this gallery of characters .
when he wrote literature , he wrote on small pieces of paper - like sheets from a calendar - and spread them out , plotted them out in front of him , on his desk to invent this literary universe .
what is also unique is how he combines this hyper-sensitivity and complexity of characters with his love of nature and the inspiration he gleaned from that - all using his beautiful linguistic techniques .
how does that his keen sensitivity as a novelist jibe with his nazi affiliation ?
this is the big question and mystery of hamsun which has been haunting us for 50 , 60 , 70 years .
how can one of the world 's finest writers , someone who writes with such sensitivity about love , nature and the human psyche , take such a political stance as a person ?
i ca n't answer that .
it 's one of those contradictions of knut hamsun .
yes , he was one of the world 's greatest authors , and yes , he supported the terrible nazi regime , which we have absolutely no sympathy for .
did he ever offer an explanation for that ?
no .
after world war ii , he was fined a huge sum of money , which was to be paid to the norwegian state .
-lsb- editors ' note : he was to stand trial for treason , but was deemed mentally unfit due to his advanced age . -rsb-
but it could never be proved that hamsun was actually a member of the nazi party .

organizers say the writer 's association with the nazi party will be explored in the exhibition . norwegian writer knut hamsun received the nobel prize for literature in 1920 for his epic , " growth of the soil . "
he is noted for laying the groundwork for the modern novel by developing literary styles of revealing the intricacies of the human psyche .
such techniques would find their way into works by franz kafka , james joyce and virginia wolf , to name just a few .
but hamsun was also an ardent advocate of the nazi party both before world war ii and after germany occupied norway in 1941 .
in 1943 , he sent his nobel prize to nazi propaganda minister joseph goebbels as a gift .
he later visited adolf hitler and after the nazi leader 's death , proclaimed in a may 1945 newspaper eulogy " he was a warrior , a warrior for mankind , and a prophet of the gospel of justice for all nations . "
despite his nazi association , many norwegians have renewed their respect for his literary greatness .
last year saw extensive festivities commemorating the author 's 150th birthday , peaking in the august opening of the knut hamsun center -lrb- hamsunsenteret -rrb- in hamoroy , north of the arctic circle , where the writer grew up .
the museum closed soon after , with organizers then beginning preparations of the exhibition that is to showcase hamsun 's literary talent , as well as his dark past , when the museum opens to the public on june 11th , 2010 .
deutsche welle spoke with bordil borset , director of the hamsunsenteret .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 150th anniversary of hamsun 's birth was celebrated last year deutsche welle : why was the museum built to honor the writer and nobel prize winner knut hamsun ?
bordil borset : he came here to hamoroy when he was three years old with this parents , stayed here as a child , and came back as a grown-up during different periods of his life .
and this area - nordland -lsb- province -rsb- and hamoroy are very important in his life and works .
the idea to build the museum came about in 1986 , but it was a long , complicated process before it was actually completed .
part of the problem was getting enough funding , but the long process also had to due with the controversy surrounding knut hamsun as a person and his sympathizing with the nazis before and during the second world war .
how has that controversy been played out ?
there have been a lot of restrictions about naming streets , places and monuments after hamsun in norway .
and if one considers the new museum to be a monument to knut hamsun , then the question is asked : " why would we build a monument to someone who has brought shame to norway ? "
and what 's your answer to that ?
the museum is built as a center for communicating and researching about knut hamsun 's life and literature , and it 's a museum for all aspects of the person , just like other museums devoted to writers .
what 's unique about this particular one is its architecture .
it 's designed by one of the world 's most famous architects , steven holl .
this is unique around the world , this combination - a museum devoted to a nobel prize-winning author , designed by an internationally famous architect as an interpretation of the writer 's work , literary figures and his life .
and all of it placed in this nordland landscape , with nature completely surrounding it , and which was so central in hamsun 's works .
how does the museum 's architecture reflect hamsun 's literary landscapes ?
steven holl 's idea with the building was to construct it as a human body , a figure which includes all the contradictions and themes found in hamsun 's literary characters in his novels " hunger , " " mysteries , " and so on .
the building is a place of contradictory forces - there are dark corners and big , open spaces , and labyrinths , and the changing light and seasons make it appear different each day .
it 's a complex building that is always changing , just like the psychology of hamsun 's early characters .
bildunterschrift : the exterior is supposed to represent a church tower what 's unique about hamsun 's literary works ?
he created a new way of describing the human psyche , which is quite close to what james joyce did in the early 20th century , except that knut hamsun did that 20 to 30 years before stream of consciousness or modernism or the modern novel .
he 's a predecessor of the modern novel in the 20th century .
and he invented some techniques of describing the human psyche , this new hyper-sensitivity toward the modern world .
and then his work opens up and he invents this gallery of characters .
when he wrote literature , he wrote on small pieces of paper - like sheets from a calendar - and spread them out , plotted them out in front of him , on his desk to invent this literary universe .
what is also unique is how he combines this hyper-sensitivity and complexity of characters with his love of nature and the inspiration he gleaned from that - all using his beautiful linguistic techniques .
how does that his keen sensitivity as a novelist jibe with his nazi affiliation ?
this is the big question and mystery of hamsun which has been haunting us for 50 , 60 , 70 years .
how can one of the world 's finest writers , someone who writes with such sensitivity about love , nature and the human psyche , take such a political stance as a person ?
i ca n't answer that .
it 's one of those contradictions of knut hamsun .
yes , he was one of the world 's greatest authors , and yes , he supported the terrible nazi regime , which we have absolutely no sympathy for .
did he ever offer an explanation for that ?
no .
after world war ii , he was fined a huge sum of money , which was to be paid to the norwegian state .
-lsb- editors ' note : he was to stand trial for treason , but was deemed mentally unfit due to his advanced age . -rsb-
but it could never be proved that hamsun was actually a member of the nazi party .
the subject is addressed again and again in biographies about him ; it 's a question that can not be answered .
just as his characters were complicated and contradictory , so was he .
that 's how human beings are .
there are lots of aspects about human beings that we ca n't explain .
how is hamsun 's nazi past addressed at the museum ?
in the exhibition , all aspects of hamsun 's life and literature are addressed and presented - everything from first editions of his works to the trial after world war ii .
we are also offering lectures , movies , debates , and conferences on the issue .
it will always be treated critically , and it has to be because there is no other way of learning how we are and how we behave today .
he can learn from hamsun 's life and actions and perhaps apply that to how we are today .
that 's what literature does to us , what makes it eternal , what makes it great .
the only way to handle the topic is to address it openly .
but i think there is a new generation of historians coming on stage now who are dealing with the war in a different way .

then , on the top of the roof , you see bamboo , which is like a strange mix of hair and grass .
the building sort of leans to the side , and all this together makes it appear like a figure .
inside , it 's white , so you get this contrast of the black , wooden exterior and white , concrete interior .
in the middle of the building , there is this brass elevator .
if the building is a metaphor for the body , then this brass elevator is like the spine holding it all up ; it 's the core , the stable element .
but there are glass panels in it , so you can see the movements both inside and outside the elevator - like the nerves in the spine of human beings .
stephan holl has all these playful tricks and illusions inside the building that make it challenging , and create a dynamic between the open spaces and the darker corners .
also , on the first level , the floor is made of blackish-gray concrete and is slightly tilted , so when you move inside the building , you actually have quite a physical , special experience of working with or against the building .
and then there are funny elements in there - like a yellow balcony , which is a reference to hamsun 's novel " hunger , " or a wooden structure that symbolizes the empty violin case in " mysteries . "

organizers say the writer 's association with the nazi party will be explored in the exhibition . norwegian writer knut hamsun received the nobel prize for literature in 1920 for his epic , " growth of the soil . "
he is noted for laying the groundwork for the modern novel by developing literary styles of revealing the intricacies of the human psyche .
such techniques would find their way into works by franz kafka , james joyce and virginia wolf , to name just a few .
but hamsun was also an ardent advocate of the nazi party both before world war ii and after germany occupied norway in 1941 .
in 1943 , he sent his nobel prize to nazi propaganda minister joseph goebbels as a gift .
he later visited adolf hitler and after the nazi leader 's death , proclaimed in a may 1945 newspaper eulogy " he was a warrior , a warrior for mankind , and a prophet of the gospel of justice for all nations . "
despite his nazi association , many norwegians have renewed their respect for his literary greatness .
last year saw extensive festivities commemorating the author 's 150th birthday , peaking in the august opening of the knut hamsun center -lrb- hamsunsenteret -rrb- in hamoroy , north of the arctic circle , where the writer grew up .
the museum closed soon after , with organizers then beginning preparations of the exhibition that is to showcase hamsun 's literary talent , as well as his dark past , when the museum opens to the public on june 11th , 2010 .
deutsche welle spoke with bordil borset , director of the hamsunsenteret .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 150th anniversary of hamsun 's birth was celebrated last year deutsche welle : why was the museum built to honor the writer and nobel prize winner knut hamsun ?
bordil borset : he came here to hamoroy when he was three years old with this parents , stayed here as a child , and came back as a grown-up during different periods of his life .
and this area - nordland -lsb- province -rsb- and hamoroy are very important in his life and works .
the idea to build the museum came about in 1986 , but it was a long , complicated process before it was actually completed .
part of the problem was getting enough funding , but the long process also had to due with the controversy surrounding knut hamsun as a person and his sympathizing with the nazis before and during the second world war .
how has that controversy been played out ?
there have been a lot of restrictions about naming streets , places and monuments after hamsun in norway .
and if one considers the new museum to be a monument to knut hamsun , then the question is asked : " why would we build a monument to someone who has brought shame to norway ? "
and what 's your answer to that ?
the museum is built as a center for communicating and researching about knut hamsun 's life and literature , and it 's a museum for all aspects of the person , just like other museums devoted to writers .
what 's unique about this particular one is its architecture .
it 's designed by one of the world 's most famous architects , steven holl .
this is unique around the world , this combination - a museum devoted to a nobel prize-winning author , designed by an internationally famous architect as an interpretation of the writer 's work , literary figures and his life .
and all of it placed in this nordland landscape , with nature completely surrounding it , and which was so central in hamsun 's works .
how does the museum 's architecture reflect hamsun 's literary landscapes ?
steven holl 's idea with the building was to construct it as a human body , a figure which includes all the contradictions and themes found in hamsun 's literary characters in his novels " hunger , " " mysteries , " and so on .
the building is a place of contradictory forces - there are dark corners and big , open spaces , and labyrinths , and the changing light and seasons make it appear different each day .
it 's a complex building that is always changing , just like the psychology of hamsun 's early characters .
bildunterschrift : the exterior is supposed to represent a church tower what 's unique about hamsun 's literary works ?
he created a new way of describing the human psyche , which is quite close to what james joyce did in the early 20th century , except that knut hamsun did that 20 to 30 years before stream of consciousness or modernism or the modern novel .
he 's a predecessor of the modern novel in the 20th century .
and he invented some techniques of describing the human psyche , this new hyper-sensitivity toward the modern world .
and then his work opens up and he invents this gallery of characters .
when he wrote literature , he wrote on small pieces of paper - like sheets from a calendar - and spread them out , plotted them out in front of him , on his desk to invent this literary universe .
what is also unique is how he combines this hyper-sensitivity and complexity of characters with his love of nature and the inspiration he gleaned from that - all using his beautiful linguistic techniques .
how does that his keen sensitivity as a novelist jibe with his nazi affiliation ?
this is the big question and mystery of hamsun which has been haunting us for 50 , 60 , 70 years .
how can one of the world 's finest writers , someone who writes with such sensitivity about love , nature and the human psyche , take such a political stance as a person ?
i ca n't answer that .
it 's one of those contradictions of knut hamsun .
yes , he was one of the world 's greatest authors , and yes , he supported the terrible nazi regime , which we have absolutely no sympathy for .
did he ever offer an explanation for that ?
no .
after world war ii , he was fined a huge sum of money , which was to be paid to the norwegian state .
-lsb- editors ' note : he was to stand trial for treason , but was deemed mentally unfit due to his advanced age . -rsb-
but it could never be proved that hamsun was actually a member of the nazi party .
the subject is addressed again and again in biographies about him ; it 's a question that can not be answered .
just as his characters were complicated and contradictory , so was he .
that 's how human beings are .
there are lots of aspects about human beings that we ca n't explain .
how is hamsun 's nazi past addressed at the museum ?
in the exhibition , all aspects of hamsun 's life and literature are addressed and presented - everything from first editions of his works to the trial after world war ii .
we are also offering lectures , movies , debates , and conferences on the issue .
it will always be treated critically , and it has to be because there is no other way of learning how we are and how we behave today .
he can learn from hamsun 's life and actions and perhaps apply that to how we are today .
that 's what literature does to us , what makes it eternal , what makes it great .
the only way to handle the topic is to address it openly .
but i think there is a new generation of historians coming on stage now who are dealing with the war in a different way .
all last year , during the jubilee for hamsun 's 150th birthday , the political aspects of him were discussed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the interior is deliberately labyrinthine hamsun was actually just one of many nazi sympathizers , but because he was an important person , because he claimed to be one of the big , new norwegian writers - our national poet - , the disappointment , the betrayal people felt was all the greater .
it was a trauma for the norwegian people .
how could he do this ?
and why did he never apologize ?
or show remorse or regret after the war ?
please tell me more about the architecture of the museum .
when you enter the area around the museum , you see this big , black tower , which is reminiscent of old , wooden , norwegian churches .
but it also refers to a scene in one of hamsun 's novels .
then , on the top of the roof , you see bamboo , which is like a strange mix of hair and grass .
the building sort of leans to the side , and all this together makes it appear like a figure .
inside , it 's white , so you get this contrast of the black , wooden exterior and white , concrete interior .
in the middle of the building , there is this brass elevator .
if the building is a metaphor for the body , then this brass elevator is like the spine holding it all up ; it 's the core , the stable element .
but there are glass panels in it , so you can see the movements both inside and outside the elevator - like the nerves in the spine of human beings .
stephan holl has all these playful tricks and illusions inside the building that make it challenging , and create a dynamic between the open spaces and the darker corners .
also , on the first level , the floor is made of blackish-gray concrete and is slightly tilted , so when you move inside the building , you actually have quite a physical , special experience of working with or against the building .
and then there are funny elements in there - like a yellow balcony , which is a reference to hamsun 's novel " hunger , " or a wooden structure that symbolizes the empty violin case in " mysteries . "

organizers say the writer 's association with the nazi party will be explored in the exhibition . norwegian writer knut hamsun received the nobel prize for literature in 1920 for his epic , " growth of the soil . "
he is noted for laying the groundwork for the modern novel by developing literary styles of revealing the intricacies of the human psyche .
such techniques would find their way into works by franz kafka , james joyce and virginia wolf , to name just a few .
but hamsun was also an ardent advocate of the nazi party both before world war ii and after germany occupied norway in 1941 .
in 1943 , he sent his nobel prize to nazi propaganda minister joseph goebbels as a gift .
he later visited adolf hitler and after the nazi leader 's death , proclaimed in a may 1945 newspaper eulogy " he was a warrior , a warrior for mankind , and a prophet of the gospel of justice for all nations . "
despite his nazi association , many norwegians have renewed their respect for his literary greatness .
last year saw extensive festivities commemorating the author 's 150th birthday , peaking in the august opening of the knut hamsun center -lrb- hamsunsenteret -rrb- in hamoroy , north of the arctic circle , where the writer grew up .
the museum closed soon after , with organizers then beginning preparations of the exhibition that is to showcase hamsun 's literary talent , as well as his dark past , when the museum opens to the public on june 11th , 2010 .
deutsche welle spoke with bordil borset , director of the hamsunsenteret .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 150th anniversary of hamsun 's birth was celebrated last year deutsche welle : why was the museum built to honor the writer and nobel prize winner knut hamsun ?
bordil borset : he came here to hamoroy when he was three years old with this parents , stayed here as a child , and came back as a grown-up during different periods of his life .
and this area - nordland -lsb- province -rsb- and hamoroy are very important in his life and works .
the idea to build the museum came about in 1986 , but it was a long , complicated process before it was actually completed .
part of the problem was getting enough funding , but the long process also had to due with the controversy surrounding knut hamsun as a person and his sympathizing with the nazis before and during the second world war .
how has that controversy been played out ?
there have been a lot of restrictions about naming streets , places and monuments after hamsun in norway .
and if one considers the new museum to be a monument to knut hamsun , then the question is asked : " why would we build a monument to someone who has brought shame to norway ? "
and what 's your answer to that ?
the museum is built as a center for communicating and researching about knut hamsun 's life and literature , and it 's a museum for all aspects of the person , just like other museums devoted to writers .
what 's unique about this particular one is its architecture .
it 's designed by one of the world 's most famous architects , steven holl .
this is unique around the world , this combination - a museum devoted to a nobel prize-winning author , designed by an internationally famous architect as an interpretation of the writer 's work , literary figures and his life .
and all of it placed in this nordland landscape , with nature completely surrounding it , and which was so central in hamsun 's works .
how does the museum 's architecture reflect hamsun 's literary landscapes ?
steven holl 's idea with the building was to construct it as a human body , a figure which includes all the contradictions and themes found in hamsun 's literary characters in his novels " hunger , " " mysteries , " and so on .
the building is a place of contradictory forces - there are dark corners and big , open spaces , and labyrinths , and the changing light and seasons make it appear different each day .
it 's a complex building that is always changing , just like the psychology of hamsun 's early characters .
bildunterschrift : the exterior is supposed to represent a church tower what 's unique about hamsun 's literary works ?
he created a new way of describing the human psyche , which is quite close to what james joyce did in the early 20th century , except that knut hamsun did that 20 to 30 years before stream of consciousness or modernism or the modern novel .
he 's a predecessor of the modern novel in the 20th century .
and he invented some techniques of describing the human psyche , this new hyper-sensitivity toward the modern world .
and then his work opens up and he invents this gallery of characters .
when he wrote literature , he wrote on small pieces of paper - like sheets from a calendar - and spread them out , plotted them out in front of him , on his desk to invent this literary universe .
what is also unique is how he combines this hyper-sensitivity and complexity of characters with his love of nature and the inspiration he gleaned from that - all using his beautiful linguistic techniques .
how does that his keen sensitivity as a novelist jibe with his nazi affiliation ?
this is the big question and mystery of hamsun which has been haunting us for 50 , 60 , 70 years .
how can one of the world 's finest writers , someone who writes with such sensitivity about love , nature and the human psyche , take such a political stance as a person ?
i ca n't answer that .
it 's one of those contradictions of knut hamsun .
yes , he was one of the world 's greatest authors , and yes , he supported the terrible nazi regime , which we have absolutely no sympathy for .
did he ever offer an explanation for that ?
no .
after world war ii , he was fined a huge sum of money , which was to be paid to the norwegian state .
-lsb- editors ' note : he was to stand trial for treason , but was deemed mentally unfit due to his advanced age . -rsb-
but it could never be proved that hamsun was actually a member of the nazi party .
the subject is addressed again and again in biographies about him ; it 's a question that can not be answered .
just as his characters were complicated and contradictory , so was he .
that 's how human beings are .
there are lots of aspects about human beings that we ca n't explain .
how is hamsun 's nazi past addressed at the museum ?
in the exhibition , all aspects of hamsun 's life and literature are addressed and presented - everything from first editions of his works to the trial after world war ii .
we are also offering lectures , movies , debates , and conferences on the issue .
it will always be treated critically , and it has to be because there is no other way of learning how we are and how we behave today .
he can learn from hamsun 's life and actions and perhaps apply that to how we are today .
that 's what literature does to us , what makes it eternal , what makes it great .
the only way to handle the topic is to address it openly .
but i think there is a new generation of historians coming on stage now who are dealing with the war in a different way .
all last year , during the jubilee for hamsun 's 150th birthday , the political aspects of him were discussed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the interior is deliberately labyrinthine hamsun was actually just one of many nazi sympathizers , but because he was an important person , because he claimed to be one of the big , new norwegian writers - our national poet - , the disappointment , the betrayal people felt was all the greater .
it was a trauma for the norwegian people .
how could he do this ?
and why did he never apologize ?
or show remorse or regret after the war ?
please tell me more about the architecture of the museum .
when you enter the area around the museum , you see this big , black tower , which is reminiscent of old , wooden , norwegian churches .
but it also refers to a scene in one of hamsun 's novels .
then , on the top of the roof , you see bamboo , which is like a strange mix of hair and grass .
the building sort of leans to the side , and all this together makes it appear like a figure .
inside , it 's white , so you get this contrast of the black , wooden exterior and white , concrete interior .
in the middle of the building , there is this brass elevator .
if the building is a metaphor for the body , then this brass elevator is like the spine holding it all up ; it 's the core , the stable element .
but there are glass panels in it , so you can see the movements both inside and outside the elevator - like the nerves in the spine of human beings .
stephan holl has all these playful tricks and illusions inside the building that make it challenging , and create a dynamic between the open spaces and the darker corners .
also , on the first level , the floor is made of blackish-gray concrete and is slightly tilted , so when you move inside the building , you actually have quite a physical , special experience of working with or against the building .
and then there are funny elements in there - like a yellow balcony , which is a reference to hamsun 's novel " hunger , " or a wooden structure that symbolizes the empty violin case in " mysteries . "

he was unable to take part in an emergency meeting on europe 's debt crisis . schaeuble 's spokesman , michael offer , described schaeuble as " conscious " and " doing well under the circumstances " in a statement .
he also said it was suspected that the allergic reaction had been caused by a medication that schaeuble had taken for the first time on saturday .
schaeuble 's absence from the critical european union talks forced berlin to fly interior minister thomas de maiziere to brussels to take his place .
when he arrived in the belgian capital , de maiziere said he had spoken to schaeuble and that he was " so well now that he presented to me his line of negotiation " on the question of how to shore of the euro .
schaeuble has been confined to a wheelchair since he was shot in the back by a mentally unstable man at a campaign event in 1990 .

eu finance ministers will meet on sunday to discuss the plan . european union leaders are working overtime to construct new crisis defense mechanisms to safeguard the euro currency and crack down on market speculation before the asian financial markets reopen on monday .
on sunday , european union finance ministers debated proposals to set up a 600 billion euro -lrb- $ 765 billion -rrb- rescue fund for member countries states that fall into financial trouble , said diplomats in brussels .
the package would consist funds raised by the eu 's executive , the european commission , loans from eurozone states ; and money from the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- , diplomats said .

the unprecedented greek bailout is due to be transferred to athens within days .
greeks oppose cuts the emergency summit in brussels coincided with ceremonies to commemorate the end of world war ii in europe , forcing some european leaders to cancel their plans to attend the events .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de elections -pipe- 09.05.2010 voting underway in crucial german state election großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the vote in north rhine-westphalia will also be decisive for the ruling coaltion in berlin germans are casting ballots on sunday in the country 's most populous state .
the vote is seen as a test for chancellor angela merkel ’ s federal government and polls suggest the ruling coalition is in trouble . polling stations in the german state of north rhine-westphalia -lrb- nrw -rrb- opened sunday morning in a state election widely seen as a referendum on chancellor angela merkel 's six-month-old government .
merkel 's conservative christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and coalition partner the free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- must hold onto power in germany 's most populous state in order to maintain a majority in the upper house of parliament , the bundesrat .
a defeat for the parties in the state , where they have also ruled in a center-right coalition since 2005 , would end their majority and lead to delays in delivering tax cuts and implementing other policies agreed to after last september 's federal election .
recent opinion polls suggest the cdu and the fdp lack the necessary support needed to maintain their majority .
the election comes just days after the german parliament approved a 22.4-billion-euro -lrb- $ 28.6 billion -rrb- emergency bailout for debt-stricken greece , a move that has proved deeply unpopular with voters .
in a poll published on saturday , 21 percent of nrw voters said the greek bailout would affect their ballot decision , according to the yougov survey for german daily bild .
spd looks to regain control " the issue has electrified people as seldom before and is going to play a determining role in the election , " said klaus-peter schoeppner , head of the polling institute emnid , in the online edition of the rheinische post .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spd leader hannelore kraft hopes to regain control of the state the rival social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , who held power for four decades until being ousted in 2005 , are looking to regain control in the influential state , home to 13.5 million eligible voters .
the spd abstained in friday 's vote on the greek aid package , a tactical move that analysts say could give them the edge .
current polls suggest that the spd and their preferred partners , the greens , have the support of between 45 and 47 percent of voters .
current predictions estimate the cdu-fdp block winning 43 to 45 percent of the vote .
" if the cdu loses its majority with the fdp , which is to be expected , it would not be a catastrophe but it would certainly make things more complicated and difficult for the chancellor , " said gerd langguth , a political scientist at the university of bonn and biographer of merkel. cmk / afp / reuters editor : kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

recent opinion polls suggest the cdu and the fdp lack the necessary support needed to maintain their majority .
the election comes just days after the german parliament approved a 22.4-billion-euro -lrb- $ 28.6 billion -rrb- emergency bailout for debt-stricken greece , a move that has proved deeply unpopular with voters .
in a poll published on saturday , 21 percent of nrw voters said the greek bailout would affect their ballot decision , according to the yougov survey for german daily bild .
spd looks to regain control " the issue has electrified people as seldom before and is going to play a determining role in the election , " said klaus-peter schoeppner , head of the polling institute emnid , in the online edition of the rheinische post .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spd leader hannelore kraft hopes to regain control of the state the rival social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , who held power for four decades until being ousted in 2005 , are looking to regain control in the influential state , home to 13.5 million eligible voters .
the spd abstained in friday 's vote on the greek aid package , a tactical move that analysts say could give them the edge .
current polls suggest that the spd and their preferred partners , the greens , have the support of between 45 and 47 percent of voters .
current predictions estimate the cdu-fdp block winning 43 to 45 percent of the vote .
" if the cdu loses its majority with the fdp , which is to be expected , it would not be a catastrophe but it would certainly make things more complicated and difficult for the chancellor , " said gerd langguth , a political scientist at the university of bonn and biographer of merkel. cmk / afp / reuters editor : kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the vote is seen as a test for chancellor angela merkel ’ s federal government and polls suggest the ruling coalition is in trouble . polling stations in the german state of north rhine-westphalia -lrb- nrw -rrb- opened sunday morning in a state election widely seen as a referendum on chancellor angela merkel 's six-month-old government .
merkel 's conservative christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and coalition partner the free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- must hold onto power in germany 's most populous state in order to maintain a majority in the upper house of parliament , the bundesrat .
a defeat for the parties in the state , where they have also ruled in a center-right coalition since 2005 , would end their majority and lead to delays in delivering tax cuts and implementing other policies agreed to after last september 's federal election .
recent opinion polls suggest the cdu and the fdp lack the necessary support needed to maintain their majority .
the election comes just days after the german parliament approved a 22.4-billion-euro -lrb- $ 28.6 billion -rrb- emergency bailout for debt-stricken greece , a move that has proved deeply unpopular with voters .
in a poll published on saturday , 21 percent of nrw voters said the greek bailout would affect their ballot decision , according to the yougov survey for german daily bild .
spd looks to regain control " the issue has electrified people as seldom before and is going to play a determining role in the election , " said klaus-peter schoeppner , head of the polling institute emnid , in the online edition of the rheinische post .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spd leader hannelore kraft hopes to regain control of the state the rival social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , who held power for four decades until being ousted in 2005 , are looking to regain control in the influential state , home to 13.5 million eligible voters .
the spd abstained in friday 's vote on the greek aid package , a tactical move that analysts say could give them the edge .
current polls suggest that the spd and their preferred partners , the greens , have the support of between 45 and 47 percent of voters .
current predictions estimate the cdu-fdp block winning 43 to 45 percent of the vote .
" if the cdu loses its majority with the fdp , which is to be expected , it would not be a catastrophe but it would certainly make things more complicated and difficult for the chancellor , " said gerd langguth , a political scientist at the university of bonn and biographer of merkel. cmk / afp / reuters editor : kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian military jets fly in formation over red square on sunday around 1,000 troops from britain , france , poland and the united states took part in the military parade , alongside some 10,000 members of the russian army and soldiers from ex-soviet countries armenia , belarus , kazakhstan , kyrgyzstan , moldova , tajikistan , turkmenistan and ukraine .
" sixty-five years ago , nazism was defeated and a machine that was exterminating whole peoples was halted , " russian president dmitry medvedev said in his speech .
" there was one choice – either victory or to become slaves .
the war made us a strong nation . "
german chancellor angela merkel arrived in moscow on saturday to take part in the commemoration , joining medvedev , chinese president hu jintao and around two dozen other world leaders at the military parade .

in an interview with the russian itar-tass news agency , merkel said the invitation to the victory celebration was a great honor .
she said the gesture showed that russia and germany had learned from history and could live in peace and friendship .

protests planned bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel is the second german chancellor to be invited to the victory day commemorations russia 's communists , the country 's biggest opposition party , were planning to hold a protest march in central moscow after the parade .
they were angry that nato troops had been given permission to march on the square , home to the embalmed body of their revolutionary hero , vladimir lenin .
" foreign troops have never appeared on red square .
it 's a violation of tradition , " said sergei obukhov , a member of the party 's central committee .
" the presence of foreign troops with weapons in their hands is ... an unnecessary reminder that we lost the cold war . "
mine explosion the celebrations were overshadowed by two methane gas explosions at a coal mine in the siberian region of kemerova , which hours earlier killed at least 12 people , injured dozens and trapped more than 80 miners and rescuers .
the first explosion occurred late saturday night , with the second following a few hours later as a rescue operation was underway .
renewed rescue operations continue , but the high concentration of methane gas poses a risk of further explosions .
russian prime minister vladimir putin described the situation as " difficult " and " tragic " and urged authorities to do everything possible to rescue those still trapped underground. cmk / afp / dpa / reuters editor : kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de literature -pipe- 09.05.2010 norwegian museum reflects love-hate relationship with author hamsun großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamsunsenteret - the knut hamsun center - is architectural eye candy in the coming weeks , a museum dedicated to knut hamsun , one of norway 's most notable authors , is due to open to the public .
organizers say the writer 's association with the nazi party will be explored in the exhibition . norwegian writer knut hamsun received the nobel prize for literature in 1920 for his epic , " growth of the soil . "
he is noted for laying the groundwork for the modern novel by developing literary styles of revealing the intricacies of the human psyche .
such techniques would find their way into works by franz kafka , james joyce and virginia wolf , to name just a few .
but hamsun was also an ardent advocate of the nazi party both before world war ii and after germany occupied norway in 1941 .
in 1943 , he sent his nobel prize to nazi propaganda minister joseph goebbels as a gift .
he later visited adolf hitler and after the nazi leader 's death , proclaimed in a may 1945 newspaper eulogy " he was a warrior , a warrior for mankind , and a prophet of the gospel of justice for all nations . "
despite his nazi association , many norwegians have renewed their respect for his literary greatness .
last year saw extensive festivities commemorating the author 's 150th birthday , peaking in the august opening of the knut hamsun center -lrb- hamsunsenteret -rrb- in hamoroy , north of the arctic circle , where the writer grew up .
the museum closed soon after , with organizers then beginning preparations of the exhibition that is to showcase hamsun 's literary talent , as well as his dark past , when the museum opens to the public on june 11th , 2010 .
deutsche welle spoke with bordil borset , director of the hamsunsenteret .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 150th anniversary of hamsun 's birth was celebrated last year deutsche welle : why was the museum built to honor the writer and nobel prize winner knut hamsun ?
bordil borset : he came here to hamoroy when he was three years old with this parents , stayed here as a child , and came back as a grown-up during different periods of his life .
and this area - nordland -lsb- province -rsb- and hamoroy are very important in his life and works .
the idea to build the museum came about in 1986 , but it was a long , complicated process before it was actually completed .
part of the problem was getting enough funding , but the long process also had to due with the controversy surrounding knut hamsun as a person and his sympathizing with the nazis before and during the second world war .
how has that controversy been played out ?
there have been a lot of restrictions about naming streets , places and monuments after hamsun in norway .
and if one considers the new museum to be a monument to knut hamsun , then the question is asked : " why would we build a monument to someone who has brought shame to norway ? "
and what 's your answer to that ?
the museum is built as a center for communicating and researching about knut hamsun 's life and literature , and it 's a museum for all aspects of the person , just like other museums devoted to writers .
what 's unique about this particular one is its architecture .
it 's designed by one of the world 's most famous architects , steven holl .
this is unique around the world , this combination - a museum devoted to a nobel prize-winning author , designed by an internationally famous architect as an interpretation of the writer 's work , literary figures and his life .
and all of it placed in this nordland landscape , with nature completely surrounding it , and which was so central in hamsun 's works .
how does the museum 's architecture reflect hamsun 's literary landscapes ?
steven holl 's idea with the building was to construct it as a human body , a figure which includes all the contradictions and themes found in hamsun 's literary characters in his novels " hunger , " " mysteries , " and so on .
the building is a place of contradictory forces - there are dark corners and big , open spaces , and labyrinths , and the changing light and seasons make it appear different each day .
it 's a complex building that is always changing , just like the psychology of hamsun 's early characters .
bildunterschrift : the exterior is supposed to represent a church tower what 's unique about hamsun 's literary works ?
he created a new way of describing the human psyche , which is quite close to what james joyce did in the early 20th century , except that knut hamsun did that 20 to 30 years before stream of consciousness or modernism or the modern novel .
he 's a predecessor of the modern novel in the 20th century .
and he invented some techniques of describing the human psyche , this new hyper-sensitivity toward the modern world .
and then his work opens up and he invents this gallery of characters .
when he wrote literature , he wrote on small pieces of paper - like sheets from a calendar - and spread them out , plotted them out in front of him , on his desk to invent this literary universe .
what is also unique is how he combines this hyper-sensitivity and complexity of characters with his love of nature and the inspiration he gleaned from that - all using his beautiful linguistic techniques .
how does that his keen sensitivity as a novelist jibe with his nazi affiliation ?
this is the big question and mystery of hamsun which has been haunting us for 50 , 60 , 70 years .
how can one of the world 's finest writers , someone who writes with such sensitivity about love , nature and the human psyche , take such a political stance as a person ?
i ca n't answer that .
it 's one of those contradictions of knut hamsun .
yes , he was one of the world 's greatest authors , and yes , he supported the terrible nazi regime , which we have absolutely no sympathy for .
did he ever offer an explanation for that ?
no .
after world war ii , he was fined a huge sum of money , which was to be paid to the norwegian state .
-lsb- editors ' note : he was to stand trial for treason , but was deemed mentally unfit due to his advanced age . -rsb-
but it could never be proved that hamsun was actually a member of the nazi party .
the subject is addressed again and again in biographies about him ; it 's a question that can not be answered .
just as his characters were complicated and contradictory , so was he .
that 's how human beings are .
there are lots of aspects about human beings that we ca n't explain .
how is hamsun 's nazi past addressed at the museum ?
in the exhibition , all aspects of hamsun 's life and literature are addressed and presented - everything from first editions of his works to the trial after world war ii .
we are also offering lectures , movies , debates , and conferences on the issue .
it will always be treated critically , and it has to be because there is no other way of learning how we are and how we behave today .
he can learn from hamsun 's life and actions and perhaps apply that to how we are today .
that 's what literature does to us , what makes it eternal , what makes it great .
the only way to handle the topic is to address it openly .
but i think there is a new generation of historians coming on stage now who are dealing with the war in a different way .
all last year , during the jubilee for hamsun 's 150th birthday , the political aspects of him were discussed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the interior is deliberately labyrinthine hamsun was actually just one of many nazi sympathizers , but because he was an important person , because he claimed to be one of the big , new norwegian writers - our national poet - , the disappointment , the betrayal people felt was all the greater .
it was a trauma for the norwegian people .
how could he do this ?
and why did he never apologize ?
or show remorse or regret after the war ?
please tell me more about the architecture of the museum .
when you enter the area around the museum , you see this big , black tower , which is reminiscent of old , wooden , norwegian churches .
but it also refers to a scene in one of hamsun 's novels .
then , on the top of the roof , you see bamboo , which is like a strange mix of hair and grass .
the building sort of leans to the side , and all this together makes it appear like a figure .
inside , it 's white , so you get this contrast of the black , wooden exterior and white , concrete interior .
in the middle of the building , there is this brass elevator .
if the building is a metaphor for the body , then this brass elevator is like the spine holding it all up ; it 's the core , the stable element .
but there are glass panels in it , so you can see the movements both inside and outside the elevator - like the nerves in the spine of human beings .
stephan holl has all these playful tricks and illusions inside the building that make it challenging , and create a dynamic between the open spaces and the darker corners .
also , on the first level , the floor is made of blackish-gray concrete and is slightly tilted , so when you move inside the building , you actually have quite a physical , special experience of working with or against the building .
and then there are funny elements in there - like a yellow balcony , which is a reference to hamsun 's novel " hunger , " or a wooden structure that symbolizes the empty violin case in " mysteries . "

organizers say the writer 's association with the nazi party will be explored in the exhibition . norwegian writer knut hamsun received the nobel prize for literature in 1920 for his epic , " growth of the soil . "
he is noted for laying the groundwork for the modern novel by developing literary styles of revealing the intricacies of the human psyche .
such techniques would find their way into works by franz kafka , james joyce and virginia wolf , to name just a few .
but hamsun was also an ardent advocate of the nazi party both before world war ii and after germany occupied norway in 1941 .
in 1943 , he sent his nobel prize to nazi propaganda minister joseph goebbels as a gift .
he later visited adolf hitler and after the nazi leader 's death , proclaimed in a may 1945 newspaper eulogy " he was a warrior , a warrior for mankind , and a prophet of the gospel of justice for all nations . "
despite his nazi association , many norwegians have renewed their respect for his literary greatness .
last year saw extensive festivities commemorating the author 's 150th birthday , peaking in the august opening of the knut hamsun center -lrb- hamsunsenteret -rrb- in hamoroy , north of the arctic circle , where the writer grew up .
the museum closed soon after , with organizers then beginning preparations of the exhibition that is to showcase hamsun 's literary talent , as well as his dark past , when the museum opens to the public on june 11th , 2010 .
deutsche welle spoke with bordil borset , director of the hamsunsenteret .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 150th anniversary of hamsun 's birth was celebrated last year deutsche welle : why was the museum built to honor the writer and nobel prize winner knut hamsun ?
bordil borset : he came here to hamoroy when he was three years old with this parents , stayed here as a child , and came back as a grown-up during different periods of his life .
and this area - nordland -lsb- province -rsb- and hamoroy are very important in his life and works .
the idea to build the museum came about in 1986 , but it was a long , complicated process before it was actually completed .
part of the problem was getting enough funding , but the long process also had to due with the controversy surrounding knut hamsun as a person and his sympathizing with the nazis before and during the second world war .
how has that controversy been played out ?
there have been a lot of restrictions about naming streets , places and monuments after hamsun in norway .
and if one considers the new museum to be a monument to knut hamsun , then the question is asked : " why would we build a monument to someone who has brought shame to norway ? "
and what 's your answer to that ?
the museum is built as a center for communicating and researching about knut hamsun 's life and literature , and it 's a museum for all aspects of the person , just like other museums devoted to writers .
what 's unique about this particular one is its architecture .
it 's designed by one of the world 's most famous architects , steven holl .
this is unique around the world , this combination - a museum devoted to a nobel prize-winning author , designed by an internationally famous architect as an interpretation of the writer 's work , literary figures and his life .
and all of it placed in this nordland landscape , with nature completely surrounding it , and which was so central in hamsun 's works .
how does the museum 's architecture reflect hamsun 's literary landscapes ?
steven holl 's idea with the building was to construct it as a human body , a figure which includes all the contradictions and themes found in hamsun 's literary characters in his novels " hunger , " " mysteries , " and so on .
the building is a place of contradictory forces - there are dark corners and big , open spaces , and labyrinths , and the changing light and seasons make it appear different each day .
it 's a complex building that is always changing , just like the psychology of hamsun 's early characters .
bildunterschrift : the exterior is supposed to represent a church tower what 's unique about hamsun 's literary works ?
he created a new way of describing the human psyche , which is quite close to what james joyce did in the early 20th century , except that knut hamsun did that 20 to 30 years before stream of consciousness or modernism or the modern novel .
he 's a predecessor of the modern novel in the 20th century .
and he invented some techniques of describing the human psyche , this new hyper-sensitivity toward the modern world .
and then his work opens up and he invents this gallery of characters .
when he wrote literature , he wrote on small pieces of paper - like sheets from a calendar - and spread them out , plotted them out in front of him , on his desk to invent this literary universe .
what is also unique is how he combines this hyper-sensitivity and complexity of characters with his love of nature and the inspiration he gleaned from that - all using his beautiful linguistic techniques .
how does that his keen sensitivity as a novelist jibe with his nazi affiliation ?
this is the big question and mystery of hamsun which has been haunting us for 50 , 60 , 70 years .
how can one of the world 's finest writers , someone who writes with such sensitivity about love , nature and the human psyche , take such a political stance as a person ?
i ca n't answer that .
it 's one of those contradictions of knut hamsun .
yes , he was one of the world 's greatest authors , and yes , he supported the terrible nazi regime , which we have absolutely no sympathy for .
did he ever offer an explanation for that ?
no .
after world war ii , he was fined a huge sum of money , which was to be paid to the norwegian state .
-lsb- editors ' note : he was to stand trial for treason , but was deemed mentally unfit due to his advanced age . -rsb-
but it could never be proved that hamsun was actually a member of the nazi party .
the subject is addressed again and again in biographies about him ; it 's a question that can not be answered .
just as his characters were complicated and contradictory , so was he .
that 's how human beings are .
there are lots of aspects about human beings that we ca n't explain .
how is hamsun 's nazi past addressed at the museum ?
in the exhibition , all aspects of hamsun 's life and literature are addressed and presented - everything from first editions of his works to the trial after world war ii .
we are also offering lectures , movies , debates , and conferences on the issue .
it will always be treated critically , and it has to be because there is no other way of learning how we are and how we behave today .
he can learn from hamsun 's life and actions and perhaps apply that to how we are today .
that 's what literature does to us , what makes it eternal , what makes it great .
the only way to handle the topic is to address it openly .
but i think there is a new generation of historians coming on stage now who are dealing with the war in a different way .
all last year , during the jubilee for hamsun 's 150th birthday , the political aspects of him were discussed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the interior is deliberately labyrinthine hamsun was actually just one of many nazi sympathizers , but because he was an important person , because he claimed to be one of the big , new norwegian writers - our national poet - , the disappointment , the betrayal people felt was all the greater .
it was a trauma for the norwegian people .
how could he do this ?
and why did he never apologize ?
or show remorse or regret after the war ?
please tell me more about the architecture of the museum .
when you enter the area around the museum , you see this big , black tower , which is reminiscent of old , wooden , norwegian churches .
but it also refers to a scene in one of hamsun 's novels .
then , on the top of the roof , you see bamboo , which is like a strange mix of hair and grass .
the building sort of leans to the side , and all this together makes it appear like a figure .
inside , it 's white , so you get this contrast of the black , wooden exterior and white , concrete interior .
in the middle of the building , there is this brass elevator .
if the building is a metaphor for the body , then this brass elevator is like the spine holding it all up ; it 's the core , the stable element .
but there are glass panels in it , so you can see the movements both inside and outside the elevator - like the nerves in the spine of human beings .
stephan holl has all these playful tricks and illusions inside the building that make it challenging , and create a dynamic between the open spaces and the darker corners .
also , on the first level , the floor is made of blackish-gray concrete and is slightly tilted , so when you move inside the building , you actually have quite a physical , special experience of working with or against the building .
and then there are funny elements in there - like a yellow balcony , which is a reference to hamsun 's novel " hunger , " or a wooden structure that symbolizes the empty violin case in " mysteries . "

this is the big question and mystery of hamsun which has been haunting us for 50 , 60 , 70 years .
how can one of the world 's finest writers , someone who writes with such sensitivity about love , nature and the human psyche , take such a political stance as a person ?
i ca n't answer that .
it 's one of those contradictions of knut hamsun .
yes , he was one of the world 's greatest authors , and yes , he supported the terrible nazi regime , which we have absolutely no sympathy for .
did he ever offer an explanation for that ?
no .
after world war ii , he was fined a huge sum of money , which was to be paid to the norwegian state .
-lsb- editors ' note : he was to stand trial for treason , but was deemed mentally unfit due to his advanced age . -rsb-
but it could never be proved that hamsun was actually a member of the nazi party .
the subject is addressed again and again in biographies about him ; it 's a question that can not be answered .
just as his characters were complicated and contradictory , so was he .
that 's how human beings are .
there are lots of aspects about human beings that we ca n't explain .
how is hamsun 's nazi past addressed at the museum ?
in the exhibition , all aspects of hamsun 's life and literature are addressed and presented - everything from first editions of his works to the trial after world war ii .
we are also offering lectures , movies , debates , and conferences on the issue .
it will always be treated critically , and it has to be because there is no other way of learning how we are and how we behave today .
he can learn from hamsun 's life and actions and perhaps apply that to how we are today .
that 's what literature does to us , what makes it eternal , what makes it great .
the only way to handle the topic is to address it openly .
but i think there is a new generation of historians coming on stage now who are dealing with the war in a different way .
all last year , during the jubilee for hamsun 's 150th birthday , the political aspects of him were discussed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the interior is deliberately labyrinthine hamsun was actually just one of many nazi sympathizers , but because he was an important person , because he claimed to be one of the big , new norwegian writers - our national poet - , the disappointment , the betrayal people felt was all the greater .
it was a trauma for the norwegian people .
how could he do this ?
and why did he never apologize ?
or show remorse or regret after the war ?
please tell me more about the architecture of the museum .
when you enter the area around the museum , you see this big , black tower , which is reminiscent of old , wooden , norwegian churches .
but it also refers to a scene in one of hamsun 's novels .
then , on the top of the roof , you see bamboo , which is like a strange mix of hair and grass .
the building sort of leans to the side , and all this together makes it appear like a figure .
inside , it 's white , so you get this contrast of the black , wooden exterior and white , concrete interior .
in the middle of the building , there is this brass elevator .
if the building is a metaphor for the body , then this brass elevator is like the spine holding it all up ; it 's the core , the stable element .
but there are glass panels in it , so you can see the movements both inside and outside the elevator - like the nerves in the spine of human beings .
stephan holl has all these playful tricks and illusions inside the building that make it challenging , and create a dynamic between the open spaces and the darker corners .
also , on the first level , the floor is made of blackish-gray concrete and is slightly tilted , so when you move inside the building , you actually have quite a physical , special experience of working with or against the building .
and then there are funny elements in there - like a yellow balcony , which is a reference to hamsun 's novel " hunger , " or a wooden structure that symbolizes the empty violin case in " mysteries . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de literature -pipe- 09.05.2010 norwegian museum reflects love-hate relationship with author hamsun großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamsunsenteret - the knut hamsun center - is architectural eye candy in the coming weeks , a museum dedicated to knut hamsun , one of norway 's most notable authors , is due to open to the public .
organizers say the writer 's association with the nazi party will be explored in the exhibition . norwegian writer knut hamsun received the nobel prize for literature in 1920 for his epic , " growth of the soil . "
he is noted for laying the groundwork for the modern novel by developing literary styles of revealing the intricacies of the human psyche .
such techniques would find their way into works by franz kafka , james joyce and virginia wolf , to name just a few .
but hamsun was also an ardent advocate of the nazi party both before world war ii and after germany occupied norway in 1941 .
in 1943 , he sent his nobel prize to nazi propaganda minister joseph goebbels as a gift .
he later visited adolf hitler and after the nazi leader 's death , proclaimed in a may 1945 newspaper eulogy " he was a warrior , a warrior for mankind , and a prophet of the gospel of justice for all nations . "
despite his nazi association , many norwegians have renewed their respect for his literary greatness .
last year saw extensive festivities commemorating the author 's 150th birthday , peaking in the august opening of the knut hamsun center -lrb- hamsunsenteret -rrb- in hamoroy , north of the arctic circle , where the writer grew up .
the museum closed soon after , with organizers then beginning preparations of the exhibition that is to showcase hamsun 's literary talent , as well as his dark past , when the museum opens to the public on june 11th , 2010 .
deutsche welle spoke with bordil borset , director of the hamsunsenteret .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 150th anniversary of hamsun 's birth was celebrated last year deutsche welle : why was the museum built to honor the writer and nobel prize winner knut hamsun ?
bordil borset : he came here to hamoroy when he was three years old with this parents , stayed here as a child , and came back as a grown-up during different periods of his life .
and this area - nordland -lsb- province -rsb- and hamoroy are very important in his life and works .
the idea to build the museum came about in 1986 , but it was a long , complicated process before it was actually completed .
part of the problem was getting enough funding , but the long process also had to due with the controversy surrounding knut hamsun as a person and his sympathizing with the nazis before and during the second world war .
how has that controversy been played out ?
there have been a lot of restrictions about naming streets , places and monuments after hamsun in norway .
and if one considers the new museum to be a monument to knut hamsun , then the question is asked : " why would we build a monument to someone who has brought shame to norway ? "
and what 's your answer to that ?
the museum is built as a center for communicating and researching about knut hamsun 's life and literature , and it 's a museum for all aspects of the person , just like other museums devoted to writers .
what 's unique about this particular one is its architecture .
it 's designed by one of the world 's most famous architects , steven holl .
this is unique around the world , this combination - a museum devoted to a nobel prize-winning author , designed by an internationally famous architect as an interpretation of the writer 's work , literary figures and his life .
and all of it placed in this nordland landscape , with nature completely surrounding it , and which was so central in hamsun 's works .
how does the museum 's architecture reflect hamsun 's literary landscapes ?
steven holl 's idea with the building was to construct it as a human body , a figure which includes all the contradictions and themes found in hamsun 's literary characters in his novels " hunger , " " mysteries , " and so on .
the building is a place of contradictory forces - there are dark corners and big , open spaces , and labyrinths , and the changing light and seasons make it appear different each day .
it 's a complex building that is always changing , just like the psychology of hamsun 's early characters .
bildunterschrift : the exterior is supposed to represent a church tower what 's unique about hamsun 's literary works ?
he created a new way of describing the human psyche , which is quite close to what james joyce did in the early 20th century , except that knut hamsun did that 20 to 30 years before stream of consciousness or modernism or the modern novel .
he 's a predecessor of the modern novel in the 20th century .
and he invented some techniques of describing the human psyche , this new hyper-sensitivity toward the modern world .
and then his work opens up and he invents this gallery of characters .
when he wrote literature , he wrote on small pieces of paper - like sheets from a calendar - and spread them out , plotted them out in front of him , on his desk to invent this literary universe .
what is also unique is how he combines this hyper-sensitivity and complexity of characters with his love of nature and the inspiration he gleaned from that - all using his beautiful linguistic techniques .
how does that his keen sensitivity as a novelist jibe with his nazi affiliation ?
this is the big question and mystery of hamsun which has been haunting us for 50 , 60 , 70 years .

the vote is seen as a test for chancellor angela merkel ’ s federal government and polls suggest the ruling coalition is in trouble . polling stations in the german state of north rhine-westphalia -lrb- nrw -rrb- opened sunday morning in a state election widely seen as a referendum on chancellor angela merkel 's six-month-old government .
merkel 's conservative christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and coalition partner the free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- must hold onto power in germany 's most populous state in order to maintain a majority in the upper house of parliament , the bundesrat .
a defeat for the parties in the state , where they have also ruled in a center-right coalition since 2005 , would end their majority and lead to delays in delivering tax cuts and implementing other policies agreed to after last september 's federal election .
recent opinion polls suggest the cdu and the fdp lack the necessary support needed to maintain their majority .
the election comes just days after the german parliament approved a 22.4-billion-euro -lrb- $ 28.6 billion -rrb- emergency bailout for debt-stricken greece , a move that has proved deeply unpopular with voters .
in a poll published on saturday , 21 percent of nrw voters said the greek bailout would affect their ballot decision , according to the yougov survey for german daily bild .
spd looks to regain control " the issue has electrified people as seldom before and is going to play a determining role in the election , " said klaus-peter schoeppner , head of the polling institute emnid , in the online edition of the rheinische post .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spd leader hannelore kraft hopes to regain control of the state the rival social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , who held power for four decades until being ousted in 2005 , are looking to regain control in the influential state , home to 13.5 million eligible voters .
the spd abstained in friday 's vote on the greek aid package , a tactical move that analysts say could give them the edge .
current polls suggest that the spd and their preferred partners , the greens , have the support of between 45 and 47 percent of voters .
current predictions estimate the cdu-fdp block winning 43 to 45 percent of the vote .
" if the cdu loses its majority with the fdp , which is to be expected , it would not be a catastrophe but it would certainly make things more complicated and difficult for the chancellor , " said gerd langguth , a political scientist at the university of bonn and biographer of merkel. cmk / afp / reuters editor : kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

kuranyi could more than double his salary with the move to the 10th-ranked russian team . former germany striker kevin kuranyi said on his website on sunday that he was leaving schalke for a deal with russia 's dynamo moscow .
kuranyi was one of the bundesliga 's top scorers this season with 18 goals and schalke ended the season in second place , after bayern munich .

"
" i always said that the whole package must be right .
i have this feeling with dynamo .

the 28-year-old will leave on a free transfer on july 1 and is said to have signed a three-year contract paying more than 6 million euros -lrb- $ 7.6 million -rrb- per season .
that more than doubles his current salary .
despite a slow start in the russian season and a current rank of 10th in their league , dynamo should n't be underestimated , kuranyi said .
dynamo has won 11 national titles , although the most recent victory was in 1976 .
no spot on the national team despite a successful league season , kuranyi was not chosen for germany 's national squad for the world cup in south africa this june .
national coach joachim loew kicked him off the team after he walked out on the team during a world cup qualifier in october 2008 after being left off that day 's line-up .

the vote is seen as a test for chancellor angela merkel ’ s federal government and polls suggest the ruling coalition is in trouble . polling stations in the german state of north rhine-westphalia -lrb- nrw -rrb- opened sunday morning in a state election widely seen as a referendum on chancellor angela merkel 's six-month-old government .
merkel 's conservative christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and coalition partner the free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- must hold onto power in germany 's most populous state in order to maintain a majority in the upper house of parliament , the bundesrat .
a defeat for the parties in the state , where they have also ruled in a center-right coalition since 2005 , would end their majority and lead to delays in delivering tax cuts and implementing other policies agreed to after last september 's federal election .
recent opinion polls suggest the cdu and the fdp lack the necessary support needed to maintain their majority .
the election comes just days after the german parliament approved a 22.4-billion-euro -lrb- $ 28.6 billion -rrb- emergency bailout for debt-stricken greece , a move that has proved deeply unpopular with voters .
in a poll published on saturday , 21 percent of nrw voters said the greek bailout would affect their ballot decision , according to the yougov survey for german daily bild .
spd looks to regain control " the issue has electrified people as seldom before and is going to play a determining role in the election , " said klaus-peter schoeppner , head of the polling institute emnid , in the online edition of the rheinische post .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spd leader hannelore kraft hopes to regain control of the state the rival social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , who held power for four decades until being ousted in 2005 , are looking to regain control in the influential state , home to 13.5 million eligible voters .
the spd abstained in friday 's vote on the greek aid package , a tactical move that analysts say could give them the edge .
current polls suggest that the spd and their preferred partners , the greens , have the support of between 45 and 47 percent of voters .
current predictions estimate the cdu-fdp block winning 43 to 45 percent of the vote .
" if the cdu loses its majority with the fdp , which is to be expected , it would not be a catastrophe but it would certainly make things more complicated and difficult for the chancellor , " said gerd langguth , a political scientist at the university of bonn and biographer of merkel. cmk / afp / reuters editor : kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian military jets fly in formation over red square on sunday around 1,000 troops from britain , france , poland and the united states took part in the military parade , alongside some 10,000 members of the russian army and soldiers from ex-soviet countries armenia , belarus , kazakhstan , kyrgyzstan , moldova , tajikistan , turkmenistan and ukraine .
" sixty-five years ago , nazism was defeated and a machine that was exterminating whole peoples was halted , " russian president dmitry medvedev said in his speech .
" there was one choice – either victory or to become slaves .
the war made us a strong nation . "
german chancellor angela merkel arrived in moscow on saturday to take part in the commemoration , joining medvedev , chinese president hu jintao and around two dozen other world leaders at the military parade .

in an interview with the russian itar-tass news agency , merkel said the invitation to the victory celebration was a great honor .

" foreign troops have never appeared on red square .
it 's a violation of tradition , " said sergei obukhov , a member of the party 's central committee .
" the presence of foreign troops with weapons in their hands is ... an unnecessary reminder that we lost the cold war . "

the first explosion occurred late saturday night , with the second following a few hours later as a rescue operation was underway .
renewed rescue operations continue , but the high concentration of methane gas poses a risk of further explosions .
russian prime minister vladimir putin described the situation as " difficult " and " tragic " and urged authorities to do everything possible to rescue those still trapped underground. cmk / afp / dpa / reuters editor : kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it was also the first time that nato forces participated . foreign troops from four nato member states marched on moscow 's red square for the first time on sunday as part of a parade marking the 65th anniversary of the end of world war ii .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian military jets fly in formation over red square on sunday around 1,000 troops from britain , france , poland and the united states took part in the military parade , alongside some 10,000 members of the russian army and soldiers from ex-soviet countries armenia , belarus , kazakhstan , kyrgyzstan , moldova , tajikistan , turkmenistan and ukraine .
" sixty-five years ago , nazism was defeated and a machine that was exterminating whole peoples was halted , " russian president dmitry medvedev said in his speech .
" there was one choice – either victory or to become slaves .
the war made us a strong nation . "
german chancellor angela merkel arrived in moscow on saturday to take part in the commemoration , joining medvedev , chinese president hu jintao and around two dozen other world leaders at the military parade .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british military personnel marching in the the largest-ever post-soviet military parade french president nicolas sarkozy and italian prime minister silvio berlusconi pulled out of the event to instead concentrate on the european financial crisis .
in an interview with the russian itar-tass news agency , merkel said the invitation to the victory celebration was a great honor .
she said the gesture showed that russia and germany had learned from history and could live in peace and friendship .
in 2005 , gerhard schroeder became the first german chancellor to be invited to the red square victory celebration .
protests planned bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel is the second german chancellor to be invited to the victory day commemorations russia 's communists , the country 's biggest opposition party , were planning to hold a protest march in central moscow after the parade .
they were angry that nato troops had been given permission to march on the square , home to the embalmed body of their revolutionary hero , vladimir lenin .
" foreign troops have never appeared on red square .
it 's a violation of tradition , " said sergei obukhov , a member of the party 's central committee .
" the presence of foreign troops with weapons in their hands is ... an unnecessary reminder that we lost the cold war . "
mine explosion the celebrations were overshadowed by two methane gas explosions at a coal mine in the siberian region of kemerova , which hours earlier killed at least 12 people , injured dozens and trapped more than 80 miners and rescuers .
the first explosion occurred late saturday night , with the second following a few hours later as a rescue operation was underway .
renewed rescue operations continue , but the high concentration of methane gas poses a risk of further explosions .
russian prime minister vladimir putin described the situation as " difficult " and " tragic " and urged authorities to do everything possible to rescue those still trapped underground. cmk / afp / dpa / reuters editor : kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

kuranyi could more than double his salary with the move to the 10th-ranked russian team . former germany striker kevin kuranyi said on his website on sunday that he was leaving schalke for a deal with russia 's dynamo moscow .
kuranyi was one of the bundesliga 's top scorers this season with 18 goals and schalke ended the season in second place , after bayern munich .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : saturday 's match was kuranyi 's last playing for schalke " after carefully weighing all the arguments and following several discussions , i have decided to transfer to russia with dynamo moscow , " kuranyi wrote in a " letter to his fans . "
" i always said that the whole package must be right .
i have this feeling with dynamo .
one aspect is certainly the financial one , " he said .
the 28-year-old will leave on a free transfer on july 1 and is said to have signed a three-year contract paying more than 6 million euros -lrb- $ 7.6 million -rrb- per season .
that more than doubles his current salary .
despite a slow start in the russian season and a current rank of 10th in their league , dynamo should n't be underestimated , kuranyi said .
dynamo has won 11 national titles , although the most recent victory was in 1976 .
no spot on the national team despite a successful league season , kuranyi was not chosen for germany 's national squad for the world cup in south africa this june .
national coach joachim loew kicked him off the team after he walked out on the team during a world cup qualifier in october 2008 after being left off that day 's line-up .
at the time loew said he would never ask him to play again and resisted pressure to include him on the world cup team. hf / afp / dpa editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it was also the first time that nato forces participated . foreign troops from four nato member states marched on moscow 's red square for the first time on sunday as part of a parade marking the 65th anniversary of the end of world war ii .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian military jets fly in formation over red square on sunday around 1,000 troops from britain , france , poland and the united states took part in the military parade , alongside some 10,000 members of the russian army and soldiers from ex-soviet countries armenia , belarus , kazakhstan , kyrgyzstan , moldova , tajikistan , turkmenistan and ukraine .
" sixty-five years ago , nazism was defeated and a machine that was exterminating whole peoples was halted , " russian president dmitry medvedev said in his speech .
" there was one choice – either victory or to become slaves .
the war made us a strong nation . "
german chancellor angela merkel arrived in moscow on saturday to take part in the commemoration , joining medvedev , chinese president hu jintao and around two dozen other world leaders at the military parade .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british military personnel marching in the the largest-ever post-soviet military parade french president nicolas sarkozy and italian prime minister silvio berlusconi pulled out of the event to instead concentrate on the european financial crisis .
in an interview with the russian itar-tass news agency , merkel said the invitation to the victory celebration was a great honor .
she said the gesture showed that russia and germany had learned from history and could live in peace and friendship .
in 2005 , gerhard schroeder became the first german chancellor to be invited to the red square victory celebration .
protests planned bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel is the second german chancellor to be invited to the victory day commemorations russia 's communists , the country 's biggest opposition party , were planning to hold a protest march in central moscow after the parade .
they were angry that nato troops had been given permission to march on the square , home to the embalmed body of their revolutionary hero , vladimir lenin .
" foreign troops have never appeared on red square .
it 's a violation of tradition , " said sergei obukhov , a member of the party 's central committee .
" the presence of foreign troops with weapons in their hands is ... an unnecessary reminder that we lost the cold war . "
mine explosion the celebrations were overshadowed by two methane gas explosions at a coal mine in the siberian region of kemerova , which hours earlier killed at least 12 people , injured dozens and trapped more than 80 miners and rescuers .
the first explosion occurred late saturday night , with the second following a few hours later as a rescue operation was underway .
renewed rescue operations continue , but the high concentration of methane gas poses a risk of further explosions .
russian prime minister vladimir putin described the situation as " difficult " and " tragic " and urged authorities to do everything possible to rescue those still trapped underground. cmk / afp / dpa / reuters editor : kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de soccer -pipe- 09.05.2010 schalke striker kuranyi confirms switch to dynamo moscow großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : soon kuranyi will be cheering on a different team with the bundesliga season at an end , schalke 's striker kevin kuranyi has confirmed he 's signed on with russia 's dynamo moscow .
kuranyi could more than double his salary with the move to the 10th-ranked russian team . former germany striker kevin kuranyi said on his website on sunday that he was leaving schalke for a deal with russia 's dynamo moscow .
kuranyi was one of the bundesliga 's top scorers this season with 18 goals and schalke ended the season in second place , after bayern munich .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : saturday 's match was kuranyi 's last playing for schalke " after carefully weighing all the arguments and following several discussions , i have decided to transfer to russia with dynamo moscow , " kuranyi wrote in a " letter to his fans . "
" i always said that the whole package must be right .
i have this feeling with dynamo .
one aspect is certainly the financial one , " he said .
the 28-year-old will leave on a free transfer on july 1 and is said to have signed a three-year contract paying more than 6 million euros -lrb- $ 7.6 million -rrb- per season .
that more than doubles his current salary .
despite a slow start in the russian season and a current rank of 10th in their league , dynamo should n't be underestimated , kuranyi said .
dynamo has won 11 national titles , although the most recent victory was in 1976 .
no spot on the national team despite a successful league season , kuranyi was not chosen for germany 's national squad for the world cup in south africa this june .
national coach joachim loew kicked him off the team after he walked out on the team during a world cup qualifier in october 2008 after being left off that day 's line-up .
at the time loew said he would never ask him to play again and resisted pressure to include him on the world cup team. hf / afp / dpa editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

eu finance ministers will meet on sunday to discuss the plan . european union leaders are working overtime to construct new crisis defense mechanisms to safeguard the euro currency and crack down on market speculation before the asian financial markets reopen on monday .
on sunday , european union finance ministers debated proposals to set up a 600 billion euro -lrb- $ 765 billion -rrb- rescue fund for member countries states that fall into financial trouble , said diplomats in brussels .
the package would consist funds raised by the eu 's executive , the european commission , loans from eurozone states ; and money from the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- , diplomats said .
german chancellor angela merkel was holding a crisis cabinet meeting in berlin late sunday , to deal with the consequences of a prospective rescue system being negotiated in brussels , officials said .
a clear signal " taking into account the exceptional circumstances , the european commission will propose a european stabilization mechanism to preserve financial stability in europe , " herman van rompuy , the president of the eu , said in a statement released in the early hours of saturday morning .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and sarkozy both want to protect the euro from speculators german chancellor angela merkel said the move will send " a very clear signal " to market speculators by creating a common fund to support economies in difficulty . the european portion of the bailout will amount to some 80 billion euros -lrb- $ 102 billion -rrb- over three years , with germany set to provide the lion 's share.the imf has approved 30 billion euro loan for greece .
despite the 110 billion euro bailout , financial markets reacted negatively to the continued uncertainty , prompting eu leaders to consider new steps to prevent similar financial chaos from spreading to other member states .
the unprecedented greek bailout is due to be transferred to athens within days .
greeks oppose cuts the emergency summit in brussels coincided with ceremonies to commemorate the end of world war ii in europe , forcing some european leaders to cancel their plans to attend the events .
french president nicolas sarkozy and italian prime minister silvio berlusconi have both pulled out of sunday 's war commemorations in russia to deal with the financial crisis , but german chancellor angela merkel has arrived in moscow and will attend the ceremonies .
investors are keeping a close watch on greek opposition to greek prime minister george papandreou 's austerity plans , concerned that prolonged protests could weaken his resolve to push through the cuts passed by the greek parliament on thursday .
on saturday , opinion polls showed a majority of greeks support further protests against the austerity measures. smh / afp / ap / dpa editor : rick demarest send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the long-planned talks had suffered a setback due to new israeli settlement plans . after a long hiatus and much prodding by the new us administration , israelis and palestinians have begun indirect peace negotiations .
" the proximity talks have started , " chief palestinian negotiator saeb erakat told reporters on sunday in the west bank city of ramallah after a meeting between palestinian president mahmud abbas and us envoy george mitchell .
" today , on may 9 , the negotiations have begun at the level of the president -lrb- abbas -rrb- and -lrb- israeli prime minister benjamin -rrb- netanyahu , " he added , while stressing there would be no direct contact between the parties .
" there are no negotiations between us and the israeli government , " he said .
" the discussions will be held with mitchell and the americans and they will mediate between the two sides . "
the fact that both parties could n't agree to face-to-face meetings , but instead will only participate in " proximity " talks , shows the deep rift between israelis and palestinians on the issue .
in proximity talks , the involved parties do n't meet and discuss problems directly , but rely on an intermediary to conduct the negotiations . " indirect negotiations are an invention of henry kissinger , " explains shlomo ben-ami , a former israeli foreign minister , who was a key negotiator in the israeli-palestinian talks in camp david in 2000 and taba in 2001 .
kissinger , in the wake of the 1973 yom kippur war , resorted to what has since then been called shuttle diplomacy to negotiate between the syrians , the israelis and the egyptians .
since that time it has become an established mechanism to try to mediate between parties in long-standing conflicts .
" that 's ok , but if you do not reach at a certain point direct negotiations it is useless , " said ben-ami in an interview with deutsche welle .
" there is no way they can reach an agreement through a third party . "
indirect talks as best option while direct talks between israelis and palestinians are ultimately necessary to hammer out a peace deal , at this point indirect talks are probably a better option , said álvaro de soto , who headed negotiations that ended the civil war in el salvador and served as un special coordinator for the middle east peace process until 2007 .
he said the format of proximity talks is actually a good choice for the middle east , especially in the current hostile climate between both parties .
bildunterschrift : israeli-palestinian peace efforts have a bad track record " and i think that altogether too much of a production has been made about direct talks .
proximity talks have the advantage in this case of placing a much greater responsibility on the mediator , the mediator being the united states . "
both experts agree that aside from the us there is no other actor that would be acceptable to both parties .
the palestinians know that only washington has real influence and can bring israel to agree to a peace deal .
the israelis believe that they can trust only washington not to betray them and their crucial interests as a mediator . key role for washington while it has been pretty much commonly accepted that only washington can mediate this conflict , there is at the same time concern that the us , because of its close ties with israel , ca n't really act as an honest broker .
" i am convinced that only the us can play this role and i do n't set too much store by the objection that the us has a bias in this matter , " said de soto .
" the us role , it seems to me , is unavoidable and indispensible and i am very pleased that the us is at the center . "
that , however , does n't guarantee that this round of talks , which are slated to last four months , will be any more successful than all the previous attempts to achieve a breakthrough on the israeli-palestinian issue .
" if these people get an agreement they will deserve a nobel peace prize in physics , " said ben-ami .
difficult circumstances he believes that the underlying conditions for both israelis and palestinians are so negative , that it will be practically impossible for them to overcome .
palestinian president mahmoud abbas ' authority is challenged by hamas while israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu 's ability to agree to a deal is limited through the coalition with his hard-line foreign minister avigdor lieberman .
de soto adds that no viable agreement is possible if hamas is n't somehow included in the peace process .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israel angered the us and palestinians by announcing new settlements however , the slim chances for success also have a positive side .
" low expectations is what any mediator wants at the start of a mediation , i can tell you that from a professional 's standpoint , " said de soto , who believes that us middle east envoy george mitchell is exactly the right person for this mission impossible .
how exactly george mitchell will carry out this shuttle diplomacy neither of the experts could say .
" actually , it 's not a bad thing that little is known about what 's going on in a given peace process , " says de soto .
" negotiations , and peace negotiations in particular , are like very delicate , exotic orchids .
if you expose them to inclement weather they might wilt . "

the long-planned talks had suffered a setback due to new israeli settlement plans . after a long hiatus and much prodding by the new us administration , israelis and palestinians have begun indirect peace negotiations .
" the proximity talks have started , " chief palestinian negotiator saeb erakat told reporters on sunday in the west bank city of ramallah after a meeting between palestinian president mahmud abbas and us envoy george mitchell .
" today , on may 9 , the negotiations have begun at the level of the president -lrb- abbas -rrb- and -lrb- israeli prime minister benjamin -rrb- netanyahu , " he added , while stressing there would be no direct contact between the parties .
" there are no negotiations between us and the israeli government , " he said .
" the discussions will be held with mitchell and the americans and they will mediate between the two sides . "
the fact that both parties could n't agree to face-to-face meetings , but instead will only participate in " proximity " talks , shows the deep rift between israelis and palestinians on the issue .
in proximity talks , the involved parties do n't meet and discuss problems directly , but rely on an intermediary to conduct the negotiations . " indirect negotiations are an invention of henry kissinger , " explains shlomo ben-ami , a former israeli foreign minister , who was a key negotiator in the israeli-palestinian talks in camp david in 2000 and taba in 2001 .
kissinger , in the wake of the 1973 yom kippur war , resorted to what has since then been called shuttle diplomacy to negotiate between the syrians , the israelis and the egyptians .
since that time it has become an established mechanism to try to mediate between parties in long-standing conflicts .
" that 's ok , but if you do not reach at a certain point direct negotiations it is useless , " said ben-ami in an interview with deutsche welle .
" there is no way they can reach an agreement through a third party . "
indirect talks as best option while direct talks between israelis and palestinians are ultimately necessary to hammer out a peace deal , at this point indirect talks are probably a better option , said álvaro de soto , who headed negotiations that ended the civil war in el salvador and served as un special coordinator for the middle east peace process until 2007 .
he said the format of proximity talks is actually a good choice for the middle east , especially in the current hostile climate between both parties .
bildunterschrift : israeli-palestinian peace efforts have a bad track record " and i think that altogether too much of a production has been made about direct talks .
proximity talks have the advantage in this case of placing a much greater responsibility on the mediator , the mediator being the united states . "
both experts agree that aside from the us there is no other actor that would be acceptable to both parties .
the palestinians know that only washington has real influence and can bring israel to agree to a peace deal .
the israelis believe that they can trust only washington not to betray them and their crucial interests as a mediator . key role for washington while it has been pretty much commonly accepted that only washington can mediate this conflict , there is at the same time concern that the us , because of its close ties with israel , ca n't really act as an honest broker .
" i am convinced that only the us can play this role and i do n't set too much store by the objection that the us has a bias in this matter , " said de soto .
" the us role , it seems to me , is unavoidable and indispensible and i am very pleased that the us is at the center . "
that , however , does n't guarantee that this round of talks , which are slated to last four months , will be any more successful than all the previous attempts to achieve a breakthrough on the israeli-palestinian issue .
" if these people get an agreement they will deserve a nobel peace prize in physics , " said ben-ami .
difficult circumstances he believes that the underlying conditions for both israelis and palestinians are so negative , that it will be practically impossible for them to overcome .
palestinian president mahmoud abbas ' authority is challenged by hamas while israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu 's ability to agree to a deal is limited through the coalition with his hard-line foreign minister avigdor lieberman .
de soto adds that no viable agreement is possible if hamas is n't somehow included in the peace process .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israel angered the us and palestinians by announcing new settlements however , the slim chances for success also have a positive side .
" low expectations is what any mediator wants at the start of a mediation , i can tell you that from a professional 's standpoint , " said de soto , who believes that us middle east envoy george mitchell is exactly the right person for this mission impossible .
how exactly george mitchell will carry out this shuttle diplomacy neither of the experts could say .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de literature -pipe- 09.05.2010 norwegian museum reflects love-hate relationship with author hamsun großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamsunsenteret - the knut hamsun center - is architectural eye candy in the coming weeks , a museum dedicated to knut hamsun , one of norway 's most notable authors , is due to open to the public .
organizers say the writer 's association with the nazi party will be explored in the exhibition . norwegian writer knut hamsun received the nobel prize for literature in 1920 for his epic , " growth of the soil . "
he is noted for laying the groundwork for the modern novel by developing literary styles of revealing the intricacies of the human psyche .
such techniques would find their way into works by franz kafka , james joyce and virginia wolf , to name just a few .
but hamsun was also an ardent advocate of the nazi party both before world war ii and after germany occupied norway in 1941 .
in 1943 , he sent his nobel prize to nazi propaganda minister joseph goebbels as a gift .
he later visited adolf hitler and after the nazi leader 's death , proclaimed in a may 1945 newspaper eulogy " he was a warrior , a warrior for mankind , and a prophet of the gospel of justice for all nations . "
despite his nazi association , many norwegians have renewed their respect for his literary greatness .
last year saw extensive festivities commemorating the author 's 150th birthday , peaking in the august opening of the knut hamsun center -lrb- hamsunsenteret -rrb- in hamoroy , north of the arctic circle , where the writer grew up .
the museum closed soon after , with organizers then beginning preparations of the exhibition that is to showcase hamsun 's literary talent , as well as his dark past , when the museum opens to the public on june 11th , 2010 .
deutsche welle spoke with bordil borset , director of the hamsunsenteret .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 150th anniversary of hamsun 's birth was celebrated last year deutsche welle : why was the museum built to honor the writer and nobel prize winner knut hamsun ?
bordil borset : he came here to hamoroy when he was three years old with this parents , stayed here as a child , and came back as a grown-up during different periods of his life .
and this area - nordland -lsb- province -rsb- and hamoroy are very important in his life and works .
the idea to build the museum came about in 1986 , but it was a long , complicated process before it was actually completed .
part of the problem was getting enough funding , but the long process also had to due with the controversy surrounding knut hamsun as a person and his sympathizing with the nazis before and during the second world war .
how has that controversy been played out ?
there have been a lot of restrictions about naming streets , places and monuments after hamsun in norway .
and if one considers the new museum to be a monument to knut hamsun , then the question is asked : " why would we build a monument to someone who has brought shame to norway ? "
and what 's your answer to that ?
the museum is built as a center for communicating and researching about knut hamsun 's life and literature , and it 's a museum for all aspects of the person , just like other museums devoted to writers .
what 's unique about this particular one is its architecture .
it 's designed by one of the world 's most famous architects , steven holl .
this is unique around the world , this combination - a museum devoted to a nobel prize-winning author , designed by an internationally famous architect as an interpretation of the writer 's work , literary figures and his life .
and all of it placed in this nordland landscape , with nature completely surrounding it , and which was so central in hamsun 's works .
how does the museum 's architecture reflect hamsun 's literary landscapes ?
steven holl 's idea with the building was to construct it as a human body , a figure which includes all the contradictions and themes found in hamsun 's literary characters in his novels " hunger , " " mysteries , " and so on .
the building is a place of contradictory forces - there are dark corners and big , open spaces , and labyrinths , and the changing light and seasons make it appear different each day .
it 's a complex building that is always changing , just like the psychology of hamsun 's early characters .
bildunterschrift : the exterior is supposed to represent a church tower what 's unique about hamsun 's literary works ?
he created a new way of describing the human psyche , which is quite close to what james joyce did in the early 20th century , except that knut hamsun did that 20 to 30 years before stream of consciousness or modernism or the modern novel .
he 's a predecessor of the modern novel in the 20th century .
and he invented some techniques of describing the human psyche , this new hyper-sensitivity toward the modern world .
and then his work opens up and he invents this gallery of characters .
when he wrote literature , he wrote on small pieces of paper - like sheets from a calendar - and spread them out , plotted them out in front of him , on his desk to invent this literary universe .
what is also unique is how he combines this hyper-sensitivity and complexity of characters with his love of nature and the inspiration he gleaned from that - all using his beautiful linguistic techniques .
how does that his keen sensitivity as a novelist jibe with his nazi affiliation ?
this is the big question and mystery of hamsun which has been haunting us for 50 , 60 , 70 years .
how can one of the world 's finest writers , someone who writes with such sensitivity about love , nature and the human psyche , take such a political stance as a person ?
i ca n't answer that .
it 's one of those contradictions of knut hamsun .
yes , he was one of the world 's greatest authors , and yes , he supported the terrible nazi regime , which we have absolutely no sympathy for .
did he ever offer an explanation for that ?
no .
after world war ii , he was fined a huge sum of money , which was to be paid to the norwegian state .
-lsb- editors ' note : he was to stand trial for treason , but was deemed mentally unfit due to his advanced age . -rsb-
but it could never be proved that hamsun was actually a member of the nazi party .
the subject is addressed again and again in biographies about him ; it 's a question that can not be answered .
just as his characters were complicated and contradictory , so was he .
that 's how human beings are .
there are lots of aspects about human beings that we ca n't explain .
how is hamsun 's nazi past addressed at the museum ?
in the exhibition , all aspects of hamsun 's life and literature are addressed and presented - everything from first editions of his works to the trial after world war ii .
we are also offering lectures , movies , debates , and conferences on the issue .
it will always be treated critically , and it has to be because there is no other way of learning how we are and how we behave today .
he can learn from hamsun 's life and actions and perhaps apply that to how we are today .
that 's what literature does to us , what makes it eternal , what makes it great .
the only way to handle the topic is to address it openly .
but i think there is a new generation of historians coming on stage now who are dealing with the war in a different way .
all last year , during the jubilee for hamsun 's 150th birthday , the political aspects of him were discussed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the interior is deliberately labyrinthine hamsun was actually just one of many nazi sympathizers , but because he was an important person , because he claimed to be one of the big , new norwegian writers - our national poet - , the disappointment , the betrayal people felt was all the greater .
it was a trauma for the norwegian people .
how could he do this ?
and why did he never apologize ?
or show remorse or regret after the war ?
please tell me more about the architecture of the museum .
when you enter the area around the museum , you see this big , black tower , which is reminiscent of old , wooden , norwegian churches .
but it also refers to a scene in one of hamsun 's novels .
then , on the top of the roof , you see bamboo , which is like a strange mix of hair and grass .
the building sort of leans to the side , and all this together makes it appear like a figure .
inside , it 's white , so you get this contrast of the black , wooden exterior and white , concrete interior .
in the middle of the building , there is this brass elevator .
if the building is a metaphor for the body , then this brass elevator is like the spine holding it all up ; it 's the core , the stable element .
but there are glass panels in it , so you can see the movements both inside and outside the elevator - like the nerves in the spine of human beings .
stephan holl has all these playful tricks and illusions inside the building that make it challenging , and create a dynamic between the open spaces and the darker corners .
also , on the first level , the floor is made of blackish-gray concrete and is slightly tilted , so when you move inside the building , you actually have quite a physical , special experience of working with or against the building .
and then there are funny elements in there - like a yellow balcony , which is a reference to hamsun 's novel " hunger , " or a wooden structure that symbolizes the empty violin case in " mysteries . "

last year saw extensive festivities commemorating the author 's 150th birthday , peaking in the august opening of the knut hamsun center -lrb- hamsunsenteret -rrb- in hamoroy , north of the arctic circle , where the writer grew up .
the museum closed soon after , with organizers then beginning preparations of the exhibition that is to showcase hamsun 's literary talent , as well as his dark past , when the museum opens to the public on june 11th , 2010 .
deutsche welle spoke with bordil borset , director of the hamsunsenteret .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 150th anniversary of hamsun 's birth was celebrated last year deutsche welle : why was the museum built to honor the writer and nobel prize winner knut hamsun ?
bordil borset : he came here to hamoroy when he was three years old with this parents , stayed here as a child , and came back as a grown-up during different periods of his life .
and this area - nordland -lsb- province -rsb- and hamoroy are very important in his life and works .
the idea to build the museum came about in 1986 , but it was a long , complicated process before it was actually completed .
part of the problem was getting enough funding , but the long process also had to due with the controversy surrounding knut hamsun as a person and his sympathizing with the nazis before and during the second world war .
how has that controversy been played out ?
there have been a lot of restrictions about naming streets , places and monuments after hamsun in norway .
and if one considers the new museum to be a monument to knut hamsun , then the question is asked : " why would we build a monument to someone who has brought shame to norway ? "
and what 's your answer to that ?
the museum is built as a center for communicating and researching about knut hamsun 's life and literature , and it 's a museum for all aspects of the person , just like other museums devoted to writers .
what 's unique about this particular one is its architecture .
it 's designed by one of the world 's most famous architects , steven holl .
this is unique around the world , this combination - a museum devoted to a nobel prize-winning author , designed by an internationally famous architect as an interpretation of the writer 's work , literary figures and his life .
and all of it placed in this nordland landscape , with nature completely surrounding it , and which was so central in hamsun 's works .
how does the museum 's architecture reflect hamsun 's literary landscapes ?
steven holl 's idea with the building was to construct it as a human body , a figure which includes all the contradictions and themes found in hamsun 's literary characters in his novels " hunger , " " mysteries , " and so on .
the building is a place of contradictory forces - there are dark corners and big , open spaces , and labyrinths , and the changing light and seasons make it appear different each day .
it 's a complex building that is always changing , just like the psychology of hamsun 's early characters .
bildunterschrift : the exterior is supposed to represent a church tower what 's unique about hamsun 's literary works ?
he created a new way of describing the human psyche , which is quite close to what james joyce did in the early 20th century , except that knut hamsun did that 20 to 30 years before stream of consciousness or modernism or the modern novel .
he 's a predecessor of the modern novel in the 20th century .
and he invented some techniques of describing the human psyche , this new hyper-sensitivity toward the modern world .
and then his work opens up and he invents this gallery of characters .
when he wrote literature , he wrote on small pieces of paper - like sheets from a calendar - and spread them out , plotted them out in front of him , on his desk to invent this literary universe .
what is also unique is how he combines this hyper-sensitivity and complexity of characters with his love of nature and the inspiration he gleaned from that - all using his beautiful linguistic techniques .
how does that his keen sensitivity as a novelist jibe with his nazi affiliation ?
this is the big question and mystery of hamsun which has been haunting us for 50 , 60 , 70 years .
how can one of the world 's finest writers , someone who writes with such sensitivity about love , nature and the human psyche , take such a political stance as a person ?
i ca n't answer that .
it 's one of those contradictions of knut hamsun .
yes , he was one of the world 's greatest authors , and yes , he supported the terrible nazi regime , which we have absolutely no sympathy for .
did he ever offer an explanation for that ?
no .
after world war ii , he was fined a huge sum of money , which was to be paid to the norwegian state .
-lsb- editors ' note : he was to stand trial for treason , but was deemed mentally unfit due to his advanced age . -rsb-
but it could never be proved that hamsun was actually a member of the nazi party .
the subject is addressed again and again in biographies about him ; it 's a question that can not be answered .
just as his characters were complicated and contradictory , so was he .
that 's how human beings are .
there are lots of aspects about human beings that we ca n't explain .
how is hamsun 's nazi past addressed at the museum ?
in the exhibition , all aspects of hamsun 's life and literature are addressed and presented - everything from first editions of his works to the trial after world war ii .
we are also offering lectures , movies , debates , and conferences on the issue .
it will always be treated critically , and it has to be because there is no other way of learning how we are and how we behave today .
he can learn from hamsun 's life and actions and perhaps apply that to how we are today .
that 's what literature does to us , what makes it eternal , what makes it great .
the only way to handle the topic is to address it openly .
but i think there is a new generation of historians coming on stage now who are dealing with the war in a different way .
all last year , during the jubilee for hamsun 's 150th birthday , the political aspects of him were discussed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the interior is deliberately labyrinthine hamsun was actually just one of many nazi sympathizers , but because he was an important person , because he claimed to be one of the big , new norwegian writers - our national poet - , the disappointment , the betrayal people felt was all the greater .
it was a trauma for the norwegian people .
how could he do this ?
and why did he never apologize ?
or show remorse or regret after the war ?
please tell me more about the architecture of the museum .
when you enter the area around the museum , you see this big , black tower , which is reminiscent of old , wooden , norwegian churches .
but it also refers to a scene in one of hamsun 's novels .
then , on the top of the roof , you see bamboo , which is like a strange mix of hair and grass .
the building sort of leans to the side , and all this together makes it appear like a figure .
inside , it 's white , so you get this contrast of the black , wooden exterior and white , concrete interior .
in the middle of the building , there is this brass elevator .
if the building is a metaphor for the body , then this brass elevator is like the spine holding it all up ; it 's the core , the stable element .
but there are glass panels in it , so you can see the movements both inside and outside the elevator - like the nerves in the spine of human beings .
stephan holl has all these playful tricks and illusions inside the building that make it challenging , and create a dynamic between the open spaces and the darker corners .
also , on the first level , the floor is made of blackish-gray concrete and is slightly tilted , so when you move inside the building , you actually have quite a physical , special experience of working with or against the building .
and then there are funny elements in there - like a yellow balcony , which is a reference to hamsun 's novel " hunger , " or a wooden structure that symbolizes the empty violin case in " mysteries . "

organizers say the writer 's association with the nazi party will be explored in the exhibition . norwegian writer knut hamsun received the nobel prize for literature in 1920 for his epic , " growth of the soil . "
he is noted for laying the groundwork for the modern novel by developing literary styles of revealing the intricacies of the human psyche .
such techniques would find their way into works by franz kafka , james joyce and virginia wolf , to name just a few .
but hamsun was also an ardent advocate of the nazi party both before world war ii and after germany occupied norway in 1941 .
in 1943 , he sent his nobel prize to nazi propaganda minister joseph goebbels as a gift .
he later visited adolf hitler and after the nazi leader 's death , proclaimed in a may 1945 newspaper eulogy " he was a warrior , a warrior for mankind , and a prophet of the gospel of justice for all nations . "
despite his nazi association , many norwegians have renewed their respect for his literary greatness .
last year saw extensive festivities commemorating the author 's 150th birthday , peaking in the august opening of the knut hamsun center -lrb- hamsunsenteret -rrb- in hamoroy , north of the arctic circle , where the writer grew up .
the museum closed soon after , with organizers then beginning preparations of the exhibition that is to showcase hamsun 's literary talent , as well as his dark past , when the museum opens to the public on june 11th , 2010 .
deutsche welle spoke with bordil borset , director of the hamsunsenteret .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 150th anniversary of hamsun 's birth was celebrated last year deutsche welle : why was the museum built to honor the writer and nobel prize winner knut hamsun ?
bordil borset : he came here to hamoroy when he was three years old with this parents , stayed here as a child , and came back as a grown-up during different periods of his life .
and this area - nordland -lsb- province -rsb- and hamoroy are very important in his life and works .
the idea to build the museum came about in 1986 , but it was a long , complicated process before it was actually completed .
part of the problem was getting enough funding , but the long process also had to due with the controversy surrounding knut hamsun as a person and his sympathizing with the nazis before and during the second world war .
how has that controversy been played out ?
there have been a lot of restrictions about naming streets , places and monuments after hamsun in norway .
and if one considers the new museum to be a monument to knut hamsun , then the question is asked : " why would we build a monument to someone who has brought shame to norway ? "
and what 's your answer to that ?
the museum is built as a center for communicating and researching about knut hamsun 's life and literature , and it 's a museum for all aspects of the person , just like other museums devoted to writers .
what 's unique about this particular one is its architecture .
it 's designed by one of the world 's most famous architects , steven holl .
this is unique around the world , this combination - a museum devoted to a nobel prize-winning author , designed by an internationally famous architect as an interpretation of the writer 's work , literary figures and his life .
and all of it placed in this nordland landscape , with nature completely surrounding it , and which was so central in hamsun 's works .
how does the museum 's architecture reflect hamsun 's literary landscapes ?
steven holl 's idea with the building was to construct it as a human body , a figure which includes all the contradictions and themes found in hamsun 's literary characters in his novels " hunger , " " mysteries , " and so on .
the building is a place of contradictory forces - there are dark corners and big , open spaces , and labyrinths , and the changing light and seasons make it appear different each day .
it 's a complex building that is always changing , just like the psychology of hamsun 's early characters .
bildunterschrift : the exterior is supposed to represent a church tower what 's unique about hamsun 's literary works ?
he created a new way of describing the human psyche , which is quite close to what james joyce did in the early 20th century , except that knut hamsun did that 20 to 30 years before stream of consciousness or modernism or the modern novel .
he 's a predecessor of the modern novel in the 20th century .
and he invented some techniques of describing the human psyche , this new hyper-sensitivity toward the modern world .
and then his work opens up and he invents this gallery of characters .
when he wrote literature , he wrote on small pieces of paper - like sheets from a calendar - and spread them out , plotted them out in front of him , on his desk to invent this literary universe .
what is also unique is how he combines this hyper-sensitivity and complexity of characters with his love of nature and the inspiration he gleaned from that - all using his beautiful linguistic techniques .
how does that his keen sensitivity as a novelist jibe with his nazi affiliation ?
this is the big question and mystery of hamsun which has been haunting us for 50 , 60 , 70 years .
how can one of the world 's finest writers , someone who writes with such sensitivity about love , nature and the human psyche , take such a political stance as a person ?
i ca n't answer that .
it 's one of those contradictions of knut hamsun .
yes , he was one of the world 's greatest authors , and yes , he supported the terrible nazi regime , which we have absolutely no sympathy for .
did he ever offer an explanation for that ?
no .
after world war ii , he was fined a huge sum of money , which was to be paid to the norwegian state .
-lsb- editors ' note : he was to stand trial for treason , but was deemed mentally unfit due to his advanced age . -rsb-
but it could never be proved that hamsun was actually a member of the nazi party .
the subject is addressed again and again in biographies about him ; it 's a question that can not be answered .
just as his characters were complicated and contradictory , so was he .
that 's how human beings are .
there are lots of aspects about human beings that we ca n't explain .
how is hamsun 's nazi past addressed at the museum ?
in the exhibition , all aspects of hamsun 's life and literature are addressed and presented - everything from first editions of his works to the trial after world war ii .
we are also offering lectures , movies , debates , and conferences on the issue .
it will always be treated critically , and it has to be because there is no other way of learning how we are and how we behave today .
he can learn from hamsun 's life and actions and perhaps apply that to how we are today .
that 's what literature does to us , what makes it eternal , what makes it great .
the only way to handle the topic is to address it openly .
but i think there is a new generation of historians coming on stage now who are dealing with the war in a different way .
all last year , during the jubilee for hamsun 's 150th birthday , the political aspects of him were discussed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the interior is deliberately labyrinthine hamsun was actually just one of many nazi sympathizers , but because he was an important person , because he claimed to be one of the big , new norwegian writers - our national poet - , the disappointment , the betrayal people felt was all the greater .
it was a trauma for the norwegian people .
how could he do this ?
and why did he never apologize ?
or show remorse or regret after the war ?
please tell me more about the architecture of the museum .
when you enter the area around the museum , you see this big , black tower , which is reminiscent of old , wooden , norwegian churches .
but it also refers to a scene in one of hamsun 's novels .
then , on the top of the roof , you see bamboo , which is like a strange mix of hair and grass .
the building sort of leans to the side , and all this together makes it appear like a figure .
inside , it 's white , so you get this contrast of the black , wooden exterior and white , concrete interior .
in the middle of the building , there is this brass elevator .
if the building is a metaphor for the body , then this brass elevator is like the spine holding it all up ; it 's the core , the stable element .
but there are glass panels in it , so you can see the movements both inside and outside the elevator - like the nerves in the spine of human beings .
stephan holl has all these playful tricks and illusions inside the building that make it challenging , and create a dynamic between the open spaces and the darker corners .
also , on the first level , the floor is made of blackish-gray concrete and is slightly tilted , so when you move inside the building , you actually have quite a physical , special experience of working with or against the building .
and then there are funny elements in there - like a yellow balcony , which is a reference to hamsun 's novel " hunger , " or a wooden structure that symbolizes the empty violin case in " mysteries . "

there have been a lot of restrictions about naming streets , places and monuments after hamsun in norway .
and if one considers the new museum to be a monument to knut hamsun , then the question is asked : " why would we build a monument to someone who has brought shame to norway ? "
and what 's your answer to that ?
the museum is built as a center for communicating and researching about knut hamsun 's life and literature , and it 's a museum for all aspects of the person , just like other museums devoted to writers .
what 's unique about this particular one is its architecture .
it 's designed by one of the world 's most famous architects , steven holl .
this is unique around the world , this combination - a museum devoted to a nobel prize-winning author , designed by an internationally famous architect as an interpretation of the writer 's work , literary figures and his life .
and all of it placed in this nordland landscape , with nature completely surrounding it , and which was so central in hamsun 's works .
how does the museum 's architecture reflect hamsun 's literary landscapes ?
steven holl 's idea with the building was to construct it as a human body , a figure which includes all the contradictions and themes found in hamsun 's literary characters in his novels " hunger , " " mysteries , " and so on .
the building is a place of contradictory forces - there are dark corners and big , open spaces , and labyrinths , and the changing light and seasons make it appear different each day .
it 's a complex building that is always changing , just like the psychology of hamsun 's early characters .
bildunterschrift : the exterior is supposed to represent a church tower what 's unique about hamsun 's literary works ?
he created a new way of describing the human psyche , which is quite close to what james joyce did in the early 20th century , except that knut hamsun did that 20 to 30 years before stream of consciousness or modernism or the modern novel .
he 's a predecessor of the modern novel in the 20th century .
and he invented some techniques of describing the human psyche , this new hyper-sensitivity toward the modern world .
and then his work opens up and he invents this gallery of characters .
when he wrote literature , he wrote on small pieces of paper - like sheets from a calendar - and spread them out , plotted them out in front of him , on his desk to invent this literary universe .
what is also unique is how he combines this hyper-sensitivity and complexity of characters with his love of nature and the inspiration he gleaned from that - all using his beautiful linguistic techniques .
how does that his keen sensitivity as a novelist jibe with his nazi affiliation ?
this is the big question and mystery of hamsun which has been haunting us for 50 , 60 , 70 years .
how can one of the world 's finest writers , someone who writes with such sensitivity about love , nature and the human psyche , take such a political stance as a person ?
i ca n't answer that .

yes , he was one of the world 's greatest authors , and yes , he supported the terrible nazi regime , which we have absolutely no sympathy for .

organizers say the writer 's association with the nazi party will be explored in the exhibition . norwegian writer knut hamsun received the nobel prize for literature in 1920 for his epic , " growth of the soil . "
he is noted for laying the groundwork for the modern novel by developing literary styles of revealing the intricacies of the human psyche .
such techniques would find their way into works by franz kafka , james joyce and virginia wolf , to name just a few .
but hamsun was also an ardent advocate of the nazi party both before world war ii and after germany occupied norway in 1941 .
in 1943 , he sent his nobel prize to nazi propaganda minister joseph goebbels as a gift .
he later visited adolf hitler and after the nazi leader 's death , proclaimed in a may 1945 newspaper eulogy " he was a warrior , a warrior for mankind , and a prophet of the gospel of justice for all nations . "
despite his nazi association , many norwegians have renewed their respect for his literary greatness .
last year saw extensive festivities commemorating the author 's 150th birthday , peaking in the august opening of the knut hamsun center -lrb- hamsunsenteret -rrb- in hamoroy , north of the arctic circle , where the writer grew up .
the museum closed soon after , with organizers then beginning preparations of the exhibition that is to showcase hamsun 's literary talent , as well as his dark past , when the museum opens to the public on june 11th , 2010 .
deutsche welle spoke with bordil borset , director of the hamsunsenteret .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 150th anniversary of hamsun 's birth was celebrated last year deutsche welle : why was the museum built to honor the writer and nobel prize winner knut hamsun ?
bordil borset : he came here to hamoroy when he was three years old with this parents , stayed here as a child , and came back as a grown-up during different periods of his life .
and this area - nordland -lsb- province -rsb- and hamoroy are very important in his life and works .
the idea to build the museum came about in 1986 , but it was a long , complicated process before it was actually completed .
part of the problem was getting enough funding , but the long process also had to due with the controversy surrounding knut hamsun as a person and his sympathizing with the nazis before and during the second world war .

the long-planned talks had suffered a setback due to new israeli settlement plans . after a long hiatus and much prodding by the new us administration , israelis and palestinians have begun indirect peace negotiations .
" the proximity talks have started , " chief palestinian negotiator saeb erakat told reporters on sunday in the west bank city of ramallah after a meeting between palestinian president mahmud abbas and us envoy george mitchell .
" today , on may 9 , the negotiations have begun at the level of the president -lrb- abbas -rrb- and -lrb- israeli prime minister benjamin -rrb- netanyahu , " he added , while stressing there would be no direct contact between the parties .
" there are no negotiations between us and the israeli government , " he said .
" the discussions will be held with mitchell and the americans and they will mediate between the two sides . "
the fact that both parties could n't agree to face-to-face meetings , but instead will only participate in " proximity " talks , shows the deep rift between israelis and palestinians on the issue .
in proximity talks , the involved parties do n't meet and discuss problems directly , but rely on an intermediary to conduct the negotiations . " indirect negotiations are an invention of henry kissinger , " explains shlomo ben-ami , a former israeli foreign minister , who was a key negotiator in the israeli-palestinian talks in camp david in 2000 and taba in 2001 .
kissinger , in the wake of the 1973 yom kippur war , resorted to what has since then been called shuttle diplomacy to negotiate between the syrians , the israelis and the egyptians .
since that time it has become an established mechanism to try to mediate between parties in long-standing conflicts .
" that 's ok , but if you do not reach at a certain point direct negotiations it is useless , " said ben-ami in an interview with deutsche welle .
" there is no way they can reach an agreement through a third party . "
indirect talks as best option while direct talks between israelis and palestinians are ultimately necessary to hammer out a peace deal , at this point indirect talks are probably a better option , said álvaro de soto , who headed negotiations that ended the civil war in el salvador and served as un special coordinator for the middle east peace process until 2007 .
he said the format of proximity talks is actually a good choice for the middle east , especially in the current hostile climate between both parties .
bildunterschrift : israeli-palestinian peace efforts have a bad track record " and i think that altogether too much of a production has been made about direct talks .
proximity talks have the advantage in this case of placing a much greater responsibility on the mediator , the mediator being the united states . "
both experts agree that aside from the us there is no other actor that would be acceptable to both parties .
the palestinians know that only washington has real influence and can bring israel to agree to a peace deal .
the israelis believe that they can trust only washington not to betray them and their crucial interests as a mediator . key role for washington while it has been pretty much commonly accepted that only washington can mediate this conflict , there is at the same time concern that the us , because of its close ties with israel , ca n't really act as an honest broker .
" i am convinced that only the us can play this role and i do n't set too much store by the objection that the us has a bias in this matter , " said de soto .
" the us role , it seems to me , is unavoidable and indispensible and i am very pleased that the us is at the center . "
that , however , does n't guarantee that this round of talks , which are slated to last four months , will be any more successful than all the previous attempts to achieve a breakthrough on the israeli-palestinian issue .
" if these people get an agreement they will deserve a nobel peace prize in physics , " said ben-ami .
difficult circumstances he believes that the underlying conditions for both israelis and palestinians are so negative , that it will be practically impossible for them to overcome .
palestinian president mahmoud abbas ' authority is challenged by hamas while israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu 's ability to agree to a deal is limited through the coalition with his hard-line foreign minister avigdor lieberman .
de soto adds that no viable agreement is possible if hamas is n't somehow included in the peace process .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israel angered the us and palestinians by announcing new settlements however , the slim chances for success also have a positive side .
" low expectations is what any mediator wants at the start of a mediation , i can tell you that from a professional 's standpoint , " said de soto , who believes that us middle east envoy george mitchell is exactly the right person for this mission impossible .
how exactly george mitchell will carry out this shuttle diplomacy neither of the experts could say .
" actually , it 's not a bad thing that little is known about what 's going on in a given peace process , " says de soto .
" negotiations , and peace negotiations in particular , are like very delicate , exotic orchids .
if you expose them to inclement weather they might wilt . "

the long-planned talks had suffered a setback due to new israeli settlement plans . after a long hiatus and much prodding by the new us administration , israelis and palestinians have begun indirect peace negotiations .
" the proximity talks have started , " chief palestinian negotiator saeb erakat told reporters on sunday in the west bank city of ramallah after a meeting between palestinian president mahmud abbas and us envoy george mitchell .
" today , on may 9 , the negotiations have begun at the level of the president -lrb- abbas -rrb- and -lrb- israeli prime minister benjamin -rrb- netanyahu , " he added , while stressing there would be no direct contact between the parties .
" there are no negotiations between us and the israeli government , " he said .
" the discussions will be held with mitchell and the americans and they will mediate between the two sides . "
the fact that both parties could n't agree to face-to-face meetings , but instead will only participate in " proximity " talks , shows the deep rift between israelis and palestinians on the issue .
in proximity talks , the involved parties do n't meet and discuss problems directly , but rely on an intermediary to conduct the negotiations . " indirect negotiations are an invention of henry kissinger , " explains shlomo ben-ami , a former israeli foreign minister , who was a key negotiator in the israeli-palestinian talks in camp david in 2000 and taba in 2001 .
kissinger , in the wake of the 1973 yom kippur war , resorted to what has since then been called shuttle diplomacy to negotiate between the syrians , the israelis and the egyptians .
since that time it has become an established mechanism to try to mediate between parties in long-standing conflicts .
" that 's ok , but if you do not reach at a certain point direct negotiations it is useless , " said ben-ami in an interview with deutsche welle .
" there is no way they can reach an agreement through a third party . "
indirect talks as best option while direct talks between israelis and palestinians are ultimately necessary to hammer out a peace deal , at this point indirect talks are probably a better option , said álvaro de soto , who headed negotiations that ended the civil war in el salvador and served as un special coordinator for the middle east peace process until 2007 .
he said the format of proximity talks is actually a good choice for the middle east , especially in the current hostile climate between both parties .
bildunterschrift : israeli-palestinian peace efforts have a bad track record " and i think that altogether too much of a production has been made about direct talks .
proximity talks have the advantage in this case of placing a much greater responsibility on the mediator , the mediator being the united states . "
both experts agree that aside from the us there is no other actor that would be acceptable to both parties .
the palestinians know that only washington has real influence and can bring israel to agree to a peace deal .
the israelis believe that they can trust only washington not to betray them and their crucial interests as a mediator . key role for washington while it has been pretty much commonly accepted that only washington can mediate this conflict , there is at the same time concern that the us , because of its close ties with israel , ca n't really act as an honest broker .
" i am convinced that only the us can play this role and i do n't set too much store by the objection that the us has a bias in this matter , " said de soto .

indirect talks as best option while direct talks between israelis and palestinians are ultimately necessary to hammer out a peace deal , at this point indirect talks are probably a better option , said álvaro de soto , who headed negotiations that ended the civil war in el salvador and served as un special coordinator for the middle east peace process until 2007 .
he said the format of proximity talks is actually a good choice for the middle east , especially in the current hostile climate between both parties .
bildunterschrift : israeli-palestinian peace efforts have a bad track record " and i think that altogether too much of a production has been made about direct talks .
proximity talks have the advantage in this case of placing a much greater responsibility on the mediator , the mediator being the united states . "
both experts agree that aside from the us there is no other actor that would be acceptable to both parties .
the palestinians know that only washington has real influence and can bring israel to agree to a peace deal .
the israelis believe that they can trust only washington not to betray them and their crucial interests as a mediator . key role for washington while it has been pretty much commonly accepted that only washington can mediate this conflict , there is at the same time concern that the us , because of its close ties with israel , ca n't really act as an honest broker .
" i am convinced that only the us can play this role and i do n't set too much store by the objection that the us has a bias in this matter , " said de soto .
" the us role , it seems to me , is unavoidable and indispensible and i am very pleased that the us is at the center . "
that , however , does n't guarantee that this round of talks , which are slated to last four months , will be any more successful than all the previous attempts to achieve a breakthrough on the israeli-palestinian issue .
" if these people get an agreement they will deserve a nobel peace prize in physics , " said ben-ami .
difficult circumstances he believes that the underlying conditions for both israelis and palestinians are so negative , that it will be practically impossible for them to overcome .
palestinian president mahmoud abbas ' authority is challenged by hamas while israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu 's ability to agree to a deal is limited through the coalition with his hard-line foreign minister avigdor lieberman .
de soto adds that no viable agreement is possible if hamas is n't somehow included in the peace process .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israel angered the us and palestinians by announcing new settlements however , the slim chances for success also have a positive side .
" low expectations is what any mediator wants at the start of a mediation , i can tell you that from a professional 's standpoint , " said de soto , who believes that us middle east envoy george mitchell is exactly the right person for this mission impossible .
how exactly george mitchell will carry out this shuttle diplomacy neither of the experts could say .
" actually , it 's not a bad thing that little is known about what 's going on in a given peace process , " says de soto .
" negotiations , and peace negotiations in particular , are like very delicate , exotic orchids .
if you expose them to inclement weather they might wilt . "

organizers say the writer 's association with the nazi party will be explored in the exhibition . norwegian writer knut hamsun received the nobel prize for literature in 1920 for his epic , " growth of the soil . "
he is noted for laying the groundwork for the modern novel by developing literary styles of revealing the intricacies of the human psyche .
such techniques would find their way into works by franz kafka , james joyce and virginia wolf , to name just a few .
but hamsun was also an ardent advocate of the nazi party both before world war ii and after germany occupied norway in 1941 .
in 1943 , he sent his nobel prize to nazi propaganda minister joseph goebbels as a gift .
he later visited adolf hitler and after the nazi leader 's death , proclaimed in a may 1945 newspaper eulogy " he was a warrior , a warrior for mankind , and a prophet of the gospel of justice for all nations . "
despite his nazi association , many norwegians have renewed their respect for his literary greatness .
last year saw extensive festivities commemorating the author 's 150th birthday , peaking in the august opening of the knut hamsun center -lrb- hamsunsenteret -rrb- in hamoroy , north of the arctic circle , where the writer grew up .
the museum closed soon after , with organizers then beginning preparations of the exhibition that is to showcase hamsun 's literary talent , as well as his dark past , when the museum opens to the public on june 11th , 2010 .
deutsche welle spoke with bordil borset , director of the hamsunsenteret .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 150th anniversary of hamsun 's birth was celebrated last year deutsche welle : why was the museum built to honor the writer and nobel prize winner knut hamsun ?
bordil borset : he came here to hamoroy when he was three years old with this parents , stayed here as a child , and came back as a grown-up during different periods of his life .
and this area - nordland -lsb- province -rsb- and hamoroy are very important in his life and works .
the idea to build the museum came about in 1986 , but it was a long , complicated process before it was actually completed .
part of the problem was getting enough funding , but the long process also had to due with the controversy surrounding knut hamsun as a person and his sympathizing with the nazis before and during the second world war .
how has that controversy been played out ?
there have been a lot of restrictions about naming streets , places and monuments after hamsun in norway .
and if one considers the new museum to be a monument to knut hamsun , then the question is asked : " why would we build a monument to someone who has brought shame to norway ? "
and what 's your answer to that ?
the museum is built as a center for communicating and researching about knut hamsun 's life and literature , and it 's a museum for all aspects of the person , just like other museums devoted to writers .
what 's unique about this particular one is its architecture .
it 's designed by one of the world 's most famous architects , steven holl .
this is unique around the world , this combination - a museum devoted to a nobel prize-winning author , designed by an internationally famous architect as an interpretation of the writer 's work , literary figures and his life .
and all of it placed in this nordland landscape , with nature completely surrounding it , and which was so central in hamsun 's works .
how does the museum 's architecture reflect hamsun 's literary landscapes ?
steven holl 's idea with the building was to construct it as a human body , a figure which includes all the contradictions and themes found in hamsun 's literary characters in his novels " hunger , " " mysteries , " and so on .
the building is a place of contradictory forces - there are dark corners and big , open spaces , and labyrinths , and the changing light and seasons make it appear different each day .
it 's a complex building that is always changing , just like the psychology of hamsun 's early characters .
bildunterschrift : the exterior is supposed to represent a church tower what 's unique about hamsun 's literary works ?
he created a new way of describing the human psyche , which is quite close to what james joyce did in the early 20th century , except that knut hamsun did that 20 to 30 years before stream of consciousness or modernism or the modern novel .
he 's a predecessor of the modern novel in the 20th century .
and he invented some techniques of describing the human psyche , this new hyper-sensitivity toward the modern world .
and then his work opens up and he invents this gallery of characters .
when he wrote literature , he wrote on small pieces of paper - like sheets from a calendar - and spread them out , plotted them out in front of him , on his desk to invent this literary universe .
what is also unique is how he combines this hyper-sensitivity and complexity of characters with his love of nature and the inspiration he gleaned from that - all using his beautiful linguistic techniques .
how does that his keen sensitivity as a novelist jibe with his nazi affiliation ?
this is the big question and mystery of hamsun which has been haunting us for 50 , 60 , 70 years .
how can one of the world 's finest writers , someone who writes with such sensitivity about love , nature and the human psyche , take such a political stance as a person ?
i ca n't answer that .
it 's one of those contradictions of knut hamsun .
yes , he was one of the world 's greatest authors , and yes , he supported the terrible nazi regime , which we have absolutely no sympathy for .
did he ever offer an explanation for that ?
no .
after world war ii , he was fined a huge sum of money , which was to be paid to the norwegian state .
-lsb- editors ' note : he was to stand trial for treason , but was deemed mentally unfit due to his advanced age . -rsb-
but it could never be proved that hamsun was actually a member of the nazi party .
the subject is addressed again and again in biographies about him ; it 's a question that can not be answered .
just as his characters were complicated and contradictory , so was he .
that 's how human beings are .
there are lots of aspects about human beings that we ca n't explain .
how is hamsun 's nazi past addressed at the museum ?
in the exhibition , all aspects of hamsun 's life and literature are addressed and presented - everything from first editions of his works to the trial after world war ii .
we are also offering lectures , movies , debates , and conferences on the issue .
it will always be treated critically , and it has to be because there is no other way of learning how we are and how we behave today .
he can learn from hamsun 's life and actions and perhaps apply that to how we are today .
that 's what literature does to us , what makes it eternal , what makes it great .
the only way to handle the topic is to address it openly .
but i think there is a new generation of historians coming on stage now who are dealing with the war in a different way .
all last year , during the jubilee for hamsun 's 150th birthday , the political aspects of him were discussed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the interior is deliberately labyrinthine hamsun was actually just one of many nazi sympathizers , but because he was an important person , because he claimed to be one of the big , new norwegian writers - our national poet - , the disappointment , the betrayal people felt was all the greater .
it was a trauma for the norwegian people .
how could he do this ?
and why did he never apologize ?
or show remorse or regret after the war ?
please tell me more about the architecture of the museum .
when you enter the area around the museum , you see this big , black tower , which is reminiscent of old , wooden , norwegian churches .
but it also refers to a scene in one of hamsun 's novels .
then , on the top of the roof , you see bamboo , which is like a strange mix of hair and grass .
the building sort of leans to the side , and all this together makes it appear like a figure .
inside , it 's white , so you get this contrast of the black , wooden exterior and white , concrete interior .
in the middle of the building , there is this brass elevator .
if the building is a metaphor for the body , then this brass elevator is like the spine holding it all up ; it 's the core , the stable element .
but there are glass panels in it , so you can see the movements both inside and outside the elevator - like the nerves in the spine of human beings .
stephan holl has all these playful tricks and illusions inside the building that make it challenging , and create a dynamic between the open spaces and the darker corners .
also , on the first level , the floor is made of blackish-gray concrete and is slightly tilted , so when you move inside the building , you actually have quite a physical , special experience of working with or against the building .
and then there are funny elements in there - like a yellow balcony , which is a reference to hamsun 's novel " hunger , " or a wooden structure that symbolizes the empty violin case in " mysteries . "

organizers say the writer 's association with the nazi party will be explored in the exhibition . norwegian writer knut hamsun received the nobel prize for literature in 1920 for his epic , " growth of the soil . "
he is noted for laying the groundwork for the modern novel by developing literary styles of revealing the intricacies of the human psyche .
such techniques would find their way into works by franz kafka , james joyce and virginia wolf , to name just a few .
but hamsun was also an ardent advocate of the nazi party both before world war ii and after germany occupied norway in 1941 .
in 1943 , he sent his nobel prize to nazi propaganda minister joseph goebbels as a gift .
he later visited adolf hitler and after the nazi leader 's death , proclaimed in a may 1945 newspaper eulogy " he was a warrior , a warrior for mankind , and a prophet of the gospel of justice for all nations . "
despite his nazi association , many norwegians have renewed their respect for his literary greatness .
last year saw extensive festivities commemorating the author 's 150th birthday , peaking in the august opening of the knut hamsun center -lrb- hamsunsenteret -rrb- in hamoroy , north of the arctic circle , where the writer grew up .
the museum closed soon after , with organizers then beginning preparations of the exhibition that is to showcase hamsun 's literary talent , as well as his dark past , when the museum opens to the public on june 11th , 2010 .
deutsche welle spoke with bordil borset , director of the hamsunsenteret .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 150th anniversary of hamsun 's birth was celebrated last year deutsche welle : why was the museum built to honor the writer and nobel prize winner knut hamsun ?
bordil borset : he came here to hamoroy when he was three years old with this parents , stayed here as a child , and came back as a grown-up during different periods of his life .
and this area - nordland -lsb- province -rsb- and hamoroy are very important in his life and works .
the idea to build the museum came about in 1986 , but it was a long , complicated process before it was actually completed .
part of the problem was getting enough funding , but the long process also had to due with the controversy surrounding knut hamsun as a person and his sympathizing with the nazis before and during the second world war .
how has that controversy been played out ?
there have been a lot of restrictions about naming streets , places and monuments after hamsun in norway .
and if one considers the new museum to be a monument to knut hamsun , then the question is asked : " why would we build a monument to someone who has brought shame to norway ? "
and what 's your answer to that ?
the museum is built as a center for communicating and researching about knut hamsun 's life and literature , and it 's a museum for all aspects of the person , just like other museums devoted to writers .
what 's unique about this particular one is its architecture .
it 's designed by one of the world 's most famous architects , steven holl .
this is unique around the world , this combination - a museum devoted to a nobel prize-winning author , designed by an internationally famous architect as an interpretation of the writer 's work , literary figures and his life .
and all of it placed in this nordland landscape , with nature completely surrounding it , and which was so central in hamsun 's works .
how does the museum 's architecture reflect hamsun 's literary landscapes ?
steven holl 's idea with the building was to construct it as a human body , a figure which includes all the contradictions and themes found in hamsun 's literary characters in his novels " hunger , " " mysteries , " and so on .
the building is a place of contradictory forces - there are dark corners and big , open spaces , and labyrinths , and the changing light and seasons make it appear different each day .
it 's a complex building that is always changing , just like the psychology of hamsun 's early characters .
bildunterschrift : the exterior is supposed to represent a church tower what 's unique about hamsun 's literary works ?
he created a new way of describing the human psyche , which is quite close to what james joyce did in the early 20th century , except that knut hamsun did that 20 to 30 years before stream of consciousness or modernism or the modern novel .
he 's a predecessor of the modern novel in the 20th century .
and he invented some techniques of describing the human psyche , this new hyper-sensitivity toward the modern world .
and then his work opens up and he invents this gallery of characters .
when he wrote literature , he wrote on small pieces of paper - like sheets from a calendar - and spread them out , plotted them out in front of him , on his desk to invent this literary universe .
what is also unique is how he combines this hyper-sensitivity and complexity of characters with his love of nature and the inspiration he gleaned from that - all using his beautiful linguistic techniques .
how does that his keen sensitivity as a novelist jibe with his nazi affiliation ?
this is the big question and mystery of hamsun which has been haunting us for 50 , 60 , 70 years .
how can one of the world 's finest writers , someone who writes with such sensitivity about love , nature and the human psyche , take such a political stance as a person ?
i ca n't answer that .
it 's one of those contradictions of knut hamsun .
yes , he was one of the world 's greatest authors , and yes , he supported the terrible nazi regime , which we have absolutely no sympathy for .
did he ever offer an explanation for that ?
no .
after world war ii , he was fined a huge sum of money , which was to be paid to the norwegian state .
-lsb- editors ' note : he was to stand trial for treason , but was deemed mentally unfit due to his advanced age . -rsb-
but it could never be proved that hamsun was actually a member of the nazi party .
the subject is addressed again and again in biographies about him ; it 's a question that can not be answered .
just as his characters were complicated and contradictory , so was he .
that 's how human beings are .
there are lots of aspects about human beings that we ca n't explain .
how is hamsun 's nazi past addressed at the museum ?
in the exhibition , all aspects of hamsun 's life and literature are addressed and presented - everything from first editions of his works to the trial after world war ii .
we are also offering lectures , movies , debates , and conferences on the issue .
it will always be treated critically , and it has to be because there is no other way of learning how we are and how we behave today .
he can learn from hamsun 's life and actions and perhaps apply that to how we are today .
that 's what literature does to us , what makes it eternal , what makes it great .
the only way to handle the topic is to address it openly .
but i think there is a new generation of historians coming on stage now who are dealing with the war in a different way .
all last year , during the jubilee for hamsun 's 150th birthday , the political aspects of him were discussed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the interior is deliberately labyrinthine hamsun was actually just one of many nazi sympathizers , but because he was an important person , because he claimed to be one of the big , new norwegian writers - our national poet - , the disappointment , the betrayal people felt was all the greater .
it was a trauma for the norwegian people .
how could he do this ?
and why did he never apologize ?
or show remorse or regret after the war ?
please tell me more about the architecture of the museum .
when you enter the area around the museum , you see this big , black tower , which is reminiscent of old , wooden , norwegian churches .
but it also refers to a scene in one of hamsun 's novels .
then , on the top of the roof , you see bamboo , which is like a strange mix of hair and grass .
the building sort of leans to the side , and all this together makes it appear like a figure .
inside , it 's white , so you get this contrast of the black , wooden exterior and white , concrete interior .
in the middle of the building , there is this brass elevator .
if the building is a metaphor for the body , then this brass elevator is like the spine holding it all up ; it 's the core , the stable element .
but there are glass panels in it , so you can see the movements both inside and outside the elevator - like the nerves in the spine of human beings .
stephan holl has all these playful tricks and illusions inside the building that make it challenging , and create a dynamic between the open spaces and the darker corners .
also , on the first level , the floor is made of blackish-gray concrete and is slightly tilted , so when you move inside the building , you actually have quite a physical , special experience of working with or against the building .
and then there are funny elements in there - like a yellow balcony , which is a reference to hamsun 's novel " hunger , " or a wooden structure that symbolizes the empty violin case in " mysteries . "

the subject is addressed again and again in biographies about him ; it 's a question that can not be answered .
just as his characters were complicated and contradictory , so was he .
that 's how human beings are .
there are lots of aspects about human beings that we ca n't explain .
how is hamsun 's nazi past addressed at the museum ?
in the exhibition , all aspects of hamsun 's life and literature are addressed and presented - everything from first editions of his works to the trial after world war ii .
we are also offering lectures , movies , debates , and conferences on the issue .
it will always be treated critically , and it has to be because there is no other way of learning how we are and how we behave today .
he can learn from hamsun 's life and actions and perhaps apply that to how we are today .
that 's what literature does to us , what makes it eternal , what makes it great .
the only way to handle the topic is to address it openly .
but i think there is a new generation of historians coming on stage now who are dealing with the war in a different way .
all last year , during the jubilee for hamsun 's 150th birthday , the political aspects of him were discussed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the interior is deliberately labyrinthine hamsun was actually just one of many nazi sympathizers , but because he was an important person , because he claimed to be one of the big , new norwegian writers - our national poet - , the disappointment , the betrayal people felt was all the greater .
it was a trauma for the norwegian people .
how could he do this ?
and why did he never apologize ?
or show remorse or regret after the war ?
please tell me more about the architecture of the museum .
when you enter the area around the museum , you see this big , black tower , which is reminiscent of old , wooden , norwegian churches .
but it also refers to a scene in one of hamsun 's novels .
then , on the top of the roof , you see bamboo , which is like a strange mix of hair and grass .
the building sort of leans to the side , and all this together makes it appear like a figure .
inside , it 's white , so you get this contrast of the black , wooden exterior and white , concrete interior .
in the middle of the building , there is this brass elevator .
if the building is a metaphor for the body , then this brass elevator is like the spine holding it all up ; it 's the core , the stable element .
but there are glass panels in it , so you can see the movements both inside and outside the elevator - like the nerves in the spine of human beings .
stephan holl has all these playful tricks and illusions inside the building that make it challenging , and create a dynamic between the open spaces and the darker corners .
also , on the first level , the floor is made of blackish-gray concrete and is slightly tilted , so when you move inside the building , you actually have quite a physical , special experience of working with or against the building .
and then there are funny elements in there - like a yellow balcony , which is a reference to hamsun 's novel " hunger , " or a wooden structure that symbolizes the empty violin case in " mysteries . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de literature -pipe- 09.05.2010 norwegian museum reflects love-hate relationship with author hamsun großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamsunsenteret - the knut hamsun center - is architectural eye candy in the coming weeks , a museum dedicated to knut hamsun , one of norway 's most notable authors , is due to open to the public .
organizers say the writer 's association with the nazi party will be explored in the exhibition . norwegian writer knut hamsun received the nobel prize for literature in 1920 for his epic , " growth of the soil . "
he is noted for laying the groundwork for the modern novel by developing literary styles of revealing the intricacies of the human psyche .
such techniques would find their way into works by franz kafka , james joyce and virginia wolf , to name just a few .
but hamsun was also an ardent advocate of the nazi party both before world war ii and after germany occupied norway in 1941 .
in 1943 , he sent his nobel prize to nazi propaganda minister joseph goebbels as a gift .
he later visited adolf hitler and after the nazi leader 's death , proclaimed in a may 1945 newspaper eulogy " he was a warrior , a warrior for mankind , and a prophet of the gospel of justice for all nations . "
despite his nazi association , many norwegians have renewed their respect for his literary greatness .
last year saw extensive festivities commemorating the author 's 150th birthday , peaking in the august opening of the knut hamsun center -lrb- hamsunsenteret -rrb- in hamoroy , north of the arctic circle , where the writer grew up .
the museum closed soon after , with organizers then beginning preparations of the exhibition that is to showcase hamsun 's literary talent , as well as his dark past , when the museum opens to the public on june 11th , 2010 .
deutsche welle spoke with bordil borset , director of the hamsunsenteret .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 150th anniversary of hamsun 's birth was celebrated last year deutsche welle : why was the museum built to honor the writer and nobel prize winner knut hamsun ?
bordil borset : he came here to hamoroy when he was three years old with this parents , stayed here as a child , and came back as a grown-up during different periods of his life .
and this area - nordland -lsb- province -rsb- and hamoroy are very important in his life and works .
the idea to build the museum came about in 1986 , but it was a long , complicated process before it was actually completed .
part of the problem was getting enough funding , but the long process also had to due with the controversy surrounding knut hamsun as a person and his sympathizing with the nazis before and during the second world war .
how has that controversy been played out ?
there have been a lot of restrictions about naming streets , places and monuments after hamsun in norway .
and if one considers the new museum to be a monument to knut hamsun , then the question is asked : " why would we build a monument to someone who has brought shame to norway ? "
and what 's your answer to that ?
the museum is built as a center for communicating and researching about knut hamsun 's life and literature , and it 's a museum for all aspects of the person , just like other museums devoted to writers .
what 's unique about this particular one is its architecture .
it 's designed by one of the world 's most famous architects , steven holl .
this is unique around the world , this combination - a museum devoted to a nobel prize-winning author , designed by an internationally famous architect as an interpretation of the writer 's work , literary figures and his life .
and all of it placed in this nordland landscape , with nature completely surrounding it , and which was so central in hamsun 's works .
how does the museum 's architecture reflect hamsun 's literary landscapes ?
steven holl 's idea with the building was to construct it as a human body , a figure which includes all the contradictions and themes found in hamsun 's literary characters in his novels " hunger , " " mysteries , " and so on .
the building is a place of contradictory forces - there are dark corners and big , open spaces , and labyrinths , and the changing light and seasons make it appear different each day .
it 's a complex building that is always changing , just like the psychology of hamsun 's early characters .
bildunterschrift : the exterior is supposed to represent a church tower what 's unique about hamsun 's literary works ?
he created a new way of describing the human psyche , which is quite close to what james joyce did in the early 20th century , except that knut hamsun did that 20 to 30 years before stream of consciousness or modernism or the modern novel .
he 's a predecessor of the modern novel in the 20th century .
and he invented some techniques of describing the human psyche , this new hyper-sensitivity toward the modern world .
and then his work opens up and he invents this gallery of characters .
when he wrote literature , he wrote on small pieces of paper - like sheets from a calendar - and spread them out , plotted them out in front of him , on his desk to invent this literary universe .
what is also unique is how he combines this hyper-sensitivity and complexity of characters with his love of nature and the inspiration he gleaned from that - all using his beautiful linguistic techniques .
how does that his keen sensitivity as a novelist jibe with his nazi affiliation ?
this is the big question and mystery of hamsun which has been haunting us for 50 , 60 , 70 years .
how can one of the world 's finest writers , someone who writes with such sensitivity about love , nature and the human psyche , take such a political stance as a person ?
i ca n't answer that .
it 's one of those contradictions of knut hamsun .
yes , he was one of the world 's greatest authors , and yes , he supported the terrible nazi regime , which we have absolutely no sympathy for .
did he ever offer an explanation for that ?
no .
after world war ii , he was fined a huge sum of money , which was to be paid to the norwegian state .
-lsb- editors ' note : he was to stand trial for treason , but was deemed mentally unfit due to his advanced age . -rsb-
but it could never be proved that hamsun was actually a member of the nazi party .

eu finance ministers will meet on sunday to discuss the plan . european union leaders are working overtime to construct new crisis defense mechanisms to safeguard the euro currency and crack down on market speculation before the asian financial markets reopen on monday .
on sunday , european union finance ministers debated proposals to set up a 600 billion euro -lrb- $ 765 billion -rrb- rescue fund for member countries states that fall into financial trouble , said diplomats in brussels .
the package would consist funds raised by the eu 's executive , the european commission , loans from eurozone states ; and money from the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- , diplomats said .
german chancellor angela merkel was holding a crisis cabinet meeting in berlin late sunday , to deal with the consequences of a prospective rescue system being negotiated in brussels , officials said .
a clear signal " taking into account the exceptional circumstances , the european commission will propose a european stabilization mechanism to preserve financial stability in europe , " herman van rompuy , the president of the eu , said in a statement released in the early hours of saturday morning .

kuranyi could more than double his salary with the move to the 10th-ranked russian team . former germany striker kevin kuranyi said on his website on sunday that he was leaving schalke for a deal with russia 's dynamo moscow .
kuranyi was one of the bundesliga 's top scorers this season with 18 goals and schalke ended the season in second place , after bayern munich .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : saturday 's match was kuranyi 's last playing for schalke " after carefully weighing all the arguments and following several discussions , i have decided to transfer to russia with dynamo moscow , " kuranyi wrote in a " letter to his fans . "
" i always said that the whole package must be right .
i have this feeling with dynamo .
one aspect is certainly the financial one , " he said .
the 28-year-old will leave on a free transfer on july 1 and is said to have signed a three-year contract paying more than 6 million euros -lrb- $ 7.6 million -rrb- per season .
that more than doubles his current salary .
despite a slow start in the russian season and a current rank of 10th in their league , dynamo should n't be underestimated , kuranyi said .
dynamo has won 11 national titles , although the most recent victory was in 1976 .

on sunday , european union finance ministers debated proposals to set up a 600 billion euro -lrb- $ 765 billion -rrb- rescue fund for member countries states that fall into financial trouble , said diplomats in brussels .
the package would consist funds raised by the eu 's executive , the european commission , loans from eurozone states ; and money from the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- , diplomats said .

the unprecedented greek bailout is due to be transferred to athens within days .
greeks oppose cuts the emergency summit in brussels coincided with ceremonies to commemorate the end of world war ii in europe , forcing some european leaders to cancel their plans to attend the events .

the long-planned talks had suffered a setback due to new israeli settlement plans . after a long hiatus and much prodding by the new us administration , israelis and palestinians have begun indirect peace negotiations .
" the proximity talks have started , " chief palestinian negotiator saeb erakat told reporters on sunday in the west bank city of ramallah after a meeting between palestinian president mahmud abbas and us envoy george mitchell .
" today , on may 9 , the negotiations have begun at the level of the president -lrb- abbas -rrb- and -lrb- israeli prime minister benjamin -rrb- netanyahu , " he added , while stressing there would be no direct contact between the parties .
" there are no negotiations between us and the israeli government , " he said .
" the discussions will be held with mitchell and the americans and they will mediate between the two sides . "
the fact that both parties could n't agree to face-to-face meetings , but instead will only participate in " proximity " talks , shows the deep rift between israelis and palestinians on the issue .
in proximity talks , the involved parties do n't meet and discuss problems directly , but rely on an intermediary to conduct the negotiations . " indirect negotiations are an invention of henry kissinger , " explains shlomo ben-ami , a former israeli foreign minister , who was a key negotiator in the israeli-palestinian talks in camp david in 2000 and taba in 2001 .
kissinger , in the wake of the 1973 yom kippur war , resorted to what has since then been called shuttle diplomacy to negotiate between the syrians , the israelis and the egyptians .
since that time it has become an established mechanism to try to mediate between parties in long-standing conflicts .
" that 's ok , but if you do not reach at a certain point direct negotiations it is useless , " said ben-ami in an interview with deutsche welle .
" there is no way they can reach an agreement through a third party . "
indirect talks as best option while direct talks between israelis and palestinians are ultimately necessary to hammer out a peace deal , at this point indirect talks are probably a better option , said álvaro de soto , who headed negotiations that ended the civil war in el salvador and served as un special coordinator for the middle east peace process until 2007 .
he said the format of proximity talks is actually a good choice for the middle east , especially in the current hostile climate between both parties .
bildunterschrift : israeli-palestinian peace efforts have a bad track record " and i think that altogether too much of a production has been made about direct talks .
proximity talks have the advantage in this case of placing a much greater responsibility on the mediator , the mediator being the united states . "
both experts agree that aside from the us there is no other actor that would be acceptable to both parties .
the palestinians know that only washington has real influence and can bring israel to agree to a peace deal .
the israelis believe that they can trust only washington not to betray them and their crucial interests as a mediator . key role for washington while it has been pretty much commonly accepted that only washington can mediate this conflict , there is at the same time concern that the us , because of its close ties with israel , ca n't really act as an honest broker .
" i am convinced that only the us can play this role and i do n't set too much store by the objection that the us has a bias in this matter , " said de soto .
" the us role , it seems to me , is unavoidable and indispensible and i am very pleased that the us is at the center . "
that , however , does n't guarantee that this round of talks , which are slated to last four months , will be any more successful than all the previous attempts to achieve a breakthrough on the israeli-palestinian issue .
" if these people get an agreement they will deserve a nobel peace prize in physics , " said ben-ami .
difficult circumstances he believes that the underlying conditions for both israelis and palestinians are so negative , that it will be practically impossible for them to overcome .
palestinian president mahmoud abbas ' authority is challenged by hamas while israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu 's ability to agree to a deal is limited through the coalition with his hard-line foreign minister avigdor lieberman .
de soto adds that no viable agreement is possible if hamas is n't somehow included in the peace process .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israel angered the us and palestinians by announcing new settlements however , the slim chances for success also have a positive side .
" low expectations is what any mediator wants at the start of a mediation , i can tell you that from a professional 's standpoint , " said de soto , who believes that us middle east envoy george mitchell is exactly the right person for this mission impossible .
how exactly george mitchell will carry out this shuttle diplomacy neither of the experts could say .
" actually , it 's not a bad thing that little is known about what 's going on in a given peace process , " says de soto .
" negotiations , and peace negotiations in particular , are like very delicate , exotic orchids .
if you expose them to inclement weather they might wilt . "

the long-planned talks had suffered a setback due to new israeli settlement plans . after a long hiatus and much prodding by the new us administration , israelis and palestinians have begun indirect peace negotiations .
" the proximity talks have started , " chief palestinian negotiator saeb erakat told reporters on sunday in the west bank city of ramallah after a meeting between palestinian president mahmud abbas and us envoy george mitchell .
" today , on may 9 , the negotiations have begun at the level of the president -lrb- abbas -rrb- and -lrb- israeli prime minister benjamin -rrb- netanyahu , " he added , while stressing there would be no direct contact between the parties .
" there are no negotiations between us and the israeli government , " he said .
" the discussions will be held with mitchell and the americans and they will mediate between the two sides . "
the fact that both parties could n't agree to face-to-face meetings , but instead will only participate in " proximity " talks , shows the deep rift between israelis and palestinians on the issue .
in proximity talks , the involved parties do n't meet and discuss problems directly , but rely on an intermediary to conduct the negotiations . " indirect negotiations are an invention of henry kissinger , " explains shlomo ben-ami , a former israeli foreign minister , who was a key negotiator in the israeli-palestinian talks in camp david in 2000 and taba in 2001 .
kissinger , in the wake of the 1973 yom kippur war , resorted to what has since then been called shuttle diplomacy to negotiate between the syrians , the israelis and the egyptians .
since that time it has become an established mechanism to try to mediate between parties in long-standing conflicts .
" that 's ok , but if you do not reach at a certain point direct negotiations it is useless , " said ben-ami in an interview with deutsche welle .
" there is no way they can reach an agreement through a third party . "
indirect talks as best option while direct talks between israelis and palestinians are ultimately necessary to hammer out a peace deal , at this point indirect talks are probably a better option , said álvaro de soto , who headed negotiations that ended the civil war in el salvador and served as un special coordinator for the middle east peace process until 2007 .
he said the format of proximity talks is actually a good choice for the middle east , especially in the current hostile climate between both parties .
bildunterschrift : israeli-palestinian peace efforts have a bad track record " and i think that altogether too much of a production has been made about direct talks .
proximity talks have the advantage in this case of placing a much greater responsibility on the mediator , the mediator being the united states . "
both experts agree that aside from the us there is no other actor that would be acceptable to both parties .
the palestinians know that only washington has real influence and can bring israel to agree to a peace deal .
the israelis believe that they can trust only washington not to betray them and their crucial interests as a mediator . key role for washington while it has been pretty much commonly accepted that only washington can mediate this conflict , there is at the same time concern that the us , because of its close ties with israel , ca n't really act as an honest broker .
" i am convinced that only the us can play this role and i do n't set too much store by the objection that the us has a bias in this matter , " said de soto .
" the us role , it seems to me , is unavoidable and indispensible and i am very pleased that the us is at the center . "
that , however , does n't guarantee that this round of talks , which are slated to last four months , will be any more successful than all the previous attempts to achieve a breakthrough on the israeli-palestinian issue .
" if these people get an agreement they will deserve a nobel peace prize in physics , " said ben-ami .
difficult circumstances he believes that the underlying conditions for both israelis and palestinians are so negative , that it will be practically impossible for them to overcome .
palestinian president mahmoud abbas ' authority is challenged by hamas while israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu 's ability to agree to a deal is limited through the coalition with his hard-line foreign minister avigdor lieberman .
de soto adds that no viable agreement is possible if hamas is n't somehow included in the peace process .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israel angered the us and palestinians by announcing new settlements however , the slim chances for success also have a positive side .
" low expectations is what any mediator wants at the start of a mediation , i can tell you that from a professional 's standpoint , " said de soto , who believes that us middle east envoy george mitchell is exactly the right person for this mission impossible .
how exactly george mitchell will carry out this shuttle diplomacy neither of the experts could say .
" actually , it 's not a bad thing that little is known about what 's going on in a given peace process , " says de soto .
" negotiations , and peace negotiations in particular , are like very delicate , exotic orchids .
if you expose them to inclement weather they might wilt . "

the vote is seen as a test for chancellor angela merkel ’ s federal government and polls suggest the ruling coalition is in trouble . polling stations in the german state of north rhine-westphalia -lrb- nrw -rrb- opened sunday morning in a state election widely seen as a referendum on chancellor angela merkel 's six-month-old government .
merkel 's conservative christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and coalition partner the free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- must hold onto power in germany 's most populous state in order to maintain a majority in the upper house of parliament , the bundesrat .
a defeat for the parties in the state , where they have also ruled in a center-right coalition since 2005 , would end their majority and lead to delays in delivering tax cuts and implementing other policies agreed to after last september 's federal election .
recent opinion polls suggest the cdu and the fdp lack the necessary support needed to maintain their majority .
the election comes just days after the german parliament approved a 22.4-billion-euro -lrb- $ 28.6 billion -rrb- emergency bailout for debt-stricken greece , a move that has proved deeply unpopular with voters .
in a poll published on saturday , 21 percent of nrw voters said the greek bailout would affect their ballot decision , according to the yougov survey for german daily bild .
spd looks to regain control " the issue has electrified people as seldom before and is going to play a determining role in the election , " said klaus-peter schoeppner , head of the polling institute emnid , in the online edition of the rheinische post .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spd leader hannelore kraft hopes to regain control of the state the rival social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , who held power for four decades until being ousted in 2005 , are looking to regain control in the influential state , home to 13.5 million eligible voters .
the spd abstained in friday 's vote on the greek aid package , a tactical move that analysts say could give them the edge .
current polls suggest that the spd and their preferred partners , the greens , have the support of between 45 and 47 percent of voters .
current predictions estimate the cdu-fdp block winning 43 to 45 percent of the vote .
" if the cdu loses its majority with the fdp , which is to be expected , it would not be a catastrophe but it would certainly make things more complicated and difficult for the chancellor , " said gerd langguth , a political scientist at the university of bonn and biographer of merkel. cmk / afp / reuters editor : kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the unprecedented greek bailout is due to be transferred to athens within days .
greeks oppose cuts the emergency summit in brussels coincided with ceremonies to commemorate the end of world war ii in europe , forcing some european leaders to cancel their plans to attend the events .

kuranyi could more than double his salary with the move to the 10th-ranked russian team . former germany striker kevin kuranyi said on his website on sunday that he was leaving schalke for a deal with russia 's dynamo moscow .
kuranyi was one of the bundesliga 's top scorers this season with 18 goals and schalke ended the season in second place , after bayern munich .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : saturday 's match was kuranyi 's last playing for schalke " after carefully weighing all the arguments and following several discussions , i have decided to transfer to russia with dynamo moscow , " kuranyi wrote in a " letter to his fans . "
" i always said that the whole package must be right .
i have this feeling with dynamo .
one aspect is certainly the financial one , " he said .
the 28-year-old will leave on a free transfer on july 1 and is said to have signed a three-year contract paying more than 6 million euros -lrb- $ 7.6 million -rrb- per season .
that more than doubles his current salary .
despite a slow start in the russian season and a current rank of 10th in their league , dynamo should n't be underestimated , kuranyi said .
dynamo has won 11 national titles , although the most recent victory was in 1976 .
no spot on the national team despite a successful league season , kuranyi was not chosen for germany 's national squad for the world cup in south africa this june .
national coach joachim loew kicked him off the team after he walked out on the team during a world cup qualifier in october 2008 after being left off that day 's line-up .
at the time loew said he would never ask him to play again and resisted pressure to include him on the world cup team. hf / afp / dpa editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

kuranyi could more than double his salary with the move to the 10th-ranked russian team . former germany striker kevin kuranyi said on his website on sunday that he was leaving schalke for a deal with russia 's dynamo moscow .
kuranyi was one of the bundesliga 's top scorers this season with 18 goals and schalke ended the season in second place , after bayern munich .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : saturday 's match was kuranyi 's last playing for schalke " after carefully weighing all the arguments and following several discussions , i have decided to transfer to russia with dynamo moscow , " kuranyi wrote in a " letter to his fans . "
" i always said that the whole package must be right .
i have this feeling with dynamo .
one aspect is certainly the financial one , " he said .
the 28-year-old will leave on a free transfer on july 1 and is said to have signed a three-year contract paying more than 6 million euros -lrb- $ 7.6 million -rrb- per season .
that more than doubles his current salary .
despite a slow start in the russian season and a current rank of 10th in their league , dynamo should n't be underestimated , kuranyi said .
dynamo has won 11 national titles , although the most recent victory was in 1976 .
no spot on the national team despite a successful league season , kuranyi was not chosen for germany 's national squad for the world cup in south africa this june .
national coach joachim loew kicked him off the team after he walked out on the team during a world cup qualifier in october 2008 after being left off that day 's line-up .
at the time loew said he would never ask him to play again and resisted pressure to include him on the world cup team. hf / afp / dpa editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de elections -pipe- 09.05.2010 voting underway in crucial german state election großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the vote in north rhine-westphalia will also be decisive for the ruling coaltion in berlin germans are casting ballots on sunday in the country 's most populous state .
the vote is seen as a test for chancellor angela merkel ’ s federal government and polls suggest the ruling coalition is in trouble . polling stations in the german state of north rhine-westphalia -lrb- nrw -rrb- opened sunday morning in a state election widely seen as a referendum on chancellor angela merkel 's six-month-old government .
merkel 's conservative christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and coalition partner the free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- must hold onto power in germany 's most populous state in order to maintain a majority in the upper house of parliament , the bundesrat .
a defeat for the parties in the state , where they have also ruled in a center-right coalition since 2005 , would end their majority and lead to delays in delivering tax cuts and implementing other policies agreed to after last september 's federal election .
recent opinion polls suggest the cdu and the fdp lack the necessary support needed to maintain their majority .
the election comes just days after the german parliament approved a 22.4-billion-euro -lrb- $ 28.6 billion -rrb- emergency bailout for debt-stricken greece , a move that has proved deeply unpopular with voters .
in a poll published on saturday , 21 percent of nrw voters said the greek bailout would affect their ballot decision , according to the yougov survey for german daily bild .
spd looks to regain control " the issue has electrified people as seldom before and is going to play a determining role in the election , " said klaus-peter schoeppner , head of the polling institute emnid , in the online edition of the rheinische post .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spd leader hannelore kraft hopes to regain control of the state the rival social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , who held power for four decades until being ousted in 2005 , are looking to regain control in the influential state , home to 13.5 million eligible voters .
the spd abstained in friday 's vote on the greek aid package , a tactical move that analysts say could give them the edge .
current polls suggest that the spd and their preferred partners , the greens , have the support of between 45 and 47 percent of voters .
current predictions estimate the cdu-fdp block winning 43 to 45 percent of the vote .
" if the cdu loses its majority with the fdp , which is to be expected , it would not be a catastrophe but it would certainly make things more complicated and difficult for the chancellor , " said gerd langguth , a political scientist at the university of bonn and biographer of merkel. cmk / afp / reuters editor : kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de left party leader prepares to make history in crucial state election on may 9 , voters in north rhine-westphalia will go to the polls to elect a new parliament .
so far , no party has a clear majority , but a small socialist party with roots in east germany has opposition leaders worried .
-lrb- 07.05.2010 -rrb- crucial state vote a test for merkel 's government on the eve of elections in the western german state of north rhine-westphalia , focus has shifted to how the vote is a litmus test for the policies of chancellor angela merkel 's federal coalition government .
-lrb- 08.05.2010 -rrb- majority unlikely in key german state election according to a recent poll , the major parties contesting in may 's state election in north rhine-westphalia are unlikely to win a majority .

it was also the first time that nato forces participated . foreign troops from four nato member states marched on moscow 's red square for the first time on sunday as part of a parade marking the 65th anniversary of the end of world war ii .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian military jets fly in formation over red square on sunday around 1,000 troops from britain , france , poland and the united states took part in the military parade , alongside some 10,000 members of the russian army and soldiers from ex-soviet countries armenia , belarus , kazakhstan , kyrgyzstan , moldova , tajikistan , turkmenistan and ukraine .
" sixty-five years ago , nazism was defeated and a machine that was exterminating whole peoples was halted , " russian president dmitry medvedev said in his speech .
" there was one choice – either victory or to become slaves .
the war made us a strong nation . "
german chancellor angela merkel arrived in moscow on saturday to take part in the commemoration , joining medvedev , chinese president hu jintao and around two dozen other world leaders at the military parade .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british military personnel marching in the the largest-ever post-soviet military parade french president nicolas sarkozy and italian prime minister silvio berlusconi pulled out of the event to instead concentrate on the european financial crisis .
in an interview with the russian itar-tass news agency , merkel said the invitation to the victory celebration was a great honor .
she said the gesture showed that russia and germany had learned from history and could live in peace and friendship .

they were angry that nato troops had been given permission to march on the square , home to the embalmed body of their revolutionary hero , vladimir lenin .
" foreign troops have never appeared on red square .
it 's a violation of tradition , " said sergei obukhov , a member of the party 's central committee .
" the presence of foreign troops with weapons in their hands is ... an unnecessary reminder that we lost the cold war . "
mine explosion the celebrations were overshadowed by two methane gas explosions at a coal mine in the siberian region of kemerova , which hours earlier killed at least 12 people , injured dozens and trapped more than 80 miners and rescuers .
the first explosion occurred late saturday night , with the second following a few hours later as a rescue operation was underway .
renewed rescue operations continue , but the high concentration of methane gas poses a risk of further explosions .
russian prime minister vladimir putin described the situation as " difficult " and " tragic " and urged authorities to do everything possible to rescue those still trapped underground. cmk / afp / dpa / reuters editor : kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he was unable to take part in an emergency meeting on europe 's debt crisis . schaeuble 's spokesman , michael offer , described schaeuble as " conscious " and " doing well under the circumstances " in a statement .
he also said it was suspected that the allergic reaction had been caused by a medication that schaeuble had taken for the first time on saturday .
schaeuble 's absence from the critical european union talks forced berlin to fly interior minister thomas de maiziere to brussels to take his place .
when he arrived in the belgian capital , de maiziere said he had spoken to schaeuble and that he was " so well now that he presented to me his line of negotiation " on the question of how to shore of the euro .
schaeuble has been confined to a wheelchair since he was shot in the back by a mentally unstable man at a campaign event in 1990 .
he underwent a routine operation in april , from which he has reportedly not entirely recovered. hf / afp / dpa editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the vote is seen as a test for chancellor angela merkel ’ s federal government and polls suggest the ruling coalition is in trouble . polling stations in the german state of north rhine-westphalia -lrb- nrw -rrb- opened sunday morning in a state election widely seen as a referendum on chancellor angela merkel 's six-month-old government .
merkel 's conservative christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and coalition partner the free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- must hold onto power in germany 's most populous state in order to maintain a majority in the upper house of parliament , the bundesrat .
a defeat for the parties in the state , where they have also ruled in a center-right coalition since 2005 , would end their majority and lead to delays in delivering tax cuts and implementing other policies agreed to after last september 's federal election .
recent opinion polls suggest the cdu and the fdp lack the necessary support needed to maintain their majority .
the election comes just days after the german parliament approved a 22.4-billion-euro -lrb- $ 28.6 billion -rrb- emergency bailout for debt-stricken greece , a move that has proved deeply unpopular with voters .
in a poll published on saturday , 21 percent of nrw voters said the greek bailout would affect their ballot decision , according to the yougov survey for german daily bild .

kuranyi could more than double his salary with the move to the 10th-ranked russian team . former germany striker kevin kuranyi said on his website on sunday that he was leaving schalke for a deal with russia 's dynamo moscow .
kuranyi was one of the bundesliga 's top scorers this season with 18 goals and schalke ended the season in second place , after bayern munich .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : saturday 's match was kuranyi 's last playing for schalke " after carefully weighing all the arguments and following several discussions , i have decided to transfer to russia with dynamo moscow , " kuranyi wrote in a " letter to his fans . "
" i always said that the whole package must be right .
i have this feeling with dynamo .
one aspect is certainly the financial one , " he said .
the 28-year-old will leave on a free transfer on july 1 and is said to have signed a three-year contract paying more than 6 million euros -lrb- $ 7.6 million -rrb- per season .
that more than doubles his current salary .
despite a slow start in the russian season and a current rank of 10th in their league , dynamo should n't be underestimated , kuranyi said .
dynamo has won 11 national titles , although the most recent victory was in 1976 .
no spot on the national team despite a successful league season , kuranyi was not chosen for germany 's national squad for the world cup in south africa this june .
national coach joachim loew kicked him off the team after he walked out on the team during a world cup qualifier in october 2008 after being left off that day 's line-up .
at the time loew said he would never ask him to play again and resisted pressure to include him on the world cup team. hf / afp / dpa editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de elections -pipe- 09.05.2010 voting underway in crucial german state election großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the vote in north rhine-westphalia will also be decisive for the ruling coaltion in berlin germans are casting ballots on sunday in the country 's most populous state .
the vote is seen as a test for chancellor angela merkel ’ s federal government and polls suggest the ruling coalition is in trouble . polling stations in the german state of north rhine-westphalia -lrb- nrw -rrb- opened sunday morning in a state election widely seen as a referendum on chancellor angela merkel 's six-month-old government .
merkel 's conservative christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and coalition partner the free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- must hold onto power in germany 's most populous state in order to maintain a majority in the upper house of parliament , the bundesrat .
a defeat for the parties in the state , where they have also ruled in a center-right coalition since 2005 , would end their majority and lead to delays in delivering tax cuts and implementing other policies agreed to after last september 's federal election .
recent opinion polls suggest the cdu and the fdp lack the necessary support needed to maintain their majority .
the election comes just days after the german parliament approved a 22.4-billion-euro -lrb- $ 28.6 billion -rrb- emergency bailout for debt-stricken greece , a move that has proved deeply unpopular with voters .
in a poll published on saturday , 21 percent of nrw voters said the greek bailout would affect their ballot decision , according to the yougov survey for german daily bild .
spd looks to regain control " the issue has electrified people as seldom before and is going to play a determining role in the election , " said klaus-peter schoeppner , head of the polling institute emnid , in the online edition of the rheinische post .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spd leader hannelore kraft hopes to regain control of the state the rival social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , who held power for four decades until being ousted in 2005 , are looking to regain control in the influential state , home to 13.5 million eligible voters .
the spd abstained in friday 's vote on the greek aid package , a tactical move that analysts say could give them the edge .
current polls suggest that the spd and their preferred partners , the greens , have the support of between 45 and 47 percent of voters .
current predictions estimate the cdu-fdp block winning 43 to 45 percent of the vote .
" if the cdu loses its majority with the fdp , which is to be expected , it would not be a catastrophe but it would certainly make things more complicated and difficult for the chancellor , " said gerd langguth , a political scientist at the university of bonn and biographer of merkel. cmk / afp / reuters editor : kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de left party leader prepares to make history in crucial state election on may 9 , voters in north rhine-westphalia will go to the polls to elect a new parliament .
so far , no party has a clear majority , but a small socialist party with roots in east germany has opposition leaders worried .
-lrb- 07.05.2010 -rrb- crucial state vote a test for merkel 's government on the eve of elections in the western german state of north rhine-westphalia , focus has shifted to how the vote is a litmus test for the policies of chancellor angela merkel 's federal coalition government .

the vote is seen as a test for chancellor angela merkel ’ s federal government and polls suggest the ruling coalition is in trouble . polling stations in the german state of north rhine-westphalia -lrb- nrw -rrb- opened sunday morning in a state election widely seen as a referendum on chancellor angela merkel 's six-month-old government .
merkel 's conservative christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and coalition partner the free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- must hold onto power in germany 's most populous state in order to maintain a majority in the upper house of parliament , the bundesrat .
a defeat for the parties in the state , where they have also ruled in a center-right coalition since 2005 , would end their majority and lead to delays in delivering tax cuts and implementing other policies agreed to after last september 's federal election .
recent opinion polls suggest the cdu and the fdp lack the necessary support needed to maintain their majority .
the election comes just days after the german parliament approved a 22.4-billion-euro -lrb- $ 28.6 billion -rrb- emergency bailout for debt-stricken greece , a move that has proved deeply unpopular with voters .
in a poll published on saturday , 21 percent of nrw voters said the greek bailout would affect their ballot decision , according to the yougov survey for german daily bild .
spd looks to regain control " the issue has electrified people as seldom before and is going to play a determining role in the election , " said klaus-peter schoeppner , head of the polling institute emnid , in the online edition of the rheinische post .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spd leader hannelore kraft hopes to regain control of the state the rival social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , who held power for four decades until being ousted in 2005 , are looking to regain control in the influential state , home to 13.5 million eligible voters .
the spd abstained in friday 's vote on the greek aid package , a tactical move that analysts say could give them the edge .
current polls suggest that the spd and their preferred partners , the greens , have the support of between 45 and 47 percent of voters .
current predictions estimate the cdu-fdp block winning 43 to 45 percent of the vote .
" if the cdu loses its majority with the fdp , which is to be expected , it would not be a catastrophe but it would certainly make things more complicated and difficult for the chancellor , " said gerd langguth , a political scientist at the university of bonn and biographer of merkel. cmk / afp / reuters editor : kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

eu finance ministers will meet on sunday to discuss the plan . european union leaders are working overtime to construct new crisis defense mechanisms to safeguard the euro currency and crack down on market speculation before the asian financial markets reopen on monday .
on sunday , european union finance ministers debated proposals to set up a 600 billion euro -lrb- $ 765 billion -rrb- rescue fund for member countries states that fall into financial trouble , said diplomats in brussels .
the package would consist funds raised by the eu 's executive , the european commission , loans from eurozone states ; and money from the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- , diplomats said .
german chancellor angela merkel was holding a crisis cabinet meeting in berlin late sunday , to deal with the consequences of a prospective rescue system being negotiated in brussels , officials said .
a clear signal " taking into account the exceptional circumstances , the european commission will propose a european stabilization mechanism to preserve financial stability in europe , " herman van rompuy , the president of the eu , said in a statement released in the early hours of saturday morning .

despite the 110 billion euro bailout , financial markets reacted negatively to the continued uncertainty , prompting eu leaders to consider new steps to prevent similar financial chaos from spreading to other member states .
the unprecedented greek bailout is due to be transferred to athens within days .
greeks oppose cuts the emergency summit in brussels coincided with ceremonies to commemorate the end of world war ii in europe , forcing some european leaders to cancel their plans to attend the events .

the long-planned talks had suffered a setback due to new israeli settlement plans . after a long hiatus and much prodding by the new us administration , israelis and palestinians have begun indirect peace negotiations .
" the proximity talks have started , " chief palestinian negotiator saeb erakat told reporters on sunday in the west bank city of ramallah after a meeting between palestinian president mahmud abbas and us envoy george mitchell .
" today , on may 9 , the negotiations have begun at the level of the president -lrb- abbas -rrb- and -lrb- israeli prime minister benjamin -rrb- netanyahu , " he added , while stressing there would be no direct contact between the parties .
" there are no negotiations between us and the israeli government , " he said .
" the discussions will be held with mitchell and the americans and they will mediate between the two sides . "
the fact that both parties could n't agree to face-to-face meetings , but instead will only participate in " proximity " talks , shows the deep rift between israelis and palestinians on the issue .
in proximity talks , the involved parties do n't meet and discuss problems directly , but rely on an intermediary to conduct the negotiations . " indirect negotiations are an invention of henry kissinger , " explains shlomo ben-ami , a former israeli foreign minister , who was a key negotiator in the israeli-palestinian talks in camp david in 2000 and taba in 2001 .
kissinger , in the wake of the 1973 yom kippur war , resorted to what has since then been called shuttle diplomacy to negotiate between the syrians , the israelis and the egyptians .
since that time it has become an established mechanism to try to mediate between parties in long-standing conflicts .
" that 's ok , but if you do not reach at a certain point direct negotiations it is useless , " said ben-ami in an interview with deutsche welle .
" there is no way they can reach an agreement through a third party . "
indirect talks as best option while direct talks between israelis and palestinians are ultimately necessary to hammer out a peace deal , at this point indirect talks are probably a better option , said álvaro de soto , who headed negotiations that ended the civil war in el salvador and served as un special coordinator for the middle east peace process until 2007 .
he said the format of proximity talks is actually a good choice for the middle east , especially in the current hostile climate between both parties .
bildunterschrift : israeli-palestinian peace efforts have a bad track record " and i think that altogether too much of a production has been made about direct talks .
proximity talks have the advantage in this case of placing a much greater responsibility on the mediator , the mediator being the united states . "
both experts agree that aside from the us there is no other actor that would be acceptable to both parties .
the palestinians know that only washington has real influence and can bring israel to agree to a peace deal .
the israelis believe that they can trust only washington not to betray them and their crucial interests as a mediator . key role for washington while it has been pretty much commonly accepted that only washington can mediate this conflict , there is at the same time concern that the us , because of its close ties with israel , ca n't really act as an honest broker .
" i am convinced that only the us can play this role and i do n't set too much store by the objection that the us has a bias in this matter , " said de soto .
" the us role , it seems to me , is unavoidable and indispensible and i am very pleased that the us is at the center . "
that , however , does n't guarantee that this round of talks , which are slated to last four months , will be any more successful than all the previous attempts to achieve a breakthrough on the israeli-palestinian issue .
" if these people get an agreement they will deserve a nobel peace prize in physics , " said ben-ami .
difficult circumstances he believes that the underlying conditions for both israelis and palestinians are so negative , that it will be practically impossible for them to overcome .
palestinian president mahmoud abbas ' authority is challenged by hamas while israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu 's ability to agree to a deal is limited through the coalition with his hard-line foreign minister avigdor lieberman .
de soto adds that no viable agreement is possible if hamas is n't somehow included in the peace process .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israel angered the us and palestinians by announcing new settlements however , the slim chances for success also have a positive side .
" low expectations is what any mediator wants at the start of a mediation , i can tell you that from a professional 's standpoint , " said de soto , who believes that us middle east envoy george mitchell is exactly the right person for this mission impossible .
how exactly george mitchell will carry out this shuttle diplomacy neither of the experts could say .
" actually , it 's not a bad thing that little is known about what 's going on in a given peace process , " says de soto .
" negotiations , and peace negotiations in particular , are like very delicate , exotic orchids .
if you expose them to inclement weather they might wilt . "

the long-planned talks had suffered a setback due to new israeli settlement plans . after a long hiatus and much prodding by the new us administration , israelis and palestinians have begun indirect peace negotiations .
" the proximity talks have started , " chief palestinian negotiator saeb erakat told reporters on sunday in the west bank city of ramallah after a meeting between palestinian president mahmud abbas and us envoy george mitchell .
" today , on may 9 , the negotiations have begun at the level of the president -lrb- abbas -rrb- and -lrb- israeli prime minister benjamin -rrb- netanyahu , " he added , while stressing there would be no direct contact between the parties .
" there are no negotiations between us and the israeli government , " he said .
" the discussions will be held with mitchell and the americans and they will mediate between the two sides . "
the fact that both parties could n't agree to face-to-face meetings , but instead will only participate in " proximity " talks , shows the deep rift between israelis and palestinians on the issue .
in proximity talks , the involved parties do n't meet and discuss problems directly , but rely on an intermediary to conduct the negotiations . " indirect negotiations are an invention of henry kissinger , " explains shlomo ben-ami , a former israeli foreign minister , who was a key negotiator in the israeli-palestinian talks in camp david in 2000 and taba in 2001 .
kissinger , in the wake of the 1973 yom kippur war , resorted to what has since then been called shuttle diplomacy to negotiate between the syrians , the israelis and the egyptians .
since that time it has become an established mechanism to try to mediate between parties in long-standing conflicts .
" that 's ok , but if you do not reach at a certain point direct negotiations it is useless , " said ben-ami in an interview with deutsche welle .
" there is no way they can reach an agreement through a third party . "
indirect talks as best option while direct talks between israelis and palestinians are ultimately necessary to hammer out a peace deal , at this point indirect talks are probably a better option , said álvaro de soto , who headed negotiations that ended the civil war in el salvador and served as un special coordinator for the middle east peace process until 2007 .
he said the format of proximity talks is actually a good choice for the middle east , especially in the current hostile climate between both parties .

" indirect negotiations are an invention of henry kissinger , " explains shlomo ben-ami , a former israeli foreign minister , who was a key negotiator in the israeli-palestinian talks in camp david in 2000 and taba in 2001 .
kissinger , in the wake of the 1973 yom kippur war , resorted to what has since then been called shuttle diplomacy to negotiate between the syrians , the israelis and the egyptians .
since that time it has become an established mechanism to try to mediate between parties in long-standing conflicts .
" that 's ok , but if you do not reach at a certain point direct negotiations it is useless , " said ben-ami in an interview with deutsche welle .
" there is no way they can reach an agreement through a third party . "
indirect talks as best option while direct talks between israelis and palestinians are ultimately necessary to hammer out a peace deal , at this point indirect talks are probably a better option , said álvaro de soto , who headed negotiations that ended the civil war in el salvador and served as un special coordinator for the middle east peace process until 2007 .
he said the format of proximity talks is actually a good choice for the middle east , especially in the current hostile climate between both parties .

" i am convinced that only the us can play this role and i do n't set too much store by the objection that the us has a bias in this matter , " said de soto .
" the us role , it seems to me , is unavoidable and indispensible and i am very pleased that the us is at the center . "

" if these people get an agreement they will deserve a nobel peace prize in physics , " said ben-ami .
difficult circumstances he believes that the underlying conditions for both israelis and palestinians are so negative , that it will be practically impossible for them to overcome .
palestinian president mahmoud abbas ' authority is challenged by hamas while israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu 's ability to agree to a deal is limited through the coalition with his hard-line foreign minister avigdor lieberman .

the long-planned talks had suffered a setback due to new israeli settlement plans . after a long hiatus and much prodding by the new us administration , israelis and palestinians have begun indirect peace negotiations .
" the proximity talks have started , " chief palestinian negotiator saeb erakat told reporters on sunday in the west bank city of ramallah after a meeting between palestinian president mahmud abbas and us envoy george mitchell .
" today , on may 9 , the negotiations have begun at the level of the president -lrb- abbas -rrb- and -lrb- israeli prime minister benjamin -rrb- netanyahu , " he added , while stressing there would be no direct contact between the parties .
" there are no negotiations between us and the israeli government , " he said .
" the discussions will be held with mitchell and the americans and they will mediate between the two sides . "
the fact that both parties could n't agree to face-to-face meetings , but instead will only participate in " proximity " talks , shows the deep rift between israelis and palestinians on the issue .
in proximity talks , the involved parties do n't meet and discuss problems directly , but rely on an intermediary to conduct the negotiations . " indirect negotiations are an invention of henry kissinger , " explains shlomo ben-ami , a former israeli foreign minister , who was a key negotiator in the israeli-palestinian talks in camp david in 2000 and taba in 2001 .
kissinger , in the wake of the 1973 yom kippur war , resorted to what has since then been called shuttle diplomacy to negotiate between the syrians , the israelis and the egyptians .
since that time it has become an established mechanism to try to mediate between parties in long-standing conflicts .
" that 's ok , but if you do not reach at a certain point direct negotiations it is useless , " said ben-ami in an interview with deutsche welle .
" there is no way they can reach an agreement through a third party . "
indirect talks as best option while direct talks between israelis and palestinians are ultimately necessary to hammer out a peace deal , at this point indirect talks are probably a better option , said álvaro de soto , who headed negotiations that ended the civil war in el salvador and served as un special coordinator for the middle east peace process until 2007 .
he said the format of proximity talks is actually a good choice for the middle east , especially in the current hostile climate between both parties .
bildunterschrift : israeli-palestinian peace efforts have a bad track record " and i think that altogether too much of a production has been made about direct talks .
proximity talks have the advantage in this case of placing a much greater responsibility on the mediator , the mediator being the united states . "
both experts agree that aside from the us there is no other actor that would be acceptable to both parties .
the palestinians know that only washington has real influence and can bring israel to agree to a peace deal .
the israelis believe that they can trust only washington not to betray them and their crucial interests as a mediator . key role for washington while it has been pretty much commonly accepted that only washington can mediate this conflict , there is at the same time concern that the us , because of its close ties with israel , ca n't really act as an honest broker .
" i am convinced that only the us can play this role and i do n't set too much store by the objection that the us has a bias in this matter , " said de soto .
" the us role , it seems to me , is unavoidable and indispensible and i am very pleased that the us is at the center . "
that , however , does n't guarantee that this round of talks , which are slated to last four months , will be any more successful than all the previous attempts to achieve a breakthrough on the israeli-palestinian issue .
" if these people get an agreement they will deserve a nobel peace prize in physics , " said ben-ami .
difficult circumstances he believes that the underlying conditions for both israelis and palestinians are so negative , that it will be practically impossible for them to overcome .
palestinian president mahmoud abbas ' authority is challenged by hamas while israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu 's ability to agree to a deal is limited through the coalition with his hard-line foreign minister avigdor lieberman .
de soto adds that no viable agreement is possible if hamas is n't somehow included in the peace process .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israel angered the us and palestinians by announcing new settlements however , the slim chances for success also have a positive side .
" low expectations is what any mediator wants at the start of a mediation , i can tell you that from a professional 's standpoint , " said de soto , who believes that us middle east envoy george mitchell is exactly the right person for this mission impossible .
how exactly george mitchell will carry out this shuttle diplomacy neither of the experts could say .
" actually , it 's not a bad thing that little is known about what 's going on in a given peace process , " says de soto .
" negotiations , and peace negotiations in particular , are like very delicate , exotic orchids .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de middle east -pipe- 09.05.2010 us-backed mideast ' proximity talks ' underway but expectations are low großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israelis and palestinians hope that george mitchell can lead them toward a peace deal indirect peace talks between israelis and palestinians are underway , however there is skepticism on both sides regarding the outcome .
the long-planned talks had suffered a setback due to new israeli settlement plans . after a long hiatus and much prodding by the new us administration , israelis and palestinians have begun indirect peace negotiations .
" the proximity talks have started , " chief palestinian negotiator saeb erakat told reporters on sunday in the west bank city of ramallah after a meeting between palestinian president mahmud abbas and us envoy george mitchell .
" today , on may 9 , the negotiations have begun at the level of the president -lrb- abbas -rrb- and -lrb- israeli prime minister benjamin -rrb- netanyahu , " he added , while stressing there would be no direct contact between the parties .
" there are no negotiations between us and the israeli government , " he said .
" the discussions will be held with mitchell and the americans and they will mediate between the two sides . "
the fact that both parties could n't agree to face-to-face meetings , but instead will only participate in " proximity " talks , shows the deep rift between israelis and palestinians on the issue .
in proximity talks , the involved parties do n't meet and discuss problems directly , but rely on an intermediary to conduct the negotiations . " indirect negotiations are an invention of henry kissinger , " explains shlomo ben-ami , a former israeli foreign minister , who was a key negotiator in the israeli-palestinian talks in camp david in 2000 and taba in 2001 .
kissinger , in the wake of the 1973 yom kippur war , resorted to what has since then been called shuttle diplomacy to negotiate between the syrians , the israelis and the egyptians .
since that time it has become an established mechanism to try to mediate between parties in long-standing conflicts .
" that 's ok , but if you do not reach at a certain point direct negotiations it is useless , " said ben-ami in an interview with deutsche welle .
" there is no way they can reach an agreement through a third party . "
indirect talks as best option while direct talks between israelis and palestinians are ultimately necessary to hammer out a peace deal , at this point indirect talks are probably a better option , said álvaro de soto , who headed negotiations that ended the civil war in el salvador and served as un special coordinator for the middle east peace process until 2007 .
he said the format of proximity talks is actually a good choice for the middle east , especially in the current hostile climate between both parties .
bildunterschrift : israeli-palestinian peace efforts have a bad track record " and i think that altogether too much of a production has been made about direct talks .
proximity talks have the advantage in this case of placing a much greater responsibility on the mediator , the mediator being the united states . "
both experts agree that aside from the us there is no other actor that would be acceptable to both parties .
the palestinians know that only washington has real influence and can bring israel to agree to a peace deal .
the israelis believe that they can trust only washington not to betray them and their crucial interests as a mediator . key role for washington while it has been pretty much commonly accepted that only washington can mediate this conflict , there is at the same time concern that the us , because of its close ties with israel , ca n't really act as an honest broker .
" i am convinced that only the us can play this role and i do n't set too much store by the objection that the us has a bias in this matter , " said de soto .
" the us role , it seems to me , is unavoidable and indispensible and i am very pleased that the us is at the center . "
that , however , does n't guarantee that this round of talks , which are slated to last four months , will be any more successful than all the previous attempts to achieve a breakthrough on the israeli-palestinian issue .
" if these people get an agreement they will deserve a nobel peace prize in physics , " said ben-ami .
difficult circumstances he believes that the underlying conditions for both israelis and palestinians are so negative , that it will be practically impossible for them to overcome .
palestinian president mahmoud abbas ' authority is challenged by hamas while israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu 's ability to agree to a deal is limited through the coalition with his hard-line foreign minister avigdor lieberman .
de soto adds that no viable agreement is possible if hamas is n't somehow included in the peace process .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israel angered the us and palestinians by announcing new settlements however , the slim chances for success also have a positive side .
" low expectations is what any mediator wants at the start of a mediation , i can tell you that from a professional 's standpoint , " said de soto , who believes that us middle east envoy george mitchell is exactly the right person for this mission impossible .
how exactly george mitchell will carry out this shuttle diplomacy neither of the experts could say .
" actually , it 's not a bad thing that little is known about what 's going on in a given peace process , " says de soto .
" negotiations , and peace negotiations in particular , are like very delicate , exotic orchids .
if you expose them to inclement weather they might wilt . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de literature -pipe- 09.05.2010 norwegian museum reflects love-hate relationship with author hamsun großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamsunsenteret - the knut hamsun center - is architectural eye candy in the coming weeks , a museum dedicated to knut hamsun , one of norway 's most notable authors , is due to open to the public .
organizers say the writer 's association with the nazi party will be explored in the exhibition . norwegian writer knut hamsun received the nobel prize for literature in 1920 for his epic , " growth of the soil . "
he is noted for laying the groundwork for the modern novel by developing literary styles of revealing the intricacies of the human psyche .
such techniques would find their way into works by franz kafka , james joyce and virginia wolf , to name just a few .
but hamsun was also an ardent advocate of the nazi party both before world war ii and after germany occupied norway in 1941 .
in 1943 , he sent his nobel prize to nazi propaganda minister joseph goebbels as a gift .
he later visited adolf hitler and after the nazi leader 's death , proclaimed in a may 1945 newspaper eulogy " he was a warrior , a warrior for mankind , and a prophet of the gospel of justice for all nations . "
despite his nazi association , many norwegians have renewed their respect for his literary greatness .
last year saw extensive festivities commemorating the author 's 150th birthday , peaking in the august opening of the knut hamsun center -lrb- hamsunsenteret -rrb- in hamoroy , north of the arctic circle , where the writer grew up .
the museum closed soon after , with organizers then beginning preparations of the exhibition that is to showcase hamsun 's literary talent , as well as his dark past , when the museum opens to the public on june 11th , 2010 .
deutsche welle spoke with bordil borset , director of the hamsunsenteret .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 150th anniversary of hamsun 's birth was celebrated last year deutsche welle : why was the museum built to honor the writer and nobel prize winner knut hamsun ?
bordil borset : he came here to hamoroy when he was three years old with this parents , stayed here as a child , and came back as a grown-up during different periods of his life .
and this area - nordland -lsb- province -rsb- and hamoroy are very important in his life and works .
the idea to build the museum came about in 1986 , but it was a long , complicated process before it was actually completed .
part of the problem was getting enough funding , but the long process also had to due with the controversy surrounding knut hamsun as a person and his sympathizing with the nazis before and during the second world war .
how has that controversy been played out ?
there have been a lot of restrictions about naming streets , places and monuments after hamsun in norway .
and if one considers the new museum to be a monument to knut hamsun , then the question is asked : " why would we build a monument to someone who has brought shame to norway ? "
and what 's your answer to that ?
the museum is built as a center for communicating and researching about knut hamsun 's life and literature , and it 's a museum for all aspects of the person , just like other museums devoted to writers .
what 's unique about this particular one is its architecture .
it 's designed by one of the world 's most famous architects , steven holl .
this is unique around the world , this combination - a museum devoted to a nobel prize-winning author , designed by an internationally famous architect as an interpretation of the writer 's work , literary figures and his life .
and all of it placed in this nordland landscape , with nature completely surrounding it , and which was so central in hamsun 's works .
how does the museum 's architecture reflect hamsun 's literary landscapes ?
steven holl 's idea with the building was to construct it as a human body , a figure which includes all the contradictions and themes found in hamsun 's literary characters in his novels " hunger , " " mysteries , " and so on .
the building is a place of contradictory forces - there are dark corners and big , open spaces , and labyrinths , and the changing light and seasons make it appear different each day .
it 's a complex building that is always changing , just like the psychology of hamsun 's early characters .
bildunterschrift : the exterior is supposed to represent a church tower what 's unique about hamsun 's literary works ?
he created a new way of describing the human psyche , which is quite close to what james joyce did in the early 20th century , except that knut hamsun did that 20 to 30 years before stream of consciousness or modernism or the modern novel .
he 's a predecessor of the modern novel in the 20th century .
and he invented some techniques of describing the human psyche , this new hyper-sensitivity toward the modern world .
and then his work opens up and he invents this gallery of characters .
when he wrote literature , he wrote on small pieces of paper - like sheets from a calendar - and spread them out , plotted them out in front of him , on his desk to invent this literary universe .
what is also unique is how he combines this hyper-sensitivity and complexity of characters with his love of nature and the inspiration he gleaned from that - all using his beautiful linguistic techniques .
how does that his keen sensitivity as a novelist jibe with his nazi affiliation ?
this is the big question and mystery of hamsun which has been haunting us for 50 , 60 , 70 years .
how can one of the world 's finest writers , someone who writes with such sensitivity about love , nature and the human psyche , take such a political stance as a person ?
i ca n't answer that .
it 's one of those contradictions of knut hamsun .
yes , he was one of the world 's greatest authors , and yes , he supported the terrible nazi regime , which we have absolutely no sympathy for .
did he ever offer an explanation for that ?
no .
after world war ii , he was fined a huge sum of money , which was to be paid to the norwegian state .
-lsb- editors ' note : he was to stand trial for treason , but was deemed mentally unfit due to his advanced age . -rsb-
but it could never be proved that hamsun was actually a member of the nazi party .
the subject is addressed again and again in biographies about him ; it 's a question that can not be answered .
just as his characters were complicated and contradictory , so was he .
that 's how human beings are .
there are lots of aspects about human beings that we ca n't explain .
how is hamsun 's nazi past addressed at the museum ?
in the exhibition , all aspects of hamsun 's life and literature are addressed and presented - everything from first editions of his works to the trial after world war ii .
we are also offering lectures , movies , debates , and conferences on the issue .
it will always be treated critically , and it has to be because there is no other way of learning how we are and how we behave today .
he can learn from hamsun 's life and actions and perhaps apply that to how we are today .
that 's what literature does to us , what makes it eternal , what makes it great .
the only way to handle the topic is to address it openly .
but i think there is a new generation of historians coming on stage now who are dealing with the war in a different way .
all last year , during the jubilee for hamsun 's 150th birthday , the political aspects of him were discussed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the interior is deliberately labyrinthine hamsun was actually just one of many nazi sympathizers , but because he was an important person , because he claimed to be one of the big , new norwegian writers - our national poet - , the disappointment , the betrayal people felt was all the greater .
it was a trauma for the norwegian people .
how could he do this ?
and why did he never apologize ?
or show remorse or regret after the war ?
please tell me more about the architecture of the museum .
when you enter the area around the museum , you see this big , black tower , which is reminiscent of old , wooden , norwegian churches .
but it also refers to a scene in one of hamsun 's novels .
then , on the top of the roof , you see bamboo , which is like a strange mix of hair and grass .
the building sort of leans to the side , and all this together makes it appear like a figure .
inside , it 's white , so you get this contrast of the black , wooden exterior and white , concrete interior .
in the middle of the building , there is this brass elevator .
if the building is a metaphor for the body , then this brass elevator is like the spine holding it all up ; it 's the core , the stable element .
but there are glass panels in it , so you can see the movements both inside and outside the elevator - like the nerves in the spine of human beings .
stephan holl has all these playful tricks and illusions inside the building that make it challenging , and create a dynamic between the open spaces and the darker corners .
also , on the first level , the floor is made of blackish-gray concrete and is slightly tilted , so when you move inside the building , you actually have quite a physical , special experience of working with or against the building .
and then there are funny elements in there - like a yellow balcony , which is a reference to hamsun 's novel " hunger , " or a wooden structure that symbolizes the empty violin case in " mysteries . "

it 's designed by one of the world 's most famous architects , steven holl .
this is unique around the world , this combination - a museum devoted to a nobel prize-winning author , designed by an internationally famous architect as an interpretation of the writer 's work , literary figures and his life .
and all of it placed in this nordland landscape , with nature completely surrounding it , and which was so central in hamsun 's works .
how does the museum 's architecture reflect hamsun 's literary landscapes ?
steven holl 's idea with the building was to construct it as a human body , a figure which includes all the contradictions and themes found in hamsun 's literary characters in his novels " hunger , " " mysteries , " and so on .
the building is a place of contradictory forces - there are dark corners and big , open spaces , and labyrinths , and the changing light and seasons make it appear different each day .
it 's a complex building that is always changing , just like the psychology of hamsun 's early characters .
bildunterschrift : the exterior is supposed to represent a church tower what 's unique about hamsun 's literary works ?
he created a new way of describing the human psyche , which is quite close to what james joyce did in the early 20th century , except that knut hamsun did that 20 to 30 years before stream of consciousness or modernism or the modern novel .
he 's a predecessor of the modern novel in the 20th century .
and he invented some techniques of describing the human psyche , this new hyper-sensitivity toward the modern world .
and then his work opens up and he invents this gallery of characters .
when he wrote literature , he wrote on small pieces of paper - like sheets from a calendar - and spread them out , plotted them out in front of him , on his desk to invent this literary universe .
what is also unique is how he combines this hyper-sensitivity and complexity of characters with his love of nature and the inspiration he gleaned from that - all using his beautiful linguistic techniques .
how does that his keen sensitivity as a novelist jibe with his nazi affiliation ?
this is the big question and mystery of hamsun which has been haunting us for 50 , 60 , 70 years .
how can one of the world 's finest writers , someone who writes with such sensitivity about love , nature and the human psyche , take such a political stance as a person ?
i ca n't answer that .
it 's one of those contradictions of knut hamsun .
yes , he was one of the world 's greatest authors , and yes , he supported the terrible nazi regime , which we have absolutely no sympathy for .
did he ever offer an explanation for that ?
no .
after world war ii , he was fined a huge sum of money , which was to be paid to the norwegian state .
-lsb- editors ' note : he was to stand trial for treason , but was deemed mentally unfit due to his advanced age . -rsb-
but it could never be proved that hamsun was actually a member of the nazi party .
the subject is addressed again and again in biographies about him ; it 's a question that can not be answered .
just as his characters were complicated and contradictory , so was he .
that 's how human beings are .
there are lots of aspects about human beings that we ca n't explain .
how is hamsun 's nazi past addressed at the museum ?
in the exhibition , all aspects of hamsun 's life and literature are addressed and presented - everything from first editions of his works to the trial after world war ii .
we are also offering lectures , movies , debates , and conferences on the issue .
it will always be treated critically , and it has to be because there is no other way of learning how we are and how we behave today .
he can learn from hamsun 's life and actions and perhaps apply that to how we are today .
that 's what literature does to us , what makes it eternal , what makes it great .
the only way to handle the topic is to address it openly .
but i think there is a new generation of historians coming on stage now who are dealing with the war in a different way .
all last year , during the jubilee for hamsun 's 150th birthday , the political aspects of him were discussed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the interior is deliberately labyrinthine hamsun was actually just one of many nazi sympathizers , but because he was an important person , because he claimed to be one of the big , new norwegian writers - our national poet - , the disappointment , the betrayal people felt was all the greater .
it was a trauma for the norwegian people .
how could he do this ?
and why did he never apologize ?
or show remorse or regret after the war ?
please tell me more about the architecture of the museum .
when you enter the area around the museum , you see this big , black tower , which is reminiscent of old , wooden , norwegian churches .
but it also refers to a scene in one of hamsun 's novels .
then , on the top of the roof , you see bamboo , which is like a strange mix of hair and grass .
the building sort of leans to the side , and all this together makes it appear like a figure .
inside , it 's white , so you get this contrast of the black , wooden exterior and white , concrete interior .
in the middle of the building , there is this brass elevator .
if the building is a metaphor for the body , then this brass elevator is like the spine holding it all up ; it 's the core , the stable element .
but there are glass panels in it , so you can see the movements both inside and outside the elevator - like the nerves in the spine of human beings .
stephan holl has all these playful tricks and illusions inside the building that make it challenging , and create a dynamic between the open spaces and the darker corners .
also , on the first level , the floor is made of blackish-gray concrete and is slightly tilted , so when you move inside the building , you actually have quite a physical , special experience of working with or against the building .
and then there are funny elements in there - like a yellow balcony , which is a reference to hamsun 's novel " hunger , " or a wooden structure that symbolizes the empty violin case in " mysteries . "

organizers say the writer 's association with the nazi party will be explored in the exhibition . norwegian writer knut hamsun received the nobel prize for literature in 1920 for his epic , " growth of the soil . "
he is noted for laying the groundwork for the modern novel by developing literary styles of revealing the intricacies of the human psyche .
such techniques would find their way into works by franz kafka , james joyce and virginia wolf , to name just a few .
but hamsun was also an ardent advocate of the nazi party both before world war ii and after germany occupied norway in 1941 .
in 1943 , he sent his nobel prize to nazi propaganda minister joseph goebbels as a gift .
he later visited adolf hitler and after the nazi leader 's death , proclaimed in a may 1945 newspaper eulogy " he was a warrior , a warrior for mankind , and a prophet of the gospel of justice for all nations . "
despite his nazi association , many norwegians have renewed their respect for his literary greatness .
last year saw extensive festivities commemorating the author 's 150th birthday , peaking in the august opening of the knut hamsun center -lrb- hamsunsenteret -rrb- in hamoroy , north of the arctic circle , where the writer grew up .
the museum closed soon after , with organizers then beginning preparations of the exhibition that is to showcase hamsun 's literary talent , as well as his dark past , when the museum opens to the public on june 11th , 2010 .
deutsche welle spoke with bordil borset , director of the hamsunsenteret .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 150th anniversary of hamsun 's birth was celebrated last year deutsche welle : why was the museum built to honor the writer and nobel prize winner knut hamsun ?
bordil borset : he came here to hamoroy when he was three years old with this parents , stayed here as a child , and came back as a grown-up during different periods of his life .
and this area - nordland -lsb- province -rsb- and hamoroy are very important in his life and works .
the idea to build the museum came about in 1986 , but it was a long , complicated process before it was actually completed .
part of the problem was getting enough funding , but the long process also had to due with the controversy surrounding knut hamsun as a person and his sympathizing with the nazis before and during the second world war .
how has that controversy been played out ?
there have been a lot of restrictions about naming streets , places and monuments after hamsun in norway .
and if one considers the new museum to be a monument to knut hamsun , then the question is asked : " why would we build a monument to someone who has brought shame to norway ? "
and what 's your answer to that ?
the museum is built as a center for communicating and researching about knut hamsun 's life and literature , and it 's a museum for all aspects of the person , just like other museums devoted to writers .
what 's unique about this particular one is its architecture .

organizers say the writer 's association with the nazi party will be explored in the exhibition . norwegian writer knut hamsun received the nobel prize for literature in 1920 for his epic , " growth of the soil . "
he is noted for laying the groundwork for the modern novel by developing literary styles of revealing the intricacies of the human psyche .
such techniques would find their way into works by franz kafka , james joyce and virginia wolf , to name just a few .
but hamsun was also an ardent advocate of the nazi party both before world war ii and after germany occupied norway in 1941 .
in 1943 , he sent his nobel prize to nazi propaganda minister joseph goebbels as a gift .
he later visited adolf hitler and after the nazi leader 's death , proclaimed in a may 1945 newspaper eulogy " he was a warrior , a warrior for mankind , and a prophet of the gospel of justice for all nations . "
despite his nazi association , many norwegians have renewed their respect for his literary greatness .
last year saw extensive festivities commemorating the author 's 150th birthday , peaking in the august opening of the knut hamsun center -lrb- hamsunsenteret -rrb- in hamoroy , north of the arctic circle , where the writer grew up .
the museum closed soon after , with organizers then beginning preparations of the exhibition that is to showcase hamsun 's literary talent , as well as his dark past , when the museum opens to the public on june 11th , 2010 .
deutsche welle spoke with bordil borset , director of the hamsunsenteret .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 150th anniversary of hamsun 's birth was celebrated last year deutsche welle : why was the museum built to honor the writer and nobel prize winner knut hamsun ?
bordil borset : he came here to hamoroy when he was three years old with this parents , stayed here as a child , and came back as a grown-up during different periods of his life .
and this area - nordland -lsb- province -rsb- and hamoroy are very important in his life and works .
the idea to build the museum came about in 1986 , but it was a long , complicated process before it was actually completed .
part of the problem was getting enough funding , but the long process also had to due with the controversy surrounding knut hamsun as a person and his sympathizing with the nazis before and during the second world war .
how has that controversy been played out ?
there have been a lot of restrictions about naming streets , places and monuments after hamsun in norway .
and if one considers the new museum to be a monument to knut hamsun , then the question is asked : " why would we build a monument to someone who has brought shame to norway ? "
and what 's your answer to that ?
the museum is built as a center for communicating and researching about knut hamsun 's life and literature , and it 's a museum for all aspects of the person , just like other museums devoted to writers .
what 's unique about this particular one is its architecture .
it 's designed by one of the world 's most famous architects , steven holl .
this is unique around the world , this combination - a museum devoted to a nobel prize-winning author , designed by an internationally famous architect as an interpretation of the writer 's work , literary figures and his life .
and all of it placed in this nordland landscape , with nature completely surrounding it , and which was so central in hamsun 's works .
how does the museum 's architecture reflect hamsun 's literary landscapes ?
steven holl 's idea with the building was to construct it as a human body , a figure which includes all the contradictions and themes found in hamsun 's literary characters in his novels " hunger , " " mysteries , " and so on .
the building is a place of contradictory forces - there are dark corners and big , open spaces , and labyrinths , and the changing light and seasons make it appear different each day .
it 's a complex building that is always changing , just like the psychology of hamsun 's early characters .
bildunterschrift : the exterior is supposed to represent a church tower what 's unique about hamsun 's literary works ?
he created a new way of describing the human psyche , which is quite close to what james joyce did in the early 20th century , except that knut hamsun did that 20 to 30 years before stream of consciousness or modernism or the modern novel .
he 's a predecessor of the modern novel in the 20th century .
and he invented some techniques of describing the human psyche , this new hyper-sensitivity toward the modern world .
and then his work opens up and he invents this gallery of characters .
when he wrote literature , he wrote on small pieces of paper - like sheets from a calendar - and spread them out , plotted them out in front of him , on his desk to invent this literary universe .
what is also unique is how he combines this hyper-sensitivity and complexity of characters with his love of nature and the inspiration he gleaned from that - all using his beautiful linguistic techniques .
how does that his keen sensitivity as a novelist jibe with his nazi affiliation ?
this is the big question and mystery of hamsun which has been haunting us for 50 , 60 , 70 years .
how can one of the world 's finest writers , someone who writes with such sensitivity about love , nature and the human psyche , take such a political stance as a person ?
i ca n't answer that .
it 's one of those contradictions of knut hamsun .
yes , he was one of the world 's greatest authors , and yes , he supported the terrible nazi regime , which we have absolutely no sympathy for .
did he ever offer an explanation for that ?
no .
after world war ii , he was fined a huge sum of money , which was to be paid to the norwegian state .
-lsb- editors ' note : he was to stand trial for treason , but was deemed mentally unfit due to his advanced age . -rsb-
but it could never be proved that hamsun was actually a member of the nazi party .
the subject is addressed again and again in biographies about him ; it 's a question that can not be answered .
just as his characters were complicated and contradictory , so was he .
that 's how human beings are .
there are lots of aspects about human beings that we ca n't explain .
how is hamsun 's nazi past addressed at the museum ?
in the exhibition , all aspects of hamsun 's life and literature are addressed and presented - everything from first editions of his works to the trial after world war ii .
we are also offering lectures , movies , debates , and conferences on the issue .
it will always be treated critically , and it has to be because there is no other way of learning how we are and how we behave today .
he can learn from hamsun 's life and actions and perhaps apply that to how we are today .
that 's what literature does to us , what makes it eternal , what makes it great .
the only way to handle the topic is to address it openly .
but i think there is a new generation of historians coming on stage now who are dealing with the war in a different way .
all last year , during the jubilee for hamsun 's 150th birthday , the political aspects of him were discussed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the interior is deliberately labyrinthine hamsun was actually just one of many nazi sympathizers , but because he was an important person , because he claimed to be one of the big , new norwegian writers - our national poet - , the disappointment , the betrayal people felt was all the greater .
it was a trauma for the norwegian people .
how could he do this ?
and why did he never apologize ?
or show remorse or regret after the war ?
please tell me more about the architecture of the museum .
when you enter the area around the museum , you see this big , black tower , which is reminiscent of old , wooden , norwegian churches .
but it also refers to a scene in one of hamsun 's novels .
then , on the top of the roof , you see bamboo , which is like a strange mix of hair and grass .
the building sort of leans to the side , and all this together makes it appear like a figure .
inside , it 's white , so you get this contrast of the black , wooden exterior and white , concrete interior .
in the middle of the building , there is this brass elevator .
if the building is a metaphor for the body , then this brass elevator is like the spine holding it all up ; it 's the core , the stable element .
but there are glass panels in it , so you can see the movements both inside and outside the elevator - like the nerves in the spine of human beings .
stephan holl has all these playful tricks and illusions inside the building that make it challenging , and create a dynamic between the open spaces and the darker corners .
also , on the first level , the floor is made of blackish-gray concrete and is slightly tilted , so when you move inside the building , you actually have quite a physical , special experience of working with or against the building .
and then there are funny elements in there - like a yellow balcony , which is a reference to hamsun 's novel " hunger , " or a wooden structure that symbolizes the empty violin case in " mysteries . "

when he wrote literature , he wrote on small pieces of paper - like sheets from a calendar - and spread them out , plotted them out in front of him , on his desk to invent this literary universe .
what is also unique is how he combines this hyper-sensitivity and complexity of characters with his love of nature and the inspiration he gleaned from that - all using his beautiful linguistic techniques .
how does that his keen sensitivity as a novelist jibe with his nazi affiliation ?
this is the big question and mystery of hamsun which has been haunting us for 50 , 60 , 70 years .
how can one of the world 's finest writers , someone who writes with such sensitivity about love , nature and the human psyche , take such a political stance as a person ?
i ca n't answer that .
it 's one of those contradictions of knut hamsun .
yes , he was one of the world 's greatest authors , and yes , he supported the terrible nazi regime , which we have absolutely no sympathy for .
did he ever offer an explanation for that ?
no .
after world war ii , he was fined a huge sum of money , which was to be paid to the norwegian state .
-lsb- editors ' note : he was to stand trial for treason , but was deemed mentally unfit due to his advanced age . -rsb-
but it could never be proved that hamsun was actually a member of the nazi party .
the subject is addressed again and again in biographies about him ; it 's a question that can not be answered .
just as his characters were complicated and contradictory , so was he .
that 's how human beings are .
there are lots of aspects about human beings that we ca n't explain .
how is hamsun 's nazi past addressed at the museum ?
in the exhibition , all aspects of hamsun 's life and literature are addressed and presented - everything from first editions of his works to the trial after world war ii .
we are also offering lectures , movies , debates , and conferences on the issue .
it will always be treated critically , and it has to be because there is no other way of learning how we are and how we behave today .
he can learn from hamsun 's life and actions and perhaps apply that to how we are today .
that 's what literature does to us , what makes it eternal , what makes it great .
the only way to handle the topic is to address it openly .
but i think there is a new generation of historians coming on stage now who are dealing with the war in a different way .
all last year , during the jubilee for hamsun 's 150th birthday , the political aspects of him were discussed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the interior is deliberately labyrinthine hamsun was actually just one of many nazi sympathizers , but because he was an important person , because he claimed to be one of the big , new norwegian writers - our national poet - , the disappointment , the betrayal people felt was all the greater .
it was a trauma for the norwegian people .
how could he do this ?
and why did he never apologize ?
or show remorse or regret after the war ?
please tell me more about the architecture of the museum .
when you enter the area around the museum , you see this big , black tower , which is reminiscent of old , wooden , norwegian churches .
but it also refers to a scene in one of hamsun 's novels .
then , on the top of the roof , you see bamboo , which is like a strange mix of hair and grass .
the building sort of leans to the side , and all this together makes it appear like a figure .
inside , it 's white , so you get this contrast of the black , wooden exterior and white , concrete interior .
in the middle of the building , there is this brass elevator .
if the building is a metaphor for the body , then this brass elevator is like the spine holding it all up ; it 's the core , the stable element .
but there are glass panels in it , so you can see the movements both inside and outside the elevator - like the nerves in the spine of human beings .
stephan holl has all these playful tricks and illusions inside the building that make it challenging , and create a dynamic between the open spaces and the darker corners .
also , on the first level , the floor is made of blackish-gray concrete and is slightly tilted , so when you move inside the building , you actually have quite a physical , special experience of working with or against the building .
and then there are funny elements in there - like a yellow balcony , which is a reference to hamsun 's novel " hunger , " or a wooden structure that symbolizes the empty violin case in " mysteries . "
