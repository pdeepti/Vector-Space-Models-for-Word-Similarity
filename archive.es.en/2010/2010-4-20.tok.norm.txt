but early signs of disaster , like increasingly saline groundwater and dwindling freshwater reserves , are already visible . last fall , island nations made a dramatic appeal to industrialized countries : " my country is on the verge of being submerged , " emanuel mori , the president of micronesia , told representatives of the european union at the time .
he demanded that western countries finally rethink their climate policies .
island states like micronesia have been hit particularly hard by global warming , primarily through rising sea levels .
there are real fears that the country could disappear from the world map in the not-too-distant future .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rising water levels are threatening micronesia 's coastlines the signs of the looming disaster are already there : rising sea levels have mixed salt water with the groundwater in several areas .
that , in turn , is shrinking drinking water reserves and making it harder to irrigate agricultural land .
the high level of salinity has poisoned the ground and made it infertile for years .
" it 's a particularly tough situation for small island nations , " juergen kropp of the potsdam institute of climate impact research said .
he added that these nations already had limited groundwater reserves .
island states not the only ones affected but it 's not just places like micronesia that are grappling with the problem of increasing salinity in the groundwater .
many other regions with long coastlines , for instance the gaza strip , are faced with similar problems .
the gaza strip is one of the most crowded places in the world , and that dense population puts great pressure on the region 's water supply .
experts say it is another important cause of saline groundwater .
" sea water can only intrude in places where water has been drained previously , " kropp said .
if groundwater turns saline , he said , it shows that more groundwater was used than can be replaced .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more demand for water can lead to rising salinity in groundwater philip magiera of the state-funded gtz development organization in germany said there are two ways to tackle the issue - either by increasing the existing water supply , or by limiting demand for it .
" i 'm a big fan of water efficiency , " magiera said .
there are lots of examples of how water usage can be reduced , he said , particularly in the agricultural sector .
in many regions , up to 70 percent of the groundwater is used to irrigate fields .
but with systems such as drip irrigation , it 's possible to save large quantities of water .
water wastage a major problem often , a lot of water is simply wasted on the way to the end consumer .
many countries struggle with leaky piping systems .
in such cases , experts say , it makes more sense to first fix the leaks before more water is pumped into the system .
" even in households , there are often possibilities to save water , " magiera said .
effective use of water can also be achieved through economic measures such as regulating water prices .
if all water-saving measures are exhausted , then increasing fresh water reserves is the only option .
if water can not be imported , then the sea water must be desalinated .
" technically , that 's not a problem anymore today , " said kropp .
sea water desalination is practiced in countries such as israel or saudi arabia .
the united arab emirates are almost entirely dependent on desalinated sea water .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the uae meets its needs for freshwater through desalination plants but one of the problems that can crop up is that desalination plants are highly energy-intensive .
and that energy is largely achieved in the middle east by burning fossil-based fuel .
that releases carbon dioxide into the atmosphere and in turn accelerates climate change .
traditional solutions desalination plants have been set up in places like micronesia .
but these are mostly small plants with very low capacities .
bigger installations are too expensive .
and there 's a lack of energy reserves to power them .
magiera said that in this case , the answer would be to turn to traditional measures - such as harvesting rainwater - instead of high-tech solutions .

but analysts are still cautious about its prospects . at a press conference on monday , nato secretary general anders rasmussen spoke about what he believed was the most serious security threat faced by europe .
" there is a growing missile threat , including from iran , " he said .
" and the politicians have a responsibility to protect the population . "
europe must " take its share in the joint protection from missile attacks . "
as far as nato is concerned , any hope of creating a missile defense system for europe rests on the cooperation of russia . moscow has persistently voiced its opposition to missile installations in eastern europe that it believes could be used as offensive weapons .
to this end , rasmussen has been working to bring nato and russia together to discuss the possibility .
speaking during a recent visit to london , nato spokesman james appathurai told reporters , " russia should be included in a missile defense system which covers europe . "
he said plans for a " new security architecture " should be " one roof which includes the russians as part of the same security family . "
the attempted cooperation has apparently met with some success .
at least one newspaper , the british independent , reported that secret talks had already begun between washington and moscow on the subject , though no further details were reported .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nmds are much more expensive than close range tmds the end of the george w. bush presidency certainly opened the door to a rapprochement between russia and the west , a process that has culminated in the recent signing of the nuclear disarmament strategic arms reduction treaty -lrb- start -rrb- treaty in prague .
many analysts were impressed at the speed with which president barack obama managed to instil enough trust in opposite number dmitry medvedev to bring him to a disarmament agreement .
just a start but many experts are still concerned whether obama 's so-called ' reset ' policy will be enough to allay russian concerns about a european missile shield .
margarete klein , senior associate at the german institute for international and security affairs -lrb- swp -rrb- , believes the former superpower enemies are still locked in a catch-22 stand-off .
" the crux of the problem is that such a defense shield would create a lot of trust between russia and nato , but would require a lot of trust in the first place , " she told deutsche welle .
but klein emphasized that there was a real willingness in russia to negotiate with the us , albeit with certain caveats .
" i think russia is open to cooperation with nato on a defence shield , on condition that the us postpones the deployment of parts of its global missile defense shield in eastern europe , " she said .
this rapprochement is partly motivated by a common threat - iran .
as francis tusa , veteran british defense analyst and writer military affairs , told deutsche welle , " if you look around at the world 's borders , you 'll see that russia is in a more risky position . "
bildunterschrift : us-russian relations have improved considerably under obama klein believes that russia 's signing of the start treaty was also motivated by necessity .
" russia saw that its strategic nuclear weapons arsenal will downsize anyway due to the age of the missiles , " she says .
" therefore , reducing its arsenal together with the usa offers the opportunity to remain on par with washington and reduce the financial burdens of its strategic nuclear arsenal . "
for its part , the us has been desperate to prevent russia selling arms to iran , and making a major agreement on a missile shield could be seen as an effective way to control the trade .
" the us has been very active in trying to persuade russia not to sell weapons to iran , " says tusa .
" but we know that russia has made deals with the iran in the past . "
several ways to skin a cat but the devil in any international agreement is in the proverbial details .
in this case , the detail is the actual military hardware up for discussion .
" there is some confusion about what kind of missile defense shields are being talked about , " says klein .
" there are theater missile defense -lrb- tmd -rrb- systems , designed to defend troops against shorter-range missiles , and the national missile defense -lrb- nmd -rrb- systems , designed to protect a whole nation or group of nations . "
though the more mobile tmds are typically used in actual war scenarios like afghanistan , they can be deployed as domestic defense systems instead of the larger nmds .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the air crash in smolensk may have improved polish-russian relations " there are several ways of skinning the cat , " says tusa .
" you could have linked batteries of tmd systems , which would be a lot cheaper . "
the variety of options and weapons technology is likely to dominate any negotiations , and could easily scupper the project .
both sides are likely to be wary of revealing too much of their own technology .
" i think the us state department 's concern at the moment is probably whether the russians are just there to have a look-see , " said tusa .
" they may say they 're interested in creating a joint defense shield just to see what the us has to offer , and then back out if it 's not enough . "
experience suggests that armies are extremely cagey about sharing technology , even with their partners .
" america 's main nato allies in europe - the uk and germany - basically never get to see any us military technology .
do we really believe that the state department is suddenly going to let russia see everything ? " asked tusa .
european complications but this does not exhaust all the complications that any large-scale collaboration would involve .
the european nato states where missile defense systems would be installed are unlikely to allow the negotiations to take place without their opinions being heard .
and these opinions are wide-ranging .
" europe encompasses several different views - eastern european countries obviously have a very different attitude to russia than western ones , " said tusa .
" the countries to the south-east will be more concerned about the threat from missiles , while countries in north-western europe less so . "
as so often , the importance of poland 's strategic position in europe could prove vital , and the country 's recently improved relations with russia may open to the door to a global project .
klein is optimistic : " poland is a very important member state in nato , and poland 's relations with russia will play an important part in the development of the missile defense shield .
for that reason the recent rapprochement between the two countries , which began well before the recent tragedy in smolensk , is a good sign . "

just a start but many experts are still concerned whether obama 's so-called ' reset ' policy will be enough to allay russian concerns about a european missile shield .
margarete klein , senior associate at the german institute for international and security affairs -lrb- swp -rrb- , believes the former superpower enemies are still locked in a catch-22 stand-off .
" the crux of the problem is that such a defense shield would create a lot of trust between russia and nato , but would require a lot of trust in the first place , " she told deutsche welle .
but klein emphasized that there was a real willingness in russia to negotiate with the us , albeit with certain caveats .
" i think russia is open to cooperation with nato on a defence shield , on condition that the us postpones the deployment of parts of its global missile defense shield in eastern europe , " she said .
this rapprochement is partly motivated by a common threat - iran .
as francis tusa , veteran british defense analyst and writer military affairs , told deutsche welle , " if you look around at the world 's borders , you 'll see that russia is in a more risky position . "
bildunterschrift : us-russian relations have improved considerably under obama klein believes that russia 's signing of the start treaty was also motivated by necessity .
" russia saw that its strategic nuclear weapons arsenal will downsize anyway due to the age of the missiles , " she says .
" therefore , reducing its arsenal together with the usa offers the opportunity to remain on par with washington and reduce the financial burdens of its strategic nuclear arsenal . "
for its part , the us has been desperate to prevent russia selling arms to iran , and making a major agreement on a missile shield could be seen as an effective way to control the trade .
" the us has been very active in trying to persuade russia not to sell weapons to iran , " says tusa .
" but we know that russia has made deals with the iran in the past . "
several ways to skin a cat but the devil in any international agreement is in the proverbial details .
in this case , the detail is the actual military hardware up for discussion .
" there is some confusion about what kind of missile defense shields are being talked about , " says klein .
" there are theater missile defense -lrb- tmd -rrb- systems , designed to defend troops against shorter-range missiles , and the national missile defense -lrb- nmd -rrb- systems , designed to protect a whole nation or group of nations . "
though the more mobile tmds are typically used in actual war scenarios like afghanistan , they can be deployed as domestic defense systems instead of the larger nmds .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the air crash in smolensk may have improved polish-russian relations " there are several ways of skinning the cat , " says tusa .
" you could have linked batteries of tmd systems , which would be a lot cheaper . "
the variety of options and weapons technology is likely to dominate any negotiations , and could easily scupper the project .
both sides are likely to be wary of revealing too much of their own technology .
" i think the us state department 's concern at the moment is probably whether the russians are just there to have a look-see , " said tusa .
" they may say they 're interested in creating a joint defense shield just to see what the us has to offer , and then back out if it 's not enough . "
experience suggests that armies are extremely cagey about sharing technology , even with their partners .
" america 's main nato allies in europe - the uk and germany - basically never get to see any us military technology .
do we really believe that the state department is suddenly going to let russia see everything ? " asked tusa .
european complications but this does not exhaust all the complications that any large-scale collaboration would involve .
the european nato states where missile defense systems would be installed are unlikely to allow the negotiations to take place without their opinions being heard .
and these opinions are wide-ranging .
" europe encompasses several different views - eastern european countries obviously have a very different attitude to russia than western ones , " said tusa .
" the countries to the south-east will be more concerned about the threat from missiles , while countries in north-western europe less so . "
as so often , the importance of poland 's strategic position in europe could prove vital , and the country 's recently improved relations with russia may open to the door to a global project .
klein is optimistic : " poland is a very important member state in nato , and poland 's relations with russia will play an important part in the development of the missile defense shield .
for that reason the recent rapprochement between the two countries , which began well before the recent tragedy in smolensk , is a good sign . "

european complications but this does not exhaust all the complications that any large-scale collaboration would involve .
the european nato states where missile defense systems would be installed are unlikely to allow the negotiations to take place without their opinions being heard .
and these opinions are wide-ranging .
" europe encompasses several different views - eastern european countries obviously have a very different attitude to russia than western ones , " said tusa .
" the countries to the south-east will be more concerned about the threat from missiles , while countries in north-western europe less so . "
as so often , the importance of poland 's strategic position in europe could prove vital , and the country 's recently improved relations with russia may open to the door to a global project .
klein is optimistic : " poland is a very important member state in nato , and poland 's relations with russia will play an important part in the development of the missile defense shield .
for that reason the recent rapprochement between the two countries , which began well before the recent tragedy in smolensk , is a good sign . "

but analysts are still cautious about its prospects . at a press conference on monday , nato secretary general anders rasmussen spoke about what he believed was the most serious security threat faced by europe .
" there is a growing missile threat , including from iran , " he said .
" and the politicians have a responsibility to protect the population . "
europe must " take its share in the joint protection from missile attacks . "
as far as nato is concerned , any hope of creating a missile defense system for europe rests on the cooperation of russia . moscow has persistently voiced its opposition to missile installations in eastern europe that it believes could be used as offensive weapons .
to this end , rasmussen has been working to bring nato and russia together to discuss the possibility .
speaking during a recent visit to london , nato spokesman james appathurai told reporters , " russia should be included in a missile defense system which covers europe . "
he said plans for a " new security architecture " should be " one roof which includes the russians as part of the same security family . "
the attempted cooperation has apparently met with some success .
at least one newspaper , the british independent , reported that secret talks had already begun between washington and moscow on the subject , though no further details were reported .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nmds are much more expensive than close range tmds the end of the george w. bush presidency certainly opened the door to a rapprochement between russia and the west , a process that has culminated in the recent signing of the nuclear disarmament strategic arms reduction treaty -lrb- start -rrb- treaty in prague .
many analysts were impressed at the speed with which president barack obama managed to instil enough trust in opposite number dmitry medvedev to bring him to a disarmament agreement .
just a start but many experts are still concerned whether obama 's so-called ' reset ' policy will be enough to allay russian concerns about a european missile shield .
margarete klein , senior associate at the german institute for international and security affairs -lrb- swp -rrb- , believes the former superpower enemies are still locked in a catch-22 stand-off .
" the crux of the problem is that such a defense shield would create a lot of trust between russia and nato , but would require a lot of trust in the first place , " she told deutsche welle .
but klein emphasized that there was a real willingness in russia to negotiate with the us , albeit with certain caveats .
" i think russia is open to cooperation with nato on a defence shield , on condition that the us postpones the deployment of parts of its global missile defense shield in eastern europe , " she said .
this rapprochement is partly motivated by a common threat - iran .
as francis tusa , veteran british defense analyst and writer military affairs , told deutsche welle , " if you look around at the world 's borders , you 'll see that russia is in a more risky position . "
bildunterschrift : us-russian relations have improved considerably under obama klein believes that russia 's signing of the start treaty was also motivated by necessity .
" russia saw that its strategic nuclear weapons arsenal will downsize anyway due to the age of the missiles , " she says .
" therefore , reducing its arsenal together with the usa offers the opportunity to remain on par with washington and reduce the financial burdens of its strategic nuclear arsenal . "
for its part , the us has been desperate to prevent russia selling arms to iran , and making a major agreement on a missile shield could be seen as an effective way to control the trade .
" the us has been very active in trying to persuade russia not to sell weapons to iran , " says tusa .
" but we know that russia has made deals with the iran in the past . "
several ways to skin a cat but the devil in any international agreement is in the proverbial details .
in this case , the detail is the actual military hardware up for discussion .
" there is some confusion about what kind of missile defense shields are being talked about , " says klein .
" there are theater missile defense -lrb- tmd -rrb- systems , designed to defend troops against shorter-range missiles , and the national missile defense -lrb- nmd -rrb- systems , designed to protect a whole nation or group of nations . "
though the more mobile tmds are typically used in actual war scenarios like afghanistan , they can be deployed as domestic defense systems instead of the larger nmds .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the air crash in smolensk may have improved polish-russian relations " there are several ways of skinning the cat , " says tusa .
" you could have linked batteries of tmd systems , which would be a lot cheaper . "
the variety of options and weapons technology is likely to dominate any negotiations , and could easily scupper the project .
both sides are likely to be wary of revealing too much of their own technology .
" i think the us state department 's concern at the moment is probably whether the russians are just there to have a look-see , " said tusa .
" they may say they 're interested in creating a joint defense shield just to see what the us has to offer , and then back out if it 's not enough . "
experience suggests that armies are extremely cagey about sharing technology , even with their partners .

but early signs of disaster , like increasingly saline groundwater and dwindling freshwater reserves , are already visible . last fall , island nations made a dramatic appeal to industrialized countries : " my country is on the verge of being submerged , " emanuel mori , the president of micronesia , told representatives of the european union at the time .
he demanded that western countries finally rethink their climate policies .
island states like micronesia have been hit particularly hard by global warming , primarily through rising sea levels .
there are real fears that the country could disappear from the world map in the not-too-distant future .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rising water levels are threatening micronesia 's coastlines the signs of the looming disaster are already there : rising sea levels have mixed salt water with the groundwater in several areas .
that , in turn , is shrinking drinking water reserves and making it harder to irrigate agricultural land .
the high level of salinity has poisoned the ground and made it infertile for years .
" it 's a particularly tough situation for small island nations , " juergen kropp of the potsdam institute of climate impact research said .
he added that these nations already had limited groundwater reserves .
island states not the only ones affected but it 's not just places like micronesia that are grappling with the problem of increasing salinity in the groundwater .
many other regions with long coastlines , for instance the gaza strip , are faced with similar problems .
the gaza strip is one of the most crowded places in the world , and that dense population puts great pressure on the region 's water supply .
experts say it is another important cause of saline groundwater .
" sea water can only intrude in places where water has been drained previously , " kropp said .
if groundwater turns saline , he said , it shows that more groundwater was used than can be replaced .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more demand for water can lead to rising salinity in groundwater philip magiera of the state-funded gtz development organization in germany said there are two ways to tackle the issue - either by increasing the existing water supply , or by limiting demand for it .
" i 'm a big fan of water efficiency , " magiera said .
there are lots of examples of how water usage can be reduced , he said , particularly in the agricultural sector .
in many regions , up to 70 percent of the groundwater is used to irrigate fields .
but with systems such as drip irrigation , it 's possible to save large quantities of water .
water wastage a major problem often , a lot of water is simply wasted on the way to the end consumer .
many countries struggle with leaky piping systems .
in such cases , experts say , it makes more sense to first fix the leaks before more water is pumped into the system .
" even in households , there are often possibilities to save water , " magiera said .
effective use of water can also be achieved through economic measures such as regulating water prices .
if all water-saving measures are exhausted , then increasing fresh water reserves is the only option .
if water can not be imported , then the sea water must be desalinated .
" technically , that 's not a problem anymore today , " said kropp .
sea water desalination is practiced in countries such as israel or saudi arabia .
the united arab emirates are almost entirely dependent on desalinated sea water .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the uae meets its needs for freshwater through desalination plants but one of the problems that can crop up is that desalination plants are highly energy-intensive .
and that energy is largely achieved in the middle east by burning fossil-based fuel .
that releases carbon dioxide into the atmosphere and in turn accelerates climate change .
traditional solutions desalination plants have been set up in places like micronesia .
but these are mostly small plants with very low capacities .
bigger installations are too expensive .
and there 's a lack of energy reserves to power them .
magiera said that in this case , the answer would be to turn to traditional measures - such as harvesting rainwater - instead of high-tech solutions .

but early signs of disaster , like increasingly saline groundwater and dwindling freshwater reserves , are already visible . last fall , island nations made a dramatic appeal to industrialized countries : " my country is on the verge of being submerged , " emanuel mori , the president of micronesia , told representatives of the european union at the time .
he demanded that western countries finally rethink their climate policies .
island states like micronesia have been hit particularly hard by global warming , primarily through rising sea levels .
there are real fears that the country could disappear from the world map in the not-too-distant future .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rising water levels are threatening micronesia 's coastlines the signs of the looming disaster are already there : rising sea levels have mixed salt water with the groundwater in several areas .
that , in turn , is shrinking drinking water reserves and making it harder to irrigate agricultural land .
the high level of salinity has poisoned the ground and made it infertile for years .
" it 's a particularly tough situation for small island nations , " juergen kropp of the potsdam institute of climate impact research said .
he added that these nations already had limited groundwater reserves .
island states not the only ones affected but it 's not just places like micronesia that are grappling with the problem of increasing salinity in the groundwater .
many other regions with long coastlines , for instance the gaza strip , are faced with similar problems .
the gaza strip is one of the most crowded places in the world , and that dense population puts great pressure on the region 's water supply .
experts say it is another important cause of saline groundwater .
" sea water can only intrude in places where water has been drained previously , " kropp said .
if groundwater turns saline , he said , it shows that more groundwater was used than can be replaced .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more demand for water can lead to rising salinity in groundwater philip magiera of the state-funded gtz development organization in germany said there are two ways to tackle the issue - either by increasing the existing water supply , or by limiting demand for it .
" i 'm a big fan of water efficiency , " magiera said .
there are lots of examples of how water usage can be reduced , he said , particularly in the agricultural sector .
in many regions , up to 70 percent of the groundwater is used to irrigate fields .
but with systems such as drip irrigation , it 's possible to save large quantities of water .
water wastage a major problem often , a lot of water is simply wasted on the way to the end consumer .
many countries struggle with leaky piping systems .
in such cases , experts say , it makes more sense to first fix the leaks before more water is pumped into the system .
" even in households , there are often possibilities to save water , " magiera said .
effective use of water can also be achieved through economic measures such as regulating water prices .
if all water-saving measures are exhausted , then increasing fresh water reserves is the only option .
if water can not be imported , then the sea water must be desalinated .
" technically , that 's not a problem anymore today , " said kropp .
sea water desalination is practiced in countries such as israel or saudi arabia .
the united arab emirates are almost entirely dependent on desalinated sea water .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the uae meets its needs for freshwater through desalination plants but one of the problems that can crop up is that desalination plants are highly energy-intensive .
and that energy is largely achieved in the middle east by burning fossil-based fuel .
that releases carbon dioxide into the atmosphere and in turn accelerates climate change .
traditional solutions desalination plants have been set up in places like micronesia .
but these are mostly small plants with very low capacities .
bigger installations are too expensive .
and there 's a lack of energy reserves to power them .
magiera said that in this case , the answer would be to turn to traditional measures - such as harvesting rainwater - instead of high-tech solutions .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rising water levels are threatening micronesia 's coastlines the signs of the looming disaster are already there : rising sea levels have mixed salt water with the groundwater in several areas .
that , in turn , is shrinking drinking water reserves and making it harder to irrigate agricultural land .
the high level of salinity has poisoned the ground and made it infertile for years .
" it 's a particularly tough situation for small island nations , " juergen kropp of the potsdam institute of climate impact research said .
he added that these nations already had limited groundwater reserves .
island states not the only ones affected but it 's not just places like micronesia that are grappling with the problem of increasing salinity in the groundwater .
many other regions with long coastlines , for instance the gaza strip , are faced with similar problems .
the gaza strip is one of the most crowded places in the world , and that dense population puts great pressure on the region 's water supply .
experts say it is another important cause of saline groundwater .
" sea water can only intrude in places where water has been drained previously , " kropp said .
if groundwater turns saline , he said , it shows that more groundwater was used than can be replaced .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more demand for water can lead to rising salinity in groundwater philip magiera of the state-funded gtz development organization in germany said there are two ways to tackle the issue - either by increasing the existing water supply , or by limiting demand for it .
" i 'm a big fan of water efficiency , " magiera said .
there are lots of examples of how water usage can be reduced , he said , particularly in the agricultural sector .
in many regions , up to 70 percent of the groundwater is used to irrigate fields .
but with systems such as drip irrigation , it 's possible to save large quantities of water .
water wastage a major problem often , a lot of water is simply wasted on the way to the end consumer .
many countries struggle with leaky piping systems .
in such cases , experts say , it makes more sense to first fix the leaks before more water is pumped into the system .
" even in households , there are often possibilities to save water , " magiera said .
effective use of water can also be achieved through economic measures such as regulating water prices .
if all water-saving measures are exhausted , then increasing fresh water reserves is the only option .
if water can not be imported , then the sea water must be desalinated .
" technically , that 's not a problem anymore today , " said kropp .
sea water desalination is practiced in countries such as israel or saudi arabia .
the united arab emirates are almost entirely dependent on desalinated sea water .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the uae meets its needs for freshwater through desalination plants but one of the problems that can crop up is that desalination plants are highly energy-intensive .
and that energy is largely achieved in the middle east by burning fossil-based fuel .
that releases carbon dioxide into the atmosphere and in turn accelerates climate change .
traditional solutions desalination plants have been set up in places like micronesia .
but these are mostly small plants with very low capacities .
bigger installations are too expensive .
and there 's a lack of energy reserves to power them .
magiera said that in this case , the answer would be to turn to traditional measures - such as harvesting rainwater - instead of high-tech solutions .

but early signs of disaster , like increasingly saline groundwater and dwindling freshwater reserves , are already visible . last fall , island nations made a dramatic appeal to industrialized countries : " my country is on the verge of being submerged , " emanuel mori , the president of micronesia , told representatives of the european union at the time .
he demanded that western countries finally rethink their climate policies .

now bayern are the favorites to break the dry spell .
but they should n't underestimate their opponents . going into the home-and-away tie against french side olympique lyon , to be played on april 21 and 27 , the words " bayern " and " major roll " were being used a lot together .
not only had the bavarians knocked out manchester united in the quarterfinals , they engaged in a bit of target practice in a 7-0 thrashing of hanover in the bundesliga .
with lyon in third place in france ligue 1 , this season represents the bavarians ' best chance of getting back to the champions league final since they won the title in 2000-01 .
and indeed , the bookmakers are tipping bayern as the clear favorites in this encounter .
this is the first time lyon have made it as far as the semifinals in the champions league , and bayern are a richer club that currently rides atop the table in a better league .
what 's more they have winger arjen robben , who 's playing the most dominant football of anyone in europe not named lionel messi .
but although coach louis van gaal 's side have every reason to believe a trip to the final in madrid on may 22 is within reach , they had best beware of the french side , which has made a habit this season of toppling big names .
giant killers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern need to watch out for lopez coach claude puel 's men did not get where they are by accident .
to progress beyond the group stage , lyon had to beat liverpool , and their round-of-16 opponents were no less than real madrid .
the french side has a top striker in argentinian lisandro lopez .
he 's scored seven goals in the champions league thus far , including a pair that sent lyon past rivals bordeaux in the quarterfinals .
but olympique 's real strength is defense .
puels usually gets 10 men behind the ball , and both liverpool and real were frustrated by lyon 's tenacity , wearing themselves out and getting punished on the counter-attack .
plus , they have the advantage of playing their first game away from home , where any goals scored put pressure on the opponents for the return leg .
that 's why bayern ceo karl-heinz rummenigge warned against over-confidence as the first leg approached .
" this is a match-up of equals , " rummenigge told reporters .
" we 're not the underdogs , but we 're not the favorites , either . "
dynamic duo bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : robben , in particular , is having a career season bayern have had to score a fair number of goals in their champions league campaign , and most have come from two men : robben and overachieving croatian striker ivica olic .
olic is one of the hardest working players in the business , and the bavarians will hope that his tireless forechecking will allow him to capitalize on defensive lapses in concentration , much as he did when he scored on a crucial last-second poach against manchester united in the quarterfinals .
olic could be key since bayern 's pair of true center forwards , mario gomez and miroslav klose , have both been out of form .
robben has been little short of unstoppable , confounding defenses with his incisive runs and lightning-quick shots on goal .
lyon will likely devote at least a couple of defenders to the dutch winger , which should open space on the left for his counterpart , frank ribery .
ribery , though , has become something of an enigma .
injured for much of the season , he seems to have temporarily lost some of his assurance with the ball , and his lone goal in the manchester united tie came on a terribly taken free kick that was lucky to be deflected off the wall .
and the frenchman is not bayern 's only worry .
question marks bildunterschrift : badstuber -lrb- right -rrb- , is one of bayern 's young defenders in both of their previous champions league ties , bayern have lost their away matches .
to take the pressure off , they need not only to win their home match but avoid conceding what could be deadly goals .
the bavarians ' defense has looked very solid in the league , but the squad van gaal is fielding is young .
on the left , both 19-year-old diego contento and 21-year-old holger badstuber have sometimes looked out of their depth against top european opposition .
moreover , on the right philipp lahm - usually one of the best defensive players in the world - has looked out of sorts for most of this season .
nonetheless , despite these potential weaknesses and regardless of what bayern 's bosses were saying before the tie , munich are the favorites in this match-up , and they know it .
if their defense can rise to the occasion and their men up front get the job done in the allianz arena , they 'll be in an excellent position to return to european club football 's biggest match .

but early signs of disaster , like increasingly saline groundwater and dwindling freshwater reserves , are already visible . last fall , island nations made a dramatic appeal to industrialized countries : " my country is on the verge of being submerged , " emanuel mori , the president of micronesia , told representatives of the european union at the time .
he demanded that western countries finally rethink their climate policies .
island states like micronesia have been hit particularly hard by global warming , primarily through rising sea levels .
there are real fears that the country could disappear from the world map in the not-too-distant future .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rising water levels are threatening micronesia 's coastlines the signs of the looming disaster are already there : rising sea levels have mixed salt water with the groundwater in several areas .
that , in turn , is shrinking drinking water reserves and making it harder to irrigate agricultural land .
the high level of salinity has poisoned the ground and made it infertile for years .
" it 's a particularly tough situation for small island nations , " juergen kropp of the potsdam institute of climate impact research said .
he added that these nations already had limited groundwater reserves .
island states not the only ones affected but it 's not just places like micronesia that are grappling with the problem of increasing salinity in the groundwater .
many other regions with long coastlines , for instance the gaza strip , are faced with similar problems .
the gaza strip is one of the most crowded places in the world , and that dense population puts great pressure on the region 's water supply .
experts say it is another important cause of saline groundwater .
" sea water can only intrude in places where water has been drained previously , " kropp said .
if groundwater turns saline , he said , it shows that more groundwater was used than can be replaced .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more demand for water can lead to rising salinity in groundwater philip magiera of the state-funded gtz development organization in germany said there are two ways to tackle the issue - either by increasing the existing water supply , or by limiting demand for it .
" i 'm a big fan of water efficiency , " magiera said .
there are lots of examples of how water usage can be reduced , he said , particularly in the agricultural sector .
in many regions , up to 70 percent of the groundwater is used to irrigate fields .
but with systems such as drip irrigation , it 's possible to save large quantities of water .
water wastage a major problem often , a lot of water is simply wasted on the way to the end consumer .
many countries struggle with leaky piping systems .
in such cases , experts say , it makes more sense to first fix the leaks before more water is pumped into the system .
" even in households , there are often possibilities to save water , " magiera said .
effective use of water can also be achieved through economic measures such as regulating water prices .
if all water-saving measures are exhausted , then increasing fresh water reserves is the only option .
if water can not be imported , then the sea water must be desalinated .
" technically , that 's not a problem anymore today , " said kropp .
sea water desalination is practiced in countries such as israel or saudi arabia .
the united arab emirates are almost entirely dependent on desalinated sea water .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the uae meets its needs for freshwater through desalination plants but one of the problems that can crop up is that desalination plants are highly energy-intensive .
and that energy is largely achieved in the middle east by burning fossil-based fuel .
that releases carbon dioxide into the atmosphere and in turn accelerates climate change .
traditional solutions desalination plants have been set up in places like micronesia .
but these are mostly small plants with very low capacities .
bigger installations are too expensive .
and there 's a lack of energy reserves to power them .
magiera said that in this case , the answer would be to turn to traditional measures - such as harvesting rainwater - instead of high-tech solutions .

but early signs of disaster , like increasingly saline groundwater and dwindling freshwater reserves , are already visible . last fall , island nations made a dramatic appeal to industrialized countries : " my country is on the verge of being submerged , " emanuel mori , the president of micronesia , told representatives of the european union at the time .
he demanded that western countries finally rethink their climate policies .
island states like micronesia have been hit particularly hard by global warming , primarily through rising sea levels .
there are real fears that the country could disappear from the world map in the not-too-distant future .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rising water levels are threatening micronesia 's coastlines the signs of the looming disaster are already there : rising sea levels have mixed salt water with the groundwater in several areas .
that , in turn , is shrinking drinking water reserves and making it harder to irrigate agricultural land .
the high level of salinity has poisoned the ground and made it infertile for years .
" it 's a particularly tough situation for small island nations , " juergen kropp of the potsdam institute of climate impact research said .
he added that these nations already had limited groundwater reserves .
island states not the only ones affected but it 's not just places like micronesia that are grappling with the problem of increasing salinity in the groundwater .
many other regions with long coastlines , for instance the gaza strip , are faced with similar problems .
the gaza strip is one of the most crowded places in the world , and that dense population puts great pressure on the region 's water supply .
experts say it is another important cause of saline groundwater .
" sea water can only intrude in places where water has been drained previously , " kropp said .
if groundwater turns saline , he said , it shows that more groundwater was used than can be replaced .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more demand for water can lead to rising salinity in groundwater philip magiera of the state-funded gtz development organization in germany said there are two ways to tackle the issue - either by increasing the existing water supply , or by limiting demand for it .
" i 'm a big fan of water efficiency , " magiera said .
there are lots of examples of how water usage can be reduced , he said , particularly in the agricultural sector .
in many regions , up to 70 percent of the groundwater is used to irrigate fields .
but with systems such as drip irrigation , it 's possible to save large quantities of water .
water wastage a major problem often , a lot of water is simply wasted on the way to the end consumer .
many countries struggle with leaky piping systems .
in such cases , experts say , it makes more sense to first fix the leaks before more water is pumped into the system .
" even in households , there are often possibilities to save water , " magiera said .
effective use of water can also be achieved through economic measures such as regulating water prices .
if all water-saving measures are exhausted , then increasing fresh water reserves is the only option .
if water can not be imported , then the sea water must be desalinated .
" technically , that 's not a problem anymore today , " said kropp .
sea water desalination is practiced in countries such as israel or saudi arabia .
the united arab emirates are almost entirely dependent on desalinated sea water .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the uae meets its needs for freshwater through desalination plants but one of the problems that can crop up is that desalination plants are highly energy-intensive .
and that energy is largely achieved in the middle east by burning fossil-based fuel .
that releases carbon dioxide into the atmosphere and in turn accelerates climate change .
traditional solutions desalination plants have been set up in places like micronesia .
but these are mostly small plants with very low capacities .
bigger installations are too expensive .
and there 's a lack of energy reserves to power them .
magiera said that in this case , the answer would be to turn to traditional measures - such as harvesting rainwater - instead of high-tech solutions .

airlines have accused aviation experts of exaggerating the risk , but is it really safe to fly right now ? europe 's busiest air hub saw its first flights on tuesday evening as airspace across the continent slowly began to reopen following nearly a week of widespread travel disruption .
a flight from vancouver arrived at london 's heathrow airport shortly before 10 p.m. local time , the first since british airspace was closed last thursday following the eruption of iceland 's eyjafjallajokull volcano .
british airways expected about 24 other flights to arrive from the united states , africa and asia later in the evening .
earlier tuesday , germany 's two biggest airlines announced they would resume flying many of their regularly scheduled flights , despite an ongoing no-fly rule in german airspace , by operating under special " visual flight " conditions . under the visual flight rules , airlines are permitted to fly below 3,000 meters -lrb- 9,800 feet -rrb- during daylight , as long as pilots use their own radar and eyesight to avoid other planes .
germany 's flag carrier lufthansa announced it would carry more than 15,000 passengers on some 200 flights on tuesday .
air berlin , germany 's second largest carrier , was operating a nearly full flight schedule , according to its web site .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many stranded passengers were forced to sleep in airports the flights were operating through a loophole in the aviation regulations , said christine kellek of germany 's flight safety organization -lrb- dfs -rrb- .
the closure of airspace only applies to aviation that relies on ground control and navigation instruments , according to kellek .
" the german air navigation services can not forbid flying by visual flying rules , because we regulate instrument flights , so it is not up to us to decide if somebody can fly under visual flying rules or not , " kellek told deutsche welle .
pressure on pilots but while these flights may be allowed , not everyone supports the idea .
juerg handwerg , a pilot and spokesperson for the german pilots ' union cockpit , said he thinks the decision to allow planes to operate on visual flight was fueled by financial considerations .
" they are avoiding the international rules they signed themselves by flying under visual flight rules , " said handwerg .
" it 's due to monetary reasons . "
it puts unfair pressure on pilots , he added . " legally , you can say , ‘ no i do n't want to fly , ’ but if your employer tells you to fly and you say no , you can get thrown out .
so how can you decide not to fly ? "
handwerg told deutsche welle . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : volcanic ash drifting across the atlantic forced the cancellation of flights across europe an expensive problem in the past , volcanic ash has been known to cause problems with aircraft . following last week 's eruption in iceland , air france , british airways , klm and lufthansa reported no problems from their own test flights , but senior us military officials said the ash had caused some engine damage to a nato f-16 fighter plane . scientists from the german aerospace center -lrb- dlr -rrb- carried out a four-hour test flight monday to measure the cloud 's density and composition .
the results were submitted to transportation authorities in berlin , who were to decide whether or not it 's safe to fly in german airspace , according to karl hinterleitner of the dlr .
after several days of flight cancellations , airlines are itching to see a return to business as usual , as flight disruptions are costing them as much as 200 million euros -lrb- $ 270 million -rrb- per day .
experts say it 's hard to know when the situation will return to normal , leaving policymakers walking a difficult line between trying to minimize the economic impact of further flight suspension and the potential risk of flying through volcanic ash .

airlines have accused aviation experts of exaggerating the risk , but is it really safe to fly right now ? europe 's busiest air hub saw its first flights on tuesday evening as airspace across the continent slowly began to reopen following nearly a week of widespread travel disruption .
a flight from vancouver arrived at london 's heathrow airport shortly before 10 p.m. local time , the first since british airspace was closed last thursday following the eruption of iceland 's eyjafjallajokull volcano .
british airways expected about 24 other flights to arrive from the united states , africa and asia later in the evening .

the heightened tensions come as the deployment of troops in a financial area of the city thwarted a planned march by the protestors earlier tuesday . tensions remain high in bangkok ten days after clashes between the military and anti-government protestors left 25 people dead and hundreds injured . the army said it was now prepared to take tougher measures in the case of further clashes , using elite troops .
according to army spokesman colonel sunsern kaewkumnerd , the army was ready to take decisive action , including the use of live bullets , if provoked .
protesters remain firm charan dittapichai is a leader of the united democratic front against dictatorship , or udd , better known as the red shirts .
he says the protesters will remain resolute in the case of a crackdown .

" it can not .
i do n't believe that the army can do that .
and if they do , no one knows what will happen because at least 30 percent who come here are not afraid of death . "
the udd says prime minister abhisit vejjajiva 's government must resign and call new elections .
but the government and coalition partners say elections in the current heated climate would do little to end the current political crisis .
on tuesday tens of thousands of red shirt protesters gathered at the rally site , near major malls and department stores that have been forced to close for almost three weeks at the cost of millions of dollars .
" they 're trying to demonize us " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anti-government protesters , in red , clash with policemen sean boonpracong , a udd spokesperson , says while there are fears the deep social divisions could be exacerbated , the government is to be blamed , not the protestors .
" they 're trying to blame us as intransigent .
you have to remember the government and their conservative allies are more powerful than us .
i think you should ask them what they 're prepared to offer .
but they 're trying to demonize us as being a terrorist group .
and it 's really counterproductive to hear that type of really extreme rhetoric . "
army officials said protestors have stockpiled home-made weapons including acid banks and clubs spiked with nails in preparation for a crackdown .
there is concern that demonstrators may also have firearms .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thailand 's prime minister abhisit vejjajiva , said his government stands ready to talk with the " red shirts " " i am afraid because i can not see any sign from now on how we can pass this moment peacefully , " says pinpaka ngamsom , the assistant editor for online news service , prachatai.com.
" if you see all the factors right now it 's difficult for thailand .
if you look at the prime minister it 's hard for him to turn away and if you look to the red shirts for the leader it 's also very hard for them to turn away , and if you look at the protestor they strongly believe that they can win . "
the worst crisis in two decades the current political crisis is the most severe test for the country in almost 20 years .
prime minister abhisit survived a similar crisis last year , one also led by the red shirts who are backing former prime minister thaksin shinawatra .
thaksin remains overseas to avoid a two year jail term for corruption .
but it is also reported thaksin is consolidating his support even now within police and military ranks .

the heightened tensions come as the deployment of troops in a financial area of the city thwarted a planned march by the protestors earlier tuesday . tensions remain high in bangkok ten days after clashes between the military and anti-government protestors left 25 people dead and hundreds injured . the army said it was now prepared to take tougher measures in the case of further clashes , using elite troops .
according to army spokesman colonel sunsern kaewkumnerd , the army was ready to take decisive action , including the use of live bullets , if provoked .

" it can not .
i do n't believe that the army can do that .
and if they do , no one knows what will happen because at least 30 percent who come here are not afraid of death . "
the udd says prime minister abhisit vejjajiva 's government must resign and call new elections .
but the government and coalition partners say elections in the current heated climate would do little to end the current political crisis .

i think you should ask them what they 're prepared to offer .
but they 're trying to demonize us as being a terrorist group .
and it 's really counterproductive to hear that type of really extreme rhetoric . "
army officials said protestors have stockpiled home-made weapons including acid banks and clubs spiked with nails in preparation for a crackdown .

" if you see all the factors right now it 's difficult for thailand .
if you look at the prime minister it 's hard for him to turn away and if you look to the red shirts for the leader it 's also very hard for them to turn away , and if you look at the protestor they strongly believe that they can win . "
the worst crisis in two decades the current political crisis is the most severe test for the country in almost 20 years .
prime minister abhisit survived a similar crisis last year , one also led by the red shirts who are backing former prime minister thaksin shinawatra .

airlines have accused aviation experts of exaggerating the risk , but is it really safe to fly right now ? europe 's busiest air hub saw its first flights on tuesday evening as airspace across the continent slowly began to reopen following nearly a week of widespread travel disruption .
a flight from vancouver arrived at london 's heathrow airport shortly before 10 p.m. local time , the first since british airspace was closed last thursday following the eruption of iceland 's eyjafjallajokull volcano .
british airways expected about 24 other flights to arrive from the united states , africa and asia later in the evening .
earlier tuesday , germany 's two biggest airlines announced they would resume flying many of their regularly scheduled flights , despite an ongoing no-fly rule in german airspace , by operating under special " visual flight " conditions . under the visual flight rules , airlines are permitted to fly below 3,000 meters -lrb- 9,800 feet -rrb- during daylight , as long as pilots use their own radar and eyesight to avoid other planes .
germany 's flag carrier lufthansa announced it would carry more than 15,000 passengers on some 200 flights on tuesday .
air berlin , germany 's second largest carrier , was operating a nearly full flight schedule , according to its web site .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many stranded passengers were forced to sleep in airports the flights were operating through a loophole in the aviation regulations , said christine kellek of germany 's flight safety organization -lrb- dfs -rrb- .
the closure of airspace only applies to aviation that relies on ground control and navigation instruments , according to kellek .
" the german air navigation services can not forbid flying by visual flying rules , because we regulate instrument flights , so it is not up to us to decide if somebody can fly under visual flying rules or not , " kellek told deutsche welle .
pressure on pilots but while these flights may be allowed , not everyone supports the idea .
juerg handwerg , a pilot and spokesperson for the german pilots ' union cockpit , said he thinks the decision to allow planes to operate on visual flight was fueled by financial considerations .
" they are avoiding the international rules they signed themselves by flying under visual flight rules , " said handwerg .
" it 's due to monetary reasons . "
it puts unfair pressure on pilots , he added . " legally , you can say , ‘ no i do n't want to fly , ’ but if your employer tells you to fly and you say no , you can get thrown out .
so how can you decide not to fly ? "
handwerg told deutsche welle . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : volcanic ash drifting across the atlantic forced the cancellation of flights across europe an expensive problem in the past , volcanic ash has been known to cause problems with aircraft . following last week 's eruption in iceland , air france , british airways , klm and lufthansa reported no problems from their own test flights , but senior us military officials said the ash had caused some engine damage to a nato f-16 fighter plane . scientists from the german aerospace center -lrb- dlr -rrb- carried out a four-hour test flight monday to measure the cloud 's density and composition .
the results were submitted to transportation authorities in berlin , who were to decide whether or not it 's safe to fly in german airspace , according to karl hinterleitner of the dlr .
after several days of flight cancellations , airlines are itching to see a return to business as usual , as flight disruptions are costing them as much as 200 million euros -lrb- $ 270 million -rrb- per day .
experts say it 's hard to know when the situation will return to normal , leaving policymakers walking a difficult line between trying to minimize the economic impact of further flight suspension and the potential risk of flying through volcanic ash .

airlines have accused aviation experts of exaggerating the risk , but is it really safe to fly right now ? europe 's busiest air hub saw its first flights on tuesday evening as airspace across the continent slowly began to reopen following nearly a week of widespread travel disruption .
a flight from vancouver arrived at london 's heathrow airport shortly before 10 p.m. local time , the first since british airspace was closed last thursday following the eruption of iceland 's eyjafjallajokull volcano .
british airways expected about 24 other flights to arrive from the united states , africa and asia later in the evening .
earlier tuesday , germany 's two biggest airlines announced they would resume flying many of their regularly scheduled flights , despite an ongoing no-fly rule in german airspace , by operating under special " visual flight " conditions . under the visual flight rules , airlines are permitted to fly below 3,000 meters -lrb- 9,800 feet -rrb- during daylight , as long as pilots use their own radar and eyesight to avoid other planes .
germany 's flag carrier lufthansa announced it would carry more than 15,000 passengers on some 200 flights on tuesday .

airlines have accused aviation experts of exaggerating the risk , but is it really safe to fly right now ? europe 's busiest air hub saw its first flights on tuesday evening as airspace across the continent slowly began to reopen following nearly a week of widespread travel disruption .
a flight from vancouver arrived at london 's heathrow airport shortly before 10 p.m. local time , the first since british airspace was closed last thursday following the eruption of iceland 's eyjafjallajokull volcano .
british airways expected about 24 other flights to arrive from the united states , africa and asia later in the evening .
earlier tuesday , germany 's two biggest airlines announced they would resume flying many of their regularly scheduled flights , despite an ongoing no-fly rule in german airspace , by operating under special " visual flight " conditions . under the visual flight rules , airlines are permitted to fly below 3,000 meters -lrb- 9,800 feet -rrb- during daylight , as long as pilots use their own radar and eyesight to avoid other planes .
germany 's flag carrier lufthansa announced it would carry more than 15,000 passengers on some 200 flights on tuesday .
air berlin , germany 's second largest carrier , was operating a nearly full flight schedule , according to its web site .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many stranded passengers were forced to sleep in airports the flights were operating through a loophole in the aviation regulations , said christine kellek of germany 's flight safety organization -lrb- dfs -rrb- .
the closure of airspace only applies to aviation that relies on ground control and navigation instruments , according to kellek .
" the german air navigation services can not forbid flying by visual flying rules , because we regulate instrument flights , so it is not up to us to decide if somebody can fly under visual flying rules or not , " kellek told deutsche welle .
pressure on pilots but while these flights may be allowed , not everyone supports the idea .
juerg handwerg , a pilot and spokesperson for the german pilots ' union cockpit , said he thinks the decision to allow planes to operate on visual flight was fueled by financial considerations .
" they are avoiding the international rules they signed themselves by flying under visual flight rules , " said handwerg .
" it 's due to monetary reasons . "
it puts unfair pressure on pilots , he added . " legally , you can say , ‘ no i do n't want to fly , ’ but if your employer tells you to fly and you say no , you can get thrown out .
so how can you decide not to fly ? "
handwerg told deutsche welle . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : volcanic ash drifting across the atlantic forced the cancellation of flights across europe an expensive problem in the past , volcanic ash has been known to cause problems with aircraft . following last week 's eruption in iceland , air france , british airways , klm and lufthansa reported no problems from their own test flights , but senior us military officials said the ash had caused some engine damage to a nato f-16 fighter plane . scientists from the german aerospace center -lrb- dlr -rrb- carried out a four-hour test flight monday to measure the cloud 's density and composition .
the results were submitted to transportation authorities in berlin , who were to decide whether or not it 's safe to fly in german airspace , according to karl hinterleitner of the dlr .
after several days of flight cancellations , airlines are itching to see a return to business as usual , as flight disruptions are costing them as much as 200 million euros -lrb- $ 270 million -rrb- per day .
experts say it 's hard to know when the situation will return to normal , leaving policymakers walking a difficult line between trying to minimize the economic impact of further flight suspension and the potential risk of flying through volcanic ash .

it was announced on tuesday that 25-year-old adler , who plays for bayer leverkusen , suffered the injury during last saturday 's 2-1 defeat against stuttgart .
there are fears that this could jeopardize his place as number one goalie during the soccer tournament , which starts on june 11 .

airlines have accused aviation experts of exaggerating the risk , but is it really safe to fly right now ? europe 's busiest air hub saw its first flights on tuesday evening as airspace across the continent slowly began to reopen following nearly a week of widespread travel disruption .
a flight from vancouver arrived at london 's heathrow airport shortly before 10 p.m. local time , the first since british airspace was closed last thursday following the eruption of iceland 's eyjafjallajokull volcano .
british airways expected about 24 other flights to arrive from the united states , africa and asia later in the evening .
earlier tuesday , germany 's two biggest airlines announced they would resume flying many of their regularly scheduled flights , despite an ongoing no-fly rule in german airspace , by operating under special " visual flight " conditions . under the visual flight rules , airlines are permitted to fly below 3,000 meters -lrb- 9,800 feet -rrb- during daylight , as long as pilots use their own radar and eyesight to avoid other planes .
germany 's flag carrier lufthansa announced it would carry more than 15,000 passengers on some 200 flights on tuesday .
air berlin , germany 's second largest carrier , was operating a nearly full flight schedule , according to its web site .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many stranded passengers were forced to sleep in airports the flights were operating through a loophole in the aviation regulations , said christine kellek of germany 's flight safety organization -lrb- dfs -rrb- .
the closure of airspace only applies to aviation that relies on ground control and navigation instruments , according to kellek .
" the german air navigation services can not forbid flying by visual flying rules , because we regulate instrument flights , so it is not up to us to decide if somebody can fly under visual flying rules or not , " kellek told deutsche welle .
pressure on pilots but while these flights may be allowed , not everyone supports the idea .
juerg handwerg , a pilot and spokesperson for the german pilots ' union cockpit , said he thinks the decision to allow planes to operate on visual flight was fueled by financial considerations .
" they are avoiding the international rules they signed themselves by flying under visual flight rules , " said handwerg .
" it 's due to monetary reasons . "
it puts unfair pressure on pilots , he added . " legally , you can say , ‘ no i do n't want to fly , ’ but if your employer tells you to fly and you say no , you can get thrown out .
so how can you decide not to fly ? "
handwerg told deutsche welle . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : volcanic ash drifting across the atlantic forced the cancellation of flights across europe an expensive problem in the past , volcanic ash has been known to cause problems with aircraft . following last week 's eruption in iceland , air france , british airways , klm and lufthansa reported no problems from their own test flights , but senior us military officials said the ash had caused some engine damage to a nato f-16 fighter plane . scientists from the german aerospace center -lrb- dlr -rrb- carried out a four-hour test flight monday to measure the cloud 's density and composition .
the results were submitted to transportation authorities in berlin , who were to decide whether or not it 's safe to fly in german airspace , according to karl hinterleitner of the dlr .
after several days of flight cancellations , airlines are itching to see a return to business as usual , as flight disruptions are costing them as much as 200 million euros -lrb- $ 270 million -rrb- per day .
experts say it 's hard to know when the situation will return to normal , leaving policymakers walking a difficult line between trying to minimize the economic impact of further flight suspension and the potential risk of flying through volcanic ash .

but early signs of disaster , like increasingly saline groundwater and dwindling freshwater reserves , are already visible . last fall , island nations made a dramatic appeal to industrialized countries : " my country is on the verge of being submerged , " emanuel mori , the president of micronesia , told representatives of the european union at the time .
he demanded that western countries finally rethink their climate policies .
island states like micronesia have been hit particularly hard by global warming , primarily through rising sea levels .
there are real fears that the country could disappear from the world map in the not-too-distant future .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rising water levels are threatening micronesia 's coastlines the signs of the looming disaster are already there : rising sea levels have mixed salt water with the groundwater in several areas .
that , in turn , is shrinking drinking water reserves and making it harder to irrigate agricultural land .
the high level of salinity has poisoned the ground and made it infertile for years .
" it 's a particularly tough situation for small island nations , " juergen kropp of the potsdam institute of climate impact research said .
he added that these nations already had limited groundwater reserves .
island states not the only ones affected but it 's not just places like micronesia that are grappling with the problem of increasing salinity in the groundwater .
many other regions with long coastlines , for instance the gaza strip , are faced with similar problems .
the gaza strip is one of the most crowded places in the world , and that dense population puts great pressure on the region 's water supply .
experts say it is another important cause of saline groundwater .
" sea water can only intrude in places where water has been drained previously , " kropp said .
if groundwater turns saline , he said , it shows that more groundwater was used than can be replaced .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more demand for water can lead to rising salinity in groundwater philip magiera of the state-funded gtz development organization in germany said there are two ways to tackle the issue - either by increasing the existing water supply , or by limiting demand for it .
" i 'm a big fan of water efficiency , " magiera said .
there are lots of examples of how water usage can be reduced , he said , particularly in the agricultural sector .
in many regions , up to 70 percent of the groundwater is used to irrigate fields .
but with systems such as drip irrigation , it 's possible to save large quantities of water .
water wastage a major problem often , a lot of water is simply wasted on the way to the end consumer .
many countries struggle with leaky piping systems .
in such cases , experts say , it makes more sense to first fix the leaks before more water is pumped into the system .
" even in households , there are often possibilities to save water , " magiera said .
effective use of water can also be achieved through economic measures such as regulating water prices .
if all water-saving measures are exhausted , then increasing fresh water reserves is the only option .
if water can not be imported , then the sea water must be desalinated .
" technically , that 's not a problem anymore today , " said kropp .
sea water desalination is practiced in countries such as israel or saudi arabia .
the united arab emirates are almost entirely dependent on desalinated sea water .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the uae meets its needs for freshwater through desalination plants but one of the problems that can crop up is that desalination plants are highly energy-intensive .
and that energy is largely achieved in the middle east by burning fossil-based fuel .
that releases carbon dioxide into the atmosphere and in turn accelerates climate change .
traditional solutions desalination plants have been set up in places like micronesia .
but these are mostly small plants with very low capacities .
bigger installations are too expensive .
and there 's a lack of energy reserves to power them .
magiera said that in this case , the answer would be to turn to traditional measures - such as harvesting rainwater - instead of high-tech solutions .

the heightened tensions come as the deployment of troops in a financial area of the city thwarted a planned march by the protestors earlier tuesday . tensions remain high in bangkok ten days after clashes between the military and anti-government protestors left 25 people dead and hundreds injured . the army said it was now prepared to take tougher measures in the case of further clashes , using elite troops .
according to army spokesman colonel sunsern kaewkumnerd , the army was ready to take decisive action , including the use of live bullets , if provoked .
protesters remain firm charan dittapichai is a leader of the united democratic front against dictatorship , or udd , better known as the red shirts .
he says the protesters will remain resolute in the case of a crackdown .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anti-government demonstrators shout insults from behind razor wire he does not believe the army will crack down in seven days , as they are threatening to do .
" it can not .
i do n't believe that the army can do that .
and if they do , no one knows what will happen because at least 30 percent who come here are not afraid of death . "
the udd says prime minister abhisit vejjajiva 's government must resign and call new elections .
but the government and coalition partners say elections in the current heated climate would do little to end the current political crisis .
on tuesday tens of thousands of red shirt protesters gathered at the rally site , near major malls and department stores that have been forced to close for almost three weeks at the cost of millions of dollars .
" they 're trying to demonize us " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anti-government protesters , in red , clash with policemen sean boonpracong , a udd spokesperson , says while there are fears the deep social divisions could be exacerbated , the government is to be blamed , not the protestors .
" they 're trying to blame us as intransigent .
you have to remember the government and their conservative allies are more powerful than us .
i think you should ask them what they 're prepared to offer .
but they 're trying to demonize us as being a terrorist group .
and it 's really counterproductive to hear that type of really extreme rhetoric . "
army officials said protestors have stockpiled home-made weapons including acid banks and clubs spiked with nails in preparation for a crackdown .
there is concern that demonstrators may also have firearms .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thailand 's prime minister abhisit vejjajiva , said his government stands ready to talk with the " red shirts " " i am afraid because i can not see any sign from now on how we can pass this moment peacefully , " says pinpaka ngamsom , the assistant editor for online news service , prachatai.com.
" if you see all the factors right now it 's difficult for thailand .
if you look at the prime minister it 's hard for him to turn away and if you look to the red shirts for the leader it 's also very hard for them to turn away , and if you look at the protestor they strongly believe that they can win . "
the worst crisis in two decades the current political crisis is the most severe test for the country in almost 20 years .
prime minister abhisit survived a similar crisis last year , one also led by the red shirts who are backing former prime minister thaksin shinawatra .
thaksin remains overseas to avoid a two year jail term for corruption .
but it is also reported thaksin is consolidating his support even now within police and military ranks .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de nato -pipe- 20.04.2010 nato and russia edge warily toward a joint missile defense shield großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rasmussen has been trying to bring the usa and russia together nato secretary general anders rasmussen has appealed for a joint missile defense shield with russia to cover europe and offer protection from a possible terror attack .
but analysts are still cautious about its prospects . at a press conference on monday , nato secretary general anders rasmussen spoke about what he believed was the most serious security threat faced by europe .
" there is a growing missile threat , including from iran , " he said .
" and the politicians have a responsibility to protect the population . "
europe must " take its share in the joint protection from missile attacks . "
as far as nato is concerned , any hope of creating a missile defense system for europe rests on the cooperation of russia . moscow has persistently voiced its opposition to missile installations in eastern europe that it believes could be used as offensive weapons .
to this end , rasmussen has been working to bring nato and russia together to discuss the possibility .
speaking during a recent visit to london , nato spokesman james appathurai told reporters , " russia should be included in a missile defense system which covers europe . "
he said plans for a " new security architecture " should be " one roof which includes the russians as part of the same security family . "
the attempted cooperation has apparently met with some success .
at least one newspaper , the british independent , reported that secret talks had already begun between washington and moscow on the subject , though no further details were reported .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nmds are much more expensive than close range tmds the end of the george w. bush presidency certainly opened the door to a rapprochement between russia and the west , a process that has culminated in the recent signing of the nuclear disarmament strategic arms reduction treaty -lrb- start -rrb- treaty in prague .
many analysts were impressed at the speed with which president barack obama managed to instil enough trust in opposite number dmitry medvedev to bring him to a disarmament agreement .
just a start but many experts are still concerned whether obama 's so-called ' reset ' policy will be enough to allay russian concerns about a european missile shield .
margarete klein , senior associate at the german institute for international and security affairs -lrb- swp -rrb- , believes the former superpower enemies are still locked in a catch-22 stand-off .
" the crux of the problem is that such a defense shield would create a lot of trust between russia and nato , but would require a lot of trust in the first place , " she told deutsche welle .
but klein emphasized that there was a real willingness in russia to negotiate with the us , albeit with certain caveats .
" i think russia is open to cooperation with nato on a defence shield , on condition that the us postpones the deployment of parts of its global missile defense shield in eastern europe , " she said .
this rapprochement is partly motivated by a common threat - iran .
as francis tusa , veteran british defense analyst and writer military affairs , told deutsche welle , " if you look around at the world 's borders , you 'll see that russia is in a more risky position . "
bildunterschrift : us-russian relations have improved considerably under obama klein believes that russia 's signing of the start treaty was also motivated by necessity .
" russia saw that its strategic nuclear weapons arsenal will downsize anyway due to the age of the missiles , " she says .
" therefore , reducing its arsenal together with the usa offers the opportunity to remain on par with washington and reduce the financial burdens of its strategic nuclear arsenal . "
for its part , the us has been desperate to prevent russia selling arms to iran , and making a major agreement on a missile shield could be seen as an effective way to control the trade .
" the us has been very active in trying to persuade russia not to sell weapons to iran , " says tusa .
" but we know that russia has made deals with the iran in the past . "
several ways to skin a cat but the devil in any international agreement is in the proverbial details .
in this case , the detail is the actual military hardware up for discussion .
" there is some confusion about what kind of missile defense shields are being talked about , " says klein .
" there are theater missile defense -lrb- tmd -rrb- systems , designed to defend troops against shorter-range missiles , and the national missile defense -lrb- nmd -rrb- systems , designed to protect a whole nation or group of nations . "
though the more mobile tmds are typically used in actual war scenarios like afghanistan , they can be deployed as domestic defense systems instead of the larger nmds .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the air crash in smolensk may have improved polish-russian relations " there are several ways of skinning the cat , " says tusa .
" you could have linked batteries of tmd systems , which would be a lot cheaper . "
the variety of options and weapons technology is likely to dominate any negotiations , and could easily scupper the project .
both sides are likely to be wary of revealing too much of their own technology .
" i think the us state department 's concern at the moment is probably whether the russians are just there to have a look-see , " said tusa .
" they may say they 're interested in creating a joint defense shield just to see what the us has to offer , and then back out if it 's not enough . "
experience suggests that armies are extremely cagey about sharing technology , even with their partners .
" america 's main nato allies in europe - the uk and germany - basically never get to see any us military technology .
do we really believe that the state department is suddenly going to let russia see everything ? " asked tusa .
european complications but this does not exhaust all the complications that any large-scale collaboration would involve .
the european nato states where missile defense systems would be installed are unlikely to allow the negotiations to take place without their opinions being heard .
and these opinions are wide-ranging .
" europe encompasses several different views - eastern european countries obviously have a very different attitude to russia than western ones , " said tusa .
" the countries to the south-east will be more concerned about the threat from missiles , while countries in north-western europe less so . "
as so often , the importance of poland 's strategic position in europe could prove vital , and the country 's recently improved relations with russia may open to the door to a global project .
klein is optimistic : " poland is a very important member state in nato , and poland 's relations with russia will play an important part in the development of the missile defense shield .
for that reason the recent rapprochement between the two countries , which began well before the recent tragedy in smolensk , is a good sign . "

both sides are likely to be wary of revealing too much of their own technology .
" i think the us state department 's concern at the moment is probably whether the russians are just there to have a look-see , " said tusa .
" they may say they 're interested in creating a joint defense shield just to see what the us has to offer , and then back out if it 's not enough . "
experience suggests that armies are extremely cagey about sharing technology , even with their partners .
" america 's main nato allies in europe - the uk and germany - basically never get to see any us military technology .
do we really believe that the state department is suddenly going to let russia see everything ? " asked tusa .
european complications but this does not exhaust all the complications that any large-scale collaboration would involve .
the european nato states where missile defense systems would be installed are unlikely to allow the negotiations to take place without their opinions being heard .
and these opinions are wide-ranging .
" europe encompasses several different views - eastern european countries obviously have a very different attitude to russia than western ones , " said tusa .
" the countries to the south-east will be more concerned about the threat from missiles , while countries in north-western europe less so . "
as so often , the importance of poland 's strategic position in europe could prove vital , and the country 's recently improved relations with russia may open to the door to a global project .
klein is optimistic : " poland is a very important member state in nato , and poland 's relations with russia will play an important part in the development of the missile defense shield .
for that reason the recent rapprochement between the two countries , which began well before the recent tragedy in smolensk , is a good sign . "

but analysts are still cautious about its prospects . at a press conference on monday , nato secretary general anders rasmussen spoke about what he believed was the most serious security threat faced by europe .
" there is a growing missile threat , including from iran , " he said .
" and the politicians have a responsibility to protect the population . "
europe must " take its share in the joint protection from missile attacks . "
as far as nato is concerned , any hope of creating a missile defense system for europe rests on the cooperation of russia . moscow has persistently voiced its opposition to missile installations in eastern europe that it believes could be used as offensive weapons .
to this end , rasmussen has been working to bring nato and russia together to discuss the possibility .
speaking during a recent visit to london , nato spokesman james appathurai told reporters , " russia should be included in a missile defense system which covers europe . "
he said plans for a " new security architecture " should be " one roof which includes the russians as part of the same security family . "
the attempted cooperation has apparently met with some success .
at least one newspaper , the british independent , reported that secret talks had already begun between washington and moscow on the subject , though no further details were reported .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nmds are much more expensive than close range tmds the end of the george w. bush presidency certainly opened the door to a rapprochement between russia and the west , a process that has culminated in the recent signing of the nuclear disarmament strategic arms reduction treaty -lrb- start -rrb- treaty in prague .
many analysts were impressed at the speed with which president barack obama managed to instil enough trust in opposite number dmitry medvedev to bring him to a disarmament agreement .
just a start but many experts are still concerned whether obama 's so-called ' reset ' policy will be enough to allay russian concerns about a european missile shield .
margarete klein , senior associate at the german institute for international and security affairs -lrb- swp -rrb- , believes the former superpower enemies are still locked in a catch-22 stand-off .
" the crux of the problem is that such a defense shield would create a lot of trust between russia and nato , but would require a lot of trust in the first place , " she told deutsche welle .
but klein emphasized that there was a real willingness in russia to negotiate with the us , albeit with certain caveats .
" i think russia is open to cooperation with nato on a defence shield , on condition that the us postpones the deployment of parts of its global missile defense shield in eastern europe , " she said .
this rapprochement is partly motivated by a common threat - iran .
as francis tusa , veteran british defense analyst and writer military affairs , told deutsche welle , " if you look around at the world 's borders , you 'll see that russia is in a more risky position . "
bildunterschrift : us-russian relations have improved considerably under obama klein believes that russia 's signing of the start treaty was also motivated by necessity .
" russia saw that its strategic nuclear weapons arsenal will downsize anyway due to the age of the missiles , " she says .
" therefore , reducing its arsenal together with the usa offers the opportunity to remain on par with washington and reduce the financial burdens of its strategic nuclear arsenal . "
for its part , the us has been desperate to prevent russia selling arms to iran , and making a major agreement on a missile shield could be seen as an effective way to control the trade .
" the us has been very active in trying to persuade russia not to sell weapons to iran , " says tusa .
" but we know that russia has made deals with the iran in the past . "
several ways to skin a cat but the devil in any international agreement is in the proverbial details .
in this case , the detail is the actual military hardware up for discussion .
" there is some confusion about what kind of missile defense shields are being talked about , " says klein .
" there are theater missile defense -lrb- tmd -rrb- systems , designed to defend troops against shorter-range missiles , and the national missile defense -lrb- nmd -rrb- systems , designed to protect a whole nation or group of nations . "
though the more mobile tmds are typically used in actual war scenarios like afghanistan , they can be deployed as domestic defense systems instead of the larger nmds .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the air crash in smolensk may have improved polish-russian relations " there are several ways of skinning the cat , " says tusa .
" you could have linked batteries of tmd systems , which would be a lot cheaper . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : focus : nato faces a changing world with new challenges nato and russia seek to bury past differences lightning-fast us-eu summit in lisbon aims to revive ties nato to withdraw from afghanistan by 2014 as summit begins , nato missile shield a test of turkey 's allegiance nato -pipe- 20.04.2010 nato and russia edge warily toward a joint missile defense shield großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rasmussen has been trying to bring the usa and russia together nato secretary general anders rasmussen has appealed for a joint missile defense shield with russia to cover europe and offer protection from a possible terror attack .
but analysts are still cautious about its prospects . at a press conference on monday , nato secretary general anders rasmussen spoke about what he believed was the most serious security threat faced by europe .
" there is a growing missile threat , including from iran , " he said .
" and the politicians have a responsibility to protect the population . "
europe must " take its share in the joint protection from missile attacks . "
as far as nato is concerned , any hope of creating a missile defense system for europe rests on the cooperation of russia . moscow has persistently voiced its opposition to missile installations in eastern europe that it believes could be used as offensive weapons .
to this end , rasmussen has been working to bring nato and russia together to discuss the possibility .
speaking during a recent visit to london , nato spokesman james appathurai told reporters , " russia should be included in a missile defense system which covers europe . "
he said plans for a " new security architecture " should be " one roof which includes the russians as part of the same security family . "
the attempted cooperation has apparently met with some success .
at least one newspaper , the british independent , reported that secret talks had already begun between washington and moscow on the subject , though no further details were reported .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nmds are much more expensive than close range tmds the end of the george w. bush presidency certainly opened the door to a rapprochement between russia and the west , a process that has culminated in the recent signing of the nuclear disarmament strategic arms reduction treaty -lrb- start -rrb- treaty in prague .
many analysts were impressed at the speed with which president barack obama managed to instil enough trust in opposite number dmitry medvedev to bring him to a disarmament agreement .
just a start but many experts are still concerned whether obama 's so-called ' reset ' policy will be enough to allay russian concerns about a european missile shield .
margarete klein , senior associate at the german institute for international and security affairs -lrb- swp -rrb- , believes the former superpower enemies are still locked in a catch-22 stand-off .
" the crux of the problem is that such a defense shield would create a lot of trust between russia and nato , but would require a lot of trust in the first place , " she told deutsche welle .
but klein emphasized that there was a real willingness in russia to negotiate with the us , albeit with certain caveats .
" i think russia is open to cooperation with nato on a defence shield , on condition that the us postpones the deployment of parts of its global missile defense shield in eastern europe , " she said .
this rapprochement is partly motivated by a common threat - iran .
as francis tusa , veteran british defense analyst and writer military affairs , told deutsche welle , " if you look around at the world 's borders , you 'll see that russia is in a more risky position . "
bildunterschrift : us-russian relations have improved considerably under obama klein believes that russia 's signing of the start treaty was also motivated by necessity .
" russia saw that its strategic nuclear weapons arsenal will downsize anyway due to the age of the missiles , " she says .
" therefore , reducing its arsenal together with the usa offers the opportunity to remain on par with washington and reduce the financial burdens of its strategic nuclear arsenal . "
for its part , the us has been desperate to prevent russia selling arms to iran , and making a major agreement on a missile shield could be seen as an effective way to control the trade .
" the us has been very active in trying to persuade russia not to sell weapons to iran , " says tusa .
" but we know that russia has made deals with the iran in the past . "
several ways to skin a cat but the devil in any international agreement is in the proverbial details .
in this case , the detail is the actual military hardware up for discussion .
" there is some confusion about what kind of missile defense shields are being talked about , " says klein .
" there are theater missile defense -lrb- tmd -rrb- systems , designed to defend troops against shorter-range missiles , and the national missile defense -lrb- nmd -rrb- systems , designed to protect a whole nation or group of nations . "
though the more mobile tmds are typically used in actual war scenarios like afghanistan , they can be deployed as domestic defense systems instead of the larger nmds .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the air crash in smolensk may have improved polish-russian relations " there are several ways of skinning the cat , " says tusa .
" you could have linked batteries of tmd systems , which would be a lot cheaper . "
the variety of options and weapons technology is likely to dominate any negotiations , and could easily scupper the project .
both sides are likely to be wary of revealing too much of their own technology .
" i think the us state department 's concern at the moment is probably whether the russians are just there to have a look-see , " said tusa .
" they may say they 're interested in creating a joint defense shield just to see what the us has to offer , and then back out if it 's not enough . "
experience suggests that armies are extremely cagey about sharing technology , even with their partners .
" america 's main nato allies in europe - the uk and germany - basically never get to see any us military technology .
do we really believe that the state department is suddenly going to let russia see everything ? " asked tusa .
european complications but this does not exhaust all the complications that any large-scale collaboration would involve .
the european nato states where missile defense systems would be installed are unlikely to allow the negotiations to take place without their opinions being heard .
and these opinions are wide-ranging .
" europe encompasses several different views - eastern european countries obviously have a very different attitude to russia than western ones , " said tusa .
" the countries to the south-east will be more concerned about the threat from missiles , while countries in north-western europe less so . "
as so often , the importance of poland 's strategic position in europe could prove vital , and the country 's recently improved relations with russia may open to the door to a global project .
klein is optimistic : " poland is a very important member state in nato , and poland 's relations with russia will play an important part in the development of the missile defense shield .
for that reason the recent rapprochement between the two countries , which began well before the recent tragedy in smolensk , is a good sign . "

meanwhile , it is unclear where the ousted former president is located . in a fresh round of violence in kyrgyzstan , on monday hundreds of police officers were dispatched to suppress riots that started in a village outside of the capital , bishkek .
ethnic kyrgyz rioters seized plots of land from russians and turks in the village of mayevka , and in the subsequent violence five people were killed and many others injured .
" the crowd poured into mayevka and started wreaking destruction , robbing and killing .
they mainly robbed and burned the homes of turks living in the village , " alexander konstantin , a local resident , told journalists .
" all the provocateurs and ringleaders in the riots will be punished to the full extent of the law , " the interim government said in a statement released on tuesday .
the riot was the latest challenge to the interim government , which seized power earlier this month after a popular uprising that ousted president kurmanbek bakiyev .
however , so far the interim government has failed to establish full control over the country .
on monday , loyalists of the former president installed a pro-bakiyev governor after seizing a regional government in jalalabad .
bakiyev 's whereabouts unknown toppled president bakiyev was flown to kazakhstan last week in an attempt to reduce the risk of civil war in kyrgyzstan .
a spokesperson for the foreign ministry in kazakhstan confirmed to the ap news agency that bakiyev had left the country , but provided no further details about where he had gone .

the reopening of certain routes in europe has brought some respite to the thousands of people stranded in asia . despite the partial reopening of european air space , many asian carriers remained grounded for the sixth consecutive day due to huge volcanic ash clouds from iceland .
the cancellation of flights has not only left millions of people stranded , but also cast a cloud on asian business . binit somaia from the centre for asia pacific aviation in sydney says the impact is huge .
" for example in india , you have the start of the long summer school holidays , and a lot of people were looking forward to start departing for europe so the impact is there .
australia has a very high volume of traffic to europe .
likewise the countries that have airlines that act as major hub carriers such as cathay pacific from hong kong , or singapore airlines , gulf carriers such as ethihad and emirates are also affected . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iceland 's volcano is creating chaos not only in europe . exports and cargo affected even though the asian carriers have been able to continue their operation in the non european sectors as usual , they are expected to lose millions of dollars in revenue per day due to the disruption of flights in europe . asian exports and air cargo services have also been hit hard .
asian carriers transport a large percentage of cargo that includes mobile phones , high tech electronics and textiles . in south korea , a trade association estimated the country will post 112 million dollars -lrb- around 83 million euros -rrb- in lost exports caused by the ash cloud . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nissan says it has curtailed production at two plants due to delay of supply of parts thousands of factories in china 's guangdong province have also seen air freight delayed , mainly watches , jewellery and clothing . in japan , the carmaker nissan said it was being forced to suspend some vehicle production because of a shortage of parts that were supposed to come from ireland . impact on financial recovery experts fear the disruption of flights could slow down the regional recovery from the recent global economic slump . " this has come at a particularly bad time , " says somaia .
" after the financial crisis we saw last year , the market has just started to see some signs of recovery .
passenger numbers were increasing .
most carriers were looking forward to a much more buoyant market for the coming summer .
this has happened right at the start of this period . " but he maintains that the implications on the asian airlines as such will be minor : " they are relatively strong carriers compared to europe and america and a lot of the carriers in the region do have either full or partial ownership with the government .
therefore they will see some support in this period .
but it will not be easy and certainly some smaller carriers may expect some challenges to go ahead . " meanwhile weather experts in europe say they expect to see a change in wind conditions and rain over the weekend , which should help clear the ash cloud , sparking hopes that air traffic will soon fully resume . author : disha uppal editor : sarah berning send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de champions league -pipe- 20.04.2010 bayern fancy their chances against lyon in champions league semis großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : robben , olic and lahm are three key bayern players it 's been nearly a decade since a german team has made the final of club soccer 's premier competition .
now bayern are the favorites to break the dry spell .
but they should n't underestimate their opponents . going into the home-and-away tie against french side olympique lyon , to be played on april 21 and 27 , the words " bayern " and " major roll " were being used a lot together .
not only had the bavarians knocked out manchester united in the quarterfinals , they engaged in a bit of target practice in a 7-0 thrashing of hanover in the bundesliga .
with lyon in third place in france ligue 1 , this season represents the bavarians ' best chance of getting back to the champions league final since they won the title in 2000-01 .
and indeed , the bookmakers are tipping bayern as the clear favorites in this encounter .
this is the first time lyon have made it as far as the semifinals in the champions league , and bayern are a richer club that currently rides atop the table in a better league .
what 's more they have winger arjen robben , who 's playing the most dominant football of anyone in europe not named lionel messi .
but although coach louis van gaal 's side have every reason to believe a trip to the final in madrid on may 22 is within reach , they had best beware of the french side , which has made a habit this season of toppling big names .
giant killers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern need to watch out for lopez coach claude puel 's men did not get where they are by accident .
to progress beyond the group stage , lyon had to beat liverpool , and their round-of-16 opponents were no less than real madrid .
the french side has a top striker in argentinian lisandro lopez .
he 's scored seven goals in the champions league thus far , including a pair that sent lyon past rivals bordeaux in the quarterfinals .
but olympique 's real strength is defense .
puels usually gets 10 men behind the ball , and both liverpool and real were frustrated by lyon 's tenacity , wearing themselves out and getting punished on the counter-attack .
plus , they have the advantage of playing their first game away from home , where any goals scored put pressure on the opponents for the return leg .
that 's why bayern ceo karl-heinz rummenigge warned against over-confidence as the first leg approached .
" this is a match-up of equals , " rummenigge told reporters .
" we 're not the underdogs , but we 're not the favorites , either . "
dynamic duo bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : robben , in particular , is having a career season bayern have had to score a fair number of goals in their champions league campaign , and most have come from two men : robben and overachieving croatian striker ivica olic .
olic is one of the hardest working players in the business , and the bavarians will hope that his tireless forechecking will allow him to capitalize on defensive lapses in concentration , much as he did when he scored on a crucial last-second poach against manchester united in the quarterfinals .
olic could be key since bayern 's pair of true center forwards , mario gomez and miroslav klose , have both been out of form .
robben has been little short of unstoppable , confounding defenses with his incisive runs and lightning-quick shots on goal .
lyon will likely devote at least a couple of defenders to the dutch winger , which should open space on the left for his counterpart , frank ribery .
ribery , though , has become something of an enigma .
injured for much of the season , he seems to have temporarily lost some of his assurance with the ball , and his lone goal in the manchester united tie came on a terribly taken free kick that was lucky to be deflected off the wall .
and the frenchman is not bayern 's only worry .
question marks bildunterschrift : badstuber -lrb- right -rrb- , is one of bayern 's young defenders in both of their previous champions league ties , bayern have lost their away matches .
to take the pressure off , they need not only to win their home match but avoid conceding what could be deadly goals .
the bavarians ' defense has looked very solid in the league , but the squad van gaal is fielding is young .
on the left , both 19-year-old diego contento and 21-year-old holger badstuber have sometimes looked out of their depth against top european opposition .
moreover , on the right philipp lahm - usually one of the best defensive players in the world - has looked out of sorts for most of this season .
nonetheless , despite these potential weaknesses and regardless of what bayern 's bosses were saying before the tie , munich are the favorites in this match-up , and they know it .
if their defense can rise to the occasion and their men up front get the job done in the allianz arena , they 'll be in an excellent position to return to european club football 's biggest match .

now bayern are the favorites to break the dry spell .
but they should n't underestimate their opponents . going into the home-and-away tie against french side olympique lyon , to be played on april 21 and 27 , the words " bayern " and " major roll " were being used a lot together .
not only had the bavarians knocked out manchester united in the quarterfinals , they engaged in a bit of target practice in a 7-0 thrashing of hanover in the bundesliga .
with lyon in third place in france ligue 1 , this season represents the bavarians ' best chance of getting back to the champions league final since they won the title in 2000-01 .
and indeed , the bookmakers are tipping bayern as the clear favorites in this encounter .
this is the first time lyon have made it as far as the semifinals in the champions league , and bayern are a richer club that currently rides atop the table in a better league .
what 's more they have winger arjen robben , who 's playing the most dominant football of anyone in europe not named lionel messi .
but although coach louis van gaal 's side have every reason to believe a trip to the final in madrid on may 22 is within reach , they had best beware of the french side , which has made a habit this season of toppling big names .
giant killers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern need to watch out for lopez coach claude puel 's men did not get where they are by accident .
to progress beyond the group stage , lyon had to beat liverpool , and their round-of-16 opponents were no less than real madrid .
the french side has a top striker in argentinian lisandro lopez .
he 's scored seven goals in the champions league thus far , including a pair that sent lyon past rivals bordeaux in the quarterfinals .
but olympique 's real strength is defense .
puels usually gets 10 men behind the ball , and both liverpool and real were frustrated by lyon 's tenacity , wearing themselves out and getting punished on the counter-attack .
plus , they have the advantage of playing their first game away from home , where any goals scored put pressure on the opponents for the return leg .
that 's why bayern ceo karl-heinz rummenigge warned against over-confidence as the first leg approached .
" this is a match-up of equals , " rummenigge told reporters .
" we 're not the underdogs , but we 're not the favorites , either . "
dynamic duo bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : robben , in particular , is having a career season bayern have had to score a fair number of goals in their champions league campaign , and most have come from two men : robben and overachieving croatian striker ivica olic .
olic is one of the hardest working players in the business , and the bavarians will hope that his tireless forechecking will allow him to capitalize on defensive lapses in concentration , much as he did when he scored on a crucial last-second poach against manchester united in the quarterfinals .
olic could be key since bayern 's pair of true center forwards , mario gomez and miroslav klose , have both been out of form .
robben has been little short of unstoppable , confounding defenses with his incisive runs and lightning-quick shots on goal .
lyon will likely devote at least a couple of defenders to the dutch winger , which should open space on the left for his counterpart , frank ribery .
ribery , though , has become something of an enigma .
injured for much of the season , he seems to have temporarily lost some of his assurance with the ball , and his lone goal in the manchester united tie came on a terribly taken free kick that was lucky to be deflected off the wall .
and the frenchman is not bayern 's only worry .
question marks bildunterschrift : badstuber -lrb- right -rrb- , is one of bayern 's young defenders in both of their previous champions league ties , bayern have lost their away matches .
to take the pressure off , they need not only to win their home match but avoid conceding what could be deadly goals .
the bavarians ' defense has looked very solid in the league , but the squad van gaal is fielding is young .
on the left , both 19-year-old diego contento and 21-year-old holger badstuber have sometimes looked out of their depth against top european opposition .
moreover , on the right philipp lahm - usually one of the best defensive players in the world - has looked out of sorts for most of this season .
nonetheless , despite these potential weaknesses and regardless of what bayern 's bosses were saying before the tie , munich are the favorites in this match-up , and they know it .
if their defense can rise to the occasion and their men up front get the job done in the allianz arena , they 'll be in an excellent position to return to european club football 's biggest match .

in his annual address to parliament , putin expressed confidence that russia would exceed the official growth forecast of 3.1 percent in 2010 .
" provisional results for the first quarter fuel optimism . this allows us to say that the recession is over .
this does not mean that the crisis is over , " putin said .
putin concentrated on the merits of responsible fiscal policy , saying that russia did not want to have to " go with our hands outstretched to somebody , losing our economic and then our political sovereignty . "
although russia was hard hit by the economic crisis , with gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- shrinking by 7.9 percent in 2009 , it did not request help from the international monetary fund , unlike its neighbour ukraine .
healthcare reform putin proposed a reform of state finances in order to halve the budget deficit to 3 percent of gdp by 2012 , although he did not go into detail .
a planned rise in social security tax will go ahead from next year , and the prime minister said it would be used for a reform of the healthcare system .

he said the government would reform the agencies that regulate business and drop restrictions for start-up companies .
in a world bank list of attractive business climates , russia only ranks 120th , due to low transparency and impenetrable bureaucracy .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de medicine -pipe- 20.04.2010 tailor-making cancer treatments großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ugly face of cancern cells cancer researchers in berlin are working on a genome sequencing project .
it promises an individualized approach to a disease that still defies complete medical comprehension . with almost half a million people in germany expected to fall prey to cancer this year , some 1,800 of them under the age of 15 , scientists at berlin 's charité hospital are working on a new form of treatment .
they hope it will help transform cancer into a chronic rather than a fatal illness .
they are beginning to understand that each tumor - an accumulation of genetic mutations - has its own genetic makeup .
and as reinhold schafer , deputy director of the charité comprehensive cancer center in berlin explained , in keeping with that discovery , they are now working on personalized approach for individual patients .
" we are beginning to understand that a cancer genome carries many more mutations than we would have anticipated , " he told deutsche welle .
" so far we are dealing with a handful of mutations , so called driver mutations , which drive the onset and are also responsible for the maintenance of the cancer phenotype . "
impotent mix as things stand , cancer patients can expect to be treated with a concoction of different and expensive drugs , some of which will have absolutely no effect on certain tumors , but which will do serious harm to other tissues in a given patient 's body .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : images from a mamogram , screening for the prevention of breast cancer that is where genome sequencing technology comes in .
as it becomes less expensive and more accessible , the potential for an individualized approach to cancer treatment is becoming a reality .
and that is good news for schafer and his colleagues on the treat1000 project , which plans to do as its name suggests .
" the idea is to use deep sequencing technology to comprehensively assess the cancer genomes of these thousand patients and to compare the cancer genomes with a constitutive situation in order to find out which are the cancer-specific molecular alterations in these patients . "
conventional cancer medicine has focused on driver mutations , which are a kind of common denominator between cancers of the same type .
schafer , however , is exploring " passenger mutations , " which are unique to each patient .
" there 's a bunch - hundreds , thousands - of mutations that occur in cancer patients , and so far we do n't have any idea what they are doing at the functional level , but they are there . "
bar code for cancer the researcher describes the combination of passenger mutations as an " individual bar code " for cancer .
as personalized treatment becomes more advanced , oncologists will be able to target specific mutations with combinations of drugs they know have a high probability of working .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a patient receives radiation therapy for cancer hans lehrach , head of vertebrate genomics at the max planck institute for molecular genetics in berlin , says using computer modeling makes it possible to sort through thousands of drug candidates in search of a combination which can combat a tumor while minimizing damage to a patients ' overall health .
the procedure requires researchers to take dna samples from patients ' blood and tumor and decode the genetic information of both .
" we can combine that with the results from decades of cancer research which has given us a very large amount of information on the pathways which connect the different components we see in the sequencing , " lehrach told deutsche welle .
scientific evolution improvements in genome sequencing technology have made treat1000 a viable project .
it currently takes lehrach and his team about 10 days to sequence a human genome .
by comparison , the original human genome project took from 1990 to 2003 to first identify and sequence human dna .
but both science and technology have moved on since then .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's charité hospital " we can try the wrong treatment thousands of times on the computer model but before we go to the patient we should be very sure that whatever we do will help the patient , it will not have any unacceptable side effects , " lehrach said .
lehrach hopes an individualized approach to cancer treatment would enable doctors to respond to changes in tumors and better control them .
but personalized medicine does n't only have the potential to change the fates of cancer patients , it is also likely to drastically change the way clinical trials of drugs are conducted .
more personal all-round clinical trials are n't currently stratified by the genetic profiles of their participants .
patients suffering from the same tumor all receive identical treatments , a practice which may have caused research on some drugs to be discontinued on account of their apparently low rate of effectiveness .
however those drugs may be highly effective if tested on a subset of patients who share similarities in their ' bar code ' of passenger mutations .
and that , says schafer , means the cancer battle of the future will become about tailoring treatments to the genetic profiles of individual patients .
" some people even believe it 's the big revolution in medicine , but time will tell , " schafer said .
" i guess it 's more or less a series of little revolutions , little progress , but steady progress .
hopefully . "

it promises an individualized approach to a disease that still defies complete medical comprehension . with almost half a million people in germany expected to fall prey to cancer this year , some 1,800 of them under the age of 15 , scientists at berlin 's charité hospital are working on a new form of treatment .
they hope it will help transform cancer into a chronic rather than a fatal illness .
they are beginning to understand that each tumor - an accumulation of genetic mutations - has its own genetic makeup .
and as reinhold schafer , deputy director of the charité comprehensive cancer center in berlin explained , in keeping with that discovery , they are now working on personalized approach for individual patients .
" we are beginning to understand that a cancer genome carries many more mutations than we would have anticipated , " he told deutsche welle .
" so far we are dealing with a handful of mutations , so called driver mutations , which drive the onset and are also responsible for the maintenance of the cancer phenotype . "
impotent mix as things stand , cancer patients can expect to be treated with a concoction of different and expensive drugs , some of which will have absolutely no effect on certain tumors , but which will do serious harm to other tissues in a given patient 's body .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : images from a mamogram , screening for the prevention of breast cancer that is where genome sequencing technology comes in .
as it becomes less expensive and more accessible , the potential for an individualized approach to cancer treatment is becoming a reality .
and that is good news for schafer and his colleagues on the treat1000 project , which plans to do as its name suggests .
" the idea is to use deep sequencing technology to comprehensively assess the cancer genomes of these thousand patients and to compare the cancer genomes with a constitutive situation in order to find out which are the cancer-specific molecular alterations in these patients . "
conventional cancer medicine has focused on driver mutations , which are a kind of common denominator between cancers of the same type .
schafer , however , is exploring " passenger mutations , " which are unique to each patient .
" there 's a bunch - hundreds , thousands - of mutations that occur in cancer patients , and so far we do n't have any idea what they are doing at the functional level , but they are there . "
bar code for cancer the researcher describes the combination of passenger mutations as an " individual bar code " for cancer .
as personalized treatment becomes more advanced , oncologists will be able to target specific mutations with combinations of drugs they know have a high probability of working .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a patient receives radiation therapy for cancer hans lehrach , head of vertebrate genomics at the max planck institute for molecular genetics in berlin , says using computer modeling makes it possible to sort through thousands of drug candidates in search of a combination which can combat a tumor while minimizing damage to a patients ' overall health .
the procedure requires researchers to take dna samples from patients ' blood and tumor and decode the genetic information of both .
" we can combine that with the results from decades of cancer research which has given us a very large amount of information on the pathways which connect the different components we see in the sequencing , " lehrach told deutsche welle .
scientific evolution improvements in genome sequencing technology have made treat1000 a viable project .
it currently takes lehrach and his team about 10 days to sequence a human genome .
by comparison , the original human genome project took from 1990 to 2003 to first identify and sequence human dna .
but both science and technology have moved on since then .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's charité hospital " we can try the wrong treatment thousands of times on the computer model but before we go to the patient we should be very sure that whatever we do will help the patient , it will not have any unacceptable side effects , " lehrach said .
lehrach hopes an individualized approach to cancer treatment would enable doctors to respond to changes in tumors and better control them .
but personalized medicine does n't only have the potential to change the fates of cancer patients , it is also likely to drastically change the way clinical trials of drugs are conducted .
more personal all-round clinical trials are n't currently stratified by the genetic profiles of their participants .
patients suffering from the same tumor all receive identical treatments , a practice which may have caused research on some drugs to be discontinued on account of their apparently low rate of effectiveness .
however those drugs may be highly effective if tested on a subset of patients who share similarities in their ' bar code ' of passenger mutations .
and that , says schafer , means the cancer battle of the future will become about tailoring treatments to the genetic profiles of individual patients .
" some people even believe it 's the big revolution in medicine , but time will tell , " schafer said .
" i guess it 's more or less a series of little revolutions , little progress , but steady progress .
hopefully . "

the takeover - the most expensive in the german company 's history - is aimed at strengthening its passenger business throughout europe . british train and bus operator arriva has confirmed that german state rail company deutsche bahn is willing to pay 1.54 billion pounds -lrb- 1.8 billion euros -rrb- in cash to buy its operations as advanced talks continue .
media reports said that if arriva 's debt is taken into account , the total value of the offer is 2.7 billion euros .
reuters news agency quoted sources close to the deal who said the takeover would be financed entirely through the issuance of bonds , and could be approved by deutsche bahn 's supervisory board as early as next week .
the acquisition , which would confirm deutsche bahn as europe 's largest rail transport operator , could also trigger a wave of consolidation in the rail sector .
french rail company sncf , which held talks with arriva as well , is equally keen to expand its footprint throughout europe .
deutsche bahn and arriva have been in talks for several weeks .
the german operator has made no secret of its interest in acquiring the uk company , which operates bus networks , rail franchises and other transportation services in 12 european countries .

last month at the presentation of the group 's financial results , deutsche bahn chief executive officer ruediger grube said the company plans to run its high-speed long-distance trains through the channel tunnel and " further actively expand " its business activities beyond germany 's national borders .
deutsche bahn is keen to move beyond its home territory as germany 's domestic rail market opens up to competition .
the uk is high on its list of target countries .
the rail company has already made a number of acquisitions in britain including chiltern railways , which offers service between marylebone and birmingham , and ews , the freight operator .
it also runs the tyne & wear metro and holds a 50 percent stake in the london overground rail network .
pros and cons richard talbot , an analyst with the railway consultancy in london , said a takeover of arriva could benefit the uk rail market in several ways .
" deutsche bahn would bring technology know-how and system management skills , " he said .
" the company would also be another powerful player competing in the franchise bidding process . "
commuters who use uk trains also see benefits .
" trains in the uk have a very poor reputation when it comes to service , punctuality and cost , " said chris manning , a businessman who commutes daily by train to london and who is familiar with german service .

the takeover - the most expensive in the german company 's history - is aimed at strengthening its passenger business throughout europe . british train and bus operator arriva has confirmed that german state rail company deutsche bahn is willing to pay 1.54 billion pounds -lrb- 1.8 billion euros -rrb- in cash to buy its operations as advanced talks continue .
media reports said that if arriva 's debt is taken into account , the total value of the offer is 2.7 billion euros .
reuters news agency quoted sources close to the deal who said the takeover would be financed entirely through the issuance of bonds , and could be approved by deutsche bahn 's supervisory board as early as next week .
the acquisition , which would confirm deutsche bahn as europe 's largest rail transport operator , could also trigger a wave of consolidation in the rail sector .
french rail company sncf , which held talks with arriva as well , is equally keen to expand its footprint throughout europe .
deutsche bahn and arriva have been in talks for several weeks .
the german operator has made no secret of its interest in acquiring the uk company , which operates bus networks , rail franchises and other transportation services in 12 european countries .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche bahn sees little room for growth in the german market key asset arriva is the only big british transport group to have ventured into europe , where it has taken advantage of gradual market liberalization .
its european operations account for nearly half of its revenue .
last month at the presentation of the group 's financial results , deutsche bahn chief executive officer ruediger grube said the company plans to run its high-speed long-distance trains through the channel tunnel and " further actively expand " its business activities beyond germany 's national borders .
deutsche bahn is keen to move beyond its home territory as germany 's domestic rail market opens up to competition .
the uk is high on its list of target countries .
the rail company has already made a number of acquisitions in britain including chiltern railways , which offers service between marylebone and birmingham , and ews , the freight operator .
it also runs the tyne & wear metro and holds a 50 percent stake in the london overground rail network .
pros and cons richard talbot , an analyst with the railway consultancy in london , said a takeover of arriva could benefit the uk rail market in several ways .
" deutsche bahn would bring technology know-how and system management skills , " he said .
" the company would also be another powerful player competing in the franchise bidding process . "
commuters who use uk trains also see benefits .
" trains in the uk have a very poor reputation when it comes to service , punctuality and cost , " said chris manning , a businessman who commutes daily by train to london and who is familiar with german service .
" they need to face competition from continental train companies like deutsche bahn to improve quality .
these operators are light years ahead . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 20.04.2010 volcanic ash clouds hit asian business großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : passengers stranded at beijing 's international airport authorities in europe have resumed some flights , which were disrupted because of the volcanic ash cloud from iceland over the last six days .
the reopening of certain routes in europe has brought some respite to the thousands of people stranded in asia . despite the partial reopening of european air space , many asian carriers remained grounded for the sixth consecutive day due to huge volcanic ash clouds from iceland .
the cancellation of flights has not only left millions of people stranded , but also cast a cloud on asian business . binit somaia from the centre for asia pacific aviation in sydney says the impact is huge .
" for example in india , you have the start of the long summer school holidays , and a lot of people were looking forward to start departing for europe so the impact is there .
australia has a very high volume of traffic to europe .
likewise the countries that have airlines that act as major hub carriers such as cathay pacific from hong kong , or singapore airlines , gulf carriers such as ethihad and emirates are also affected . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iceland 's volcano is creating chaos not only in europe . exports and cargo affected even though the asian carriers have been able to continue their operation in the non european sectors as usual , they are expected to lose millions of dollars in revenue per day due to the disruption of flights in europe . asian exports and air cargo services have also been hit hard .
asian carriers transport a large percentage of cargo that includes mobile phones , high tech electronics and textiles . in south korea , a trade association estimated the country will post 112 million dollars -lrb- around 83 million euros -rrb- in lost exports caused by the ash cloud . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nissan says it has curtailed production at two plants due to delay of supply of parts thousands of factories in china 's guangdong province have also seen air freight delayed , mainly watches , jewellery and clothing . in japan , the carmaker nissan said it was being forced to suspend some vehicle production because of a shortage of parts that were supposed to come from ireland . impact on financial recovery experts fear the disruption of flights could slow down the regional recovery from the recent global economic slump . " this has come at a particularly bad time , " says somaia .
" after the financial crisis we saw last year , the market has just started to see some signs of recovery .
passenger numbers were increasing .
most carriers were looking forward to a much more buoyant market for the coming summer .
this has happened right at the start of this period . " but he maintains that the implications on the asian airlines as such will be minor : " they are relatively strong carriers compared to europe and america and a lot of the carriers in the region do have either full or partial ownership with the government .

the reopening of certain routes in europe has brought some respite to the thousands of people stranded in asia . despite the partial reopening of european air space , many asian carriers remained grounded for the sixth consecutive day due to huge volcanic ash clouds from iceland .
the cancellation of flights has not only left millions of people stranded , but also cast a cloud on asian business . binit somaia from the centre for asia pacific aviation in sydney says the impact is huge .
" for example in india , you have the start of the long summer school holidays , and a lot of people were looking forward to start departing for europe so the impact is there .
australia has a very high volume of traffic to europe .

asian carriers transport a large percentage of cargo that includes mobile phones , high tech electronics and textiles . in south korea , a trade association estimated the country will post 112 million dollars -lrb- around 83 million euros -rrb- in lost exports caused by the ash cloud . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nissan says it has curtailed production at two plants due to delay of supply of parts thousands of factories in china 's guangdong province have also seen air freight delayed , mainly watches , jewellery and clothing . in japan , the carmaker nissan said it was being forced to suspend some vehicle production because of a shortage of parts that were supposed to come from ireland . impact on financial recovery experts fear the disruption of flights could slow down the regional recovery from the recent global economic slump .

but early signs of disaster , like increasingly saline groundwater and dwindling freshwater reserves , are already visible . last fall , island nations made a dramatic appeal to industrialized countries : " my country is on the verge of being submerged , " emanuel mori , the president of micronesia , told representatives of the european union at the time .
he demanded that western countries finally rethink their climate policies .
island states like micronesia have been hit particularly hard by global warming , primarily through rising sea levels .
there are real fears that the country could disappear from the world map in the not-too-distant future .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rising water levels are threatening micronesia 's coastlines the signs of the looming disaster are already there : rising sea levels have mixed salt water with the groundwater in several areas .
that , in turn , is shrinking drinking water reserves and making it harder to irrigate agricultural land .
the high level of salinity has poisoned the ground and made it infertile for years .
" it 's a particularly tough situation for small island nations , " juergen kropp of the potsdam institute of climate impact research said .
he added that these nations already had limited groundwater reserves .
island states not the only ones affected but it 's not just places like micronesia that are grappling with the problem of increasing salinity in the groundwater .
many other regions with long coastlines , for instance the gaza strip , are faced with similar problems .
the gaza strip is one of the most crowded places in the world , and that dense population puts great pressure on the region 's water supply .
experts say it is another important cause of saline groundwater .
" sea water can only intrude in places where water has been drained previously , " kropp said .
if groundwater turns saline , he said , it shows that more groundwater was used than can be replaced .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more demand for water can lead to rising salinity in groundwater philip magiera of the state-funded gtz development organization in germany said there are two ways to tackle the issue - either by increasing the existing water supply , or by limiting demand for it .
" i 'm a big fan of water efficiency , " magiera said .
there are lots of examples of how water usage can be reduced , he said , particularly in the agricultural sector .
in many regions , up to 70 percent of the groundwater is used to irrigate fields .
but with systems such as drip irrigation , it 's possible to save large quantities of water .
water wastage a major problem often , a lot of water is simply wasted on the way to the end consumer .
many countries struggle with leaky piping systems .
in such cases , experts say , it makes more sense to first fix the leaks before more water is pumped into the system .
" even in households , there are often possibilities to save water , " magiera said .
effective use of water can also be achieved through economic measures such as regulating water prices .
if all water-saving measures are exhausted , then increasing fresh water reserves is the only option .
if water can not be imported , then the sea water must be desalinated .
" technically , that 's not a problem anymore today , " said kropp .
sea water desalination is practiced in countries such as israel or saudi arabia .
the united arab emirates are almost entirely dependent on desalinated sea water .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the uae meets its needs for freshwater through desalination plants but one of the problems that can crop up is that desalination plants are highly energy-intensive .
and that energy is largely achieved in the middle east by burning fossil-based fuel .
that releases carbon dioxide into the atmosphere and in turn accelerates climate change .
traditional solutions desalination plants have been set up in places like micronesia .
but these are mostly small plants with very low capacities .
bigger installations are too expensive .
and there 's a lack of energy reserves to power them .
magiera said that in this case , the answer would be to turn to traditional measures - such as harvesting rainwater - instead of high-tech solutions .

there are fears that this could jeopardize his place as number one goalie during the soccer tournament , which starts on june 11 .

lukashenko also said that bakiyev still considers himself the president of kyrgyzstan .
bakiyev , who was deposed after an uprising on april 7 that left at least 85 people dead , fled to neighboring kazakhstan last thursday , where he resigned in an internationally-brokered agreement designed to restore calm .
there had been speculation that lukashenko , who has ruled belarus since 1994 and is known for his zero-tolerance of any kind of dissent , would take bakiyev in .

interim leaders hold him reponsible for most of the deaths during the april 7 uprising .

uzbek leader islam karimov said he was concerned that instability in kyrgyzstan might " become permanent . "

the takeover - the most expensive in the german company 's history - is aimed at strengthening its passenger business throughout europe . british train and bus operator arriva has confirmed that german state rail company deutsche bahn is willing to pay 1.54 billion pounds -lrb- 1.8 billion euros -rrb- in cash to buy its operations as advanced talks continue .
media reports said that if arriva 's debt is taken into account , the total value of the offer is 2.7 billion euros .
reuters news agency quoted sources close to the deal who said the takeover would be financed entirely through the issuance of bonds , and could be approved by deutsche bahn 's supervisory board as early as next week .
the acquisition , which would confirm deutsche bahn as europe 's largest rail transport operator , could also trigger a wave of consolidation in the rail sector .
french rail company sncf , which held talks with arriva as well , is equally keen to expand its footprint throughout europe .
deutsche bahn and arriva have been in talks for several weeks .
the german operator has made no secret of its interest in acquiring the uk company , which operates bus networks , rail franchises and other transportation services in 12 european countries .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche bahn sees little room for growth in the german market key asset arriva is the only big british transport group to have ventured into europe , where it has taken advantage of gradual market liberalization .
its european operations account for nearly half of its revenue .
last month at the presentation of the group 's financial results , deutsche bahn chief executive officer ruediger grube said the company plans to run its high-speed long-distance trains through the channel tunnel and " further actively expand " its business activities beyond germany 's national borders .
deutsche bahn is keen to move beyond its home territory as germany 's domestic rail market opens up to competition .
the uk is high on its list of target countries .
the rail company has already made a number of acquisitions in britain including chiltern railways , which offers service between marylebone and birmingham , and ews , the freight operator .
it also runs the tyne & wear metro and holds a 50 percent stake in the london overground rail network .
pros and cons richard talbot , an analyst with the railway consultancy in london , said a takeover of arriva could benefit the uk rail market in several ways .
" deutsche bahn would bring technology know-how and system management skills , " he said .
" the company would also be another powerful player competing in the franchise bidding process . "
commuters who use uk trains also see benefits .
" trains in the uk have a very poor reputation when it comes to service , punctuality and cost , " said chris manning , a businessman who commutes daily by train to london and who is familiar with german service .
" they need to face competition from continental train companies like deutsche bahn to improve quality .
these operators are light years ahead . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics say britain 's rail network could use some german efficiency but consultant talbot also warned that consolidation could have its drawbacks .
" small can be beautiful , especially when it comes to regional operators that provide a good service cost-efficiently , " he said .

the takeover - the most expensive in the german company 's history - is aimed at strengthening its passenger business throughout europe . british train and bus operator arriva has confirmed that german state rail company deutsche bahn is willing to pay 1.54 billion pounds -lrb- 1.8 billion euros -rrb- in cash to buy its operations as advanced talks continue .
media reports said that if arriva 's debt is taken into account , the total value of the offer is 2.7 billion euros .
reuters news agency quoted sources close to the deal who said the takeover would be financed entirely through the issuance of bonds , and could be approved by deutsche bahn 's supervisory board as early as next week .
the acquisition , which would confirm deutsche bahn as europe 's largest rail transport operator , could also trigger a wave of consolidation in the rail sector .
french rail company sncf , which held talks with arriva as well , is equally keen to expand its footprint throughout europe .
deutsche bahn and arriva have been in talks for several weeks .
the german operator has made no secret of its interest in acquiring the uk company , which operates bus networks , rail franchises and other transportation services in 12 european countries .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche bahn sees little room for growth in the german market key asset arriva is the only big british transport group to have ventured into europe , where it has taken advantage of gradual market liberalization .
its european operations account for nearly half of its revenue .
last month at the presentation of the group 's financial results , deutsche bahn chief executive officer ruediger grube said the company plans to run its high-speed long-distance trains through the channel tunnel and " further actively expand " its business activities beyond germany 's national borders .
deutsche bahn is keen to move beyond its home territory as germany 's domestic rail market opens up to competition .
the uk is high on its list of target countries .
the rail company has already made a number of acquisitions in britain including chiltern railways , which offers service between marylebone and birmingham , and ews , the freight operator .
it also runs the tyne & wear metro and holds a 50 percent stake in the london overground rail network .
pros and cons richard talbot , an analyst with the railway consultancy in london , said a takeover of arriva could benefit the uk rail market in several ways .
" deutsche bahn would bring technology know-how and system management skills , " he said .
" the company would also be another powerful player competing in the franchise bidding process . "
commuters who use uk trains also see benefits .
" trains in the uk have a very poor reputation when it comes to service , punctuality and cost , " said chris manning , a businessman who commutes daily by train to london and who is familiar with german service .
" they need to face competition from continental train companies like deutsche bahn to improve quality .
these operators are light years ahead . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics say britain 's rail network could use some german efficiency but consultant talbot also warned that consolidation could have its drawbacks .
" small can be beautiful , especially when it comes to regional operators that provide a good service cost-efficiently , " he said .
" big is n't always necessarily better . "
indeed , some critics of deutsche bahn say the state-owned company , which is known for its bureaucracy , could be overextending its resources with its ambitious expansion plans . author : john blau editor : samuel edmonds send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de medicine -pipe- 20.04.2010 tailor-making cancer treatments großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ugly face of cancern cells cancer researchers in berlin are working on a genome sequencing project .
it promises an individualized approach to a disease that still defies complete medical comprehension . with almost half a million people in germany expected to fall prey to cancer this year , some 1,800 of them under the age of 15 , scientists at berlin 's charité hospital are working on a new form of treatment .
they hope it will help transform cancer into a chronic rather than a fatal illness .
they are beginning to understand that each tumor - an accumulation of genetic mutations - has its own genetic makeup .
and as reinhold schafer , deputy director of the charité comprehensive cancer center in berlin explained , in keeping with that discovery , they are now working on personalized approach for individual patients .
" we are beginning to understand that a cancer genome carries many more mutations than we would have anticipated , " he told deutsche welle .
" so far we are dealing with a handful of mutations , so called driver mutations , which drive the onset and are also responsible for the maintenance of the cancer phenotype . "
impotent mix as things stand , cancer patients can expect to be treated with a concoction of different and expensive drugs , some of which will have absolutely no effect on certain tumors , but which will do serious harm to other tissues in a given patient 's body .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : images from a mamogram , screening for the prevention of breast cancer that is where genome sequencing technology comes in .
as it becomes less expensive and more accessible , the potential for an individualized approach to cancer treatment is becoming a reality .
and that is good news for schafer and his colleagues on the treat1000 project , which plans to do as its name suggests .
" the idea is to use deep sequencing technology to comprehensively assess the cancer genomes of these thousand patients and to compare the cancer genomes with a constitutive situation in order to find out which are the cancer-specific molecular alterations in these patients . "
conventional cancer medicine has focused on driver mutations , which are a kind of common denominator between cancers of the same type .
schafer , however , is exploring " passenger mutations , " which are unique to each patient .
" there 's a bunch - hundreds , thousands - of mutations that occur in cancer patients , and so far we do n't have any idea what they are doing at the functional level , but they are there . "
bar code for cancer the researcher describes the combination of passenger mutations as an " individual bar code " for cancer .
as personalized treatment becomes more advanced , oncologists will be able to target specific mutations with combinations of drugs they know have a high probability of working .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a patient receives radiation therapy for cancer hans lehrach , head of vertebrate genomics at the max planck institute for molecular genetics in berlin , says using computer modeling makes it possible to sort through thousands of drug candidates in search of a combination which can combat a tumor while minimizing damage to a patients ' overall health .
the procedure requires researchers to take dna samples from patients ' blood and tumor and decode the genetic information of both .
" we can combine that with the results from decades of cancer research which has given us a very large amount of information on the pathways which connect the different components we see in the sequencing , " lehrach told deutsche welle .
scientific evolution improvements in genome sequencing technology have made treat1000 a viable project .
it currently takes lehrach and his team about 10 days to sequence a human genome .
by comparison , the original human genome project took from 1990 to 2003 to first identify and sequence human dna .
but both science and technology have moved on since then .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's charité hospital " we can try the wrong treatment thousands of times on the computer model but before we go to the patient we should be very sure that whatever we do will help the patient , it will not have any unacceptable side effects , " lehrach said .
lehrach hopes an individualized approach to cancer treatment would enable doctors to respond to changes in tumors and better control them .
but personalized medicine does n't only have the potential to change the fates of cancer patients , it is also likely to drastically change the way clinical trials of drugs are conducted .
more personal all-round clinical trials are n't currently stratified by the genetic profiles of their participants .
patients suffering from the same tumor all receive identical treatments , a practice which may have caused research on some drugs to be discontinued on account of their apparently low rate of effectiveness .
however those drugs may be highly effective if tested on a subset of patients who share similarities in their ' bar code ' of passenger mutations .
and that , says schafer , means the cancer battle of the future will become about tailoring treatments to the genetic profiles of individual patients .
" some people even believe it 's the big revolution in medicine , but time will tell , " schafer said .
" i guess it 's more or less a series of little revolutions , little progress , but steady progress .
hopefully . "

" provisional results for the first quarter fuel optimism . this allows us to say that the recession is over .

putin concentrated on the merits of responsible fiscal policy , saying that russia did not want to have to " go with our hands outstretched to somebody , losing our economic and then our political sovereignty . "

but early signs of disaster , like increasingly saline groundwater and dwindling freshwater reserves , are already visible . last fall , island nations made a dramatic appeal to industrialized countries : " my country is on the verge of being submerged , " emanuel mori , the president of micronesia , told representatives of the european union at the time .
he demanded that western countries finally rethink their climate policies .
island states like micronesia have been hit particularly hard by global warming , primarily through rising sea levels .
there are real fears that the country could disappear from the world map in the not-too-distant future .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rising water levels are threatening micronesia 's coastlines the signs of the looming disaster are already there : rising sea levels have mixed salt water with the groundwater in several areas .
that , in turn , is shrinking drinking water reserves and making it harder to irrigate agricultural land .
the high level of salinity has poisoned the ground and made it infertile for years .
" it 's a particularly tough situation for small island nations , " juergen kropp of the potsdam institute of climate impact research said .
he added that these nations already had limited groundwater reserves .
island states not the only ones affected but it 's not just places like micronesia that are grappling with the problem of increasing salinity in the groundwater .
many other regions with long coastlines , for instance the gaza strip , are faced with similar problems .
the gaza strip is one of the most crowded places in the world , and that dense population puts great pressure on the region 's water supply .
experts say it is another important cause of saline groundwater .
" sea water can only intrude in places where water has been drained previously , " kropp said .
if groundwater turns saline , he said , it shows that more groundwater was used than can be replaced .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more demand for water can lead to rising salinity in groundwater philip magiera of the state-funded gtz development organization in germany said there are two ways to tackle the issue - either by increasing the existing water supply , or by limiting demand for it .
" i 'm a big fan of water efficiency , " magiera said .
there are lots of examples of how water usage can be reduced , he said , particularly in the agricultural sector .
in many regions , up to 70 percent of the groundwater is used to irrigate fields .
but with systems such as drip irrigation , it 's possible to save large quantities of water .
water wastage a major problem often , a lot of water is simply wasted on the way to the end consumer .
many countries struggle with leaky piping systems .
in such cases , experts say , it makes more sense to first fix the leaks before more water is pumped into the system .
" even in households , there are often possibilities to save water , " magiera said .
effective use of water can also be achieved through economic measures such as regulating water prices .
if all water-saving measures are exhausted , then increasing fresh water reserves is the only option .
if water can not be imported , then the sea water must be desalinated .
" technically , that 's not a problem anymore today , " said kropp .
sea water desalination is practiced in countries such as israel or saudi arabia .
the united arab emirates are almost entirely dependent on desalinated sea water .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the uae meets its needs for freshwater through desalination plants but one of the problems that can crop up is that desalination plants are highly energy-intensive .
and that energy is largely achieved in the middle east by burning fossil-based fuel .
that releases carbon dioxide into the atmosphere and in turn accelerates climate change .
traditional solutions desalination plants have been set up in places like micronesia .
but these are mostly small plants with very low capacities .
bigger installations are too expensive .
and there 's a lack of energy reserves to power them .
magiera said that in this case , the answer would be to turn to traditional measures - such as harvesting rainwater - instead of high-tech solutions .

" it 's a particularly tough situation for small island nations , " juergen kropp of the potsdam institute of climate impact research said .
he added that these nations already had limited groundwater reserves .
island states not the only ones affected but it 's not just places like micronesia that are grappling with the problem of increasing salinity in the groundwater .
many other regions with long coastlines , for instance the gaza strip , are faced with similar problems .
the gaza strip is one of the most crowded places in the world , and that dense population puts great pressure on the region 's water supply .
experts say it is another important cause of saline groundwater .
" sea water can only intrude in places where water has been drained previously , " kropp said .
if groundwater turns saline , he said , it shows that more groundwater was used than can be replaced .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more demand for water can lead to rising salinity in groundwater philip magiera of the state-funded gtz development organization in germany said there are two ways to tackle the issue - either by increasing the existing water supply , or by limiting demand for it .
" i 'm a big fan of water efficiency , " magiera said .
there are lots of examples of how water usage can be reduced , he said , particularly in the agricultural sector .
in many regions , up to 70 percent of the groundwater is used to irrigate fields .
but with systems such as drip irrigation , it 's possible to save large quantities of water .
water wastage a major problem often , a lot of water is simply wasted on the way to the end consumer .
many countries struggle with leaky piping systems .
in such cases , experts say , it makes more sense to first fix the leaks before more water is pumped into the system .
" even in households , there are often possibilities to save water , " magiera said .
effective use of water can also be achieved through economic measures such as regulating water prices .
if all water-saving measures are exhausted , then increasing fresh water reserves is the only option .
if water can not be imported , then the sea water must be desalinated .
" technically , that 's not a problem anymore today , " said kropp .
sea water desalination is practiced in countries such as israel or saudi arabia .
the united arab emirates are almost entirely dependent on desalinated sea water .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the uae meets its needs for freshwater through desalination plants but one of the problems that can crop up is that desalination plants are highly energy-intensive .
and that energy is largely achieved in the middle east by burning fossil-based fuel .
that releases carbon dioxide into the atmosphere and in turn accelerates climate change .
traditional solutions desalination plants have been set up in places like micronesia .
but these are mostly small plants with very low capacities .
bigger installations are too expensive .
and there 's a lack of energy reserves to power them .
magiera said that in this case , the answer would be to turn to traditional measures - such as harvesting rainwater - instead of high-tech solutions .

now bayern are the favorites to break the dry spell .
but they should n't underestimate their opponents . going into the home-and-away tie against french side olympique lyon , to be played on april 21 and 27 , the words " bayern " and " major roll " were being used a lot together .
not only had the bavarians knocked out manchester united in the quarterfinals , they engaged in a bit of target practice in a 7-0 thrashing of hanover in the bundesliga .
with lyon in third place in france ligue 1 , this season represents the bavarians ' best chance of getting back to the champions league final since they won the title in 2000-01 .
and indeed , the bookmakers are tipping bayern as the clear favorites in this encounter .
this is the first time lyon have made it as far as the semifinals in the champions league , and bayern are a richer club that currently rides atop the table in a better league .
what 's more they have winger arjen robben , who 's playing the most dominant football of anyone in europe not named lionel messi .
but although coach louis van gaal 's side have every reason to believe a trip to the final in madrid on may 22 is within reach , they had best beware of the french side , which has made a habit this season of toppling big names .
giant killers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern need to watch out for lopez coach claude puel 's men did not get where they are by accident .
to progress beyond the group stage , lyon had to beat liverpool , and their round-of-16 opponents were no less than real madrid .
the french side has a top striker in argentinian lisandro lopez .
he 's scored seven goals in the champions league thus far , including a pair that sent lyon past rivals bordeaux in the quarterfinals .
but olympique 's real strength is defense .
puels usually gets 10 men behind the ball , and both liverpool and real were frustrated by lyon 's tenacity , wearing themselves out and getting punished on the counter-attack .
plus , they have the advantage of playing their first game away from home , where any goals scored put pressure on the opponents for the return leg .
that 's why bayern ceo karl-heinz rummenigge warned against over-confidence as the first leg approached .
" this is a match-up of equals , " rummenigge told reporters .
" we 're not the underdogs , but we 're not the favorites , either . "
dynamic duo bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : robben , in particular , is having a career season bayern have had to score a fair number of goals in their champions league campaign , and most have come from two men : robben and overachieving croatian striker ivica olic .
olic is one of the hardest working players in the business , and the bavarians will hope that his tireless forechecking will allow him to capitalize on defensive lapses in concentration , much as he did when he scored on a crucial last-second poach against manchester united in the quarterfinals .
olic could be key since bayern 's pair of true center forwards , mario gomez and miroslav klose , have both been out of form .
robben has been little short of unstoppable , confounding defenses with his incisive runs and lightning-quick shots on goal .
lyon will likely devote at least a couple of defenders to the dutch winger , which should open space on the left for his counterpart , frank ribery .
ribery , though , has become something of an enigma .
injured for much of the season , he seems to have temporarily lost some of his assurance with the ball , and his lone goal in the manchester united tie came on a terribly taken free kick that was lucky to be deflected off the wall .
and the frenchman is not bayern 's only worry .
question marks bildunterschrift : badstuber -lrb- right -rrb- , is one of bayern 's young defenders in both of their previous champions league ties , bayern have lost their away matches .
to take the pressure off , they need not only to win their home match but avoid conceding what could be deadly goals .
the bavarians ' defense has looked very solid in the league , but the squad van gaal is fielding is young .
on the left , both 19-year-old diego contento and 21-year-old holger badstuber have sometimes looked out of their depth against top european opposition .
moreover , on the right philipp lahm - usually one of the best defensive players in the world - has looked out of sorts for most of this season .
nonetheless , despite these potential weaknesses and regardless of what bayern 's bosses were saying before the tie , munich are the favorites in this match-up , and they know it .
if their defense can rise to the occasion and their men up front get the job done in the allianz arena , they 'll be in an excellent position to return to european club football 's biggest match .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de champions league -pipe- 20.04.2010 bayern fancy their chances against lyon in champions league semis großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : robben , olic and lahm are three key bayern players it 's been nearly a decade since a german team has made the final of club soccer 's premier competition .
now bayern are the favorites to break the dry spell .
but they should n't underestimate their opponents . going into the home-and-away tie against french side olympique lyon , to be played on april 21 and 27 , the words " bayern " and " major roll " were being used a lot together .
not only had the bavarians knocked out manchester united in the quarterfinals , they engaged in a bit of target practice in a 7-0 thrashing of hanover in the bundesliga .
with lyon in third place in france ligue 1 , this season represents the bavarians ' best chance of getting back to the champions league final since they won the title in 2000-01 .
and indeed , the bookmakers are tipping bayern as the clear favorites in this encounter .
this is the first time lyon have made it as far as the semifinals in the champions league , and bayern are a richer club that currently rides atop the table in a better league .
what 's more they have winger arjen robben , who 's playing the most dominant football of anyone in europe not named lionel messi .
but although coach louis van gaal 's side have every reason to believe a trip to the final in madrid on may 22 is within reach , they had best beware of the french side , which has made a habit this season of toppling big names .
giant killers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern need to watch out for lopez coach claude puel 's men did not get where they are by accident .
to progress beyond the group stage , lyon had to beat liverpool , and their round-of-16 opponents were no less than real madrid .
the french side has a top striker in argentinian lisandro lopez .
he 's scored seven goals in the champions league thus far , including a pair that sent lyon past rivals bordeaux in the quarterfinals .
but olympique 's real strength is defense .
puels usually gets 10 men behind the ball , and both liverpool and real were frustrated by lyon 's tenacity , wearing themselves out and getting punished on the counter-attack .
plus , they have the advantage of playing their first game away from home , where any goals scored put pressure on the opponents for the return leg .
that 's why bayern ceo karl-heinz rummenigge warned against over-confidence as the first leg approached .
" this is a match-up of equals , " rummenigge told reporters .
" we 're not the underdogs , but we 're not the favorites , either . "
dynamic duo bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : robben , in particular , is having a career season bayern have had to score a fair number of goals in their champions league campaign , and most have come from two men : robben and overachieving croatian striker ivica olic .
olic is one of the hardest working players in the business , and the bavarians will hope that his tireless forechecking will allow him to capitalize on defensive lapses in concentration , much as he did when he scored on a crucial last-second poach against manchester united in the quarterfinals .
olic could be key since bayern 's pair of true center forwards , mario gomez and miroslav klose , have both been out of form .
robben has been little short of unstoppable , confounding defenses with his incisive runs and lightning-quick shots on goal .
lyon will likely devote at least a couple of defenders to the dutch winger , which should open space on the left for his counterpart , frank ribery .
ribery , though , has become something of an enigma .
injured for much of the season , he seems to have temporarily lost some of his assurance with the ball , and his lone goal in the manchester united tie came on a terribly taken free kick that was lucky to be deflected off the wall .
and the frenchman is not bayern 's only worry .
question marks bildunterschrift : badstuber -lrb- right -rrb- , is one of bayern 's young defenders in both of their previous champions league ties , bayern have lost their away matches .
to take the pressure off , they need not only to win their home match but avoid conceding what could be deadly goals .
the bavarians ' defense has looked very solid in the league , but the squad van gaal is fielding is young .
on the left , both 19-year-old diego contento and 21-year-old holger badstuber have sometimes looked out of their depth against top european opposition .
moreover , on the right philipp lahm - usually one of the best defensive players in the world - has looked out of sorts for most of this season .
nonetheless , despite these potential weaknesses and regardless of what bayern 's bosses were saying before the tie , munich are the favorites in this match-up , and they know it .
if their defense can rise to the occasion and their men up front get the job done in the allianz arena , they 'll be in an excellent position to return to european club football 's biggest match .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de mergers & acquisitions -pipe- 20.04.2010 deutsche bahn offers 1.54 billion pounds for britain 's arriva großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : arriva operates transport services in 12 european nations deutsche bahn 's plan to acquire uk transport provider arriva appears to be on track .
the takeover - the most expensive in the german company 's history - is aimed at strengthening its passenger business throughout europe . british train and bus operator arriva has confirmed that german state rail company deutsche bahn is willing to pay 1.54 billion pounds -lrb- 1.8 billion euros -rrb- in cash to buy its operations as advanced talks continue .
media reports said that if arriva 's debt is taken into account , the total value of the offer is 2.7 billion euros .
reuters news agency quoted sources close to the deal who said the takeover would be financed entirely through the issuance of bonds , and could be approved by deutsche bahn 's supervisory board as early as next week .
the acquisition , which would confirm deutsche bahn as europe 's largest rail transport operator , could also trigger a wave of consolidation in the rail sector .
french rail company sncf , which held talks with arriva as well , is equally keen to expand its footprint throughout europe .
deutsche bahn and arriva have been in talks for several weeks .
the german operator has made no secret of its interest in acquiring the uk company , which operates bus networks , rail franchises and other transportation services in 12 european countries .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche bahn sees little room for growth in the german market key asset arriva is the only big british transport group to have ventured into europe , where it has taken advantage of gradual market liberalization .
its european operations account for nearly half of its revenue .
last month at the presentation of the group 's financial results , deutsche bahn chief executive officer ruediger grube said the company plans to run its high-speed long-distance trains through the channel tunnel and " further actively expand " its business activities beyond germany 's national borders .
deutsche bahn is keen to move beyond its home territory as germany 's domestic rail market opens up to competition .
the uk is high on its list of target countries .
the rail company has already made a number of acquisitions in britain including chiltern railways , which offers service between marylebone and birmingham , and ews , the freight operator .
it also runs the tyne & wear metro and holds a 50 percent stake in the london overground rail network .
pros and cons richard talbot , an analyst with the railway consultancy in london , said a takeover of arriva could benefit the uk rail market in several ways .
" deutsche bahn would bring technology know-how and system management skills , " he said .
" the company would also be another powerful player competing in the franchise bidding process . "
commuters who use uk trains also see benefits .
" trains in the uk have a very poor reputation when it comes to service , punctuality and cost , " said chris manning , a businessman who commutes daily by train to london and who is familiar with german service .
" they need to face competition from continental train companies like deutsche bahn to improve quality .
these operators are light years ahead . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics say britain 's rail network could use some german efficiency but consultant talbot also warned that consolidation could have its drawbacks .
" small can be beautiful , especially when it comes to regional operators that provide a good service cost-efficiently , " he said .
" big is n't always necessarily better . "
indeed , some critics of deutsche bahn say the state-owned company , which is known for its bureaucracy , could be overextending its resources with its ambitious expansion plans . author : john blau editor : samuel edmonds send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but analysts are still cautious about its prospects . at a press conference on monday , nato secretary general anders rasmussen spoke about what he believed was the most serious security threat faced by europe .
" there is a growing missile threat , including from iran , " he said .
" and the politicians have a responsibility to protect the population . "
europe must " take its share in the joint protection from missile attacks . "
as far as nato is concerned , any hope of creating a missile defense system for europe rests on the cooperation of russia . moscow has persistently voiced its opposition to missile installations in eastern europe that it believes could be used as offensive weapons .
to this end , rasmussen has been working to bring nato and russia together to discuss the possibility .
speaking during a recent visit to london , nato spokesman james appathurai told reporters , " russia should be included in a missile defense system which covers europe . "
he said plans for a " new security architecture " should be " one roof which includes the russians as part of the same security family . "
the attempted cooperation has apparently met with some success .
at least one newspaper , the british independent , reported that secret talks had already begun between washington and moscow on the subject , though no further details were reported .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nmds are much more expensive than close range tmds the end of the george w. bush presidency certainly opened the door to a rapprochement between russia and the west , a process that has culminated in the recent signing of the nuclear disarmament strategic arms reduction treaty -lrb- start -rrb- treaty in prague .
many analysts were impressed at the speed with which president barack obama managed to instil enough trust in opposite number dmitry medvedev to bring him to a disarmament agreement .
just a start but many experts are still concerned whether obama 's so-called ' reset ' policy will be enough to allay russian concerns about a european missile shield .
margarete klein , senior associate at the german institute for international and security affairs -lrb- swp -rrb- , believes the former superpower enemies are still locked in a catch-22 stand-off .
" the crux of the problem is that such a defense shield would create a lot of trust between russia and nato , but would require a lot of trust in the first place , " she told deutsche welle .
but klein emphasized that there was a real willingness in russia to negotiate with the us , albeit with certain caveats .
" i think russia is open to cooperation with nato on a defence shield , on condition that the us postpones the deployment of parts of its global missile defense shield in eastern europe , " she said .
this rapprochement is partly motivated by a common threat - iran .
as francis tusa , veteran british defense analyst and writer military affairs , told deutsche welle , " if you look around at the world 's borders , you 'll see that russia is in a more risky position . "
bildunterschrift : us-russian relations have improved considerably under obama klein believes that russia 's signing of the start treaty was also motivated by necessity .
" russia saw that its strategic nuclear weapons arsenal will downsize anyway due to the age of the missiles , " she says .
" therefore , reducing its arsenal together with the usa offers the opportunity to remain on par with washington and reduce the financial burdens of its strategic nuclear arsenal . "
for its part , the us has been desperate to prevent russia selling arms to iran , and making a major agreement on a missile shield could be seen as an effective way to control the trade .
" the us has been very active in trying to persuade russia not to sell weapons to iran , " says tusa .
" but we know that russia has made deals with the iran in the past . "
several ways to skin a cat but the devil in any international agreement is in the proverbial details .
in this case , the detail is the actual military hardware up for discussion .
" there is some confusion about what kind of missile defense shields are being talked about , " says klein .
" there are theater missile defense -lrb- tmd -rrb- systems , designed to defend troops against shorter-range missiles , and the national missile defense -lrb- nmd -rrb- systems , designed to protect a whole nation or group of nations . "
though the more mobile tmds are typically used in actual war scenarios like afghanistan , they can be deployed as domestic defense systems instead of the larger nmds .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the air crash in smolensk may have improved polish-russian relations " there are several ways of skinning the cat , " says tusa .
" you could have linked batteries of tmd systems , which would be a lot cheaper . "
the variety of options and weapons technology is likely to dominate any negotiations , and could easily scupper the project .
both sides are likely to be wary of revealing too much of their own technology .
" i think the us state department 's concern at the moment is probably whether the russians are just there to have a look-see , " said tusa .
" they may say they 're interested in creating a joint defense shield just to see what the us has to offer , and then back out if it 's not enough . "
experience suggests that armies are extremely cagey about sharing technology , even with their partners .
" america 's main nato allies in europe - the uk and germany - basically never get to see any us military technology .
do we really believe that the state department is suddenly going to let russia see everything ? " asked tusa .
european complications but this does not exhaust all the complications that any large-scale collaboration would involve .
the european nato states where missile defense systems would be installed are unlikely to allow the negotiations to take place without their opinions being heard .
and these opinions are wide-ranging .
" europe encompasses several different views - eastern european countries obviously have a very different attitude to russia than western ones , " said tusa .
" the countries to the south-east will be more concerned about the threat from missiles , while countries in north-western europe less so . "
as so often , the importance of poland 's strategic position in europe could prove vital , and the country 's recently improved relations with russia may open to the door to a global project .
klein is optimistic : " poland is a very important member state in nato , and poland 's relations with russia will play an important part in the development of the missile defense shield .
for that reason the recent rapprochement between the two countries , which began well before the recent tragedy in smolensk , is a good sign . "

but analysts are still cautious about its prospects . at a press conference on monday , nato secretary general anders rasmussen spoke about what he believed was the most serious security threat faced by europe .
" there is a growing missile threat , including from iran , " he said .
" and the politicians have a responsibility to protect the population . "
europe must " take its share in the joint protection from missile attacks . "
as far as nato is concerned , any hope of creating a missile defense system for europe rests on the cooperation of russia . moscow has persistently voiced its opposition to missile installations in eastern europe that it believes could be used as offensive weapons .
to this end , rasmussen has been working to bring nato and russia together to discuss the possibility .
speaking during a recent visit to london , nato spokesman james appathurai told reporters , " russia should be included in a missile defense system which covers europe . "
he said plans for a " new security architecture " should be " one roof which includes the russians as part of the same security family . "
the attempted cooperation has apparently met with some success .
at least one newspaper , the british independent , reported that secret talks had already begun between washington and moscow on the subject , though no further details were reported .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nmds are much more expensive than close range tmds the end of the george w. bush presidency certainly opened the door to a rapprochement between russia and the west , a process that has culminated in the recent signing of the nuclear disarmament strategic arms reduction treaty -lrb- start -rrb- treaty in prague .
many analysts were impressed at the speed with which president barack obama managed to instil enough trust in opposite number dmitry medvedev to bring him to a disarmament agreement .
just a start but many experts are still concerned whether obama 's so-called ' reset ' policy will be enough to allay russian concerns about a european missile shield .
margarete klein , senior associate at the german institute for international and security affairs -lrb- swp -rrb- , believes the former superpower enemies are still locked in a catch-22 stand-off .
" the crux of the problem is that such a defense shield would create a lot of trust between russia and nato , but would require a lot of trust in the first place , " she told deutsche welle .
but klein emphasized that there was a real willingness in russia to negotiate with the us , albeit with certain caveats .
" i think russia is open to cooperation with nato on a defence shield , on condition that the us postpones the deployment of parts of its global missile defense shield in eastern europe , " she said .
this rapprochement is partly motivated by a common threat - iran .
as francis tusa , veteran british defense analyst and writer military affairs , told deutsche welle , " if you look around at the world 's borders , you 'll see that russia is in a more risky position . "
bildunterschrift : us-russian relations have improved considerably under obama klein believes that russia 's signing of the start treaty was also motivated by necessity .
" russia saw that its strategic nuclear weapons arsenal will downsize anyway due to the age of the missiles , " she says .
" therefore , reducing its arsenal together with the usa offers the opportunity to remain on par with washington and reduce the financial burdens of its strategic nuclear arsenal . "
for its part , the us has been desperate to prevent russia selling arms to iran , and making a major agreement on a missile shield could be seen as an effective way to control the trade .
" the us has been very active in trying to persuade russia not to sell weapons to iran , " says tusa .
" but we know that russia has made deals with the iran in the past . "
several ways to skin a cat but the devil in any international agreement is in the proverbial details .
in this case , the detail is the actual military hardware up for discussion .
" there is some confusion about what kind of missile defense shields are being talked about , " says klein .
" there are theater missile defense -lrb- tmd -rrb- systems , designed to defend troops against shorter-range missiles , and the national missile defense -lrb- nmd -rrb- systems , designed to protect a whole nation or group of nations . "
though the more mobile tmds are typically used in actual war scenarios like afghanistan , they can be deployed as domestic defense systems instead of the larger nmds .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the air crash in smolensk may have improved polish-russian relations " there are several ways of skinning the cat , " says tusa .
" you could have linked batteries of tmd systems , which would be a lot cheaper . "
the variety of options and weapons technology is likely to dominate any negotiations , and could easily scupper the project .
both sides are likely to be wary of revealing too much of their own technology .
" i think the us state department 's concern at the moment is probably whether the russians are just there to have a look-see , " said tusa .
" they may say they 're interested in creating a joint defense shield just to see what the us has to offer , and then back out if it 's not enough . "
experience suggests that armies are extremely cagey about sharing technology , even with their partners .
" america 's main nato allies in europe - the uk and germany - basically never get to see any us military technology .
do we really believe that the state department is suddenly going to let russia see everything ? " asked tusa .
european complications but this does not exhaust all the complications that any large-scale collaboration would involve .
the european nato states where missile defense systems would be installed are unlikely to allow the negotiations to take place without their opinions being heard .
and these opinions are wide-ranging .
" europe encompasses several different views - eastern european countries obviously have a very different attitude to russia than western ones , " said tusa .
" the countries to the south-east will be more concerned about the threat from missiles , while countries in north-western europe less so . "
as so often , the importance of poland 's strategic position in europe could prove vital , and the country 's recently improved relations with russia may open to the door to a global project .
klein is optimistic : " poland is a very important member state in nato , and poland 's relations with russia will play an important part in the development of the missile defense shield .
for that reason the recent rapprochement between the two countries , which began well before the recent tragedy in smolensk , is a good sign . "

now bayern are the favorites to break the dry spell .
but they should n't underestimate their opponents . going into the home-and-away tie against french side olympique lyon , to be played on april 21 and 27 , the words " bayern " and " major roll " were being used a lot together .
not only had the bavarians knocked out manchester united in the quarterfinals , they engaged in a bit of target practice in a 7-0 thrashing of hanover in the bundesliga .
with lyon in third place in france ligue 1 , this season represents the bavarians ' best chance of getting back to the champions league final since they won the title in 2000-01 .
and indeed , the bookmakers are tipping bayern as the clear favorites in this encounter .
this is the first time lyon have made it as far as the semifinals in the champions league , and bayern are a richer club that currently rides atop the table in a better league .
what 's more they have winger arjen robben , who 's playing the most dominant football of anyone in europe not named lionel messi .
but although coach louis van gaal 's side have every reason to believe a trip to the final in madrid on may 22 is within reach , they had best beware of the french side , which has made a habit this season of toppling big names .
giant killers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern need to watch out for lopez coach claude puel 's men did not get where they are by accident .
to progress beyond the group stage , lyon had to beat liverpool , and their round-of-16 opponents were no less than real madrid .
the french side has a top striker in argentinian lisandro lopez .
he 's scored seven goals in the champions league thus far , including a pair that sent lyon past rivals bordeaux in the quarterfinals .
but olympique 's real strength is defense .
puels usually gets 10 men behind the ball , and both liverpool and real were frustrated by lyon 's tenacity , wearing themselves out and getting punished on the counter-attack .
plus , they have the advantage of playing their first game away from home , where any goals scored put pressure on the opponents for the return leg .
that 's why bayern ceo karl-heinz rummenigge warned against over-confidence as the first leg approached .
" this is a match-up of equals , " rummenigge told reporters .
" we 're not the underdogs , but we 're not the favorites , either . "
dynamic duo bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : robben , in particular , is having a career season bayern have had to score a fair number of goals in their champions league campaign , and most have come from two men : robben and overachieving croatian striker ivica olic .
olic is one of the hardest working players in the business , and the bavarians will hope that his tireless forechecking will allow him to capitalize on defensive lapses in concentration , much as he did when he scored on a crucial last-second poach against manchester united in the quarterfinals .
olic could be key since bayern 's pair of true center forwards , mario gomez and miroslav klose , have both been out of form .
robben has been little short of unstoppable , confounding defenses with his incisive runs and lightning-quick shots on goal .
lyon will likely devote at least a couple of defenders to the dutch winger , which should open space on the left for his counterpart , frank ribery .
ribery , though , has become something of an enigma .
injured for much of the season , he seems to have temporarily lost some of his assurance with the ball , and his lone goal in the manchester united tie came on a terribly taken free kick that was lucky to be deflected off the wall .
and the frenchman is not bayern 's only worry .
question marks bildunterschrift : badstuber -lrb- right -rrb- , is one of bayern 's young defenders in both of their previous champions league ties , bayern have lost their away matches .
to take the pressure off , they need not only to win their home match but avoid conceding what could be deadly goals .
the bavarians ' defense has looked very solid in the league , but the squad van gaal is fielding is young .
on the left , both 19-year-old diego contento and 21-year-old holger badstuber have sometimes looked out of their depth against top european opposition .
moreover , on the right philipp lahm - usually one of the best defensive players in the world - has looked out of sorts for most of this season .
nonetheless , despite these potential weaknesses and regardless of what bayern 's bosses were saying before the tie , munich are the favorites in this match-up , and they know it .
if their defense can rise to the occasion and their men up front get the job done in the allianz arena , they 'll be in an excellent position to return to european club football 's biggest match .

to take the pressure off , they need not only to win their home match but avoid conceding what could be deadly goals .
the bavarians ' defense has looked very solid in the league , but the squad van gaal is fielding is young .
on the left , both 19-year-old diego contento and 21-year-old holger badstuber have sometimes looked out of their depth against top european opposition .
moreover , on the right philipp lahm - usually one of the best defensive players in the world - has looked out of sorts for most of this season .
nonetheless , despite these potential weaknesses and regardless of what bayern 's bosses were saying before the tie , munich are the favorites in this match-up , and they know it .
if their defense can rise to the occasion and their men up front get the job done in the allianz arena , they 'll be in an excellent position to return to european club football 's biggest match .

airlines have accused aviation experts of exaggerating the risk , but is it really safe to fly right now ? europe 's busiest air hub saw its first flights on tuesday evening as airspace across the continent slowly began to reopen following nearly a week of widespread travel disruption .
a flight from vancouver arrived at london 's heathrow airport shortly before 10 p.m. local time , the first since british airspace was closed last thursday following the eruption of iceland 's eyjafjallajokull volcano .
british airways expected about 24 other flights to arrive from the united states , africa and asia later in the evening .
earlier tuesday , germany 's two biggest airlines announced they would resume flying many of their regularly scheduled flights , despite an ongoing no-fly rule in german airspace , by operating under special " visual flight " conditions . under the visual flight rules , airlines are permitted to fly below 3,000 meters -lrb- 9,800 feet -rrb- during daylight , as long as pilots use their own radar and eyesight to avoid other planes .
germany 's flag carrier lufthansa announced it would carry more than 15,000 passengers on some 200 flights on tuesday .
air berlin , germany 's second largest carrier , was operating a nearly full flight schedule , according to its web site .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many stranded passengers were forced to sleep in airports the flights were operating through a loophole in the aviation regulations , said christine kellek of germany 's flight safety organization -lrb- dfs -rrb- .
the closure of airspace only applies to aviation that relies on ground control and navigation instruments , according to kellek .
" the german air navigation services can not forbid flying by visual flying rules , because we regulate instrument flights , so it is not up to us to decide if somebody can fly under visual flying rules or not , " kellek told deutsche welle .
pressure on pilots but while these flights may be allowed , not everyone supports the idea .
juerg handwerg , a pilot and spokesperson for the german pilots ' union cockpit , said he thinks the decision to allow planes to operate on visual flight was fueled by financial considerations .
" they are avoiding the international rules they signed themselves by flying under visual flight rules , " said handwerg .
" it 's due to monetary reasons . "
it puts unfair pressure on pilots , he added . " legally , you can say , ‘ no i do n't want to fly , ’ but if your employer tells you to fly and you say no , you can get thrown out .
so how can you decide not to fly ? "
handwerg told deutsche welle . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : volcanic ash drifting across the atlantic forced the cancellation of flights across europe an expensive problem in the past , volcanic ash has been known to cause problems with aircraft . following last week 's eruption in iceland , air france , british airways , klm and lufthansa reported no problems from their own test flights , but senior us military officials said the ash had caused some engine damage to a nato f-16 fighter plane . scientists from the german aerospace center -lrb- dlr -rrb- carried out a four-hour test flight monday to measure the cloud 's density and composition .
the results were submitted to transportation authorities in berlin , who were to decide whether or not it 's safe to fly in german airspace , according to karl hinterleitner of the dlr .
after several days of flight cancellations , airlines are itching to see a return to business as usual , as flight disruptions are costing them as much as 200 million euros -lrb- $ 270 million -rrb- per day .
experts say it 's hard to know when the situation will return to normal , leaving policymakers walking a difficult line between trying to minimize the economic impact of further flight suspension and the potential risk of flying through volcanic ash .

the heightened tensions come as the deployment of troops in a financial area of the city thwarted a planned march by the protestors earlier tuesday . tensions remain high in bangkok ten days after clashes between the military and anti-government protestors left 25 people dead and hundreds injured . the army said it was now prepared to take tougher measures in the case of further clashes , using elite troops .
according to army spokesman colonel sunsern kaewkumnerd , the army was ready to take decisive action , including the use of live bullets , if provoked .
protesters remain firm charan dittapichai is a leader of the united democratic front against dictatorship , or udd , better known as the red shirts .
he says the protesters will remain resolute in the case of a crackdown .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anti-government demonstrators shout insults from behind razor wire he does not believe the army will crack down in seven days , as they are threatening to do .
" it can not .
i do n't believe that the army can do that .
and if they do , no one knows what will happen because at least 30 percent who come here are not afraid of death . "
the udd says prime minister abhisit vejjajiva 's government must resign and call new elections .
but the government and coalition partners say elections in the current heated climate would do little to end the current political crisis .
on tuesday tens of thousands of red shirt protesters gathered at the rally site , near major malls and department stores that have been forced to close for almost three weeks at the cost of millions of dollars .
" they 're trying to demonize us " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anti-government protesters , in red , clash with policemen sean boonpracong , a udd spokesperson , says while there are fears the deep social divisions could be exacerbated , the government is to be blamed , not the protestors .
" they 're trying to blame us as intransigent .
you have to remember the government and their conservative allies are more powerful than us .
i think you should ask them what they 're prepared to offer .
but they 're trying to demonize us as being a terrorist group .
and it 's really counterproductive to hear that type of really extreme rhetoric . "
army officials said protestors have stockpiled home-made weapons including acid banks and clubs spiked with nails in preparation for a crackdown .
there is concern that demonstrators may also have firearms .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thailand 's prime minister abhisit vejjajiva , said his government stands ready to talk with the " red shirts " " i am afraid because i can not see any sign from now on how we can pass this moment peacefully , " says pinpaka ngamsom , the assistant editor for online news service , prachatai.com.
" if you see all the factors right now it 's difficult for thailand .
if you look at the prime minister it 's hard for him to turn away and if you look to the red shirts for the leader it 's also very hard for them to turn away , and if you look at the protestor they strongly believe that they can win . "
the worst crisis in two decades the current political crisis is the most severe test for the country in almost 20 years .
prime minister abhisit survived a similar crisis last year , one also led by the red shirts who are backing former prime minister thaksin shinawatra .
thaksin remains overseas to avoid a two year jail term for corruption .
but it is also reported thaksin is consolidating his support even now within police and military ranks .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thailand 's prime minister abhisit vejjajiva , said his government stands ready to talk with the " red shirts " " i am afraid because i can not see any sign from now on how we can pass this moment peacefully , " says pinpaka ngamsom , the assistant editor for online news service , prachatai.com.
" if you see all the factors right now it 's difficult for thailand .
if you look at the prime minister it 's hard for him to turn away and if you look to the red shirts for the leader it 's also very hard for them to turn away , and if you look at the protestor they strongly believe that they can win . "
the worst crisis in two decades the current political crisis is the most severe test for the country in almost 20 years .
prime minister abhisit survived a similar crisis last year , one also led by the red shirts who are backing former prime minister thaksin shinawatra .
thaksin remains overseas to avoid a two year jail term for corruption .
but it is also reported thaksin is consolidating his support even now within police and military ranks .

meanwhile , it is unclear where the ousted former president is located . in a fresh round of violence in kyrgyzstan , on monday hundreds of police officers were dispatched to suppress riots that started in a village outside of the capital , bishkek .
ethnic kyrgyz rioters seized plots of land from russians and turks in the village of mayevka , and in the subsequent violence five people were killed and many others injured .
" the crowd poured into mayevka and started wreaking destruction , robbing and killing .
they mainly robbed and burned the homes of turks living in the village , " alexander konstantin , a local resident , told journalists .
" all the provocateurs and ringleaders in the riots will be punished to the full extent of the law , " the interim government said in a statement released on tuesday .
the riot was the latest challenge to the interim government , which seized power earlier this month after a popular uprising that ousted president kurmanbek bakiyev .
however , so far the interim government has failed to establish full control over the country .
on monday , loyalists of the former president installed a pro-bakiyev governor after seizing a regional government in jalalabad .
bakiyev 's whereabouts unknown toppled president bakiyev was flown to kazakhstan last week in an attempt to reduce the risk of civil war in kyrgyzstan .
a spokesperson for the foreign ministry in kazakhstan confirmed to the ap news agency that bakiyev had left the country , but provided no further details about where he had gone .
bakiyev is wanted by the interim kyrgyz government in connection with the shootings of demonstrators during the protests in early april that culminated in his overthrow. cb / afp / reuters / ap editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but early signs of disaster , like increasingly saline groundwater and dwindling freshwater reserves , are already visible . last fall , island nations made a dramatic appeal to industrialized countries : " my country is on the verge of being submerged , " emanuel mori , the president of micronesia , told representatives of the european union at the time .
he demanded that western countries finally rethink their climate policies .
island states like micronesia have been hit particularly hard by global warming , primarily through rising sea levels .
there are real fears that the country could disappear from the world map in the not-too-distant future .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rising water levels are threatening micronesia 's coastlines the signs of the looming disaster are already there : rising sea levels have mixed salt water with the groundwater in several areas .
that , in turn , is shrinking drinking water reserves and making it harder to irrigate agricultural land .
the high level of salinity has poisoned the ground and made it infertile for years .
" it 's a particularly tough situation for small island nations , " juergen kropp of the potsdam institute of climate impact research said .
he added that these nations already had limited groundwater reserves .
island states not the only ones affected but it 's not just places like micronesia that are grappling with the problem of increasing salinity in the groundwater .
many other regions with long coastlines , for instance the gaza strip , are faced with similar problems .
the gaza strip is one of the most crowded places in the world , and that dense population puts great pressure on the region 's water supply .
experts say it is another important cause of saline groundwater .
" sea water can only intrude in places where water has been drained previously , " kropp said .
if groundwater turns saline , he said , it shows that more groundwater was used than can be replaced .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more demand for water can lead to rising salinity in groundwater philip magiera of the state-funded gtz development organization in germany said there are two ways to tackle the issue - either by increasing the existing water supply , or by limiting demand for it .
" i 'm a big fan of water efficiency , " magiera said .
there are lots of examples of how water usage can be reduced , he said , particularly in the agricultural sector .
in many regions , up to 70 percent of the groundwater is used to irrigate fields .
but with systems such as drip irrigation , it 's possible to save large quantities of water .
water wastage a major problem often , a lot of water is simply wasted on the way to the end consumer .
many countries struggle with leaky piping systems .
in such cases , experts say , it makes more sense to first fix the leaks before more water is pumped into the system .
" even in households , there are often possibilities to save water , " magiera said .
effective use of water can also be achieved through economic measures such as regulating water prices .
if all water-saving measures are exhausted , then increasing fresh water reserves is the only option .
if water can not be imported , then the sea water must be desalinated .
" technically , that 's not a problem anymore today , " said kropp .
sea water desalination is practiced in countries such as israel or saudi arabia .
the united arab emirates are almost entirely dependent on desalinated sea water .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the uae meets its needs for freshwater through desalination plants but one of the problems that can crop up is that desalination plants are highly energy-intensive .
and that energy is largely achieved in the middle east by burning fossil-based fuel .
that releases carbon dioxide into the atmosphere and in turn accelerates climate change .
traditional solutions desalination plants have been set up in places like micronesia .
but these are mostly small plants with very low capacities .
bigger installations are too expensive .
and there 's a lack of energy reserves to power them .
magiera said that in this case , the answer would be to turn to traditional measures - such as harvesting rainwater - instead of high-tech solutions .

but early signs of disaster , like increasingly saline groundwater and dwindling freshwater reserves , are already visible . last fall , island nations made a dramatic appeal to industrialized countries : " my country is on the verge of being submerged , " emanuel mori , the president of micronesia , told representatives of the european union at the time .
he demanded that western countries finally rethink their climate policies .
island states like micronesia have been hit particularly hard by global warming , primarily through rising sea levels .
there are real fears that the country could disappear from the world map in the not-too-distant future .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rising water levels are threatening micronesia 's coastlines the signs of the looming disaster are already there : rising sea levels have mixed salt water with the groundwater in several areas .
that , in turn , is shrinking drinking water reserves and making it harder to irrigate agricultural land .
the high level of salinity has poisoned the ground and made it infertile for years .
" it 's a particularly tough situation for small island nations , " juergen kropp of the potsdam institute of climate impact research said .
he added that these nations already had limited groundwater reserves .
island states not the only ones affected but it 's not just places like micronesia that are grappling with the problem of increasing salinity in the groundwater .
many other regions with long coastlines , for instance the gaza strip , are faced with similar problems .
the gaza strip is one of the most crowded places in the world , and that dense population puts great pressure on the region 's water supply .
experts say it is another important cause of saline groundwater .
" sea water can only intrude in places where water has been drained previously , " kropp said .
if groundwater turns saline , he said , it shows that more groundwater was used than can be replaced .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more demand for water can lead to rising salinity in groundwater philip magiera of the state-funded gtz development organization in germany said there are two ways to tackle the issue - either by increasing the existing water supply , or by limiting demand for it .
" i 'm a big fan of water efficiency , " magiera said .
there are lots of examples of how water usage can be reduced , he said , particularly in the agricultural sector .
in many regions , up to 70 percent of the groundwater is used to irrigate fields .
but with systems such as drip irrigation , it 's possible to save large quantities of water .
water wastage a major problem often , a lot of water is simply wasted on the way to the end consumer .
many countries struggle with leaky piping systems .
in such cases , experts say , it makes more sense to first fix the leaks before more water is pumped into the system .
" even in households , there are often possibilities to save water , " magiera said .
effective use of water can also be achieved through economic measures such as regulating water prices .
if all water-saving measures are exhausted , then increasing fresh water reserves is the only option .
if water can not be imported , then the sea water must be desalinated .
" technically , that 's not a problem anymore today , " said kropp .
sea water desalination is practiced in countries such as israel or saudi arabia .
the united arab emirates are almost entirely dependent on desalinated sea water .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the uae meets its needs for freshwater through desalination plants but one of the problems that can crop up is that desalination plants are highly energy-intensive .
and that energy is largely achieved in the middle east by burning fossil-based fuel .
that releases carbon dioxide into the atmosphere and in turn accelerates climate change .
traditional solutions desalination plants have been set up in places like micronesia .
but these are mostly small plants with very low capacities .
bigger installations are too expensive .
and there 's a lack of energy reserves to power them .
magiera said that in this case , the answer would be to turn to traditional measures - such as harvesting rainwater - instead of high-tech solutions .

meanwhile , it is unclear where the ousted former president is located . in a fresh round of violence in kyrgyzstan , on monday hundreds of police officers were dispatched to suppress riots that started in a village outside of the capital , bishkek .
ethnic kyrgyz rioters seized plots of land from russians and turks in the village of mayevka , and in the subsequent violence five people were killed and many others injured .
" the crowd poured into mayevka and started wreaking destruction , robbing and killing .
they mainly robbed and burned the homes of turks living in the village , " alexander konstantin , a local resident , told journalists .
" all the provocateurs and ringleaders in the riots will be punished to the full extent of the law , " the interim government said in a statement released on tuesday .
the riot was the latest challenge to the interim government , which seized power earlier this month after a popular uprising that ousted president kurmanbek bakiyev .
however , so far the interim government has failed to establish full control over the country .
on monday , loyalists of the former president installed a pro-bakiyev governor after seizing a regional government in jalalabad .
bakiyev 's whereabouts unknown toppled president bakiyev was flown to kazakhstan last week in an attempt to reduce the risk of civil war in kyrgyzstan .
a spokesperson for the foreign ministry in kazakhstan confirmed to the ap news agency that bakiyev had left the country , but provided no further details about where he had gone .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 20.04.2010 thai army warns of tough action großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thailand 's commander in chief , anupong paochinda , prepared to crack down thailand is bracing itself for a new round of clashes between anti-government protestors and security forces amid fears of major bloodshed .
the heightened tensions come as the deployment of troops in a financial area of the city thwarted a planned march by the protestors earlier tuesday . tensions remain high in bangkok ten days after clashes between the military and anti-government protestors left 25 people dead and hundreds injured . the army said it was now prepared to take tougher measures in the case of further clashes , using elite troops .
according to army spokesman colonel sunsern kaewkumnerd , the army was ready to take decisive action , including the use of live bullets , if provoked .
protesters remain firm charan dittapichai is a leader of the united democratic front against dictatorship , or udd , better known as the red shirts .
he says the protesters will remain resolute in the case of a crackdown .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anti-government demonstrators shout insults from behind razor wire he does not believe the army will crack down in seven days , as they are threatening to do .
" it can not .
i do n't believe that the army can do that .
and if they do , no one knows what will happen because at least 30 percent who come here are not afraid of death . "
the udd says prime minister abhisit vejjajiva 's government must resign and call new elections .
but the government and coalition partners say elections in the current heated climate would do little to end the current political crisis .
on tuesday tens of thousands of red shirt protesters gathered at the rally site , near major malls and department stores that have been forced to close for almost three weeks at the cost of millions of dollars .
" they 're trying to demonize us " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anti-government protesters , in red , clash with policemen sean boonpracong , a udd spokesperson , says while there are fears the deep social divisions could be exacerbated , the government is to be blamed , not the protestors .
" they 're trying to blame us as intransigent .
you have to remember the government and their conservative allies are more powerful than us .
i think you should ask them what they 're prepared to offer .
but they 're trying to demonize us as being a terrorist group .
and it 's really counterproductive to hear that type of really extreme rhetoric . "
army officials said protestors have stockpiled home-made weapons including acid banks and clubs spiked with nails in preparation for a crackdown .
there is concern that demonstrators may also have firearms .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thailand 's prime minister abhisit vejjajiva , said his government stands ready to talk with the " red shirts " " i am afraid because i can not see any sign from now on how we can pass this moment peacefully , " says pinpaka ngamsom , the assistant editor for online news service , prachatai.com.
" if you see all the factors right now it 's difficult for thailand .
if you look at the prime minister it 's hard for him to turn away and if you look to the red shirts for the leader it 's also very hard for them to turn away , and if you look at the protestor they strongly believe that they can win . "
the worst crisis in two decades the current political crisis is the most severe test for the country in almost 20 years .
prime minister abhisit survived a similar crisis last year , one also led by the red shirts who are backing former prime minister thaksin shinawatra .
thaksin remains overseas to avoid a two year jail term for corruption .
but it is also reported thaksin is consolidating his support even now within police and military ranks .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de mergers & acquisitions -pipe- 20.04.2010 deutsche bahn offers 1.54 billion pounds for britain 's arriva großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : arriva operates transport services in 12 european nations deutsche bahn 's plan to acquire uk transport provider arriva appears to be on track .
the takeover - the most expensive in the german company 's history - is aimed at strengthening its passenger business throughout europe . british train and bus operator arriva has confirmed that german state rail company deutsche bahn is willing to pay 1.54 billion pounds -lrb- 1.8 billion euros -rrb- in cash to buy its operations as advanced talks continue .
media reports said that if arriva 's debt is taken into account , the total value of the offer is 2.7 billion euros .
reuters news agency quoted sources close to the deal who said the takeover would be financed entirely through the issuance of bonds , and could be approved by deutsche bahn 's supervisory board as early as next week .
the acquisition , which would confirm deutsche bahn as europe 's largest rail transport operator , could also trigger a wave of consolidation in the rail sector .
french rail company sncf , which held talks with arriva as well , is equally keen to expand its footprint throughout europe .
deutsche bahn and arriva have been in talks for several weeks .
the german operator has made no secret of its interest in acquiring the uk company , which operates bus networks , rail franchises and other transportation services in 12 european countries .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche bahn sees little room for growth in the german market key asset arriva is the only big british transport group to have ventured into europe , where it has taken advantage of gradual market liberalization .
its european operations account for nearly half of its revenue .
last month at the presentation of the group 's financial results , deutsche bahn chief executive officer ruediger grube said the company plans to run its high-speed long-distance trains through the channel tunnel and " further actively expand " its business activities beyond germany 's national borders .
deutsche bahn is keen to move beyond its home territory as germany 's domestic rail market opens up to competition .

in his annual address to parliament , putin expressed confidence that russia would exceed the official growth forecast of 3.1 percent in 2010 .
" provisional results for the first quarter fuel optimism . this allows us to say that the recession is over .
this does not mean that the crisis is over , " putin said .
putin concentrated on the merits of responsible fiscal policy , saying that russia did not want to have to " go with our hands outstretched to somebody , losing our economic and then our political sovereignty . "
although russia was hard hit by the economic crisis , with gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- shrinking by 7.9 percent in 2009 , it did not request help from the international monetary fund , unlike its neighbour ukraine .
healthcare reform putin proposed a reform of state finances in order to halve the budget deficit to 3 percent of gdp by 2012 , although he did not go into detail .
a planned rise in social security tax will go ahead from next year , and the prime minister said it would be used for a reform of the healthcare system .
" more than 30 percent of the country 's medical institutions are in a critical state or require a financial overhaul .
therefore , within the next two years , we will assign about 300 billion roubles -lrb- 10.3 billion dollars , 7.6 million euros -rrb- to put the country 's health system in order , " putin said .
in an attempt to boost russia 's standing in the business world , putin pledged to free russian businesses from the " kilos of paperwork " that burden operations .
he said the government would reform the agencies that regulate business and drop restrictions for start-up companies .
in a world bank list of attractive business climates , russia only ranks 120th , due to low transparency and impenetrable bureaucracy .
however , putin 's speech did not mention the strengthening rouble , which some analysts say is the biggest threat to boosting russia 's growth. cb / reuters / afp / ap editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the reopening of certain routes in europe has brought some respite to the thousands of people stranded in asia . despite the partial reopening of european air space , many asian carriers remained grounded for the sixth consecutive day due to huge volcanic ash clouds from iceland .
the cancellation of flights has not only left millions of people stranded , but also cast a cloud on asian business . binit somaia from the centre for asia pacific aviation in sydney says the impact is huge .
" for example in india , you have the start of the long summer school holidays , and a lot of people were looking forward to start departing for europe so the impact is there .

most carriers were looking forward to a much more buoyant market for the coming summer .

therefore they will see some support in this period .
but it will not be easy and certainly some smaller carriers may expect some challenges to go ahead .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de mergers & acquisitions -pipe- 20.04.2010 deutsche bahn offers 1.54 billion pounds for britain 's arriva großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : arriva operates transport services in 12 european nations deutsche bahn 's plan to acquire uk transport provider arriva appears to be on track .
the takeover - the most expensive in the german company 's history - is aimed at strengthening its passenger business throughout europe . british train and bus operator arriva has confirmed that german state rail company deutsche bahn is willing to pay 1.54 billion pounds -lrb- 1.8 billion euros -rrb- in cash to buy its operations as advanced talks continue .
media reports said that if arriva 's debt is taken into account , the total value of the offer is 2.7 billion euros .
reuters news agency quoted sources close to the deal who said the takeover would be financed entirely through the issuance of bonds , and could be approved by deutsche bahn 's supervisory board as early as next week .
the acquisition , which would confirm deutsche bahn as europe 's largest rail transport operator , could also trigger a wave of consolidation in the rail sector .
french rail company sncf , which held talks with arriva as well , is equally keen to expand its footprint throughout europe .
deutsche bahn and arriva have been in talks for several weeks .
the german operator has made no secret of its interest in acquiring the uk company , which operates bus networks , rail franchises and other transportation services in 12 european countries .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche bahn sees little room for growth in the german market key asset arriva is the only big british transport group to have ventured into europe , where it has taken advantage of gradual market liberalization .
its european operations account for nearly half of its revenue .
last month at the presentation of the group 's financial results , deutsche bahn chief executive officer ruediger grube said the company plans to run its high-speed long-distance trains through the channel tunnel and " further actively expand " its business activities beyond germany 's national borders .
deutsche bahn is keen to move beyond its home territory as germany 's domestic rail market opens up to competition .
the uk is high on its list of target countries .
the rail company has already made a number of acquisitions in britain including chiltern railways , which offers service between marylebone and birmingham , and ews , the freight operator .
it also runs the tyne & wear metro and holds a 50 percent stake in the london overground rail network .
pros and cons richard talbot , an analyst with the railway consultancy in london , said a takeover of arriva could benefit the uk rail market in several ways .
" deutsche bahn would bring technology know-how and system management skills , " he said .
" the company would also be another powerful player competing in the franchise bidding process . "
commuters who use uk trains also see benefits .
" trains in the uk have a very poor reputation when it comes to service , punctuality and cost , " said chris manning , a businessman who commutes daily by train to london and who is familiar with german service .
" they need to face competition from continental train companies like deutsche bahn to improve quality .
these operators are light years ahead . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics say britain 's rail network could use some german efficiency but consultant talbot also warned that consolidation could have its drawbacks .
" small can be beautiful , especially when it comes to regional operators that provide a good service cost-efficiently , " he said .
" big is n't always necessarily better . "
indeed , some critics of deutsche bahn say the state-owned company , which is known for its bureaucracy , could be overextending its resources with its ambitious expansion plans . author : john blau editor : samuel edmonds send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but they should n't underestimate their opponents . going into the home-and-away tie against french side olympique lyon , to be played on april 21 and 27 , the words " bayern " and " major roll " were being used a lot together .
not only had the bavarians knocked out manchester united in the quarterfinals , they engaged in a bit of target practice in a 7-0 thrashing of hanover in the bundesliga .
with lyon in third place in france ligue 1 , this season represents the bavarians ' best chance of getting back to the champions league final since they won the title in 2000-01 .
and indeed , the bookmakers are tipping bayern as the clear favorites in this encounter .
this is the first time lyon have made it as far as the semifinals in the champions league , and bayern are a richer club that currently rides atop the table in a better league .
what 's more they have winger arjen robben , who 's playing the most dominant football of anyone in europe not named lionel messi .

puels usually gets 10 men behind the ball , and both liverpool and real were frustrated by lyon 's tenacity , wearing themselves out and getting punished on the counter-attack .

olic is one of the hardest working players in the business , and the bavarians will hope that his tireless forechecking will allow him to capitalize on defensive lapses in concentration , much as he did when he scored on a crucial last-second poach against manchester united in the quarterfinals .
olic could be key since bayern 's pair of true center forwards , mario gomez and miroslav klose , have both been out of form .
robben has been little short of unstoppable , confounding defenses with his incisive runs and lightning-quick shots on goal .
lyon will likely devote at least a couple of defenders to the dutch winger , which should open space on the left for his counterpart , frank ribery .
ribery , though , has become something of an enigma .
injured for much of the season , he seems to have temporarily lost some of his assurance with the ball , and his lone goal in the manchester united tie came on a terribly taken free kick that was lucky to be deflected off the wall .

now bayern are the favorites to break the dry spell .
but they should n't underestimate their opponents . going into the home-and-away tie against french side olympique lyon , to be played on april 21 and 27 , the words " bayern " and " major roll " were being used a lot together .
not only had the bavarians knocked out manchester united in the quarterfinals , they engaged in a bit of target practice in a 7-0 thrashing of hanover in the bundesliga .
with lyon in third place in france ligue 1 , this season represents the bavarians ' best chance of getting back to the champions league final since they won the title in 2000-01 .
and indeed , the bookmakers are tipping bayern as the clear favorites in this encounter .
this is the first time lyon have made it as far as the semifinals in the champions league , and bayern are a richer club that currently rides atop the table in a better league .
what 's more they have winger arjen robben , who 's playing the most dominant football of anyone in europe not named lionel messi .
but although coach louis van gaal 's side have every reason to believe a trip to the final in madrid on may 22 is within reach , they had best beware of the french side , which has made a habit this season of toppling big names .
giant killers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern need to watch out for lopez coach claude puel 's men did not get where they are by accident .
to progress beyond the group stage , lyon had to beat liverpool , and their round-of-16 opponents were no less than real madrid .
the french side has a top striker in argentinian lisandro lopez .
he 's scored seven goals in the champions league thus far , including a pair that sent lyon past rivals bordeaux in the quarterfinals .
but olympique 's real strength is defense .
puels usually gets 10 men behind the ball , and both liverpool and real were frustrated by lyon 's tenacity , wearing themselves out and getting punished on the counter-attack .
plus , they have the advantage of playing their first game away from home , where any goals scored put pressure on the opponents for the return leg .
that 's why bayern ceo karl-heinz rummenigge warned against over-confidence as the first leg approached .
" this is a match-up of equals , " rummenigge told reporters .
" we 're not the underdogs , but we 're not the favorites , either . "
dynamic duo bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : robben , in particular , is having a career season bayern have had to score a fair number of goals in their champions league campaign , and most have come from two men : robben and overachieving croatian striker ivica olic .
olic is one of the hardest working players in the business , and the bavarians will hope that his tireless forechecking will allow him to capitalize on defensive lapses in concentration , much as he did when he scored on a crucial last-second poach against manchester united in the quarterfinals .
olic could be key since bayern 's pair of true center forwards , mario gomez and miroslav klose , have both been out of form .
robben has been little short of unstoppable , confounding defenses with his incisive runs and lightning-quick shots on goal .
lyon will likely devote at least a couple of defenders to the dutch winger , which should open space on the left for his counterpart , frank ribery .
ribery , though , has become something of an enigma .
injured for much of the season , he seems to have temporarily lost some of his assurance with the ball , and his lone goal in the manchester united tie came on a terribly taken free kick that was lucky to be deflected off the wall .
and the frenchman is not bayern 's only worry .
question marks bildunterschrift : badstuber -lrb- right -rrb- , is one of bayern 's young defenders in both of their previous champions league ties , bayern have lost their away matches .
to take the pressure off , they need not only to win their home match but avoid conceding what could be deadly goals .
the bavarians ' defense has looked very solid in the league , but the squad van gaal is fielding is young .
on the left , both 19-year-old diego contento and 21-year-old holger badstuber have sometimes looked out of their depth against top european opposition .
moreover , on the right philipp lahm - usually one of the best defensive players in the world - has looked out of sorts for most of this season .
nonetheless , despite these potential weaknesses and regardless of what bayern 's bosses were saying before the tie , munich are the favorites in this match-up , and they know it .
if their defense can rise to the occasion and their men up front get the job done in the allianz arena , they 'll be in an excellent position to return to european club football 's biggest match .

moreover , on the right philipp lahm - usually one of the best defensive players in the world - has looked out of sorts for most of this season .
nonetheless , despite these potential weaknesses and regardless of what bayern 's bosses were saying before the tie , munich are the favorites in this match-up , and they know it .
if their defense can rise to the occasion and their men up front get the job done in the allianz arena , they 'll be in an excellent position to return to european club football 's biggest match .

at the weekend , a door came loose and smashed into an oncoming train . deutsche bahn has announced it will investigate the failure of a door over the weekend and check all the operating trains for faults .
the trains will also run at reduced speed in tunnels until the reason for the accident has been determined .
on saturday , a train travelling from amsterdam to basel lost a door in a tunnel on the track between cologne and frankfurt .
the door came loose and crashed into the restaurant car of an oncoming train .
six people were injured , four of whom had to be treated in hospital .
the door was later recovered in a tunnel near the town of montabauer .
the track remained closed for ten hours of investigation .
the high speed ice train travels at up to 300 kilometers per hour between cologne and frankfurt .
a troubled safety record deutsche bahn 's prestigious ice trains are already facing hefty criticism over their safety record .
in july 2008 , a train derailed when its axle broke .
subsequent checks of the same generation trains revealed small cracks in the axles to be a widespread problem .
many of the trains had to be taken out of service to have the malfunctioning parts replaced .
as the wear and tear of material turned out to be higher than previously thought , the trains now have to undergo more frequent checks , leading to disruption in german rail services . ai / dpa / ap / apn editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but analysts are still cautious about its prospects . at a press conference on monday , nato secretary general anders rasmussen spoke about what he believed was the most serious security threat faced by europe .
" there is a growing missile threat , including from iran , " he said .
" and the politicians have a responsibility to protect the population . "
europe must " take its share in the joint protection from missile attacks . "
as far as nato is concerned , any hope of creating a missile defense system for europe rests on the cooperation of russia . moscow has persistently voiced its opposition to missile installations in eastern europe that it believes could be used as offensive weapons .
to this end , rasmussen has been working to bring nato and russia together to discuss the possibility .
speaking during a recent visit to london , nato spokesman james appathurai told reporters , " russia should be included in a missile defense system which covers europe . "
he said plans for a " new security architecture " should be " one roof which includes the russians as part of the same security family . "
the attempted cooperation has apparently met with some success .
at least one newspaper , the british independent , reported that secret talks had already begun between washington and moscow on the subject , though no further details were reported .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nmds are much more expensive than close range tmds the end of the george w. bush presidency certainly opened the door to a rapprochement between russia and the west , a process that has culminated in the recent signing of the nuclear disarmament strategic arms reduction treaty -lrb- start -rrb- treaty in prague .
many analysts were impressed at the speed with which president barack obama managed to instil enough trust in opposite number dmitry medvedev to bring him to a disarmament agreement .
just a start but many experts are still concerned whether obama 's so-called ' reset ' policy will be enough to allay russian concerns about a european missile shield .
margarete klein , senior associate at the german institute for international and security affairs -lrb- swp -rrb- , believes the former superpower enemies are still locked in a catch-22 stand-off .
" the crux of the problem is that such a defense shield would create a lot of trust between russia and nato , but would require a lot of trust in the first place , " she told deutsche welle .
but klein emphasized that there was a real willingness in russia to negotiate with the us , albeit with certain caveats .
" i think russia is open to cooperation with nato on a defence shield , on condition that the us postpones the deployment of parts of its global missile defense shield in eastern europe , " she said .
this rapprochement is partly motivated by a common threat - iran .
as francis tusa , veteran british defense analyst and writer military affairs , told deutsche welle , " if you look around at the world 's borders , you 'll see that russia is in a more risky position . "
bildunterschrift : us-russian relations have improved considerably under obama klein believes that russia 's signing of the start treaty was also motivated by necessity .
" russia saw that its strategic nuclear weapons arsenal will downsize anyway due to the age of the missiles , " she says .
" therefore , reducing its arsenal together with the usa offers the opportunity to remain on par with washington and reduce the financial burdens of its strategic nuclear arsenal . "
for its part , the us has been desperate to prevent russia selling arms to iran , and making a major agreement on a missile shield could be seen as an effective way to control the trade .
" the us has been very active in trying to persuade russia not to sell weapons to iran , " says tusa .
" but we know that russia has made deals with the iran in the past . "
several ways to skin a cat but the devil in any international agreement is in the proverbial details .
in this case , the detail is the actual military hardware up for discussion .
" there is some confusion about what kind of missile defense shields are being talked about , " says klein .
" there are theater missile defense -lrb- tmd -rrb- systems , designed to defend troops against shorter-range missiles , and the national missile defense -lrb- nmd -rrb- systems , designed to protect a whole nation or group of nations . "
though the more mobile tmds are typically used in actual war scenarios like afghanistan , they can be deployed as domestic defense systems instead of the larger nmds .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the air crash in smolensk may have improved polish-russian relations " there are several ways of skinning the cat , " says tusa .
" you could have linked batteries of tmd systems , which would be a lot cheaper . "
the variety of options and weapons technology is likely to dominate any negotiations , and could easily scupper the project .
both sides are likely to be wary of revealing too much of their own technology .
" i think the us state department 's concern at the moment is probably whether the russians are just there to have a look-see , " said tusa .
" they may say they 're interested in creating a joint defense shield just to see what the us has to offer , and then back out if it 's not enough . "
experience suggests that armies are extremely cagey about sharing technology , even with their partners .
" america 's main nato allies in europe - the uk and germany - basically never get to see any us military technology .
do we really believe that the state department is suddenly going to let russia see everything ? " asked tusa .
european complications but this does not exhaust all the complications that any large-scale collaboration would involve .
the european nato states where missile defense systems would be installed are unlikely to allow the negotiations to take place without their opinions being heard .
and these opinions are wide-ranging .
" europe encompasses several different views - eastern european countries obviously have a very different attitude to russia than western ones , " said tusa .
" the countries to the south-east will be more concerned about the threat from missiles , while countries in north-western europe less so . "
as so often , the importance of poland 's strategic position in europe could prove vital , and the country 's recently improved relations with russia may open to the door to a global project .
klein is optimistic : " poland is a very important member state in nato , and poland 's relations with russia will play an important part in the development of the missile defense shield .
for that reason the recent rapprochement between the two countries , which began well before the recent tragedy in smolensk , is a good sign . "

" the countries to the south-east will be more concerned about the threat from missiles , while countries in north-western europe less so . "
as so often , the importance of poland 's strategic position in europe could prove vital , and the country 's recently improved relations with russia may open to the door to a global project .
klein is optimistic : " poland is a very important member state in nato , and poland 's relations with russia will play an important part in the development of the missile defense shield .
for that reason the recent rapprochement between the two countries , which began well before the recent tragedy in smolensk , is a good sign . "

but analysts are still cautious about its prospects . at a press conference on monday , nato secretary general anders rasmussen spoke about what he believed was the most serious security threat faced by europe .
" there is a growing missile threat , including from iran , " he said .
" and the politicians have a responsibility to protect the population . "
europe must " take its share in the joint protection from missile attacks . "
as far as nato is concerned , any hope of creating a missile defense system for europe rests on the cooperation of russia . moscow has persistently voiced its opposition to missile installations in eastern europe that it believes could be used as offensive weapons .
to this end , rasmussen has been working to bring nato and russia together to discuss the possibility .
speaking during a recent visit to london , nato spokesman james appathurai told reporters , " russia should be included in a missile defense system which covers europe . "
he said plans for a " new security architecture " should be " one roof which includes the russians as part of the same security family . "
the attempted cooperation has apparently met with some success .
at least one newspaper , the british independent , reported that secret talks had already begun between washington and moscow on the subject , though no further details were reported .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nmds are much more expensive than close range tmds the end of the george w. bush presidency certainly opened the door to a rapprochement between russia and the west , a process that has culminated in the recent signing of the nuclear disarmament strategic arms reduction treaty -lrb- start -rrb- treaty in prague .
many analysts were impressed at the speed with which president barack obama managed to instil enough trust in opposite number dmitry medvedev to bring him to a disarmament agreement .
just a start but many experts are still concerned whether obama 's so-called ' reset ' policy will be enough to allay russian concerns about a european missile shield .
margarete klein , senior associate at the german institute for international and security affairs -lrb- swp -rrb- , believes the former superpower enemies are still locked in a catch-22 stand-off .
" the crux of the problem is that such a defense shield would create a lot of trust between russia and nato , but would require a lot of trust in the first place , " she told deutsche welle .
but klein emphasized that there was a real willingness in russia to negotiate with the us , albeit with certain caveats .
" i think russia is open to cooperation with nato on a defence shield , on condition that the us postpones the deployment of parts of its global missile defense shield in eastern europe , " she said .
this rapprochement is partly motivated by a common threat - iran .
as francis tusa , veteran british defense analyst and writer military affairs , told deutsche welle , " if you look around at the world 's borders , you 'll see that russia is in a more risky position . "
bildunterschrift : us-russian relations have improved considerably under obama klein believes that russia 's signing of the start treaty was also motivated by necessity .
" russia saw that its strategic nuclear weapons arsenal will downsize anyway due to the age of the missiles , " she says .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : focus : nato faces a changing world with new challenges nato and russia seek to bury past differences lightning-fast us-eu summit in lisbon aims to revive ties nato to withdraw from afghanistan by 2014 as summit begins , nato missile shield a test of turkey 's allegiance nato -pipe- 20.04.2010 nato and russia edge warily toward a joint missile defense shield großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rasmussen has been trying to bring the usa and russia together nato secretary general anders rasmussen has appealed for a joint missile defense shield with russia to cover europe and offer protection from a possible terror attack .
but analysts are still cautious about its prospects . at a press conference on monday , nato secretary general anders rasmussen spoke about what he believed was the most serious security threat faced by europe .
" there is a growing missile threat , including from iran , " he said .
" and the politicians have a responsibility to protect the population . "
europe must " take its share in the joint protection from missile attacks . "
as far as nato is concerned , any hope of creating a missile defense system for europe rests on the cooperation of russia . moscow has persistently voiced its opposition to missile installations in eastern europe that it believes could be used as offensive weapons .
to this end , rasmussen has been working to bring nato and russia together to discuss the possibility .
speaking during a recent visit to london , nato spokesman james appathurai told reporters , " russia should be included in a missile defense system which covers europe . "
he said plans for a " new security architecture " should be " one roof which includes the russians as part of the same security family . "
the attempted cooperation has apparently met with some success .
at least one newspaper , the british independent , reported that secret talks had already begun between washington and moscow on the subject , though no further details were reported .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nmds are much more expensive than close range tmds the end of the george w. bush presidency certainly opened the door to a rapprochement between russia and the west , a process that has culminated in the recent signing of the nuclear disarmament strategic arms reduction treaty -lrb- start -rrb- treaty in prague .
many analysts were impressed at the speed with which president barack obama managed to instil enough trust in opposite number dmitry medvedev to bring him to a disarmament agreement .
just a start but many experts are still concerned whether obama 's so-called ' reset ' policy will be enough to allay russian concerns about a european missile shield .
margarete klein , senior associate at the german institute for international and security affairs -lrb- swp -rrb- , believes the former superpower enemies are still locked in a catch-22 stand-off .
" the crux of the problem is that such a defense shield would create a lot of trust between russia and nato , but would require a lot of trust in the first place , " she told deutsche welle .
but klein emphasized that there was a real willingness in russia to negotiate with the us , albeit with certain caveats .
" i think russia is open to cooperation with nato on a defence shield , on condition that the us postpones the deployment of parts of its global missile defense shield in eastern europe , " she said .
this rapprochement is partly motivated by a common threat - iran .
as francis tusa , veteran british defense analyst and writer military affairs , told deutsche welle , " if you look around at the world 's borders , you 'll see that russia is in a more risky position . "
bildunterschrift : us-russian relations have improved considerably under obama klein believes that russia 's signing of the start treaty was also motivated by necessity .
" russia saw that its strategic nuclear weapons arsenal will downsize anyway due to the age of the missiles , " she says .
" therefore , reducing its arsenal together with the usa offers the opportunity to remain on par with washington and reduce the financial burdens of its strategic nuclear arsenal . "
for its part , the us has been desperate to prevent russia selling arms to iran , and making a major agreement on a missile shield could be seen as an effective way to control the trade .
" the us has been very active in trying to persuade russia not to sell weapons to iran , " says tusa .
" but we know that russia has made deals with the iran in the past . "
several ways to skin a cat but the devil in any international agreement is in the proverbial details .
in this case , the detail is the actual military hardware up for discussion .
" there is some confusion about what kind of missile defense shields are being talked about , " says klein .
" there are theater missile defense -lrb- tmd -rrb- systems , designed to defend troops against shorter-range missiles , and the national missile defense -lrb- nmd -rrb- systems , designed to protect a whole nation or group of nations . "
though the more mobile tmds are typically used in actual war scenarios like afghanistan , they can be deployed as domestic defense systems instead of the larger nmds .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the air crash in smolensk may have improved polish-russian relations " there are several ways of skinning the cat , " says tusa .
" you could have linked batteries of tmd systems , which would be a lot cheaper . "
the variety of options and weapons technology is likely to dominate any negotiations , and could easily scupper the project .
both sides are likely to be wary of revealing too much of their own technology .
" i think the us state department 's concern at the moment is probably whether the russians are just there to have a look-see , " said tusa .
" they may say they 're interested in creating a joint defense shield just to see what the us has to offer , and then back out if it 's not enough . "
experience suggests that armies are extremely cagey about sharing technology , even with their partners .
" america 's main nato allies in europe - the uk and germany - basically never get to see any us military technology .
do we really believe that the state department is suddenly going to let russia see everything ? " asked tusa .
european complications but this does not exhaust all the complications that any large-scale collaboration would involve .
the european nato states where missile defense systems would be installed are unlikely to allow the negotiations to take place without their opinions being heard .
and these opinions are wide-ranging .
" europe encompasses several different views - eastern european countries obviously have a very different attitude to russia than western ones , " said tusa .
" the countries to the south-east will be more concerned about the threat from missiles , while countries in north-western europe less so . "
as so often , the importance of poland 's strategic position in europe could prove vital , and the country 's recently improved relations with russia may open to the door to a global project .
klein is optimistic : " poland is a very important member state in nato , and poland 's relations with russia will play an important part in the development of the missile defense shield .
for that reason the recent rapprochement between the two countries , which began well before the recent tragedy in smolensk , is a good sign . "

the takeover - the most expensive in the german company 's history - is aimed at strengthening its passenger business throughout europe . british train and bus operator arriva has confirmed that german state rail company deutsche bahn is willing to pay 1.54 billion pounds -lrb- 1.8 billion euros -rrb- in cash to buy its operations as advanced talks continue .
media reports said that if arriva 's debt is taken into account , the total value of the offer is 2.7 billion euros .
reuters news agency quoted sources close to the deal who said the takeover would be financed entirely through the issuance of bonds , and could be approved by deutsche bahn 's supervisory board as early as next week .
the acquisition , which would confirm deutsche bahn as europe 's largest rail transport operator , could also trigger a wave of consolidation in the rail sector .
french rail company sncf , which held talks with arriva as well , is equally keen to expand its footprint throughout europe .
deutsche bahn and arriva have been in talks for several weeks .
the german operator has made no secret of its interest in acquiring the uk company , which operates bus networks , rail franchises and other transportation services in 12 european countries .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche bahn sees little room for growth in the german market key asset arriva is the only big british transport group to have ventured into europe , where it has taken advantage of gradual market liberalization .
its european operations account for nearly half of its revenue .
last month at the presentation of the group 's financial results , deutsche bahn chief executive officer ruediger grube said the company plans to run its high-speed long-distance trains through the channel tunnel and " further actively expand " its business activities beyond germany 's national borders .
deutsche bahn is keen to move beyond its home territory as germany 's domestic rail market opens up to competition .
the uk is high on its list of target countries .
the rail company has already made a number of acquisitions in britain including chiltern railways , which offers service between marylebone and birmingham , and ews , the freight operator .
it also runs the tyne & wear metro and holds a 50 percent stake in the london overground rail network .
pros and cons richard talbot , an analyst with the railway consultancy in london , said a takeover of arriva could benefit the uk rail market in several ways .
" deutsche bahn would bring technology know-how and system management skills , " he said .
" the company would also be another powerful player competing in the franchise bidding process . "
commuters who use uk trains also see benefits .
" trains in the uk have a very poor reputation when it comes to service , punctuality and cost , " said chris manning , a businessman who commutes daily by train to london and who is familiar with german service .
" they need to face competition from continental train companies like deutsche bahn to improve quality .
these operators are light years ahead . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics say britain 's rail network could use some german efficiency but consultant talbot also warned that consolidation could have its drawbacks .
" small can be beautiful , especially when it comes to regional operators that provide a good service cost-efficiently , " he said .
" big is n't always necessarily better . "
indeed , some critics of deutsche bahn say the state-owned company , which is known for its bureaucracy , could be overextending its resources with its ambitious expansion plans . author : john blau editor : samuel edmonds send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

at the weekend , a door came loose and smashed into an oncoming train . deutsche bahn has announced it will investigate the failure of a door over the weekend and check all the operating trains for faults .
the trains will also run at reduced speed in tunnels until the reason for the accident has been determined .
on saturday , a train travelling from amsterdam to basel lost a door in a tunnel on the track between cologne and frankfurt .
the door came loose and crashed into the restaurant car of an oncoming train .
six people were injured , four of whom had to be treated in hospital .
the door was later recovered in a tunnel near the town of montabauer .
the track remained closed for ten hours of investigation .
the high speed ice train travels at up to 300 kilometers per hour between cologne and frankfurt .
a troubled safety record deutsche bahn 's prestigious ice trains are already facing hefty criticism over their safety record .
in july 2008 , a train derailed when its axle broke .
subsequent checks of the same generation trains revealed small cracks in the axles to be a widespread problem .
many of the trains had to be taken out of service to have the malfunctioning parts replaced .
as the wear and tear of material turned out to be higher than previously thought , the trains now have to undergo more frequent checks , leading to disruption in german rail services . ai / dpa / ap / apn editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the heightened tensions come as the deployment of troops in a financial area of the city thwarted a planned march by the protestors earlier tuesday . tensions remain high in bangkok ten days after clashes between the military and anti-government protestors left 25 people dead and hundreds injured . the army said it was now prepared to take tougher measures in the case of further clashes , using elite troops .
according to army spokesman colonel sunsern kaewkumnerd , the army was ready to take decisive action , including the use of live bullets , if provoked .

in his annual address to parliament , putin expressed confidence that russia would exceed the official growth forecast of 3.1 percent in 2010 .
" provisional results for the first quarter fuel optimism . this allows us to say that the recession is over .
this does not mean that the crisis is over , " putin said .
putin concentrated on the merits of responsible fiscal policy , saying that russia did not want to have to " go with our hands outstretched to somebody , losing our economic and then our political sovereignty . "
although russia was hard hit by the economic crisis , with gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- shrinking by 7.9 percent in 2009 , it did not request help from the international monetary fund , unlike its neighbour ukraine .
healthcare reform putin proposed a reform of state finances in order to halve the budget deficit to 3 percent of gdp by 2012 , although he did not go into detail .
a planned rise in social security tax will go ahead from next year , and the prime minister said it would be used for a reform of the healthcare system .
" more than 30 percent of the country 's medical institutions are in a critical state or require a financial overhaul .
therefore , within the next two years , we will assign about 300 billion roubles -lrb- 10.3 billion dollars , 7.6 million euros -rrb- to put the country 's health system in order , " putin said .
in an attempt to boost russia 's standing in the business world , putin pledged to free russian businesses from the " kilos of paperwork " that burden operations .

in his annual address to parliament , putin expressed confidence that russia would exceed the official growth forecast of 3.1 percent in 2010 .
" provisional results for the first quarter fuel optimism . this allows us to say that the recession is over .
this does not mean that the crisis is over , " putin said .
putin concentrated on the merits of responsible fiscal policy , saying that russia did not want to have to " go with our hands outstretched to somebody , losing our economic and then our political sovereignty . "
although russia was hard hit by the economic crisis , with gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- shrinking by 7.9 percent in 2009 , it did not request help from the international monetary fund , unlike its neighbour ukraine .
healthcare reform putin proposed a reform of state finances in order to halve the budget deficit to 3 percent of gdp by 2012 , although he did not go into detail .
a planned rise in social security tax will go ahead from next year , and the prime minister said it would be used for a reform of the healthcare system .
" more than 30 percent of the country 's medical institutions are in a critical state or require a financial overhaul .
therefore , within the next two years , we will assign about 300 billion roubles -lrb- 10.3 billion dollars , 7.6 million euros -rrb- to put the country 's health system in order , " putin said .
in an attempt to boost russia 's standing in the business world , putin pledged to free russian businesses from the " kilos of paperwork " that burden operations .
he said the government would reform the agencies that regulate business and drop restrictions for start-up companies .

airlines have accused aviation experts of exaggerating the risk , but is it really safe to fly right now ? europe 's busiest air hub saw its first flights on tuesday evening as airspace across the continent slowly began to reopen following nearly a week of widespread travel disruption .
a flight from vancouver arrived at london 's heathrow airport shortly before 10 p.m. local time , the first since british airspace was closed last thursday following the eruption of iceland 's eyjafjallajokull volcano .
british airways expected about 24 other flights to arrive from the united states , africa and asia later in the evening .
earlier tuesday , germany 's two biggest airlines announced they would resume flying many of their regularly scheduled flights , despite an ongoing no-fly rule in german airspace , by operating under special " visual flight " conditions . under the visual flight rules , airlines are permitted to fly below 3,000 meters -lrb- 9,800 feet -rrb- during daylight , as long as pilots use their own radar and eyesight to avoid other planes .
germany 's flag carrier lufthansa announced it would carry more than 15,000 passengers on some 200 flights on tuesday .
air berlin , germany 's second largest carrier , was operating a nearly full flight schedule , according to its web site .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many stranded passengers were forced to sleep in airports the flights were operating through a loophole in the aviation regulations , said christine kellek of germany 's flight safety organization -lrb- dfs -rrb- .
the closure of airspace only applies to aviation that relies on ground control and navigation instruments , according to kellek .
" the german air navigation services can not forbid flying by visual flying rules , because we regulate instrument flights , so it is not up to us to decide if somebody can fly under visual flying rules or not , " kellek told deutsche welle .
pressure on pilots but while these flights may be allowed , not everyone supports the idea .
juerg handwerg , a pilot and spokesperson for the german pilots ' union cockpit , said he thinks the decision to allow planes to operate on visual flight was fueled by financial considerations .
" they are avoiding the international rules they signed themselves by flying under visual flight rules , " said handwerg .
" it 's due to monetary reasons . "
it puts unfair pressure on pilots , he added . " legally , you can say , ‘ no i do n't want to fly , ’ but if your employer tells you to fly and you say no , you can get thrown out .
so how can you decide not to fly ? "
handwerg told deutsche welle . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : volcanic ash drifting across the atlantic forced the cancellation of flights across europe an expensive problem in the past , volcanic ash has been known to cause problems with aircraft . following last week 's eruption in iceland , air france , british airways , klm and lufthansa reported no problems from their own test flights , but senior us military officials said the ash had caused some engine damage to a nato f-16 fighter plane . scientists from the german aerospace center -lrb- dlr -rrb- carried out a four-hour test flight monday to measure the cloud 's density and composition .
the results were submitted to transportation authorities in berlin , who were to decide whether or not it 's safe to fly in german airspace , according to karl hinterleitner of the dlr .
after several days of flight cancellations , airlines are itching to see a return to business as usual , as flight disruptions are costing them as much as 200 million euros -lrb- $ 270 million -rrb- per day .
experts say it 's hard to know when the situation will return to normal , leaving policymakers walking a difficult line between trying to minimize the economic impact of further flight suspension and the potential risk of flying through volcanic ash .

it was announced on tuesday that 25-year-old adler , who plays for bayer leverkusen , suffered the injury during last saturday 's 2-1 defeat against stuttgart .
there are fears that this could jeopardize his place as number one goalie during the soccer tournament , which starts on june 11 .
but adler is staying optimistic .
" the doctors say the fracture is expected to heal pretty quickly , so i am cautiously optimistic , " he said in a press release by his club .
but adler will have to miss at least saturday 's clash against hanover .
he won the first of his nine caps in october 2008 , and at the beginning of march this year loew chose him as number one keeper over schalke 's manuel neuer and bremen 's tim wiese .

but early signs of disaster , like increasingly saline groundwater and dwindling freshwater reserves , are already visible . last fall , island nations made a dramatic appeal to industrialized countries : " my country is on the verge of being submerged , " emanuel mori , the president of micronesia , told representatives of the european union at the time .
he demanded that western countries finally rethink their climate policies .
island states like micronesia have been hit particularly hard by global warming , primarily through rising sea levels .
there are real fears that the country could disappear from the world map in the not-too-distant future .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rising water levels are threatening micronesia 's coastlines the signs of the looming disaster are already there : rising sea levels have mixed salt water with the groundwater in several areas .
that , in turn , is shrinking drinking water reserves and making it harder to irrigate agricultural land .
the high level of salinity has poisoned the ground and made it infertile for years .
" it 's a particularly tough situation for small island nations , " juergen kropp of the potsdam institute of climate impact research said .
he added that these nations already had limited groundwater reserves .
island states not the only ones affected but it 's not just places like micronesia that are grappling with the problem of increasing salinity in the groundwater .
many other regions with long coastlines , for instance the gaza strip , are faced with similar problems .
the gaza strip is one of the most crowded places in the world , and that dense population puts great pressure on the region 's water supply .
experts say it is another important cause of saline groundwater .
" sea water can only intrude in places where water has been drained previously , " kropp said .
if groundwater turns saline , he said , it shows that more groundwater was used than can be replaced .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more demand for water can lead to rising salinity in groundwater philip magiera of the state-funded gtz development organization in germany said there are two ways to tackle the issue - either by increasing the existing water supply , or by limiting demand for it .
" i 'm a big fan of water efficiency , " magiera said .
there are lots of examples of how water usage can be reduced , he said , particularly in the agricultural sector .
in many regions , up to 70 percent of the groundwater is used to irrigate fields .
but with systems such as drip irrigation , it 's possible to save large quantities of water .
water wastage a major problem often , a lot of water is simply wasted on the way to the end consumer .
many countries struggle with leaky piping systems .
in such cases , experts say , it makes more sense to first fix the leaks before more water is pumped into the system .
" even in households , there are often possibilities to save water , " magiera said .
effective use of water can also be achieved through economic measures such as regulating water prices .
if all water-saving measures are exhausted , then increasing fresh water reserves is the only option .
if water can not be imported , then the sea water must be desalinated .
" technically , that 's not a problem anymore today , " said kropp .
sea water desalination is practiced in countries such as israel or saudi arabia .
the united arab emirates are almost entirely dependent on desalinated sea water .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the uae meets its needs for freshwater through desalination plants but one of the problems that can crop up is that desalination plants are highly energy-intensive .
and that energy is largely achieved in the middle east by burning fossil-based fuel .
that releases carbon dioxide into the atmosphere and in turn accelerates climate change .
traditional solutions desalination plants have been set up in places like micronesia .
but these are mostly small plants with very low capacities .
bigger installations are too expensive .
and there 's a lack of energy reserves to power them .
magiera said that in this case , the answer would be to turn to traditional measures - such as harvesting rainwater - instead of high-tech solutions .

" even in households , there are often possibilities to save water , " magiera said .
effective use of water can also be achieved through economic measures such as regulating water prices .
if all water-saving measures are exhausted , then increasing fresh water reserves is the only option .
if water can not be imported , then the sea water must be desalinated .
" technically , that 's not a problem anymore today , " said kropp .
sea water desalination is practiced in countries such as israel or saudi arabia .
the united arab emirates are almost entirely dependent on desalinated sea water .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the uae meets its needs for freshwater through desalination plants but one of the problems that can crop up is that desalination plants are highly energy-intensive .
and that energy is largely achieved in the middle east by burning fossil-based fuel .
that releases carbon dioxide into the atmosphere and in turn accelerates climate change .
traditional solutions desalination plants have been set up in places like micronesia .
but these are mostly small plants with very low capacities .
bigger installations are too expensive .
and there 's a lack of energy reserves to power them .
magiera said that in this case , the answer would be to turn to traditional measures - such as harvesting rainwater - instead of high-tech solutions .

the heightened tensions come as the deployment of troops in a financial area of the city thwarted a planned march by the protestors earlier tuesday . tensions remain high in bangkok ten days after clashes between the military and anti-government protestors left 25 people dead and hundreds injured . the army said it was now prepared to take tougher measures in the case of further clashes , using elite troops .
according to army spokesman colonel sunsern kaewkumnerd , the army was ready to take decisive action , including the use of live bullets , if provoked .
protesters remain firm charan dittapichai is a leader of the united democratic front against dictatorship , or udd , better known as the red shirts .
he says the protesters will remain resolute in the case of a crackdown .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anti-government demonstrators shout insults from behind razor wire he does not believe the army will crack down in seven days , as they are threatening to do .
" it can not .
i do n't believe that the army can do that .
and if they do , no one knows what will happen because at least 30 percent who come here are not afraid of death . "
the udd says prime minister abhisit vejjajiva 's government must resign and call new elections .
but the government and coalition partners say elections in the current heated climate would do little to end the current political crisis .
on tuesday tens of thousands of red shirt protesters gathered at the rally site , near major malls and department stores that have been forced to close for almost three weeks at the cost of millions of dollars .
" they 're trying to demonize us " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anti-government protesters , in red , clash with policemen sean boonpracong , a udd spokesperson , says while there are fears the deep social divisions could be exacerbated , the government is to be blamed , not the protestors .
" they 're trying to blame us as intransigent .
you have to remember the government and their conservative allies are more powerful than us .
i think you should ask them what they 're prepared to offer .
but they 're trying to demonize us as being a terrorist group .
and it 's really counterproductive to hear that type of really extreme rhetoric . "
army officials said protestors have stockpiled home-made weapons including acid banks and clubs spiked with nails in preparation for a crackdown .
there is concern that demonstrators may also have firearms .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thailand 's prime minister abhisit vejjajiva , said his government stands ready to talk with the " red shirts " " i am afraid because i can not see any sign from now on how we can pass this moment peacefully , " says pinpaka ngamsom , the assistant editor for online news service , prachatai.com.
" if you see all the factors right now it 's difficult for thailand .
if you look at the prime minister it 's hard for him to turn away and if you look to the red shirts for the leader it 's also very hard for them to turn away , and if you look at the protestor they strongly believe that they can win . "
the worst crisis in two decades the current political crisis is the most severe test for the country in almost 20 years .
prime minister abhisit survived a similar crisis last year , one also led by the red shirts who are backing former prime minister thaksin shinawatra .
thaksin remains overseas to avoid a two year jail term for corruption .
but it is also reported thaksin is consolidating his support even now within police and military ranks .

at the weekend , a door came loose and smashed into an oncoming train . deutsche bahn has announced it will investigate the failure of a door over the weekend and check all the operating trains for faults .
the trains will also run at reduced speed in tunnels until the reason for the accident has been determined .
on saturday , a train travelling from amsterdam to basel lost a door in a tunnel on the track between cologne and frankfurt .
the door came loose and crashed into the restaurant car of an oncoming train .
six people were injured , four of whom had to be treated in hospital .
the door was later recovered in a tunnel near the town of montabauer .
the track remained closed for ten hours of investigation .
the high speed ice train travels at up to 300 kilometers per hour between cologne and frankfurt .
a troubled safety record deutsche bahn 's prestigious ice trains are already facing hefty criticism over their safety record .
in july 2008 , a train derailed when its axle broke .
subsequent checks of the same generation trains revealed small cracks in the axles to be a widespread problem .
many of the trains had to be taken out of service to have the malfunctioning parts replaced .
as the wear and tear of material turned out to be higher than previously thought , the trains now have to undergo more frequent checks , leading to disruption in german rail services . ai / dpa / ap / apn editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but early signs of disaster , like increasingly saline groundwater and dwindling freshwater reserves , are already visible . last fall , island nations made a dramatic appeal to industrialized countries : " my country is on the verge of being submerged , " emanuel mori , the president of micronesia , told representatives of the european union at the time .
he demanded that western countries finally rethink their climate policies .
island states like micronesia have been hit particularly hard by global warming , primarily through rising sea levels .
there are real fears that the country could disappear from the world map in the not-too-distant future .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rising water levels are threatening micronesia 's coastlines the signs of the looming disaster are already there : rising sea levels have mixed salt water with the groundwater in several areas .
that , in turn , is shrinking drinking water reserves and making it harder to irrigate agricultural land .
the high level of salinity has poisoned the ground and made it infertile for years .
" it 's a particularly tough situation for small island nations , " juergen kropp of the potsdam institute of climate impact research said .
he added that these nations already had limited groundwater reserves .
island states not the only ones affected but it 's not just places like micronesia that are grappling with the problem of increasing salinity in the groundwater .
many other regions with long coastlines , for instance the gaza strip , are faced with similar problems .
the gaza strip is one of the most crowded places in the world , and that dense population puts great pressure on the region 's water supply .
experts say it is another important cause of saline groundwater .
" sea water can only intrude in places where water has been drained previously , " kropp said .
if groundwater turns saline , he said , it shows that more groundwater was used than can be replaced .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more demand for water can lead to rising salinity in groundwater philip magiera of the state-funded gtz development organization in germany said there are two ways to tackle the issue - either by increasing the existing water supply , or by limiting demand for it .
" i 'm a big fan of water efficiency , " magiera said .
there are lots of examples of how water usage can be reduced , he said , particularly in the agricultural sector .
in many regions , up to 70 percent of the groundwater is used to irrigate fields .
but with systems such as drip irrigation , it 's possible to save large quantities of water .
water wastage a major problem often , a lot of water is simply wasted on the way to the end consumer .
many countries struggle with leaky piping systems .
in such cases , experts say , it makes more sense to first fix the leaks before more water is pumped into the system .
" even in households , there are often possibilities to save water , " magiera said .
effective use of water can also be achieved through economic measures such as regulating water prices .
if all water-saving measures are exhausted , then increasing fresh water reserves is the only option .
if water can not be imported , then the sea water must be desalinated .
" technically , that 's not a problem anymore today , " said kropp .
sea water desalination is practiced in countries such as israel or saudi arabia .
the united arab emirates are almost entirely dependent on desalinated sea water .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the uae meets its needs for freshwater through desalination plants but one of the problems that can crop up is that desalination plants are highly energy-intensive .
and that energy is largely achieved in the middle east by burning fossil-based fuel .
that releases carbon dioxide into the atmosphere and in turn accelerates climate change .
traditional solutions desalination plants have been set up in places like micronesia .
but these are mostly small plants with very low capacities .
bigger installations are too expensive .
and there 's a lack of energy reserves to power them .
magiera said that in this case , the answer would be to turn to traditional measures - such as harvesting rainwater - instead of high-tech solutions .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de champions league -pipe- 20.04.2010 bayern fancy their chances against lyon in champions league semis großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : robben , olic and lahm are three key bayern players it 's been nearly a decade since a german team has made the final of club soccer 's premier competition .
now bayern are the favorites to break the dry spell .
but they should n't underestimate their opponents . going into the home-and-away tie against french side olympique lyon , to be played on april 21 and 27 , the words " bayern " and " major roll " were being used a lot together .
not only had the bavarians knocked out manchester united in the quarterfinals , they engaged in a bit of target practice in a 7-0 thrashing of hanover in the bundesliga .
with lyon in third place in france ligue 1 , this season represents the bavarians ' best chance of getting back to the champions league final since they won the title in 2000-01 .
and indeed , the bookmakers are tipping bayern as the clear favorites in this encounter .
this is the first time lyon have made it as far as the semifinals in the champions league , and bayern are a richer club that currently rides atop the table in a better league .
what 's more they have winger arjen robben , who 's playing the most dominant football of anyone in europe not named lionel messi .
but although coach louis van gaal 's side have every reason to believe a trip to the final in madrid on may 22 is within reach , they had best beware of the french side , which has made a habit this season of toppling big names .
giant killers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern need to watch out for lopez coach claude puel 's men did not get where they are by accident .
to progress beyond the group stage , lyon had to beat liverpool , and their round-of-16 opponents were no less than real madrid .
the french side has a top striker in argentinian lisandro lopez .
he 's scored seven goals in the champions league thus far , including a pair that sent lyon past rivals bordeaux in the quarterfinals .
but olympique 's real strength is defense .
puels usually gets 10 men behind the ball , and both liverpool and real were frustrated by lyon 's tenacity , wearing themselves out and getting punished on the counter-attack .
plus , they have the advantage of playing their first game away from home , where any goals scored put pressure on the opponents for the return leg .
that 's why bayern ceo karl-heinz rummenigge warned against over-confidence as the first leg approached .
" this is a match-up of equals , " rummenigge told reporters .
" we 're not the underdogs , but we 're not the favorites , either . "
dynamic duo bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : robben , in particular , is having a career season bayern have had to score a fair number of goals in their champions league campaign , and most have come from two men : robben and overachieving croatian striker ivica olic .
olic is one of the hardest working players in the business , and the bavarians will hope that his tireless forechecking will allow him to capitalize on defensive lapses in concentration , much as he did when he scored on a crucial last-second poach against manchester united in the quarterfinals .
olic could be key since bayern 's pair of true center forwards , mario gomez and miroslav klose , have both been out of form .
robben has been little short of unstoppable , confounding defenses with his incisive runs and lightning-quick shots on goal .
lyon will likely devote at least a couple of defenders to the dutch winger , which should open space on the left for his counterpart , frank ribery .
ribery , though , has become something of an enigma .
injured for much of the season , he seems to have temporarily lost some of his assurance with the ball , and his lone goal in the manchester united tie came on a terribly taken free kick that was lucky to be deflected off the wall .
and the frenchman is not bayern 's only worry .
question marks bildunterschrift : badstuber -lrb- right -rrb- , is one of bayern 's young defenders in both of their previous champions league ties , bayern have lost their away matches .
to take the pressure off , they need not only to win their home match but avoid conceding what could be deadly goals .
the bavarians ' defense has looked very solid in the league , but the squad van gaal is fielding is young .
on the left , both 19-year-old diego contento and 21-year-old holger badstuber have sometimes looked out of their depth against top european opposition .
moreover , on the right philipp lahm - usually one of the best defensive players in the world - has looked out of sorts for most of this season .
nonetheless , despite these potential weaknesses and regardless of what bayern 's bosses were saying before the tie , munich are the favorites in this match-up , and they know it .
if their defense can rise to the occasion and their men up front get the job done in the allianz arena , they 'll be in an excellent position to return to european club football 's biggest match .

at the weekend , a door came loose and smashed into an oncoming train . deutsche bahn has announced it will investigate the failure of a door over the weekend and check all the operating trains for faults .
the trains will also run at reduced speed in tunnels until the reason for the accident has been determined .
on saturday , a train travelling from amsterdam to basel lost a door in a tunnel on the track between cologne and frankfurt .
the door came loose and crashed into the restaurant car of an oncoming train .
six people were injured , four of whom had to be treated in hospital .
the door was later recovered in a tunnel near the town of montabauer .
the track remained closed for ten hours of investigation .
the high speed ice train travels at up to 300 kilometers per hour between cologne and frankfurt .
a troubled safety record deutsche bahn 's prestigious ice trains are already facing hefty criticism over their safety record .
in july 2008 , a train derailed when its axle broke .
subsequent checks of the same generation trains revealed small cracks in the axles to be a widespread problem .
many of the trains had to be taken out of service to have the malfunctioning parts replaced .
as the wear and tear of material turned out to be higher than previously thought , the trains now have to undergo more frequent checks , leading to disruption in german rail services . ai / dpa / ap / apn editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in his annual address to parliament , putin expressed confidence that russia would exceed the official growth forecast of 3.1 percent in 2010 .
" provisional results for the first quarter fuel optimism . this allows us to say that the recession is over .
this does not mean that the crisis is over , " putin said .
putin concentrated on the merits of responsible fiscal policy , saying that russia did not want to have to " go with our hands outstretched to somebody , losing our economic and then our political sovereignty . "
although russia was hard hit by the economic crisis , with gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- shrinking by 7.9 percent in 2009 , it did not request help from the international monetary fund , unlike its neighbour ukraine .
healthcare reform putin proposed a reform of state finances in order to halve the budget deficit to 3 percent of gdp by 2012 , although he did not go into detail .
a planned rise in social security tax will go ahead from next year , and the prime minister said it would be used for a reform of the healthcare system .
" more than 30 percent of the country 's medical institutions are in a critical state or require a financial overhaul .
therefore , within the next two years , we will assign about 300 billion roubles -lrb- 10.3 billion dollars , 7.6 million euros -rrb- to put the country 's health system in order , " putin said .
in an attempt to boost russia 's standing in the business world , putin pledged to free russian businesses from the " kilos of paperwork " that burden operations .
he said the government would reform the agencies that regulate business and drop restrictions for start-up companies .
in a world bank list of attractive business climates , russia only ranks 120th , due to low transparency and impenetrable bureaucracy .
however , putin 's speech did not mention the strengthening rouble , which some analysts say is the biggest threat to boosting russia 's growth. cb / reuters / afp / ap editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the reopening of certain routes in europe has brought some respite to the thousands of people stranded in asia . despite the partial reopening of european air space , many asian carriers remained grounded for the sixth consecutive day due to huge volcanic ash clouds from iceland .
the cancellation of flights has not only left millions of people stranded , but also cast a cloud on asian business . binit somaia from the centre for asia pacific aviation in sydney says the impact is huge .
" for example in india , you have the start of the long summer school holidays , and a lot of people were looking forward to start departing for europe so the impact is there .
australia has a very high volume of traffic to europe .
likewise the countries that have airlines that act as major hub carriers such as cathay pacific from hong kong , or singapore airlines , gulf carriers such as ethihad and emirates are also affected . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iceland 's volcano is creating chaos not only in europe . exports and cargo affected even though the asian carriers have been able to continue their operation in the non european sectors as usual , they are expected to lose millions of dollars in revenue per day due to the disruption of flights in europe . asian exports and air cargo services have also been hit hard .
asian carriers transport a large percentage of cargo that includes mobile phones , high tech electronics and textiles . in south korea , a trade association estimated the country will post 112 million dollars -lrb- around 83 million euros -rrb- in lost exports caused by the ash cloud . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nissan says it has curtailed production at two plants due to delay of supply of parts thousands of factories in china 's guangdong province have also seen air freight delayed , mainly watches , jewellery and clothing . in japan , the carmaker nissan said it was being forced to suspend some vehicle production because of a shortage of parts that were supposed to come from ireland . impact on financial recovery experts fear the disruption of flights could slow down the regional recovery from the recent global economic slump . " this has come at a particularly bad time , " says somaia .
" after the financial crisis we saw last year , the market has just started to see some signs of recovery .
passenger numbers were increasing .
most carriers were looking forward to a much more buoyant market for the coming summer .
this has happened right at the start of this period . " but he maintains that the implications on the asian airlines as such will be minor : " they are relatively strong carriers compared to europe and america and a lot of the carriers in the region do have either full or partial ownership with the government .
therefore they will see some support in this period .
but it will not be easy and certainly some smaller carriers may expect some challenges to go ahead . " meanwhile weather experts in europe say they expect to see a change in wind conditions and rain over the weekend , which should help clear the ash cloud , sparking hopes that air traffic will soon fully resume . author : disha uppal editor : sarah berning send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

airlines have accused aviation experts of exaggerating the risk , but is it really safe to fly right now ? europe 's busiest air hub saw its first flights on tuesday evening as airspace across the continent slowly began to reopen following nearly a week of widespread travel disruption .
a flight from vancouver arrived at london 's heathrow airport shortly before 10 p.m. local time , the first since british airspace was closed last thursday following the eruption of iceland 's eyjafjallajokull volcano .
british airways expected about 24 other flights to arrive from the united states , africa and asia later in the evening .
earlier tuesday , germany 's two biggest airlines announced they would resume flying many of their regularly scheduled flights , despite an ongoing no-fly rule in german airspace , by operating under special " visual flight " conditions . under the visual flight rules , airlines are permitted to fly below 3,000 meters -lrb- 9,800 feet -rrb- during daylight , as long as pilots use their own radar and eyesight to avoid other planes .
germany 's flag carrier lufthansa announced it would carry more than 15,000 passengers on some 200 flights on tuesday .
air berlin , germany 's second largest carrier , was operating a nearly full flight schedule , according to its web site .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many stranded passengers were forced to sleep in airports the flights were operating through a loophole in the aviation regulations , said christine kellek of germany 's flight safety organization -lrb- dfs -rrb- .
the closure of airspace only applies to aviation that relies on ground control and navigation instruments , according to kellek .
" the german air navigation services can not forbid flying by visual flying rules , because we regulate instrument flights , so it is not up to us to decide if somebody can fly under visual flying rules or not , " kellek told deutsche welle .
pressure on pilots but while these flights may be allowed , not everyone supports the idea .
juerg handwerg , a pilot and spokesperson for the german pilots ' union cockpit , said he thinks the decision to allow planes to operate on visual flight was fueled by financial considerations .
" they are avoiding the international rules they signed themselves by flying under visual flight rules , " said handwerg .
" it 's due to monetary reasons . "
it puts unfair pressure on pilots , he added . " legally , you can say , ‘ no i do n't want to fly , ’ but if your employer tells you to fly and you say no , you can get thrown out .
so how can you decide not to fly ? "
handwerg told deutsche welle . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : volcanic ash drifting across the atlantic forced the cancellation of flights across europe an expensive problem in the past , volcanic ash has been known to cause problems with aircraft . following last week 's eruption in iceland , air france , british airways , klm and lufthansa reported no problems from their own test flights , but senior us military officials said the ash had caused some engine damage to a nato f-16 fighter plane . scientists from the german aerospace center -lrb- dlr -rrb- carried out a four-hour test flight monday to measure the cloud 's density and composition .
the results were submitted to transportation authorities in berlin , who were to decide whether or not it 's safe to fly in german airspace , according to karl hinterleitner of the dlr .
after several days of flight cancellations , airlines are itching to see a return to business as usual , as flight disruptions are costing them as much as 200 million euros -lrb- $ 270 million -rrb- per day .
experts say it 's hard to know when the situation will return to normal , leaving policymakers walking a difficult line between trying to minimize the economic impact of further flight suspension and the potential risk of flying through volcanic ash .

the heightened tensions come as the deployment of troops in a financial area of the city thwarted a planned march by the protestors earlier tuesday . tensions remain high in bangkok ten days after clashes between the military and anti-government protestors left 25 people dead and hundreds injured . the army said it was now prepared to take tougher measures in the case of further clashes , using elite troops .
according to army spokesman colonel sunsern kaewkumnerd , the army was ready to take decisive action , including the use of live bullets , if provoked .
protesters remain firm charan dittapichai is a leader of the united democratic front against dictatorship , or udd , better known as the red shirts .
he says the protesters will remain resolute in the case of a crackdown .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anti-government demonstrators shout insults from behind razor wire he does not believe the army will crack down in seven days , as they are threatening to do .
" it can not .
i do n't believe that the army can do that .
and if they do , no one knows what will happen because at least 30 percent who come here are not afraid of death . "
the udd says prime minister abhisit vejjajiva 's government must resign and call new elections .
but the government and coalition partners say elections in the current heated climate would do little to end the current political crisis .
on tuesday tens of thousands of red shirt protesters gathered at the rally site , near major malls and department stores that have been forced to close for almost three weeks at the cost of millions of dollars .
" they 're trying to demonize us " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anti-government protesters , in red , clash with policemen sean boonpracong , a udd spokesperson , says while there are fears the deep social divisions could be exacerbated , the government is to be blamed , not the protestors .
" they 're trying to blame us as intransigent .
you have to remember the government and their conservative allies are more powerful than us .
i think you should ask them what they 're prepared to offer .
but they 're trying to demonize us as being a terrorist group .
and it 's really counterproductive to hear that type of really extreme rhetoric . "
army officials said protestors have stockpiled home-made weapons including acid banks and clubs spiked with nails in preparation for a crackdown .
there is concern that demonstrators may also have firearms .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thailand 's prime minister abhisit vejjajiva , said his government stands ready to talk with the " red shirts " " i am afraid because i can not see any sign from now on how we can pass this moment peacefully , " says pinpaka ngamsom , the assistant editor for online news service , prachatai.com.
" if you see all the factors right now it 's difficult for thailand .
if you look at the prime minister it 's hard for him to turn away and if you look to the red shirts for the leader it 's also very hard for them to turn away , and if you look at the protestor they strongly believe that they can win . "
the worst crisis in two decades the current political crisis is the most severe test for the country in almost 20 years .
prime minister abhisit survived a similar crisis last year , one also led by the red shirts who are backing former prime minister thaksin shinawatra .
thaksin remains overseas to avoid a two year jail term for corruption .
but it is also reported thaksin is consolidating his support even now within police and military ranks .

the 38-year-old hamburg lawyer 's family emigrated to germany from turkey four decades ago . ayguel oezkan on monday became germany 's first muslim woman minister .
the hamburg lawyer has been named minister of social affairs for the northern state of lower saxony .
this was part of a cabinet shuffle in which christian democrat premier christian wulff replaced four of his ministers .
in addition to the 38-year-old oezkan there was also another first , as the newly appointed science minister , johanna wanka -lrb- 59 -rrb- of brandenburg , became the first eastern german woman to enter the cabinet of a western german state .
oezkan 's appointment was welcomed by serkan toeren , the liberal free democrats ' spokesman on integration policy at the federal level .
only a decade ago there was still discussion as to whether the public could accept having an immigrant as a minister , said toeren , who , like oezkan has turkish roots . but now germany has not only oezkan , but also philipp roesler , germany 's vietnamese-born health minister .
" who knows ? maybe she could become chancellor , too , " toeren told the rheinische post newspaper .

it was announced on tuesday that 25-year-old adler , who plays for bayer leverkusen , suffered the injury during last saturday 's 2-1 defeat against stuttgart .
there are fears that this could jeopardize his place as number one goalie during the soccer tournament , which starts on june 11 .

" the doctors say the fracture is expected to heal pretty quickly , so i am cautiously optimistic , " he said in a press release by his club .

but analysts are still cautious about its prospects . at a press conference on monday , nato secretary general anders rasmussen spoke about what he believed was the most serious security threat faced by europe .
" there is a growing missile threat , including from iran , " he said .
" and the politicians have a responsibility to protect the population . "
europe must " take its share in the joint protection from missile attacks . "
as far as nato is concerned , any hope of creating a missile defense system for europe rests on the cooperation of russia . moscow has persistently voiced its opposition to missile installations in eastern europe that it believes could be used as offensive weapons .
to this end , rasmussen has been working to bring nato and russia together to discuss the possibility .
speaking during a recent visit to london , nato spokesman james appathurai told reporters , " russia should be included in a missile defense system which covers europe . "
he said plans for a " new security architecture " should be " one roof which includes the russians as part of the same security family . "
the attempted cooperation has apparently met with some success .
at least one newspaper , the british independent , reported that secret talks had already begun between washington and moscow on the subject , though no further details were reported .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nmds are much more expensive than close range tmds the end of the george w. bush presidency certainly opened the door to a rapprochement between russia and the west , a process that has culminated in the recent signing of the nuclear disarmament strategic arms reduction treaty -lrb- start -rrb- treaty in prague .
many analysts were impressed at the speed with which president barack obama managed to instil enough trust in opposite number dmitry medvedev to bring him to a disarmament agreement .
just a start but many experts are still concerned whether obama 's so-called ' reset ' policy will be enough to allay russian concerns about a european missile shield .
margarete klein , senior associate at the german institute for international and security affairs -lrb- swp -rrb- , believes the former superpower enemies are still locked in a catch-22 stand-off .
" the crux of the problem is that such a defense shield would create a lot of trust between russia and nato , but would require a lot of trust in the first place , " she told deutsche welle .
but klein emphasized that there was a real willingness in russia to negotiate with the us , albeit with certain caveats .
" i think russia is open to cooperation with nato on a defence shield , on condition that the us postpones the deployment of parts of its global missile defense shield in eastern europe , " she said .
this rapprochement is partly motivated by a common threat - iran .
as francis tusa , veteran british defense analyst and writer military affairs , told deutsche welle , " if you look around at the world 's borders , you 'll see that russia is in a more risky position . "
bildunterschrift : us-russian relations have improved considerably under obama klein believes that russia 's signing of the start treaty was also motivated by necessity .
" russia saw that its strategic nuclear weapons arsenal will downsize anyway due to the age of the missiles , " she says .
" therefore , reducing its arsenal together with the usa offers the opportunity to remain on par with washington and reduce the financial burdens of its strategic nuclear arsenal . "
for its part , the us has been desperate to prevent russia selling arms to iran , and making a major agreement on a missile shield could be seen as an effective way to control the trade .
" the us has been very active in trying to persuade russia not to sell weapons to iran , " says tusa .
" but we know that russia has made deals with the iran in the past . "
several ways to skin a cat but the devil in any international agreement is in the proverbial details .
in this case , the detail is the actual military hardware up for discussion .
" there is some confusion about what kind of missile defense shields are being talked about , " says klein .
" there are theater missile defense -lrb- tmd -rrb- systems , designed to defend troops against shorter-range missiles , and the national missile defense -lrb- nmd -rrb- systems , designed to protect a whole nation or group of nations . "
though the more mobile tmds are typically used in actual war scenarios like afghanistan , they can be deployed as domestic defense systems instead of the larger nmds .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the air crash in smolensk may have improved polish-russian relations " there are several ways of skinning the cat , " says tusa .
" you could have linked batteries of tmd systems , which would be a lot cheaper . "
the variety of options and weapons technology is likely to dominate any negotiations , and could easily scupper the project .
both sides are likely to be wary of revealing too much of their own technology .
" i think the us state department 's concern at the moment is probably whether the russians are just there to have a look-see , " said tusa .
" they may say they 're interested in creating a joint defense shield just to see what the us has to offer , and then back out if it 's not enough . "
experience suggests that armies are extremely cagey about sharing technology , even with their partners .
" america 's main nato allies in europe - the uk and germany - basically never get to see any us military technology .
do we really believe that the state department is suddenly going to let russia see everything ? " asked tusa .
european complications but this does not exhaust all the complications that any large-scale collaboration would involve .
the european nato states where missile defense systems would be installed are unlikely to allow the negotiations to take place without their opinions being heard .
and these opinions are wide-ranging .
" europe encompasses several different views - eastern european countries obviously have a very different attitude to russia than western ones , " said tusa .
" the countries to the south-east will be more concerned about the threat from missiles , while countries in north-western europe less so . "
as so often , the importance of poland 's strategic position in europe could prove vital , and the country 's recently improved relations with russia may open to the door to a global project .
klein is optimistic : " poland is a very important member state in nato , and poland 's relations with russia will play an important part in the development of the missile defense shield .
for that reason the recent rapprochement between the two countries , which began well before the recent tragedy in smolensk , is a good sign . "

this does not mean that the crisis is over , " putin said .
putin concentrated on the merits of responsible fiscal policy , saying that russia did not want to have to " go with our hands outstretched to somebody , losing our economic and then our political sovereignty . "
although russia was hard hit by the economic crisis , with gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- shrinking by 7.9 percent in 2009 , it did not request help from the international monetary fund , unlike its neighbour ukraine .
healthcare reform putin proposed a reform of state finances in order to halve the budget deficit to 3 percent of gdp by 2012 , although he did not go into detail .
a planned rise in social security tax will go ahead from next year , and the prime minister said it would be used for a reform of the healthcare system .
" more than 30 percent of the country 's medical institutions are in a critical state or require a financial overhaul .
therefore , within the next two years , we will assign about 300 billion roubles -lrb- 10.3 billion dollars , 7.6 million euros -rrb- to put the country 's health system in order , " putin said .
in an attempt to boost russia 's standing in the business world , putin pledged to free russian businesses from the " kilos of paperwork " that burden operations .
he said the government would reform the agencies that regulate business and drop restrictions for start-up companies .
in a world bank list of attractive business climates , russia only ranks 120th , due to low transparency and impenetrable bureaucracy .
however , putin 's speech did not mention the strengthening rouble , which some analysts say is the biggest threat to boosting russia 's growth. cb / reuters / afp / ap editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but analysts are still cautious about its prospects . at a press conference on monday , nato secretary general anders rasmussen spoke about what he believed was the most serious security threat faced by europe .
" there is a growing missile threat , including from iran , " he said .
" and the politicians have a responsibility to protect the population . "
europe must " take its share in the joint protection from missile attacks . "
as far as nato is concerned , any hope of creating a missile defense system for europe rests on the cooperation of russia . moscow has persistently voiced its opposition to missile installations in eastern europe that it believes could be used as offensive weapons .
to this end , rasmussen has been working to bring nato and russia together to discuss the possibility .
speaking during a recent visit to london , nato spokesman james appathurai told reporters , " russia should be included in a missile defense system which covers europe . "
he said plans for a " new security architecture " should be " one roof which includes the russians as part of the same security family . "
the attempted cooperation has apparently met with some success .
at least one newspaper , the british independent , reported that secret talks had already begun between washington and moscow on the subject , though no further details were reported .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nmds are much more expensive than close range tmds the end of the george w. bush presidency certainly opened the door to a rapprochement between russia and the west , a process that has culminated in the recent signing of the nuclear disarmament strategic arms reduction treaty -lrb- start -rrb- treaty in prague .
many analysts were impressed at the speed with which president barack obama managed to instil enough trust in opposite number dmitry medvedev to bring him to a disarmament agreement .
just a start but many experts are still concerned whether obama 's so-called ' reset ' policy will be enough to allay russian concerns about a european missile shield .
margarete klein , senior associate at the german institute for international and security affairs -lrb- swp -rrb- , believes the former superpower enemies are still locked in a catch-22 stand-off .
" the crux of the problem is that such a defense shield would create a lot of trust between russia and nato , but would require a lot of trust in the first place , " she told deutsche welle .
but klein emphasized that there was a real willingness in russia to negotiate with the us , albeit with certain caveats .
" i think russia is open to cooperation with nato on a defence shield , on condition that the us postpones the deployment of parts of its global missile defense shield in eastern europe , " she said .
this rapprochement is partly motivated by a common threat - iran .
as francis tusa , veteran british defense analyst and writer military affairs , told deutsche welle , " if you look around at the world 's borders , you 'll see that russia is in a more risky position . "
bildunterschrift : us-russian relations have improved considerably under obama klein believes that russia 's signing of the start treaty was also motivated by necessity .
" russia saw that its strategic nuclear weapons arsenal will downsize anyway due to the age of the missiles , " she says .
" therefore , reducing its arsenal together with the usa offers the opportunity to remain on par with washington and reduce the financial burdens of its strategic nuclear arsenal . "
for its part , the us has been desperate to prevent russia selling arms to iran , and making a major agreement on a missile shield could be seen as an effective way to control the trade .
" the us has been very active in trying to persuade russia not to sell weapons to iran , " says tusa .
" but we know that russia has made deals with the iran in the past . "
several ways to skin a cat but the devil in any international agreement is in the proverbial details .
in this case , the detail is the actual military hardware up for discussion .
" there is some confusion about what kind of missile defense shields are being talked about , " says klein .
" there are theater missile defense -lrb- tmd -rrb- systems , designed to defend troops against shorter-range missiles , and the national missile defense -lrb- nmd -rrb- systems , designed to protect a whole nation or group of nations . "
though the more mobile tmds are typically used in actual war scenarios like afghanistan , they can be deployed as domestic defense systems instead of the larger nmds .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the air crash in smolensk may have improved polish-russian relations " there are several ways of skinning the cat , " says tusa .
" you could have linked batteries of tmd systems , which would be a lot cheaper . "
the variety of options and weapons technology is likely to dominate any negotiations , and could easily scupper the project .
both sides are likely to be wary of revealing too much of their own technology .
" i think the us state department 's concern at the moment is probably whether the russians are just there to have a look-see , " said tusa .
" they may say they 're interested in creating a joint defense shield just to see what the us has to offer , and then back out if it 's not enough . "
experience suggests that armies are extremely cagey about sharing technology , even with their partners .
" america 's main nato allies in europe - the uk and germany - basically never get to see any us military technology .
do we really believe that the state department is suddenly going to let russia see everything ? " asked tusa .
european complications but this does not exhaust all the complications that any large-scale collaboration would involve .
the european nato states where missile defense systems would be installed are unlikely to allow the negotiations to take place without their opinions being heard .
and these opinions are wide-ranging .
" europe encompasses several different views - eastern european countries obviously have a very different attitude to russia than western ones , " said tusa .
" the countries to the south-east will be more concerned about the threat from missiles , while countries in north-western europe less so . "
as so often , the importance of poland 's strategic position in europe could prove vital , and the country 's recently improved relations with russia may open to the door to a global project .
klein is optimistic : " poland is a very important member state in nato , and poland 's relations with russia will play an important part in the development of the missile defense shield .
for that reason the recent rapprochement between the two countries , which began well before the recent tragedy in smolensk , is a good sign . "

the heightened tensions come as the deployment of troops in a financial area of the city thwarted a planned march by the protestors earlier tuesday . tensions remain high in bangkok ten days after clashes between the military and anti-government protestors left 25 people dead and hundreds injured . the army said it was now prepared to take tougher measures in the case of further clashes , using elite troops .
according to army spokesman colonel sunsern kaewkumnerd , the army was ready to take decisive action , including the use of live bullets , if provoked .
protesters remain firm charan dittapichai is a leader of the united democratic front against dictatorship , or udd , better known as the red shirts .
he says the protesters will remain resolute in the case of a crackdown .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anti-government demonstrators shout insults from behind razor wire he does not believe the army will crack down in seven days , as they are threatening to do .
" it can not .
i do n't believe that the army can do that .
and if they do , no one knows what will happen because at least 30 percent who come here are not afraid of death . "
the udd says prime minister abhisit vejjajiva 's government must resign and call new elections .
but the government and coalition partners say elections in the current heated climate would do little to end the current political crisis .
on tuesday tens of thousands of red shirt protesters gathered at the rally site , near major malls and department stores that have been forced to close for almost three weeks at the cost of millions of dollars .
" they 're trying to demonize us " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anti-government protesters , in red , clash with policemen sean boonpracong , a udd spokesperson , says while there are fears the deep social divisions could be exacerbated , the government is to be blamed , not the protestors .
" they 're trying to blame us as intransigent .
you have to remember the government and their conservative allies are more powerful than us .
i think you should ask them what they 're prepared to offer .
but they 're trying to demonize us as being a terrorist group .
and it 's really counterproductive to hear that type of really extreme rhetoric . "
army officials said protestors have stockpiled home-made weapons including acid banks and clubs spiked with nails in preparation for a crackdown .
there is concern that demonstrators may also have firearms .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thailand 's prime minister abhisit vejjajiva , said his government stands ready to talk with the " red shirts " " i am afraid because i can not see any sign from now on how we can pass this moment peacefully , " says pinpaka ngamsom , the assistant editor for online news service , prachatai.com.
" if you see all the factors right now it 's difficult for thailand .
if you look at the prime minister it 's hard for him to turn away and if you look to the red shirts for the leader it 's also very hard for them to turn away , and if you look at the protestor they strongly believe that they can win . "
the worst crisis in two decades the current political crisis is the most severe test for the country in almost 20 years .
prime minister abhisit survived a similar crisis last year , one also led by the red shirts who are backing former prime minister thaksin shinawatra .
thaksin remains overseas to avoid a two year jail term for corruption .
but it is also reported thaksin is consolidating his support even now within police and military ranks .

it was announced on tuesday that 25-year-old adler , who plays for bayer leverkusen , suffered the injury during last saturday 's 2-1 defeat against stuttgart .
there are fears that this could jeopardize his place as number one goalie during the soccer tournament , which starts on june 11 .
but adler is staying optimistic .
" the doctors say the fracture is expected to heal pretty quickly , so i am cautiously optimistic , " he said in a press release by his club .
but adler will have to miss at least saturday 's clash against hanover .
he won the first of his nine caps in october 2008 , and at the beginning of march this year loew chose him as number one keeper over schalke 's manuel neuer and bremen 's tim wiese .

the 38-year-old hamburg lawyer 's family emigrated to germany from turkey four decades ago . ayguel oezkan on monday became germany 's first muslim woman minister .
the hamburg lawyer has been named minister of social affairs for the northern state of lower saxony .
this was part of a cabinet shuffle in which christian democrat premier christian wulff replaced four of his ministers .
in addition to the 38-year-old oezkan there was also another first , as the newly appointed science minister , johanna wanka -lrb- 59 -rrb- of brandenburg , became the first eastern german woman to enter the cabinet of a western german state .
oezkan 's appointment was welcomed by serkan toeren , the liberal free democrats ' spokesman on integration policy at the federal level .
only a decade ago there was still discussion as to whether the public could accept having an immigrant as a minister , said toeren , who , like oezkan has turkish roots . but now germany has not only oezkan , but also philipp roesler , germany 's vietnamese-born health minister .
" who knows ? maybe she could become chancellor , too , " toeren told the rheinische post newspaper .
" i am aware that i 'll a role model , " oezkan said , shortly after learning of her appointment .
kenan kolat , chairman of the tgd , the turkish community in germany , said in a statement that he found it remarkable that the conservative christian democrats had taken this step .
he added that he hoped that other german parties would follow the cdu 's example. dl / ots / dpa editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

now bayern are the favorites to break the dry spell .
but they should n't underestimate their opponents . going into the home-and-away tie against french side olympique lyon , to be played on april 21 and 27 , the words " bayern " and " major roll " were being used a lot together .
not only had the bavarians knocked out manchester united in the quarterfinals , they engaged in a bit of target practice in a 7-0 thrashing of hanover in the bundesliga .
with lyon in third place in france ligue 1 , this season represents the bavarians ' best chance of getting back to the champions league final since they won the title in 2000-01 .
and indeed , the bookmakers are tipping bayern as the clear favorites in this encounter .
this is the first time lyon have made it as far as the semifinals in the champions league , and bayern are a richer club that currently rides atop the table in a better league .
what 's more they have winger arjen robben , who 's playing the most dominant football of anyone in europe not named lionel messi .
but although coach louis van gaal 's side have every reason to believe a trip to the final in madrid on may 22 is within reach , they had best beware of the french side , which has made a habit this season of toppling big names .
giant killers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern need to watch out for lopez coach claude puel 's men did not get where they are by accident .
to progress beyond the group stage , lyon had to beat liverpool , and their round-of-16 opponents were no less than real madrid .
the french side has a top striker in argentinian lisandro lopez .
he 's scored seven goals in the champions league thus far , including a pair that sent lyon past rivals bordeaux in the quarterfinals .
but olympique 's real strength is defense .
puels usually gets 10 men behind the ball , and both liverpool and real were frustrated by lyon 's tenacity , wearing themselves out and getting punished on the counter-attack .
plus , they have the advantage of playing their first game away from home , where any goals scored put pressure on the opponents for the return leg .
that 's why bayern ceo karl-heinz rummenigge warned against over-confidence as the first leg approached .
" this is a match-up of equals , " rummenigge told reporters .
" we 're not the underdogs , but we 're not the favorites , either . "
dynamic duo bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : robben , in particular , is having a career season bayern have had to score a fair number of goals in their champions league campaign , and most have come from two men : robben and overachieving croatian striker ivica olic .
olic is one of the hardest working players in the business , and the bavarians will hope that his tireless forechecking will allow him to capitalize on defensive lapses in concentration , much as he did when he scored on a crucial last-second poach against manchester united in the quarterfinals .
olic could be key since bayern 's pair of true center forwards , mario gomez and miroslav klose , have both been out of form .
robben has been little short of unstoppable , confounding defenses with his incisive runs and lightning-quick shots on goal .
lyon will likely devote at least a couple of defenders to the dutch winger , which should open space on the left for his counterpart , frank ribery .
ribery , though , has become something of an enigma .
injured for much of the season , he seems to have temporarily lost some of his assurance with the ball , and his lone goal in the manchester united tie came on a terribly taken free kick that was lucky to be deflected off the wall .
and the frenchman is not bayern 's only worry .
question marks bildunterschrift : badstuber -lrb- right -rrb- , is one of bayern 's young defenders in both of their previous champions league ties , bayern have lost their away matches .
to take the pressure off , they need not only to win their home match but avoid conceding what could be deadly goals .
the bavarians ' defense has looked very solid in the league , but the squad van gaal is fielding is young .
on the left , both 19-year-old diego contento and 21-year-old holger badstuber have sometimes looked out of their depth against top european opposition .
moreover , on the right philipp lahm - usually one of the best defensive players in the world - has looked out of sorts for most of this season .
nonetheless , despite these potential weaknesses and regardless of what bayern 's bosses were saying before the tie , munich are the favorites in this match-up , and they know it .
if their defense can rise to the occasion and their men up front get the job done in the allianz arena , they 'll be in an excellent position to return to european club football 's biggest match .

airlines have accused aviation experts of exaggerating the risk , but is it really safe to fly right now ? europe 's busiest air hub saw its first flights on tuesday evening as airspace across the continent slowly began to reopen following nearly a week of widespread travel disruption .
a flight from vancouver arrived at london 's heathrow airport shortly before 10 p.m. local time , the first since british airspace was closed last thursday following the eruption of iceland 's eyjafjallajokull volcano .
british airways expected about 24 other flights to arrive from the united states , africa and asia later in the evening .
earlier tuesday , germany 's two biggest airlines announced they would resume flying many of their regularly scheduled flights , despite an ongoing no-fly rule in german airspace , by operating under special " visual flight " conditions . under the visual flight rules , airlines are permitted to fly below 3,000 meters -lrb- 9,800 feet -rrb- during daylight , as long as pilots use their own radar and eyesight to avoid other planes .
germany 's flag carrier lufthansa announced it would carry more than 15,000 passengers on some 200 flights on tuesday .
air berlin , germany 's second largest carrier , was operating a nearly full flight schedule , according to its web site .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many stranded passengers were forced to sleep in airports the flights were operating through a loophole in the aviation regulations , said christine kellek of germany 's flight safety organization -lrb- dfs -rrb- .
the closure of airspace only applies to aviation that relies on ground control and navigation instruments , according to kellek .
" the german air navigation services can not forbid flying by visual flying rules , because we regulate instrument flights , so it is not up to us to decide if somebody can fly under visual flying rules or not , " kellek told deutsche welle .
pressure on pilots but while these flights may be allowed , not everyone supports the idea .
juerg handwerg , a pilot and spokesperson for the german pilots ' union cockpit , said he thinks the decision to allow planes to operate on visual flight was fueled by financial considerations .
" they are avoiding the international rules they signed themselves by flying under visual flight rules , " said handwerg .
" it 's due to monetary reasons . "
it puts unfair pressure on pilots , he added . " legally , you can say , ‘ no i do n't want to fly , ’ but if your employer tells you to fly and you say no , you can get thrown out .
so how can you decide not to fly ? "
handwerg told deutsche welle . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : volcanic ash drifting across the atlantic forced the cancellation of flights across europe an expensive problem in the past , volcanic ash has been known to cause problems with aircraft . following last week 's eruption in iceland , air france , british airways , klm and lufthansa reported no problems from their own test flights , but senior us military officials said the ash had caused some engine damage to a nato f-16 fighter plane . scientists from the german aerospace center -lrb- dlr -rrb- carried out a four-hour test flight monday to measure the cloud 's density and composition .
the results were submitted to transportation authorities in berlin , who were to decide whether or not it 's safe to fly in german airspace , according to karl hinterleitner of the dlr .
after several days of flight cancellations , airlines are itching to see a return to business as usual , as flight disruptions are costing them as much as 200 million euros -lrb- $ 270 million -rrb- per day .
experts say it 's hard to know when the situation will return to normal , leaving policymakers walking a difficult line between trying to minimize the economic impact of further flight suspension and the potential risk of flying through volcanic ash .

the heightened tensions come as the deployment of troops in a financial area of the city thwarted a planned march by the protestors earlier tuesday . tensions remain high in bangkok ten days after clashes between the military and anti-government protestors left 25 people dead and hundreds injured . the army said it was now prepared to take tougher measures in the case of further clashes , using elite troops .
according to army spokesman colonel sunsern kaewkumnerd , the army was ready to take decisive action , including the use of live bullets , if provoked .
protesters remain firm charan dittapichai is a leader of the united democratic front against dictatorship , or udd , better known as the red shirts .
he says the protesters will remain resolute in the case of a crackdown .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anti-government demonstrators shout insults from behind razor wire he does not believe the army will crack down in seven days , as they are threatening to do .
" it can not .
i do n't believe that the army can do that .
and if they do , no one knows what will happen because at least 30 percent who come here are not afraid of death . "
the udd says prime minister abhisit vejjajiva 's government must resign and call new elections .
but the government and coalition partners say elections in the current heated climate would do little to end the current political crisis .
on tuesday tens of thousands of red shirt protesters gathered at the rally site , near major malls and department stores that have been forced to close for almost three weeks at the cost of millions of dollars .
" they 're trying to demonize us " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anti-government protesters , in red , clash with policemen sean boonpracong , a udd spokesperson , says while there are fears the deep social divisions could be exacerbated , the government is to be blamed , not the protestors .
" they 're trying to blame us as intransigent .
you have to remember the government and their conservative allies are more powerful than us .
i think you should ask them what they 're prepared to offer .
but they 're trying to demonize us as being a terrorist group .
and it 's really counterproductive to hear that type of really extreme rhetoric . "
army officials said protestors have stockpiled home-made weapons including acid banks and clubs spiked with nails in preparation for a crackdown .
there is concern that demonstrators may also have firearms .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thailand 's prime minister abhisit vejjajiva , said his government stands ready to talk with the " red shirts " " i am afraid because i can not see any sign from now on how we can pass this moment peacefully , " says pinpaka ngamsom , the assistant editor for online news service , prachatai.com.
" if you see all the factors right now it 's difficult for thailand .
if you look at the prime minister it 's hard for him to turn away and if you look to the red shirts for the leader it 's also very hard for them to turn away , and if you look at the protestor they strongly believe that they can win . "
the worst crisis in two decades the current political crisis is the most severe test for the country in almost 20 years .
prime minister abhisit survived a similar crisis last year , one also led by the red shirts who are backing former prime minister thaksin shinawatra .
thaksin remains overseas to avoid a two year jail term for corruption .
but it is also reported thaksin is consolidating his support even now within police and military ranks .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de aviation -pipe- 20.04.2010 some flights resume despite ash cloud , but is it safe ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pilots bear the ultimate responsiblity under " visual flight " conditions as european airspace begins to reopen , some airlines in germany have resumed flights under special conditions .
airlines have accused aviation experts of exaggerating the risk , but is it really safe to fly right now ? europe 's busiest air hub saw its first flights on tuesday evening as airspace across the continent slowly began to reopen following nearly a week of widespread travel disruption .
a flight from vancouver arrived at london 's heathrow airport shortly before 10 p.m. local time , the first since british airspace was closed last thursday following the eruption of iceland 's eyjafjallajokull volcano .
british airways expected about 24 other flights to arrive from the united states , africa and asia later in the evening .
earlier tuesday , germany 's two biggest airlines announced they would resume flying many of their regularly scheduled flights , despite an ongoing no-fly rule in german airspace , by operating under special " visual flight " conditions . under the visual flight rules , airlines are permitted to fly below 3,000 meters -lrb- 9,800 feet -rrb- during daylight , as long as pilots use their own radar and eyesight to avoid other planes .
germany 's flag carrier lufthansa announced it would carry more than 15,000 passengers on some 200 flights on tuesday .
air berlin , germany 's second largest carrier , was operating a nearly full flight schedule , according to its web site .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many stranded passengers were forced to sleep in airports the flights were operating through a loophole in the aviation regulations , said christine kellek of germany 's flight safety organization -lrb- dfs -rrb- .
the closure of airspace only applies to aviation that relies on ground control and navigation instruments , according to kellek .
" the german air navigation services can not forbid flying by visual flying rules , because we regulate instrument flights , so it is not up to us to decide if somebody can fly under visual flying rules or not , " kellek told deutsche welle .
pressure on pilots but while these flights may be allowed , not everyone supports the idea .
juerg handwerg , a pilot and spokesperson for the german pilots ' union cockpit , said he thinks the decision to allow planes to operate on visual flight was fueled by financial considerations .
" they are avoiding the international rules they signed themselves by flying under visual flight rules , " said handwerg .
" it 's due to monetary reasons . "
it puts unfair pressure on pilots , he added . " legally , you can say , ‘ no i do n't want to fly , ’ but if your employer tells you to fly and you say no , you can get thrown out .
so how can you decide not to fly ? "
handwerg told deutsche welle . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : volcanic ash drifting across the atlantic forced the cancellation of flights across europe an expensive problem in the past , volcanic ash has been known to cause problems with aircraft . following last week 's eruption in iceland , air france , british airways , klm and lufthansa reported no problems from their own test flights , but senior us military officials said the ash had caused some engine damage to a nato f-16 fighter plane . scientists from the german aerospace center -lrb- dlr -rrb- carried out a four-hour test flight monday to measure the cloud 's density and composition .
the results were submitted to transportation authorities in berlin , who were to decide whether or not it 's safe to fly in german airspace , according to karl hinterleitner of the dlr .
after several days of flight cancellations , airlines are itching to see a return to business as usual , as flight disruptions are costing them as much as 200 million euros -lrb- $ 270 million -rrb- per day .
experts say it 's hard to know when the situation will return to normal , leaving policymakers walking a difficult line between trying to minimize the economic impact of further flight suspension and the potential risk of flying through volcanic ash .

it was announced on tuesday that 25-year-old adler , who plays for bayer leverkusen , suffered the injury during last saturday 's 2-1 defeat against stuttgart .
there are fears that this could jeopardize his place as number one goalie during the soccer tournament , which starts on june 11 .
but adler is staying optimistic .
" the doctors say the fracture is expected to heal pretty quickly , so i am cautiously optimistic , " he said in a press release by his club .
but adler will have to miss at least saturday 's clash against hanover .
he won the first of his nine caps in october 2008 , and at the beginning of march this year loew chose him as number one keeper over schalke 's manuel neuer and bremen 's tim wiese .

the heightened tensions come as the deployment of troops in a financial area of the city thwarted a planned march by the protestors earlier tuesday . tensions remain high in bangkok ten days after clashes between the military and anti-government protestors left 25 people dead and hundreds injured . the army said it was now prepared to take tougher measures in the case of further clashes , using elite troops .

i think you should ask them what they 're prepared to offer .
but they 're trying to demonize us as being a terrorist group .
and it 's really counterproductive to hear that type of really extreme rhetoric . "

" if you see all the factors right now it 's difficult for thailand .
if you look at the prime minister it 's hard for him to turn away and if you look to the red shirts for the leader it 's also very hard for them to turn away , and if you look at the protestor they strongly believe that they can win . "
the worst crisis in two decades the current political crisis is the most severe test for the country in almost 20 years .

now bayern are the favorites to break the dry spell .
but they should n't underestimate their opponents . going into the home-and-away tie against french side olympique lyon , to be played on april 21 and 27 , the words " bayern " and " major roll " were being used a lot together .
not only had the bavarians knocked out manchester united in the quarterfinals , they engaged in a bit of target practice in a 7-0 thrashing of hanover in the bundesliga .
with lyon in third place in france ligue 1 , this season represents the bavarians ' best chance of getting back to the champions league final since they won the title in 2000-01 .
and indeed , the bookmakers are tipping bayern as the clear favorites in this encounter .
this is the first time lyon have made it as far as the semifinals in the champions league , and bayern are a richer club that currently rides atop the table in a better league .
what 's more they have winger arjen robben , who 's playing the most dominant football of anyone in europe not named lionel messi .
but although coach louis van gaal 's side have every reason to believe a trip to the final in madrid on may 22 is within reach , they had best beware of the french side , which has made a habit this season of toppling big names .
giant killers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern need to watch out for lopez coach claude puel 's men did not get where they are by accident .
to progress beyond the group stage , lyon had to beat liverpool , and their round-of-16 opponents were no less than real madrid .

olic is one of the hardest working players in the business , and the bavarians will hope that his tireless forechecking will allow him to capitalize on defensive lapses in concentration , much as he did when he scored on a crucial last-second poach against manchester united in the quarterfinals .

the takeover - the most expensive in the german company 's history - is aimed at strengthening its passenger business throughout europe . british train and bus operator arriva has confirmed that german state rail company deutsche bahn is willing to pay 1.54 billion pounds -lrb- 1.8 billion euros -rrb- in cash to buy its operations as advanced talks continue .
media reports said that if arriva 's debt is taken into account , the total value of the offer is 2.7 billion euros .
reuters news agency quoted sources close to the deal who said the takeover would be financed entirely through the issuance of bonds , and could be approved by deutsche bahn 's supervisory board as early as next week .
the acquisition , which would confirm deutsche bahn as europe 's largest rail transport operator , could also trigger a wave of consolidation in the rail sector .
french rail company sncf , which held talks with arriva as well , is equally keen to expand its footprint throughout europe .
deutsche bahn and arriva have been in talks for several weeks .
the german operator has made no secret of its interest in acquiring the uk company , which operates bus networks , rail franchises and other transportation services in 12 european countries .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche bahn sees little room for growth in the german market key asset arriva is the only big british transport group to have ventured into europe , where it has taken advantage of gradual market liberalization .

deutsche bahn is keen to move beyond its home territory as germany 's domestic rail market opens up to competition .
the uk is high on its list of target countries .
the rail company has already made a number of acquisitions in britain including chiltern railways , which offers service between marylebone and birmingham , and ews , the freight operator .
it also runs the tyne & wear metro and holds a 50 percent stake in the london overground rail network .
pros and cons richard talbot , an analyst with the railway consultancy in london , said a takeover of arriva could benefit the uk rail market in several ways .
" deutsche bahn would bring technology know-how and system management skills , " he said .
" the company would also be another powerful player competing in the franchise bidding process . "
commuters who use uk trains also see benefits .
" trains in the uk have a very poor reputation when it comes to service , punctuality and cost , " said chris manning , a businessman who commutes daily by train to london and who is familiar with german service .

at the weekend , a door came loose and smashed into an oncoming train . deutsche bahn has announced it will investigate the failure of a door over the weekend and check all the operating trains for faults .
the trains will also run at reduced speed in tunnels until the reason for the accident has been determined .
on saturday , a train travelling from amsterdam to basel lost a door in a tunnel on the track between cologne and frankfurt .
the door came loose and crashed into the restaurant car of an oncoming train .
six people were injured , four of whom had to be treated in hospital .
the door was later recovered in a tunnel near the town of montabauer .
the track remained closed for ten hours of investigation .
the high speed ice train travels at up to 300 kilometers per hour between cologne and frankfurt .
a troubled safety record deutsche bahn 's prestigious ice trains are already facing hefty criticism over their safety record .
in july 2008 , a train derailed when its axle broke .
subsequent checks of the same generation trains revealed small cracks in the axles to be a widespread problem .
many of the trains had to be taken out of service to have the malfunctioning parts replaced .
as the wear and tear of material turned out to be higher than previously thought , the trains now have to undergo more frequent checks , leading to disruption in german rail services . ai / dpa / ap / apn editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

at the weekend , a door came loose and smashed into an oncoming train . deutsche bahn has announced it will investigate the failure of a door over the weekend and check all the operating trains for faults .
the trains will also run at reduced speed in tunnels until the reason for the accident has been determined .
on saturday , a train travelling from amsterdam to basel lost a door in a tunnel on the track between cologne and frankfurt .
the door came loose and crashed into the restaurant car of an oncoming train .
six people were injured , four of whom had to be treated in hospital .
the door was later recovered in a tunnel near the town of montabauer .
the track remained closed for ten hours of investigation .
the high speed ice train travels at up to 300 kilometers per hour between cologne and frankfurt .
a troubled safety record deutsche bahn 's prestigious ice trains are already facing hefty criticism over their safety record .
in july 2008 , a train derailed when its axle broke .
subsequent checks of the same generation trains revealed small cracks in the axles to be a widespread problem .
many of the trains had to be taken out of service to have the malfunctioning parts replaced .
as the wear and tear of material turned out to be higher than previously thought , the trains now have to undergo more frequent checks , leading to disruption in german rail services . ai / dpa / ap / apn editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

meanwhile , it is unclear where the ousted former president is located . in a fresh round of violence in kyrgyzstan , on monday hundreds of police officers were dispatched to suppress riots that started in a village outside of the capital , bishkek .
ethnic kyrgyz rioters seized plots of land from russians and turks in the village of mayevka , and in the subsequent violence five people were killed and many others injured .
" the crowd poured into mayevka and started wreaking destruction , robbing and killing .
they mainly robbed and burned the homes of turks living in the village , " alexander konstantin , a local resident , told journalists .
" all the provocateurs and ringleaders in the riots will be punished to the full extent of the law , " the interim government said in a statement released on tuesday .
the riot was the latest challenge to the interim government , which seized power earlier this month after a popular uprising that ousted president kurmanbek bakiyev .
however , so far the interim government has failed to establish full control over the country .
on monday , loyalists of the former president installed a pro-bakiyev governor after seizing a regional government in jalalabad .
bakiyev 's whereabouts unknown toppled president bakiyev was flown to kazakhstan last week in an attempt to reduce the risk of civil war in kyrgyzstan .
a spokesperson for the foreign ministry in kazakhstan confirmed to the ap news agency that bakiyev had left the country , but provided no further details about where he had gone .
bakiyev is wanted by the interim kyrgyz government in connection with the shootings of demonstrators during the protests in early april that culminated in his overthrow. cb / afp / reuters / ap editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the takeover - the most expensive in the german company 's history - is aimed at strengthening its passenger business throughout europe . british train and bus operator arriva has confirmed that german state rail company deutsche bahn is willing to pay 1.54 billion pounds -lrb- 1.8 billion euros -rrb- in cash to buy its operations as advanced talks continue .
media reports said that if arriva 's debt is taken into account , the total value of the offer is 2.7 billion euros .
reuters news agency quoted sources close to the deal who said the takeover would be financed entirely through the issuance of bonds , and could be approved by deutsche bahn 's supervisory board as early as next week .
the acquisition , which would confirm deutsche bahn as europe 's largest rail transport operator , could also trigger a wave of consolidation in the rail sector .
french rail company sncf , which held talks with arriva as well , is equally keen to expand its footprint throughout europe .
deutsche bahn and arriva have been in talks for several weeks .
the german operator has made no secret of its interest in acquiring the uk company , which operates bus networks , rail franchises and other transportation services in 12 european countries .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche bahn sees little room for growth in the german market key asset arriva is the only big british transport group to have ventured into europe , where it has taken advantage of gradual market liberalization .
its european operations account for nearly half of its revenue .
last month at the presentation of the group 's financial results , deutsche bahn chief executive officer ruediger grube said the company plans to run its high-speed long-distance trains through the channel tunnel and " further actively expand " its business activities beyond germany 's national borders .
deutsche bahn is keen to move beyond its home territory as germany 's domestic rail market opens up to competition .
the uk is high on its list of target countries .
the rail company has already made a number of acquisitions in britain including chiltern railways , which offers service between marylebone and birmingham , and ews , the freight operator .
it also runs the tyne & wear metro and holds a 50 percent stake in the london overground rail network .
pros and cons richard talbot , an analyst with the railway consultancy in london , said a takeover of arriva could benefit the uk rail market in several ways .
" deutsche bahn would bring technology know-how and system management skills , " he said .
" the company would also be another powerful player competing in the franchise bidding process . "
commuters who use uk trains also see benefits .
" trains in the uk have a very poor reputation when it comes to service , punctuality and cost , " said chris manning , a businessman who commutes daily by train to london and who is familiar with german service .
" they need to face competition from continental train companies like deutsche bahn to improve quality .
these operators are light years ahead . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics say britain 's rail network could use some german efficiency but consultant talbot also warned that consolidation could have its drawbacks .
" small can be beautiful , especially when it comes to regional operators that provide a good service cost-efficiently , " he said .
" big is n't always necessarily better . "
indeed , some critics of deutsche bahn say the state-owned company , which is known for its bureaucracy , could be overextending its resources with its ambitious expansion plans . author : john blau editor : samuel edmonds send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the reopening of certain routes in europe has brought some respite to the thousands of people stranded in asia . despite the partial reopening of european air space , many asian carriers remained grounded for the sixth consecutive day due to huge volcanic ash clouds from iceland .
the cancellation of flights has not only left millions of people stranded , but also cast a cloud on asian business . binit somaia from the centre for asia pacific aviation in sydney says the impact is huge .
" for example in india , you have the start of the long summer school holidays , and a lot of people were looking forward to start departing for europe so the impact is there .
australia has a very high volume of traffic to europe .
likewise the countries that have airlines that act as major hub carriers such as cathay pacific from hong kong , or singapore airlines , gulf carriers such as ethihad and emirates are also affected . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iceland 's volcano is creating chaos not only in europe . exports and cargo affected even though the asian carriers have been able to continue their operation in the non european sectors as usual , they are expected to lose millions of dollars in revenue per day due to the disruption of flights in europe . asian exports and air cargo services have also been hit hard .
asian carriers transport a large percentage of cargo that includes mobile phones , high tech electronics and textiles . in south korea , a trade association estimated the country will post 112 million dollars -lrb- around 83 million euros -rrb- in lost exports caused by the ash cloud . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nissan says it has curtailed production at two plants due to delay of supply of parts thousands of factories in china 's guangdong province have also seen air freight delayed , mainly watches , jewellery and clothing . in japan , the carmaker nissan said it was being forced to suspend some vehicle production because of a shortage of parts that were supposed to come from ireland . impact on financial recovery experts fear the disruption of flights could slow down the regional recovery from the recent global economic slump . " this has come at a particularly bad time , " says somaia .
" after the financial crisis we saw last year , the market has just started to see some signs of recovery .
passenger numbers were increasing .
most carriers were looking forward to a much more buoyant market for the coming summer .
this has happened right at the start of this period . " but he maintains that the implications on the asian airlines as such will be minor : " they are relatively strong carriers compared to europe and america and a lot of the carriers in the region do have either full or partial ownership with the government .
therefore they will see some support in this period .

at the weekend , a door came loose and smashed into an oncoming train . deutsche bahn has announced it will investigate the failure of a door over the weekend and check all the operating trains for faults .
the trains will also run at reduced speed in tunnels until the reason for the accident has been determined .
on saturday , a train travelling from amsterdam to basel lost a door in a tunnel on the track between cologne and frankfurt .
the door came loose and crashed into the restaurant car of an oncoming train .
six people were injured , four of whom had to be treated in hospital .
the door was later recovered in a tunnel near the town of montabauer .
the track remained closed for ten hours of investigation .
the high speed ice train travels at up to 300 kilometers per hour between cologne and frankfurt .
a troubled safety record deutsche bahn 's prestigious ice trains are already facing hefty criticism over their safety record .
in july 2008 , a train derailed when its axle broke .
subsequent checks of the same generation trains revealed small cracks in the axles to be a widespread problem .
many of the trains had to be taken out of service to have the malfunctioning parts replaced .
as the wear and tear of material turned out to be higher than previously thought , the trains now have to undergo more frequent checks , leading to disruption in german rail services . ai / dpa / ap / apn editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the 38-year-old hamburg lawyer 's family emigrated to germany from turkey four decades ago . ayguel oezkan on monday became germany 's first muslim woman minister .
the hamburg lawyer has been named minister of social affairs for the northern state of lower saxony .
this was part of a cabinet shuffle in which christian democrat premier christian wulff replaced four of his ministers .
in addition to the 38-year-old oezkan there was also another first , as the newly appointed science minister , johanna wanka -lrb- 59 -rrb- of brandenburg , became the first eastern german woman to enter the cabinet of a western german state .
oezkan 's appointment was welcomed by serkan toeren , the liberal free democrats ' spokesman on integration policy at the federal level .
only a decade ago there was still discussion as to whether the public could accept having an immigrant as a minister , said toeren , who , like oezkan has turkish roots . but now germany has not only oezkan , but also philipp roesler , germany 's vietnamese-born health minister .
" who knows ? maybe she could become chancellor , too , " toeren told the rheinische post newspaper .
" i am aware that i 'll a role model , " oezkan said , shortly after learning of her appointment .
kenan kolat , chairman of the tgd , the turkish community in germany , said in a statement that he found it remarkable that the conservative christian democrats had taken this step .
he added that he hoped that other german parties would follow the cdu 's example. dl / ots / dpa editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

airlines have accused aviation experts of exaggerating the risk , but is it really safe to fly right now ? europe 's busiest air hub saw its first flights on tuesday evening as airspace across the continent slowly began to reopen following nearly a week of widespread travel disruption .
a flight from vancouver arrived at london 's heathrow airport shortly before 10 p.m. local time , the first since british airspace was closed last thursday following the eruption of iceland 's eyjafjallajokull volcano .
british airways expected about 24 other flights to arrive from the united states , africa and asia later in the evening .
earlier tuesday , germany 's two biggest airlines announced they would resume flying many of their regularly scheduled flights , despite an ongoing no-fly rule in german airspace , by operating under special " visual flight " conditions . under the visual flight rules , airlines are permitted to fly below 3,000 meters -lrb- 9,800 feet -rrb- during daylight , as long as pilots use their own radar and eyesight to avoid other planes .
germany 's flag carrier lufthansa announced it would carry more than 15,000 passengers on some 200 flights on tuesday .
air berlin , germany 's second largest carrier , was operating a nearly full flight schedule , according to its web site .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many stranded passengers were forced to sleep in airports the flights were operating through a loophole in the aviation regulations , said christine kellek of germany 's flight safety organization -lrb- dfs -rrb- .
the closure of airspace only applies to aviation that relies on ground control and navigation instruments , according to kellek .
" the german air navigation services can not forbid flying by visual flying rules , because we regulate instrument flights , so it is not up to us to decide if somebody can fly under visual flying rules or not , " kellek told deutsche welle .
pressure on pilots but while these flights may be allowed , not everyone supports the idea .
juerg handwerg , a pilot and spokesperson for the german pilots ' union cockpit , said he thinks the decision to allow planes to operate on visual flight was fueled by financial considerations .
" they are avoiding the international rules they signed themselves by flying under visual flight rules , " said handwerg .
" it 's due to monetary reasons . "
it puts unfair pressure on pilots , he added . " legally , you can say , ‘ no i do n't want to fly , ’ but if your employer tells you to fly and you say no , you can get thrown out .
so how can you decide not to fly ? "
handwerg told deutsche welle . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : volcanic ash drifting across the atlantic forced the cancellation of flights across europe an expensive problem in the past , volcanic ash has been known to cause problems with aircraft . following last week 's eruption in iceland , air france , british airways , klm and lufthansa reported no problems from their own test flights , but senior us military officials said the ash had caused some engine damage to a nato f-16 fighter plane . scientists from the german aerospace center -lrb- dlr -rrb- carried out a four-hour test flight monday to measure the cloud 's density and composition .
the results were submitted to transportation authorities in berlin , who were to decide whether or not it 's safe to fly in german airspace , according to karl hinterleitner of the dlr .
after several days of flight cancellations , airlines are itching to see a return to business as usual , as flight disruptions are costing them as much as 200 million euros -lrb- $ 270 million -rrb- per day .
experts say it 's hard to know when the situation will return to normal , leaving policymakers walking a difficult line between trying to minimize the economic impact of further flight suspension and the potential risk of flying through volcanic ash .

but analysts are still cautious about its prospects . at a press conference on monday , nato secretary general anders rasmussen spoke about what he believed was the most serious security threat faced by europe .
" there is a growing missile threat , including from iran , " he said .
" and the politicians have a responsibility to protect the population . "
europe must " take its share in the joint protection from missile attacks . "
as far as nato is concerned , any hope of creating a missile defense system for europe rests on the cooperation of russia . moscow has persistently voiced its opposition to missile installations in eastern europe that it believes could be used as offensive weapons .
to this end , rasmussen has been working to bring nato and russia together to discuss the possibility .
speaking during a recent visit to london , nato spokesman james appathurai told reporters , " russia should be included in a missile defense system which covers europe . "
he said plans for a " new security architecture " should be " one roof which includes the russians as part of the same security family . "
the attempted cooperation has apparently met with some success .
at least one newspaper , the british independent , reported that secret talks had already begun between washington and moscow on the subject , though no further details were reported .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nmds are much more expensive than close range tmds the end of the george w. bush presidency certainly opened the door to a rapprochement between russia and the west , a process that has culminated in the recent signing of the nuclear disarmament strategic arms reduction treaty -lrb- start -rrb- treaty in prague .
many analysts were impressed at the speed with which president barack obama managed to instil enough trust in opposite number dmitry medvedev to bring him to a disarmament agreement .
just a start but many experts are still concerned whether obama 's so-called ' reset ' policy will be enough to allay russian concerns about a european missile shield .
margarete klein , senior associate at the german institute for international and security affairs -lrb- swp -rrb- , believes the former superpower enemies are still locked in a catch-22 stand-off .
" the crux of the problem is that such a defense shield would create a lot of trust between russia and nato , but would require a lot of trust in the first place , " she told deutsche welle .
but klein emphasized that there was a real willingness in russia to negotiate with the us , albeit with certain caveats .
" i think russia is open to cooperation with nato on a defence shield , on condition that the us postpones the deployment of parts of its global missile defense shield in eastern europe , " she said .
this rapprochement is partly motivated by a common threat - iran .
as francis tusa , veteran british defense analyst and writer military affairs , told deutsche welle , " if you look around at the world 's borders , you 'll see that russia is in a more risky position . "
bildunterschrift : us-russian relations have improved considerably under obama klein believes that russia 's signing of the start treaty was also motivated by necessity .
" russia saw that its strategic nuclear weapons arsenal will downsize anyway due to the age of the missiles , " she says .
" therefore , reducing its arsenal together with the usa offers the opportunity to remain on par with washington and reduce the financial burdens of its strategic nuclear arsenal . "
for its part , the us has been desperate to prevent russia selling arms to iran , and making a major agreement on a missile shield could be seen as an effective way to control the trade .
" the us has been very active in trying to persuade russia not to sell weapons to iran , " says tusa .
" but we know that russia has made deals with the iran in the past . "
several ways to skin a cat but the devil in any international agreement is in the proverbial details .
in this case , the detail is the actual military hardware up for discussion .
" there is some confusion about what kind of missile defense shields are being talked about , " says klein .
" there are theater missile defense -lrb- tmd -rrb- systems , designed to defend troops against shorter-range missiles , and the national missile defense -lrb- nmd -rrb- systems , designed to protect a whole nation or group of nations . "
though the more mobile tmds are typically used in actual war scenarios like afghanistan , they can be deployed as domestic defense systems instead of the larger nmds .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the air crash in smolensk may have improved polish-russian relations " there are several ways of skinning the cat , " says tusa .
" you could have linked batteries of tmd systems , which would be a lot cheaper . "
the variety of options and weapons technology is likely to dominate any negotiations , and could easily scupper the project .
both sides are likely to be wary of revealing too much of their own technology .
" i think the us state department 's concern at the moment is probably whether the russians are just there to have a look-see , " said tusa .
" they may say they 're interested in creating a joint defense shield just to see what the us has to offer , and then back out if it 's not enough . "
experience suggests that armies are extremely cagey about sharing technology , even with their partners .
" america 's main nato allies in europe - the uk and germany - basically never get to see any us military technology .
do we really believe that the state department is suddenly going to let russia see everything ? " asked tusa .
european complications but this does not exhaust all the complications that any large-scale collaboration would involve .
the european nato states where missile defense systems would be installed are unlikely to allow the negotiations to take place without their opinions being heard .
and these opinions are wide-ranging .
" europe encompasses several different views - eastern european countries obviously have a very different attitude to russia than western ones , " said tusa .
" the countries to the south-east will be more concerned about the threat from missiles , while countries in north-western europe less so . "
as so often , the importance of poland 's strategic position in europe could prove vital , and the country 's recently improved relations with russia may open to the door to a global project .
klein is optimistic : " poland is a very important member state in nato , and poland 's relations with russia will play an important part in the development of the missile defense shield .
for that reason the recent rapprochement between the two countries , which began well before the recent tragedy in smolensk , is a good sign . "

meanwhile , it is unclear where the ousted former president is located . in a fresh round of violence in kyrgyzstan , on monday hundreds of police officers were dispatched to suppress riots that started in a village outside of the capital , bishkek .
ethnic kyrgyz rioters seized plots of land from russians and turks in the village of mayevka , and in the subsequent violence five people were killed and many others injured .
" the crowd poured into mayevka and started wreaking destruction , robbing and killing .
they mainly robbed and burned the homes of turks living in the village , " alexander konstantin , a local resident , told journalists .
" all the provocateurs and ringleaders in the riots will be punished to the full extent of the law , " the interim government said in a statement released on tuesday .
the riot was the latest challenge to the interim government , which seized power earlier this month after a popular uprising that ousted president kurmanbek bakiyev .
however , so far the interim government has failed to establish full control over the country .
on monday , loyalists of the former president installed a pro-bakiyev governor after seizing a regional government in jalalabad .
bakiyev 's whereabouts unknown toppled president bakiyev was flown to kazakhstan last week in an attempt to reduce the risk of civil war in kyrgyzstan .
a spokesperson for the foreign ministry in kazakhstan confirmed to the ap news agency that bakiyev had left the country , but provided no further details about where he had gone .
bakiyev is wanted by the interim kyrgyz government in connection with the shootings of demonstrators during the protests in early april that culminated in his overthrow. cb / afp / reuters / ap editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de nato -pipe- 20.04.2010 nato and russia edge warily toward a joint missile defense shield großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rasmussen has been trying to bring the usa and russia together nato secretary general anders rasmussen has appealed for a joint missile defense shield with russia to cover europe and offer protection from a possible terror attack .
but analysts are still cautious about its prospects . at a press conference on monday , nato secretary general anders rasmussen spoke about what he believed was the most serious security threat faced by europe .
" there is a growing missile threat , including from iran , " he said .
" and the politicians have a responsibility to protect the population . "
europe must " take its share in the joint protection from missile attacks . "
as far as nato is concerned , any hope of creating a missile defense system for europe rests on the cooperation of russia . moscow has persistently voiced its opposition to missile installations in eastern europe that it believes could be used as offensive weapons .
to this end , rasmussen has been working to bring nato and russia together to discuss the possibility .
speaking during a recent visit to london , nato spokesman james appathurai told reporters , " russia should be included in a missile defense system which covers europe . "
he said plans for a " new security architecture " should be " one roof which includes the russians as part of the same security family . "
the attempted cooperation has apparently met with some success .
at least one newspaper , the british independent , reported that secret talks had already begun between washington and moscow on the subject , though no further details were reported .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nmds are much more expensive than close range tmds the end of the george w. bush presidency certainly opened the door to a rapprochement between russia and the west , a process that has culminated in the recent signing of the nuclear disarmament strategic arms reduction treaty -lrb- start -rrb- treaty in prague .
many analysts were impressed at the speed with which president barack obama managed to instil enough trust in opposite number dmitry medvedev to bring him to a disarmament agreement .
just a start but many experts are still concerned whether obama 's so-called ' reset ' policy will be enough to allay russian concerns about a european missile shield .
margarete klein , senior associate at the german institute for international and security affairs -lrb- swp -rrb- , believes the former superpower enemies are still locked in a catch-22 stand-off .
" the crux of the problem is that such a defense shield would create a lot of trust between russia and nato , but would require a lot of trust in the first place , " she told deutsche welle .
but klein emphasized that there was a real willingness in russia to negotiate with the us , albeit with certain caveats .
" i think russia is open to cooperation with nato on a defence shield , on condition that the us postpones the deployment of parts of its global missile defense shield in eastern europe , " she said .
this rapprochement is partly motivated by a common threat - iran .
as francis tusa , veteran british defense analyst and writer military affairs , told deutsche welle , " if you look around at the world 's borders , you 'll see that russia is in a more risky position . "
bildunterschrift : us-russian relations have improved considerably under obama klein believes that russia 's signing of the start treaty was also motivated by necessity .
" russia saw that its strategic nuclear weapons arsenal will downsize anyway due to the age of the missiles , " she says .
" therefore , reducing its arsenal together with the usa offers the opportunity to remain on par with washington and reduce the financial burdens of its strategic nuclear arsenal . "
for its part , the us has been desperate to prevent russia selling arms to iran , and making a major agreement on a missile shield could be seen as an effective way to control the trade .
" the us has been very active in trying to persuade russia not to sell weapons to iran , " says tusa .
" but we know that russia has made deals with the iran in the past . "
several ways to skin a cat but the devil in any international agreement is in the proverbial details .
in this case , the detail is the actual military hardware up for discussion .
" there is some confusion about what kind of missile defense shields are being talked about , " says klein .
" there are theater missile defense -lrb- tmd -rrb- systems , designed to defend troops against shorter-range missiles , and the national missile defense -lrb- nmd -rrb- systems , designed to protect a whole nation or group of nations . "
though the more mobile tmds are typically used in actual war scenarios like afghanistan , they can be deployed as domestic defense systems instead of the larger nmds .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the air crash in smolensk may have improved polish-russian relations " there are several ways of skinning the cat , " says tusa .
" you could have linked batteries of tmd systems , which would be a lot cheaper . "
the variety of options and weapons technology is likely to dominate any negotiations , and could easily scupper the project .
both sides are likely to be wary of revealing too much of their own technology .
" i think the us state department 's concern at the moment is probably whether the russians are just there to have a look-see , " said tusa .
" they may say they 're interested in creating a joint defense shield just to see what the us has to offer , and then back out if it 's not enough . "
experience suggests that armies are extremely cagey about sharing technology , even with their partners .
" america 's main nato allies in europe - the uk and germany - basically never get to see any us military technology .
do we really believe that the state department is suddenly going to let russia see everything ? " asked tusa .
european complications but this does not exhaust all the complications that any large-scale collaboration would involve .
the european nato states where missile defense systems would be installed are unlikely to allow the negotiations to take place without their opinions being heard .
and these opinions are wide-ranging .
" europe encompasses several different views - eastern european countries obviously have a very different attitude to russia than western ones , " said tusa .
" the countries to the south-east will be more concerned about the threat from missiles , while countries in north-western europe less so . "
as so often , the importance of poland 's strategic position in europe could prove vital , and the country 's recently improved relations with russia may open to the door to a global project .
klein is optimistic : " poland is a very important member state in nato , and poland 's relations with russia will play an important part in the development of the missile defense shield .
for that reason the recent rapprochement between the two countries , which began well before the recent tragedy in smolensk , is a good sign . "

speaking during a recent visit to london , nato spokesman james appathurai told reporters , " russia should be included in a missile defense system which covers europe . "
he said plans for a " new security architecture " should be " one roof which includes the russians as part of the same security family . "
the attempted cooperation has apparently met with some success .
at least one newspaper , the british independent , reported that secret talks had already begun between washington and moscow on the subject , though no further details were reported .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nmds are much more expensive than close range tmds the end of the george w. bush presidency certainly opened the door to a rapprochement between russia and the west , a process that has culminated in the recent signing of the nuclear disarmament strategic arms reduction treaty -lrb- start -rrb- treaty in prague .
many analysts were impressed at the speed with which president barack obama managed to instil enough trust in opposite number dmitry medvedev to bring him to a disarmament agreement .
just a start but many experts are still concerned whether obama 's so-called ' reset ' policy will be enough to allay russian concerns about a european missile shield .
margarete klein , senior associate at the german institute for international and security affairs -lrb- swp -rrb- , believes the former superpower enemies are still locked in a catch-22 stand-off .
" the crux of the problem is that such a defense shield would create a lot of trust between russia and nato , but would require a lot of trust in the first place , " she told deutsche welle .
but klein emphasized that there was a real willingness in russia to negotiate with the us , albeit with certain caveats .
" i think russia is open to cooperation with nato on a defence shield , on condition that the us postpones the deployment of parts of its global missile defense shield in eastern europe , " she said .
this rapprochement is partly motivated by a common threat - iran .
as francis tusa , veteran british defense analyst and writer military affairs , told deutsche welle , " if you look around at the world 's borders , you 'll see that russia is in a more risky position . "
bildunterschrift : us-russian relations have improved considerably under obama klein believes that russia 's signing of the start treaty was also motivated by necessity .
" russia saw that its strategic nuclear weapons arsenal will downsize anyway due to the age of the missiles , " she says .
" therefore , reducing its arsenal together with the usa offers the opportunity to remain on par with washington and reduce the financial burdens of its strategic nuclear arsenal . "
for its part , the us has been desperate to prevent russia selling arms to iran , and making a major agreement on a missile shield could be seen as an effective way to control the trade .
" the us has been very active in trying to persuade russia not to sell weapons to iran , " says tusa .
" but we know that russia has made deals with the iran in the past . "
several ways to skin a cat but the devil in any international agreement is in the proverbial details .
in this case , the detail is the actual military hardware up for discussion .
" there is some confusion about what kind of missile defense shields are being talked about , " says klein .
" there are theater missile defense -lrb- tmd -rrb- systems , designed to defend troops against shorter-range missiles , and the national missile defense -lrb- nmd -rrb- systems , designed to protect a whole nation or group of nations . "
though the more mobile tmds are typically used in actual war scenarios like afghanistan , they can be deployed as domestic defense systems instead of the larger nmds .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the air crash in smolensk may have improved polish-russian relations " there are several ways of skinning the cat , " says tusa .
" you could have linked batteries of tmd systems , which would be a lot cheaper . "
the variety of options and weapons technology is likely to dominate any negotiations , and could easily scupper the project .
both sides are likely to be wary of revealing too much of their own technology .
" i think the us state department 's concern at the moment is probably whether the russians are just there to have a look-see , " said tusa .
" they may say they 're interested in creating a joint defense shield just to see what the us has to offer , and then back out if it 's not enough . "
experience suggests that armies are extremely cagey about sharing technology , even with their partners .
" america 's main nato allies in europe - the uk and germany - basically never get to see any us military technology .
do we really believe that the state department is suddenly going to let russia see everything ? " asked tusa .
european complications but this does not exhaust all the complications that any large-scale collaboration would involve .
the european nato states where missile defense systems would be installed are unlikely to allow the negotiations to take place without their opinions being heard .
and these opinions are wide-ranging .
" europe encompasses several different views - eastern european countries obviously have a very different attitude to russia than western ones , " said tusa .
" the countries to the south-east will be more concerned about the threat from missiles , while countries in north-western europe less so . "
as so often , the importance of poland 's strategic position in europe could prove vital , and the country 's recently improved relations with russia may open to the door to a global project .
klein is optimistic : " poland is a very important member state in nato , and poland 's relations with russia will play an important part in the development of the missile defense shield .
for that reason the recent rapprochement between the two countries , which began well before the recent tragedy in smolensk , is a good sign . "

the 38-year-old hamburg lawyer 's family emigrated to germany from turkey four decades ago . ayguel oezkan on monday became germany 's first muslim woman minister .
the hamburg lawyer has been named minister of social affairs for the northern state of lower saxony .
this was part of a cabinet shuffle in which christian democrat premier christian wulff replaced four of his ministers .
in addition to the 38-year-old oezkan there was also another first , as the newly appointed science minister , johanna wanka -lrb- 59 -rrb- of brandenburg , became the first eastern german woman to enter the cabinet of a western german state .
oezkan 's appointment was welcomed by serkan toeren , the liberal free democrats ' spokesman on integration policy at the federal level .
only a decade ago there was still discussion as to whether the public could accept having an immigrant as a minister , said toeren , who , like oezkan has turkish roots . but now germany has not only oezkan , but also philipp roesler , germany 's vietnamese-born health minister .
" who knows ? maybe she could become chancellor , too , " toeren told the rheinische post newspaper .
" i am aware that i 'll a role model , " oezkan said , shortly after learning of her appointment .
kenan kolat , chairman of the tgd , the turkish community in germany , said in a statement that he found it remarkable that the conservative christian democrats had taken this step .
he added that he hoped that other german parties would follow the cdu 's example. dl / ots / dpa editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

airlines have accused aviation experts of exaggerating the risk , but is it really safe to fly right now ? europe 's busiest air hub saw its first flights on tuesday evening as airspace across the continent slowly began to reopen following nearly a week of widespread travel disruption .
a flight from vancouver arrived at london 's heathrow airport shortly before 10 p.m. local time , the first since british airspace was closed last thursday following the eruption of iceland 's eyjafjallajokull volcano .
british airways expected about 24 other flights to arrive from the united states , africa and asia later in the evening .
earlier tuesday , germany 's two biggest airlines announced they would resume flying many of their regularly scheduled flights , despite an ongoing no-fly rule in german airspace , by operating under special " visual flight " conditions . under the visual flight rules , airlines are permitted to fly below 3,000 meters -lrb- 9,800 feet -rrb- during daylight , as long as pilots use their own radar and eyesight to avoid other planes .
germany 's flag carrier lufthansa announced it would carry more than 15,000 passengers on some 200 flights on tuesday .
air berlin , germany 's second largest carrier , was operating a nearly full flight schedule , according to its web site .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many stranded passengers were forced to sleep in airports the flights were operating through a loophole in the aviation regulations , said christine kellek of germany 's flight safety organization -lrb- dfs -rrb- .
the closure of airspace only applies to aviation that relies on ground control and navigation instruments , according to kellek .

airlines have accused aviation experts of exaggerating the risk , but is it really safe to fly right now ? europe 's busiest air hub saw its first flights on tuesday evening as airspace across the continent slowly began to reopen following nearly a week of widespread travel disruption .
a flight from vancouver arrived at london 's heathrow airport shortly before 10 p.m. local time , the first since british airspace was closed last thursday following the eruption of iceland 's eyjafjallajokull volcano .
british airways expected about 24 other flights to arrive from the united states , africa and asia later in the evening .
earlier tuesday , germany 's two biggest airlines announced they would resume flying many of their regularly scheduled flights , despite an ongoing no-fly rule in german airspace , by operating under special " visual flight " conditions . under the visual flight rules , airlines are permitted to fly below 3,000 meters -lrb- 9,800 feet -rrb- during daylight , as long as pilots use their own radar and eyesight to avoid other planes .
germany 's flag carrier lufthansa announced it would carry more than 15,000 passengers on some 200 flights on tuesday .
air berlin , germany 's second largest carrier , was operating a nearly full flight schedule , according to its web site .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many stranded passengers were forced to sleep in airports the flights were operating through a loophole in the aviation regulations , said christine kellek of germany 's flight safety organization -lrb- dfs -rrb- .
the closure of airspace only applies to aviation that relies on ground control and navigation instruments , according to kellek .
" the german air navigation services can not forbid flying by visual flying rules , because we regulate instrument flights , so it is not up to us to decide if somebody can fly under visual flying rules or not , " kellek told deutsche welle .
pressure on pilots but while these flights may be allowed , not everyone supports the idea .

" it 's due to monetary reasons . "
it puts unfair pressure on pilots , he added . " legally , you can say , ‘ no i do n't want to fly , ’ but if your employer tells you to fly and you say no , you can get thrown out .
so how can you decide not to fly ? "

the heightened tensions come as the deployment of troops in a financial area of the city thwarted a planned march by the protestors earlier tuesday . tensions remain high in bangkok ten days after clashes between the military and anti-government protestors left 25 people dead and hundreds injured . the army said it was now prepared to take tougher measures in the case of further clashes , using elite troops .
according to army spokesman colonel sunsern kaewkumnerd , the army was ready to take decisive action , including the use of live bullets , if provoked .
protesters remain firm charan dittapichai is a leader of the united democratic front against dictatorship , or udd , better known as the red shirts .
he says the protesters will remain resolute in the case of a crackdown .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anti-government demonstrators shout insults from behind razor wire he does not believe the army will crack down in seven days , as they are threatening to do .
" it can not .
i do n't believe that the army can do that .
and if they do , no one knows what will happen because at least 30 percent who come here are not afraid of death . "
the udd says prime minister abhisit vejjajiva 's government must resign and call new elections .
but the government and coalition partners say elections in the current heated climate would do little to end the current political crisis .
on tuesday tens of thousands of red shirt protesters gathered at the rally site , near major malls and department stores that have been forced to close for almost three weeks at the cost of millions of dollars .
" they 're trying to demonize us " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anti-government protesters , in red , clash with policemen sean boonpracong , a udd spokesperson , says while there are fears the deep social divisions could be exacerbated , the government is to be blamed , not the protestors .
" they 're trying to blame us as intransigent .
you have to remember the government and their conservative allies are more powerful than us .
i think you should ask them what they 're prepared to offer .
but they 're trying to demonize us as being a terrorist group .
and it 's really counterproductive to hear that type of really extreme rhetoric . "
army officials said protestors have stockpiled home-made weapons including acid banks and clubs spiked with nails in preparation for a crackdown .
there is concern that demonstrators may also have firearms .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thailand 's prime minister abhisit vejjajiva , said his government stands ready to talk with the " red shirts " " i am afraid because i can not see any sign from now on how we can pass this moment peacefully , " says pinpaka ngamsom , the assistant editor for online news service , prachatai.com.
" if you see all the factors right now it 's difficult for thailand .
if you look at the prime minister it 's hard for him to turn away and if you look to the red shirts for the leader it 's also very hard for them to turn away , and if you look at the protestor they strongly believe that they can win . "
the worst crisis in two decades the current political crisis is the most severe test for the country in almost 20 years .
prime minister abhisit survived a similar crisis last year , one also led by the red shirts who are backing former prime minister thaksin shinawatra .
thaksin remains overseas to avoid a two year jail term for corruption .
but it is also reported thaksin is consolidating his support even now within police and military ranks .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 20.04.2010 thai army warns of tough action großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thailand 's commander in chief , anupong paochinda , prepared to crack down thailand is bracing itself for a new round of clashes between anti-government protestors and security forces amid fears of major bloodshed .
the heightened tensions come as the deployment of troops in a financial area of the city thwarted a planned march by the protestors earlier tuesday . tensions remain high in bangkok ten days after clashes between the military and anti-government protestors left 25 people dead and hundreds injured . the army said it was now prepared to take tougher measures in the case of further clashes , using elite troops .
according to army spokesman colonel sunsern kaewkumnerd , the army was ready to take decisive action , including the use of live bullets , if provoked .
protesters remain firm charan dittapichai is a leader of the united democratic front against dictatorship , or udd , better known as the red shirts .
he says the protesters will remain resolute in the case of a crackdown .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anti-government demonstrators shout insults from behind razor wire he does not believe the army will crack down in seven days , as they are threatening to do .
" it can not .
i do n't believe that the army can do that .
and if they do , no one knows what will happen because at least 30 percent who come here are not afraid of death . "
the udd says prime minister abhisit vejjajiva 's government must resign and call new elections .
but the government and coalition partners say elections in the current heated climate would do little to end the current political crisis .
on tuesday tens of thousands of red shirt protesters gathered at the rally site , near major malls and department stores that have been forced to close for almost three weeks at the cost of millions of dollars .
" they 're trying to demonize us " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anti-government protesters , in red , clash with policemen sean boonpracong , a udd spokesperson , says while there are fears the deep social divisions could be exacerbated , the government is to be blamed , not the protestors .
" they 're trying to blame us as intransigent .
you have to remember the government and their conservative allies are more powerful than us .
i think you should ask them what they 're prepared to offer .
but they 're trying to demonize us as being a terrorist group .
and it 's really counterproductive to hear that type of really extreme rhetoric . "
army officials said protestors have stockpiled home-made weapons including acid banks and clubs spiked with nails in preparation for a crackdown .
there is concern that demonstrators may also have firearms .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thailand 's prime minister abhisit vejjajiva , said his government stands ready to talk with the " red shirts " " i am afraid because i can not see any sign from now on how we can pass this moment peacefully , " says pinpaka ngamsom , the assistant editor for online news service , prachatai.com.
" if you see all the factors right now it 's difficult for thailand .
if you look at the prime minister it 's hard for him to turn away and if you look to the red shirts for the leader it 's also very hard for them to turn away , and if you look at the protestor they strongly believe that they can win . "
the worst crisis in two decades the current political crisis is the most severe test for the country in almost 20 years .
prime minister abhisit survived a similar crisis last year , one also led by the red shirts who are backing former prime minister thaksin shinawatra .
thaksin remains overseas to avoid a two year jail term for corruption .
but it is also reported thaksin is consolidating his support even now within police and military ranks .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 20.04.2010 thai army warns of tough action großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thailand 's commander in chief , anupong paochinda , prepared to crack down thailand is bracing itself for a new round of clashes between anti-government protestors and security forces amid fears of major bloodshed .
the heightened tensions come as the deployment of troops in a financial area of the city thwarted a planned march by the protestors earlier tuesday . tensions remain high in bangkok ten days after clashes between the military and anti-government protestors left 25 people dead and hundreds injured . the army said it was now prepared to take tougher measures in the case of further clashes , using elite troops .
according to army spokesman colonel sunsern kaewkumnerd , the army was ready to take decisive action , including the use of live bullets , if provoked .
protesters remain firm charan dittapichai is a leader of the united democratic front against dictatorship , or udd , better known as the red shirts .
he says the protesters will remain resolute in the case of a crackdown .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anti-government demonstrators shout insults from behind razor wire he does not believe the army will crack down in seven days , as they are threatening to do .
" it can not .
i do n't believe that the army can do that .
and if they do , no one knows what will happen because at least 30 percent who come here are not afraid of death . "
the udd says prime minister abhisit vejjajiva 's government must resign and call new elections .
but the government and coalition partners say elections in the current heated climate would do little to end the current political crisis .
on tuesday tens of thousands of red shirt protesters gathered at the rally site , near major malls and department stores that have been forced to close for almost three weeks at the cost of millions of dollars .
" they 're trying to demonize us " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anti-government protesters , in red , clash with policemen sean boonpracong , a udd spokesperson , says while there are fears the deep social divisions could be exacerbated , the government is to be blamed , not the protestors .
" they 're trying to blame us as intransigent .
you have to remember the government and their conservative allies are more powerful than us .
i think you should ask them what they 're prepared to offer .
but they 're trying to demonize us as being a terrorist group .
and it 's really counterproductive to hear that type of really extreme rhetoric . "
army officials said protestors have stockpiled home-made weapons including acid banks and clubs spiked with nails in preparation for a crackdown .
there is concern that demonstrators may also have firearms .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thailand 's prime minister abhisit vejjajiva , said his government stands ready to talk with the " red shirts " " i am afraid because i can not see any sign from now on how we can pass this moment peacefully , " says pinpaka ngamsom , the assistant editor for online news service , prachatai.com.
" if you see all the factors right now it 's difficult for thailand .
if you look at the prime minister it 's hard for him to turn away and if you look to the red shirts for the leader it 's also very hard for them to turn away , and if you look at the protestor they strongly believe that they can win . "
the worst crisis in two decades the current political crisis is the most severe test for the country in almost 20 years .
prime minister abhisit survived a similar crisis last year , one also led by the red shirts who are backing former prime minister thaksin shinawatra .
thaksin remains overseas to avoid a two year jail term for corruption .
but it is also reported thaksin is consolidating his support even now within police and military ranks .

meanwhile , it is unclear where the ousted former president is located . in a fresh round of violence in kyrgyzstan , on monday hundreds of police officers were dispatched to suppress riots that started in a village outside of the capital , bishkek .
ethnic kyrgyz rioters seized plots of land from russians and turks in the village of mayevka , and in the subsequent violence five people were killed and many others injured .
" the crowd poured into mayevka and started wreaking destruction , robbing and killing .
they mainly robbed and burned the homes of turks living in the village , " alexander konstantin , a local resident , told journalists .
" all the provocateurs and ringleaders in the riots will be punished to the full extent of the law , " the interim government said in a statement released on tuesday .
the riot was the latest challenge to the interim government , which seized power earlier this month after a popular uprising that ousted president kurmanbek bakiyev .
however , so far the interim government has failed to establish full control over the country .
on monday , loyalists of the former president installed a pro-bakiyev governor after seizing a regional government in jalalabad .
bakiyev 's whereabouts unknown toppled president bakiyev was flown to kazakhstan last week in an attempt to reduce the risk of civil war in kyrgyzstan .
a spokesperson for the foreign ministry in kazakhstan confirmed to the ap news agency that bakiyev had left the country , but provided no further details about where he had gone .
bakiyev is wanted by the interim kyrgyz government in connection with the shootings of demonstrators during the protests in early april that culminated in his overthrow. cb / afp / reuters / ap editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the heightened tensions come as the deployment of troops in a financial area of the city thwarted a planned march by the protestors earlier tuesday . tensions remain high in bangkok ten days after clashes between the military and anti-government protestors left 25 people dead and hundreds injured . the army said it was now prepared to take tougher measures in the case of further clashes , using elite troops .
according to army spokesman colonel sunsern kaewkumnerd , the army was ready to take decisive action , including the use of live bullets , if provoked .

the udd says prime minister abhisit vejjajiva 's government must resign and call new elections .
but the government and coalition partners say elections in the current heated climate would do little to end the current political crisis .

you have to remember the government and their conservative allies are more powerful than us .
i think you should ask them what they 're prepared to offer .
but they 're trying to demonize us as being a terrorist group .
and it 's really counterproductive to hear that type of really extreme rhetoric . "
army officials said protestors have stockpiled home-made weapons including acid banks and clubs spiked with nails in preparation for a crackdown .
there is concern that demonstrators may also have firearms .

in his annual address to parliament , putin expressed confidence that russia would exceed the official growth forecast of 3.1 percent in 2010 .
" provisional results for the first quarter fuel optimism . this allows us to say that the recession is over .
this does not mean that the crisis is over , " putin said .
putin concentrated on the merits of responsible fiscal policy , saying that russia did not want to have to " go with our hands outstretched to somebody , losing our economic and then our political sovereignty . "
although russia was hard hit by the economic crisis , with gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- shrinking by 7.9 percent in 2009 , it did not request help from the international monetary fund , unlike its neighbour ukraine .
healthcare reform putin proposed a reform of state finances in order to halve the budget deficit to 3 percent of gdp by 2012 , although he did not go into detail .
a planned rise in social security tax will go ahead from next year , and the prime minister said it would be used for a reform of the healthcare system .
" more than 30 percent of the country 's medical institutions are in a critical state or require a financial overhaul .
therefore , within the next two years , we will assign about 300 billion roubles -lrb- 10.3 billion dollars , 7.6 million euros -rrb- to put the country 's health system in order , " putin said .
in an attempt to boost russia 's standing in the business world , putin pledged to free russian businesses from the " kilos of paperwork " that burden operations .
he said the government would reform the agencies that regulate business and drop restrictions for start-up companies .
in a world bank list of attractive business climates , russia only ranks 120th , due to low transparency and impenetrable bureaucracy .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de medicine -pipe- 20.04.2010 tailor-making cancer treatments großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ugly face of cancern cells cancer researchers in berlin are working on a genome sequencing project .
it promises an individualized approach to a disease that still defies complete medical comprehension . with almost half a million people in germany expected to fall prey to cancer this year , some 1,800 of them under the age of 15 , scientists at berlin 's charité hospital are working on a new form of treatment .
they hope it will help transform cancer into a chronic rather than a fatal illness .
they are beginning to understand that each tumor - an accumulation of genetic mutations - has its own genetic makeup .
and as reinhold schafer , deputy director of the charité comprehensive cancer center in berlin explained , in keeping with that discovery , they are now working on personalized approach for individual patients .
" we are beginning to understand that a cancer genome carries many more mutations than we would have anticipated , " he told deutsche welle .
" so far we are dealing with a handful of mutations , so called driver mutations , which drive the onset and are also responsible for the maintenance of the cancer phenotype . "
impotent mix as things stand , cancer patients can expect to be treated with a concoction of different and expensive drugs , some of which will have absolutely no effect on certain tumors , but which will do serious harm to other tissues in a given patient 's body .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : images from a mamogram , screening for the prevention of breast cancer that is where genome sequencing technology comes in .
as it becomes less expensive and more accessible , the potential for an individualized approach to cancer treatment is becoming a reality .
and that is good news for schafer and his colleagues on the treat1000 project , which plans to do as its name suggests .
" the idea is to use deep sequencing technology to comprehensively assess the cancer genomes of these thousand patients and to compare the cancer genomes with a constitutive situation in order to find out which are the cancer-specific molecular alterations in these patients . "
conventional cancer medicine has focused on driver mutations , which are a kind of common denominator between cancers of the same type .
schafer , however , is exploring " passenger mutations , " which are unique to each patient .
" there 's a bunch - hundreds , thousands - of mutations that occur in cancer patients , and so far we do n't have any idea what they are doing at the functional level , but they are there . "
bar code for cancer the researcher describes the combination of passenger mutations as an " individual bar code " for cancer .
as personalized treatment becomes more advanced , oncologists will be able to target specific mutations with combinations of drugs they know have a high probability of working .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a patient receives radiation therapy for cancer hans lehrach , head of vertebrate genomics at the max planck institute for molecular genetics in berlin , says using computer modeling makes it possible to sort through thousands of drug candidates in search of a combination which can combat a tumor while minimizing damage to a patients ' overall health .
the procedure requires researchers to take dna samples from patients ' blood and tumor and decode the genetic information of both .
" we can combine that with the results from decades of cancer research which has given us a very large amount of information on the pathways which connect the different components we see in the sequencing , " lehrach told deutsche welle .
scientific evolution improvements in genome sequencing technology have made treat1000 a viable project .
it currently takes lehrach and his team about 10 days to sequence a human genome .
by comparison , the original human genome project took from 1990 to 2003 to first identify and sequence human dna .
but both science and technology have moved on since then .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's charité hospital " we can try the wrong treatment thousands of times on the computer model but before we go to the patient we should be very sure that whatever we do will help the patient , it will not have any unacceptable side effects , " lehrach said .
lehrach hopes an individualized approach to cancer treatment would enable doctors to respond to changes in tumors and better control them .
but personalized medicine does n't only have the potential to change the fates of cancer patients , it is also likely to drastically change the way clinical trials of drugs are conducted .
more personal all-round clinical trials are n't currently stratified by the genetic profiles of their participants .
patients suffering from the same tumor all receive identical treatments , a practice which may have caused research on some drugs to be discontinued on account of their apparently low rate of effectiveness .
however those drugs may be highly effective if tested on a subset of patients who share similarities in their ' bar code ' of passenger mutations .
and that , says schafer , means the cancer battle of the future will become about tailoring treatments to the genetic profiles of individual patients .
" some people even believe it 's the big revolution in medicine , but time will tell , " schafer said .
" i guess it 's more or less a series of little revolutions , little progress , but steady progress .
hopefully . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de mergers & acquisitions -pipe- 20.04.2010 deutsche bahn offers 1.54 billion pounds for britain 's arriva großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : arriva operates transport services in 12 european nations deutsche bahn 's plan to acquire uk transport provider arriva appears to be on track .
the takeover - the most expensive in the german company 's history - is aimed at strengthening its passenger business throughout europe . british train and bus operator arriva has confirmed that german state rail company deutsche bahn is willing to pay 1.54 billion pounds -lrb- 1.8 billion euros -rrb- in cash to buy its operations as advanced talks continue .
media reports said that if arriva 's debt is taken into account , the total value of the offer is 2.7 billion euros .
reuters news agency quoted sources close to the deal who said the takeover would be financed entirely through the issuance of bonds , and could be approved by deutsche bahn 's supervisory board as early as next week .
the acquisition , which would confirm deutsche bahn as europe 's largest rail transport operator , could also trigger a wave of consolidation in the rail sector .
french rail company sncf , which held talks with arriva as well , is equally keen to expand its footprint throughout europe .
deutsche bahn and arriva have been in talks for several weeks .
the german operator has made no secret of its interest in acquiring the uk company , which operates bus networks , rail franchises and other transportation services in 12 european countries .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche bahn sees little room for growth in the german market key asset arriva is the only big british transport group to have ventured into europe , where it has taken advantage of gradual market liberalization .
its european operations account for nearly half of its revenue .
last month at the presentation of the group 's financial results , deutsche bahn chief executive officer ruediger grube said the company plans to run its high-speed long-distance trains through the channel tunnel and " further actively expand " its business activities beyond germany 's national borders .
deutsche bahn is keen to move beyond its home territory as germany 's domestic rail market opens up to competition .
the uk is high on its list of target countries .
the rail company has already made a number of acquisitions in britain including chiltern railways , which offers service between marylebone and birmingham , and ews , the freight operator .
it also runs the tyne & wear metro and holds a 50 percent stake in the london overground rail network .
pros and cons richard talbot , an analyst with the railway consultancy in london , said a takeover of arriva could benefit the uk rail market in several ways .
" deutsche bahn would bring technology know-how and system management skills , " he said .
" the company would also be another powerful player competing in the franchise bidding process . "
commuters who use uk trains also see benefits .
" trains in the uk have a very poor reputation when it comes to service , punctuality and cost , " said chris manning , a businessman who commutes daily by train to london and who is familiar with german service .
" they need to face competition from continental train companies like deutsche bahn to improve quality .
these operators are light years ahead . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics say britain 's rail network could use some german efficiency but consultant talbot also warned that consolidation could have its drawbacks .
" small can be beautiful , especially when it comes to regional operators that provide a good service cost-efficiently , " he said .
" big is n't always necessarily better . "
indeed , some critics of deutsche bahn say the state-owned company , which is known for its bureaucracy , could be overextending its resources with its ambitious expansion plans . author : john blau editor : samuel edmonds send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

its european operations account for nearly half of its revenue .
last month at the presentation of the group 's financial results , deutsche bahn chief executive officer ruediger grube said the company plans to run its high-speed long-distance trains through the channel tunnel and " further actively expand " its business activities beyond germany 's national borders .
deutsche bahn is keen to move beyond its home territory as germany 's domestic rail market opens up to competition .
the uk is high on its list of target countries .
the rail company has already made a number of acquisitions in britain including chiltern railways , which offers service between marylebone and birmingham , and ews , the freight operator .
it also runs the tyne & wear metro and holds a 50 percent stake in the london overground rail network .
pros and cons richard talbot , an analyst with the railway consultancy in london , said a takeover of arriva could benefit the uk rail market in several ways .
" deutsche bahn would bring technology know-how and system management skills , " he said .
" the company would also be another powerful player competing in the franchise bidding process . "
commuters who use uk trains also see benefits .
" trains in the uk have a very poor reputation when it comes to service , punctuality and cost , " said chris manning , a businessman who commutes daily by train to london and who is familiar with german service .

the takeover - the most expensive in the german company 's history - is aimed at strengthening its passenger business throughout europe . british train and bus operator arriva has confirmed that german state rail company deutsche bahn is willing to pay 1.54 billion pounds -lrb- 1.8 billion euros -rrb- in cash to buy its operations as advanced talks continue .
media reports said that if arriva 's debt is taken into account , the total value of the offer is 2.7 billion euros .
reuters news agency quoted sources close to the deal who said the takeover would be financed entirely through the issuance of bonds , and could be approved by deutsche bahn 's supervisory board as early as next week .
the acquisition , which would confirm deutsche bahn as europe 's largest rail transport operator , could also trigger a wave of consolidation in the rail sector .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de mergers & acquisitions -pipe- 20.04.2010 deutsche bahn offers 1.54 billion pounds for britain 's arriva großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : arriva operates transport services in 12 european nations deutsche bahn 's plan to acquire uk transport provider arriva appears to be on track .
the takeover - the most expensive in the german company 's history - is aimed at strengthening its passenger business throughout europe . british train and bus operator arriva has confirmed that german state rail company deutsche bahn is willing to pay 1.54 billion pounds -lrb- 1.8 billion euros -rrb- in cash to buy its operations as advanced talks continue .
media reports said that if arriva 's debt is taken into account , the total value of the offer is 2.7 billion euros .
reuters news agency quoted sources close to the deal who said the takeover would be financed entirely through the issuance of bonds , and could be approved by deutsche bahn 's supervisory board as early as next week .
the acquisition , which would confirm deutsche bahn as europe 's largest rail transport operator , could also trigger a wave of consolidation in the rail sector .
french rail company sncf , which held talks with arriva as well , is equally keen to expand its footprint throughout europe .
deutsche bahn and arriva have been in talks for several weeks .
the german operator has made no secret of its interest in acquiring the uk company , which operates bus networks , rail franchises and other transportation services in 12 european countries .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche bahn sees little room for growth in the german market key asset arriva is the only big british transport group to have ventured into europe , where it has taken advantage of gradual market liberalization .
its european operations account for nearly half of its revenue .
last month at the presentation of the group 's financial results , deutsche bahn chief executive officer ruediger grube said the company plans to run its high-speed long-distance trains through the channel tunnel and " further actively expand " its business activities beyond germany 's national borders .
deutsche bahn is keen to move beyond its home territory as germany 's domestic rail market opens up to competition .
the uk is high on its list of target countries .
the rail company has already made a number of acquisitions in britain including chiltern railways , which offers service between marylebone and birmingham , and ews , the freight operator .
it also runs the tyne & wear metro and holds a 50 percent stake in the london overground rail network .
pros and cons richard talbot , an analyst with the railway consultancy in london , said a takeover of arriva could benefit the uk rail market in several ways .
" deutsche bahn would bring technology know-how and system management skills , " he said .
" the company would also be another powerful player competing in the franchise bidding process . "
commuters who use uk trains also see benefits .
" trains in the uk have a very poor reputation when it comes to service , punctuality and cost , " said chris manning , a businessman who commutes daily by train to london and who is familiar with german service .
" they need to face competition from continental train companies like deutsche bahn to improve quality .
these operators are light years ahead . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics say britain 's rail network could use some german efficiency but consultant talbot also warned that consolidation could have its drawbacks .
" small can be beautiful , especially when it comes to regional operators that provide a good service cost-efficiently , " he said .
" big is n't always necessarily better . "
indeed , some critics of deutsche bahn say the state-owned company , which is known for its bureaucracy , could be overextending its resources with its ambitious expansion plans . author : john blau editor : samuel edmonds send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de mergers & acquisitions -pipe- 20.04.2010 deutsche bahn offers 1.54 billion pounds for britain 's arriva großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : arriva operates transport services in 12 european nations deutsche bahn 's plan to acquire uk transport provider arriva appears to be on track .
the takeover - the most expensive in the german company 's history - is aimed at strengthening its passenger business throughout europe . british train and bus operator arriva has confirmed that german state rail company deutsche bahn is willing to pay 1.54 billion pounds -lrb- 1.8 billion euros -rrb- in cash to buy its operations as advanced talks continue .
media reports said that if arriva 's debt is taken into account , the total value of the offer is 2.7 billion euros .
reuters news agency quoted sources close to the deal who said the takeover would be financed entirely through the issuance of bonds , and could be approved by deutsche bahn 's supervisory board as early as next week .
the acquisition , which would confirm deutsche bahn as europe 's largest rail transport operator , could also trigger a wave of consolidation in the rail sector .
french rail company sncf , which held talks with arriva as well , is equally keen to expand its footprint throughout europe .
deutsche bahn and arriva have been in talks for several weeks .
the german operator has made no secret of its interest in acquiring the uk company , which operates bus networks , rail franchises and other transportation services in 12 european countries .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche bahn sees little room for growth in the german market key asset arriva is the only big british transport group to have ventured into europe , where it has taken advantage of gradual market liberalization .
its european operations account for nearly half of its revenue .
last month at the presentation of the group 's financial results , deutsche bahn chief executive officer ruediger grube said the company plans to run its high-speed long-distance trains through the channel tunnel and " further actively expand " its business activities beyond germany 's national borders .
deutsche bahn is keen to move beyond its home territory as germany 's domestic rail market opens up to competition .
the uk is high on its list of target countries .
the rail company has already made a number of acquisitions in britain including chiltern railways , which offers service between marylebone and birmingham , and ews , the freight operator .
it also runs the tyne & wear metro and holds a 50 percent stake in the london overground rail network .
pros and cons richard talbot , an analyst with the railway consultancy in london , said a takeover of arriva could benefit the uk rail market in several ways .
" deutsche bahn would bring technology know-how and system management skills , " he said .
" the company would also be another powerful player competing in the franchise bidding process . "
commuters who use uk trains also see benefits .
" trains in the uk have a very poor reputation when it comes to service , punctuality and cost , " said chris manning , a businessman who commutes daily by train to london and who is familiar with german service .
" they need to face competition from continental train companies like deutsche bahn to improve quality .
these operators are light years ahead . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics say britain 's rail network could use some german efficiency but consultant talbot also warned that consolidation could have its drawbacks .
" small can be beautiful , especially when it comes to regional operators that provide a good service cost-efficiently , " he said .
" big is n't always necessarily better . "
indeed , some critics of deutsche bahn say the state-owned company , which is known for its bureaucracy , could be overextending its resources with its ambitious expansion plans . author : john blau editor : samuel edmonds send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

meanwhile , it is unclear where the ousted former president is located . in a fresh round of violence in kyrgyzstan , on monday hundreds of police officers were dispatched to suppress riots that started in a village outside of the capital , bishkek .
ethnic kyrgyz rioters seized plots of land from russians and turks in the village of mayevka , and in the subsequent violence five people were killed and many others injured .
" the crowd poured into mayevka and started wreaking destruction , robbing and killing .
they mainly robbed and burned the homes of turks living in the village , " alexander konstantin , a local resident , told journalists .
" all the provocateurs and ringleaders in the riots will be punished to the full extent of the law , " the interim government said in a statement released on tuesday .
the riot was the latest challenge to the interim government , which seized power earlier this month after a popular uprising that ousted president kurmanbek bakiyev .
however , so far the interim government has failed to establish full control over the country .
on monday , loyalists of the former president installed a pro-bakiyev governor after seizing a regional government in jalalabad .
bakiyev 's whereabouts unknown toppled president bakiyev was flown to kazakhstan last week in an attempt to reduce the risk of civil war in kyrgyzstan .
a spokesperson for the foreign ministry in kazakhstan confirmed to the ap news agency that bakiyev had left the country , but provided no further details about where he had gone .

the takeover - the most expensive in the german company 's history - is aimed at strengthening its passenger business throughout europe . british train and bus operator arriva has confirmed that german state rail company deutsche bahn is willing to pay 1.54 billion pounds -lrb- 1.8 billion euros -rrb- in cash to buy its operations as advanced talks continue .
media reports said that if arriva 's debt is taken into account , the total value of the offer is 2.7 billion euros .
reuters news agency quoted sources close to the deal who said the takeover would be financed entirely through the issuance of bonds , and could be approved by deutsche bahn 's supervisory board as early as next week .
the acquisition , which would confirm deutsche bahn as europe 's largest rail transport operator , could also trigger a wave of consolidation in the rail sector .
french rail company sncf , which held talks with arriva as well , is equally keen to expand its footprint throughout europe .
deutsche bahn and arriva have been in talks for several weeks .
the german operator has made no secret of its interest in acquiring the uk company , which operates bus networks , rail franchises and other transportation services in 12 european countries .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche bahn sees little room for growth in the german market key asset arriva is the only big british transport group to have ventured into europe , where it has taken advantage of gradual market liberalization .
its european operations account for nearly half of its revenue .
last month at the presentation of the group 's financial results , deutsche bahn chief executive officer ruediger grube said the company plans to run its high-speed long-distance trains through the channel tunnel and " further actively expand " its business activities beyond germany 's national borders .
deutsche bahn is keen to move beyond its home territory as germany 's domestic rail market opens up to competition .
the uk is high on its list of target countries .
the rail company has already made a number of acquisitions in britain including chiltern railways , which offers service between marylebone and birmingham , and ews , the freight operator .
it also runs the tyne & wear metro and holds a 50 percent stake in the london overground rail network .
pros and cons richard talbot , an analyst with the railway consultancy in london , said a takeover of arriva could benefit the uk rail market in several ways .
" deutsche bahn would bring technology know-how and system management skills , " he said .
" the company would also be another powerful player competing in the franchise bidding process . "
commuters who use uk trains also see benefits .
" trains in the uk have a very poor reputation when it comes to service , punctuality and cost , " said chris manning , a businessman who commutes daily by train to london and who is familiar with german service .
" they need to face competition from continental train companies like deutsche bahn to improve quality .
these operators are light years ahead . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics say britain 's rail network could use some german efficiency but consultant talbot also warned that consolidation could have its drawbacks .
" small can be beautiful , especially when it comes to regional operators that provide a good service cost-efficiently , " he said .
" big is n't always necessarily better . "
indeed , some critics of deutsche bahn say the state-owned company , which is known for its bureaucracy , could be overextending its resources with its ambitious expansion plans . author : john blau editor : samuel edmonds send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the takeover - the most expensive in the german company 's history - is aimed at strengthening its passenger business throughout europe . british train and bus operator arriva has confirmed that german state rail company deutsche bahn is willing to pay 1.54 billion pounds -lrb- 1.8 billion euros -rrb- in cash to buy its operations as advanced talks continue .
media reports said that if arriva 's debt is taken into account , the total value of the offer is 2.7 billion euros .
reuters news agency quoted sources close to the deal who said the takeover would be financed entirely through the issuance of bonds , and could be approved by deutsche bahn 's supervisory board as early as next week .
the acquisition , which would confirm deutsche bahn as europe 's largest rail transport operator , could also trigger a wave of consolidation in the rail sector .
french rail company sncf , which held talks with arriva as well , is equally keen to expand its footprint throughout europe .
deutsche bahn and arriva have been in talks for several weeks .
the german operator has made no secret of its interest in acquiring the uk company , which operates bus networks , rail franchises and other transportation services in 12 european countries .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche bahn sees little room for growth in the german market key asset arriva is the only big british transport group to have ventured into europe , where it has taken advantage of gradual market liberalization .
its european operations account for nearly half of its revenue .
last month at the presentation of the group 's financial results , deutsche bahn chief executive officer ruediger grube said the company plans to run its high-speed long-distance trains through the channel tunnel and " further actively expand " its business activities beyond germany 's national borders .
deutsche bahn is keen to move beyond its home territory as germany 's domestic rail market opens up to competition .
the uk is high on its list of target countries .
the rail company has already made a number of acquisitions in britain including chiltern railways , which offers service between marylebone and birmingham , and ews , the freight operator .
it also runs the tyne & wear metro and holds a 50 percent stake in the london overground rail network .
pros and cons richard talbot , an analyst with the railway consultancy in london , said a takeover of arriva could benefit the uk rail market in several ways .
" deutsche bahn would bring technology know-how and system management skills , " he said .
" the company would also be another powerful player competing in the franchise bidding process . "
commuters who use uk trains also see benefits .
" trains in the uk have a very poor reputation when it comes to service , punctuality and cost , " said chris manning , a businessman who commutes daily by train to london and who is familiar with german service .
" they need to face competition from continental train companies like deutsche bahn to improve quality .
these operators are light years ahead . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics say britain 's rail network could use some german efficiency but consultant talbot also warned that consolidation could have its drawbacks .
" small can be beautiful , especially when it comes to regional operators that provide a good service cost-efficiently , " he said .
" big is n't always necessarily better . "

airlines have accused aviation experts of exaggerating the risk , but is it really safe to fly right now ? europe 's busiest air hub saw its first flights on tuesday evening as airspace across the continent slowly began to reopen following nearly a week of widespread travel disruption .
a flight from vancouver arrived at london 's heathrow airport shortly before 10 p.m. local time , the first since british airspace was closed last thursday following the eruption of iceland 's eyjafjallajokull volcano .
british airways expected about 24 other flights to arrive from the united states , africa and asia later in the evening .
earlier tuesday , germany 's two biggest airlines announced they would resume flying many of their regularly scheduled flights , despite an ongoing no-fly rule in german airspace , by operating under special " visual flight " conditions . under the visual flight rules , airlines are permitted to fly below 3,000 meters -lrb- 9,800 feet -rrb- during daylight , as long as pilots use their own radar and eyesight to avoid other planes .

the closure of airspace only applies to aviation that relies on ground control and navigation instruments , according to kellek .

juerg handwerg , a pilot and spokesperson for the german pilots ' union cockpit , said he thinks the decision to allow planes to operate on visual flight was fueled by financial considerations .
" they are avoiding the international rules they signed themselves by flying under visual flight rules , " said handwerg .
" it 's due to monetary reasons . "
it puts unfair pressure on pilots , he added . " legally , you can say , ‘ no i do n't want to fly , ’ but if your employer tells you to fly and you say no , you can get thrown out .
so how can you decide not to fly ? "
handwerg told deutsche welle . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : volcanic ash drifting across the atlantic forced the cancellation of flights across europe an expensive problem in the past , volcanic ash has been known to cause problems with aircraft . following last week 's eruption in iceland , air france , british airways , klm and lufthansa reported no problems from their own test flights , but senior us military officials said the ash had caused some engine damage to a nato f-16 fighter plane . scientists from the german aerospace center -lrb- dlr -rrb- carried out a four-hour test flight monday to measure the cloud 's density and composition .
the results were submitted to transportation authorities in berlin , who were to decide whether or not it 's safe to fly in german airspace , according to karl hinterleitner of the dlr .
after several days of flight cancellations , airlines are itching to see a return to business as usual , as flight disruptions are costing them as much as 200 million euros -lrb- $ 270 million -rrb- per day .
experts say it 's hard to know when the situation will return to normal , leaving policymakers walking a difficult line between trying to minimize the economic impact of further flight suspension and the potential risk of flying through volcanic ash .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de aviation -pipe- 20.04.2010 some flights resume despite ash cloud , but is it safe ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pilots bear the ultimate responsiblity under " visual flight " conditions as european airspace begins to reopen , some airlines in germany have resumed flights under special conditions .
airlines have accused aviation experts of exaggerating the risk , but is it really safe to fly right now ? europe 's busiest air hub saw its first flights on tuesday evening as airspace across the continent slowly began to reopen following nearly a week of widespread travel disruption .
a flight from vancouver arrived at london 's heathrow airport shortly before 10 p.m. local time , the first since british airspace was closed last thursday following the eruption of iceland 's eyjafjallajokull volcano .
british airways expected about 24 other flights to arrive from the united states , africa and asia later in the evening .
earlier tuesday , germany 's two biggest airlines announced they would resume flying many of their regularly scheduled flights , despite an ongoing no-fly rule in german airspace , by operating under special " visual flight " conditions . under the visual flight rules , airlines are permitted to fly below 3,000 meters -lrb- 9,800 feet -rrb- during daylight , as long as pilots use their own radar and eyesight to avoid other planes .
germany 's flag carrier lufthansa announced it would carry more than 15,000 passengers on some 200 flights on tuesday .
air berlin , germany 's second largest carrier , was operating a nearly full flight schedule , according to its web site .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many stranded passengers were forced to sleep in airports the flights were operating through a loophole in the aviation regulations , said christine kellek of germany 's flight safety organization -lrb- dfs -rrb- .
the closure of airspace only applies to aviation that relies on ground control and navigation instruments , according to kellek .
" the german air navigation services can not forbid flying by visual flying rules , because we regulate instrument flights , so it is not up to us to decide if somebody can fly under visual flying rules or not , " kellek told deutsche welle .
pressure on pilots but while these flights may be allowed , not everyone supports the idea .
juerg handwerg , a pilot and spokesperson for the german pilots ' union cockpit , said he thinks the decision to allow planes to operate on visual flight was fueled by financial considerations .
" they are avoiding the international rules they signed themselves by flying under visual flight rules , " said handwerg .
" it 's due to monetary reasons . "
it puts unfair pressure on pilots , he added . " legally , you can say , ‘ no i do n't want to fly , ’ but if your employer tells you to fly and you say no , you can get thrown out .
so how can you decide not to fly ? "
handwerg told deutsche welle . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : volcanic ash drifting across the atlantic forced the cancellation of flights across europe an expensive problem in the past , volcanic ash has been known to cause problems with aircraft . following last week 's eruption in iceland , air france , british airways , klm and lufthansa reported no problems from their own test flights , but senior us military officials said the ash had caused some engine damage to a nato f-16 fighter plane . scientists from the german aerospace center -lrb- dlr -rrb- carried out a four-hour test flight monday to measure the cloud 's density and composition .
the results were submitted to transportation authorities in berlin , who were to decide whether or not it 's safe to fly in german airspace , according to karl hinterleitner of the dlr .
after several days of flight cancellations , airlines are itching to see a return to business as usual , as flight disruptions are costing them as much as 200 million euros -lrb- $ 270 million -rrb- per day .
experts say it 's hard to know when the situation will return to normal , leaving policymakers walking a difficult line between trying to minimize the economic impact of further flight suspension and the potential risk of flying through volcanic ash .

but analysts are still cautious about its prospects . at a press conference on monday , nato secretary general anders rasmussen spoke about what he believed was the most serious security threat faced by europe .
" there is a growing missile threat , including from iran , " he said .
" and the politicians have a responsibility to protect the population . "
europe must " take its share in the joint protection from missile attacks . "
as far as nato is concerned , any hope of creating a missile defense system for europe rests on the cooperation of russia . moscow has persistently voiced its opposition to missile installations in eastern europe that it believes could be used as offensive weapons .
to this end , rasmussen has been working to bring nato and russia together to discuss the possibility .
speaking during a recent visit to london , nato spokesman james appathurai told reporters , " russia should be included in a missile defense system which covers europe . "
he said plans for a " new security architecture " should be " one roof which includes the russians as part of the same security family . "
the attempted cooperation has apparently met with some success .
at least one newspaper , the british independent , reported that secret talks had already begun between washington and moscow on the subject , though no further details were reported .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nmds are much more expensive than close range tmds the end of the george w. bush presidency certainly opened the door to a rapprochement between russia and the west , a process that has culminated in the recent signing of the nuclear disarmament strategic arms reduction treaty -lrb- start -rrb- treaty in prague .
many analysts were impressed at the speed with which president barack obama managed to instil enough trust in opposite number dmitry medvedev to bring him to a disarmament agreement .
just a start but many experts are still concerned whether obama 's so-called ' reset ' policy will be enough to allay russian concerns about a european missile shield .
margarete klein , senior associate at the german institute for international and security affairs -lrb- swp -rrb- , believes the former superpower enemies are still locked in a catch-22 stand-off .
" the crux of the problem is that such a defense shield would create a lot of trust between russia and nato , but would require a lot of trust in the first place , " she told deutsche welle .
but klein emphasized that there was a real willingness in russia to negotiate with the us , albeit with certain caveats .
" i think russia is open to cooperation with nato on a defence shield , on condition that the us postpones the deployment of parts of its global missile defense shield in eastern europe , " she said .
this rapprochement is partly motivated by a common threat - iran .
as francis tusa , veteran british defense analyst and writer military affairs , told deutsche welle , " if you look around at the world 's borders , you 'll see that russia is in a more risky position . "
bildunterschrift : us-russian relations have improved considerably under obama klein believes that russia 's signing of the start treaty was also motivated by necessity .
" russia saw that its strategic nuclear weapons arsenal will downsize anyway due to the age of the missiles , " she says .
" therefore , reducing its arsenal together with the usa offers the opportunity to remain on par with washington and reduce the financial burdens of its strategic nuclear arsenal . "
for its part , the us has been desperate to prevent russia selling arms to iran , and making a major agreement on a missile shield could be seen as an effective way to control the trade .
" the us has been very active in trying to persuade russia not to sell weapons to iran , " says tusa .
" but we know that russia has made deals with the iran in the past . "
several ways to skin a cat but the devil in any international agreement is in the proverbial details .
in this case , the detail is the actual military hardware up for discussion .
" there is some confusion about what kind of missile defense shields are being talked about , " says klein .
" there are theater missile defense -lrb- tmd -rrb- systems , designed to defend troops against shorter-range missiles , and the national missile defense -lrb- nmd -rrb- systems , designed to protect a whole nation or group of nations . "
though the more mobile tmds are typically used in actual war scenarios like afghanistan , they can be deployed as domestic defense systems instead of the larger nmds .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the air crash in smolensk may have improved polish-russian relations " there are several ways of skinning the cat , " says tusa .
" you could have linked batteries of tmd systems , which would be a lot cheaper . "
the variety of options and weapons technology is likely to dominate any negotiations , and could easily scupper the project .
both sides are likely to be wary of revealing too much of their own technology .
" i think the us state department 's concern at the moment is probably whether the russians are just there to have a look-see , " said tusa .
" they may say they 're interested in creating a joint defense shield just to see what the us has to offer , and then back out if it 's not enough . "
experience suggests that armies are extremely cagey about sharing technology , even with their partners .
" america 's main nato allies in europe - the uk and germany - basically never get to see any us military technology .
do we really believe that the state department is suddenly going to let russia see everything ? " asked tusa .
european complications but this does not exhaust all the complications that any large-scale collaboration would involve .
the european nato states where missile defense systems would be installed are unlikely to allow the negotiations to take place without their opinions being heard .
and these opinions are wide-ranging .
" europe encompasses several different views - eastern european countries obviously have a very different attitude to russia than western ones , " said tusa .
" the countries to the south-east will be more concerned about the threat from missiles , while countries in north-western europe less so . "
as so often , the importance of poland 's strategic position in europe could prove vital , and the country 's recently improved relations with russia may open to the door to a global project .
klein is optimistic : " poland is a very important member state in nato , and poland 's relations with russia will play an important part in the development of the missile defense shield .
for that reason the recent rapprochement between the two countries , which began well before the recent tragedy in smolensk , is a good sign . "

the takeover - the most expensive in the german company 's history - is aimed at strengthening its passenger business throughout europe . british train and bus operator arriva has confirmed that german state rail company deutsche bahn is willing to pay 1.54 billion pounds -lrb- 1.8 billion euros -rrb- in cash to buy its operations as advanced talks continue .
media reports said that if arriva 's debt is taken into account , the total value of the offer is 2.7 billion euros .
reuters news agency quoted sources close to the deal who said the takeover would be financed entirely through the issuance of bonds , and could be approved by deutsche bahn 's supervisory board as early as next week .
the acquisition , which would confirm deutsche bahn as europe 's largest rail transport operator , could also trigger a wave of consolidation in the rail sector .
french rail company sncf , which held talks with arriva as well , is equally keen to expand its footprint throughout europe .
deutsche bahn and arriva have been in talks for several weeks .

last month at the presentation of the group 's financial results , deutsche bahn chief executive officer ruediger grube said the company plans to run its high-speed long-distance trains through the channel tunnel and " further actively expand " its business activities beyond germany 's national borders .
deutsche bahn is keen to move beyond its home territory as germany 's domestic rail market opens up to competition .
the uk is high on its list of target countries .
the rail company has already made a number of acquisitions in britain including chiltern railways , which offers service between marylebone and birmingham , and ews , the freight operator .
it also runs the tyne & wear metro and holds a 50 percent stake in the london overground rail network .
pros and cons richard talbot , an analyst with the railway consultancy in london , said a takeover of arriva could benefit the uk rail market in several ways .
" deutsche bahn would bring technology know-how and system management skills , " he said .
" the company would also be another powerful player competing in the franchise bidding process . "
commuters who use uk trains also see benefits .
" trains in the uk have a very poor reputation when it comes to service , punctuality and cost , " said chris manning , a businessman who commutes daily by train to london and who is familiar with german service .

the takeover - the most expensive in the german company 's history - is aimed at strengthening its passenger business throughout europe . british train and bus operator arriva has confirmed that german state rail company deutsche bahn is willing to pay 1.54 billion pounds -lrb- 1.8 billion euros -rrb- in cash to buy its operations as advanced talks continue .
media reports said that if arriva 's debt is taken into account , the total value of the offer is 2.7 billion euros .
reuters news agency quoted sources close to the deal who said the takeover would be financed entirely through the issuance of bonds , and could be approved by deutsche bahn 's supervisory board as early as next week .
the acquisition , which would confirm deutsche bahn as europe 's largest rail transport operator , could also trigger a wave of consolidation in the rail sector .
french rail company sncf , which held talks with arriva as well , is equally keen to expand its footprint throughout europe .
deutsche bahn and arriva have been in talks for several weeks .
the german operator has made no secret of its interest in acquiring the uk company , which operates bus networks , rail franchises and other transportation services in 12 european countries .

deutsche bahn is keen to move beyond its home territory as germany 's domestic rail market opens up to competition .
the uk is high on its list of target countries .
the rail company has already made a number of acquisitions in britain including chiltern railways , which offers service between marylebone and birmingham , and ews , the freight operator .
it also runs the tyne & wear metro and holds a 50 percent stake in the london overground rail network .
pros and cons richard talbot , an analyst with the railway consultancy in london , said a takeover of arriva could benefit the uk rail market in several ways .

in his annual address to parliament , putin expressed confidence that russia would exceed the official growth forecast of 3.1 percent in 2010 .
" provisional results for the first quarter fuel optimism . this allows us to say that the recession is over .
this does not mean that the crisis is over , " putin said .
putin concentrated on the merits of responsible fiscal policy , saying that russia did not want to have to " go with our hands outstretched to somebody , losing our economic and then our political sovereignty . "
although russia was hard hit by the economic crisis , with gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- shrinking by 7.9 percent in 2009 , it did not request help from the international monetary fund , unlike its neighbour ukraine .
healthcare reform putin proposed a reform of state finances in order to halve the budget deficit to 3 percent of gdp by 2012 , although he did not go into detail .
a planned rise in social security tax will go ahead from next year , and the prime minister said it would be used for a reform of the healthcare system .
" more than 30 percent of the country 's medical institutions are in a critical state or require a financial overhaul .
therefore , within the next two years , we will assign about 300 billion roubles -lrb- 10.3 billion dollars , 7.6 million euros -rrb- to put the country 's health system in order , " putin said .
in an attempt to boost russia 's standing in the business world , putin pledged to free russian businesses from the " kilos of paperwork " that burden operations .
he said the government would reform the agencies that regulate business and drop restrictions for start-up companies .
in a world bank list of attractive business climates , russia only ranks 120th , due to low transparency and impenetrable bureaucracy .
however , putin 's speech did not mention the strengthening rouble , which some analysts say is the biggest threat to boosting russia 's growth. cb / reuters / afp / ap editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the reopening of certain routes in europe has brought some respite to the thousands of people stranded in asia . despite the partial reopening of european air space , many asian carriers remained grounded for the sixth consecutive day due to huge volcanic ash clouds from iceland .
the cancellation of flights has not only left millions of people stranded , but also cast a cloud on asian business . binit somaia from the centre for asia pacific aviation in sydney says the impact is huge .
" for example in india , you have the start of the long summer school holidays , and a lot of people were looking forward to start departing for europe so the impact is there .
australia has a very high volume of traffic to europe .
likewise the countries that have airlines that act as major hub carriers such as cathay pacific from hong kong , or singapore airlines , gulf carriers such as ethihad and emirates are also affected . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iceland 's volcano is creating chaos not only in europe . exports and cargo affected even though the asian carriers have been able to continue their operation in the non european sectors as usual , they are expected to lose millions of dollars in revenue per day due to the disruption of flights in europe . asian exports and air cargo services have also been hit hard .
asian carriers transport a large percentage of cargo that includes mobile phones , high tech electronics and textiles . in south korea , a trade association estimated the country will post 112 million dollars -lrb- around 83 million euros -rrb- in lost exports caused by the ash cloud . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nissan says it has curtailed production at two plants due to delay of supply of parts thousands of factories in china 's guangdong province have also seen air freight delayed , mainly watches , jewellery and clothing . in japan , the carmaker nissan said it was being forced to suspend some vehicle production because of a shortage of parts that were supposed to come from ireland . impact on financial recovery experts fear the disruption of flights could slow down the regional recovery from the recent global economic slump . " this has come at a particularly bad time , " says somaia .
" after the financial crisis we saw last year , the market has just started to see some signs of recovery .
passenger numbers were increasing .
most carriers were looking forward to a much more buoyant market for the coming summer .
this has happened right at the start of this period . " but he maintains that the implications on the asian airlines as such will be minor : " they are relatively strong carriers compared to europe and america and a lot of the carriers in the region do have either full or partial ownership with the government .
therefore they will see some support in this period .
but it will not be easy and certainly some smaller carriers may expect some challenges to go ahead . " meanwhile weather experts in europe say they expect to see a change in wind conditions and rain over the weekend , which should help clear the ash cloud , sparking hopes that air traffic will soon fully resume . author : disha uppal editor : sarah berning send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the reopening of certain routes in europe has brought some respite to the thousands of people stranded in asia . despite the partial reopening of european air space , many asian carriers remained grounded for the sixth consecutive day due to huge volcanic ash clouds from iceland .
the cancellation of flights has not only left millions of people stranded , but also cast a cloud on asian business . binit somaia from the centre for asia pacific aviation in sydney says the impact is huge .
" for example in india , you have the start of the long summer school holidays , and a lot of people were looking forward to start departing for europe so the impact is there .
australia has a very high volume of traffic to europe .
likewise the countries that have airlines that act as major hub carriers such as cathay pacific from hong kong , or singapore airlines , gulf carriers such as ethihad and emirates are also affected . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iceland 's volcano is creating chaos not only in europe . exports and cargo affected even though the asian carriers have been able to continue their operation in the non european sectors as usual , they are expected to lose millions of dollars in revenue per day due to the disruption of flights in europe . asian exports and air cargo services have also been hit hard .
asian carriers transport a large percentage of cargo that includes mobile phones , high tech electronics and textiles . in south korea , a trade association estimated the country will post 112 million dollars -lrb- around 83 million euros -rrb- in lost exports caused by the ash cloud . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nissan says it has curtailed production at two plants due to delay of supply of parts thousands of factories in china 's guangdong province have also seen air freight delayed , mainly watches , jewellery and clothing . in japan , the carmaker nissan said it was being forced to suspend some vehicle production because of a shortage of parts that were supposed to come from ireland . impact on financial recovery experts fear the disruption of flights could slow down the regional recovery from the recent global economic slump . " this has come at a particularly bad time , " says somaia .
" after the financial crisis we saw last year , the market has just started to see some signs of recovery .
passenger numbers were increasing .
most carriers were looking forward to a much more buoyant market for the coming summer .
this has happened right at the start of this period . " but he maintains that the implications on the asian airlines as such will be minor : " they are relatively strong carriers compared to europe and america and a lot of the carriers in the region do have either full or partial ownership with the government .
therefore they will see some support in this period .
but it will not be easy and certainly some smaller carriers may expect some challenges to go ahead . " meanwhile weather experts in europe say they expect to see a change in wind conditions and rain over the weekend , which should help clear the ash cloud , sparking hopes that air traffic will soon fully resume . author : disha uppal editor : sarah berning send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de champions league -pipe- 20.04.2010 bayern fancy their chances against lyon in champions league semis großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : robben , olic and lahm are three key bayern players it 's been nearly a decade since a german team has made the final of club soccer 's premier competition .
now bayern are the favorites to break the dry spell .
but they should n't underestimate their opponents . going into the home-and-away tie against french side olympique lyon , to be played on april 21 and 27 , the words " bayern " and " major roll " were being used a lot together .
not only had the bavarians knocked out manchester united in the quarterfinals , they engaged in a bit of target practice in a 7-0 thrashing of hanover in the bundesliga .
with lyon in third place in france ligue 1 , this season represents the bavarians ' best chance of getting back to the champions league final since they won the title in 2000-01 .
and indeed , the bookmakers are tipping bayern as the clear favorites in this encounter .
this is the first time lyon have made it as far as the semifinals in the champions league , and bayern are a richer club that currently rides atop the table in a better league .
what 's more they have winger arjen robben , who 's playing the most dominant football of anyone in europe not named lionel messi .
but although coach louis van gaal 's side have every reason to believe a trip to the final in madrid on may 22 is within reach , they had best beware of the french side , which has made a habit this season of toppling big names .
giant killers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern need to watch out for lopez coach claude puel 's men did not get where they are by accident .
to progress beyond the group stage , lyon had to beat liverpool , and their round-of-16 opponents were no less than real madrid .
the french side has a top striker in argentinian lisandro lopez .
he 's scored seven goals in the champions league thus far , including a pair that sent lyon past rivals bordeaux in the quarterfinals .
but olympique 's real strength is defense .
puels usually gets 10 men behind the ball , and both liverpool and real were frustrated by lyon 's tenacity , wearing themselves out and getting punished on the counter-attack .
plus , they have the advantage of playing their first game away from home , where any goals scored put pressure on the opponents for the return leg .
that 's why bayern ceo karl-heinz rummenigge warned against over-confidence as the first leg approached .
" this is a match-up of equals , " rummenigge told reporters .
" we 're not the underdogs , but we 're not the favorites , either . "
dynamic duo bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : robben , in particular , is having a career season bayern have had to score a fair number of goals in their champions league campaign , and most have come from two men : robben and overachieving croatian striker ivica olic .
olic is one of the hardest working players in the business , and the bavarians will hope that his tireless forechecking will allow him to capitalize on defensive lapses in concentration , much as he did when he scored on a crucial last-second poach against manchester united in the quarterfinals .
olic could be key since bayern 's pair of true center forwards , mario gomez and miroslav klose , have both been out of form .
robben has been little short of unstoppable , confounding defenses with his incisive runs and lightning-quick shots on goal .
lyon will likely devote at least a couple of defenders to the dutch winger , which should open space on the left for his counterpart , frank ribery .
ribery , though , has become something of an enigma .
injured for much of the season , he seems to have temporarily lost some of his assurance with the ball , and his lone goal in the manchester united tie came on a terribly taken free kick that was lucky to be deflected off the wall .
and the frenchman is not bayern 's only worry .
question marks bildunterschrift : badstuber -lrb- right -rrb- , is one of bayern 's young defenders in both of their previous champions league ties , bayern have lost their away matches .
to take the pressure off , they need not only to win their home match but avoid conceding what could be deadly goals .
the bavarians ' defense has looked very solid in the league , but the squad van gaal is fielding is young .
on the left , both 19-year-old diego contento and 21-year-old holger badstuber have sometimes looked out of their depth against top european opposition .
moreover , on the right philipp lahm - usually one of the best defensive players in the world - has looked out of sorts for most of this season .
nonetheless , despite these potential weaknesses and regardless of what bayern 's bosses were saying before the tie , munich are the favorites in this match-up , and they know it .
if their defense can rise to the occasion and their men up front get the job done in the allianz arena , they 'll be in an excellent position to return to european club football 's biggest match .

the 38-year-old hamburg lawyer 's family emigrated to germany from turkey four decades ago . ayguel oezkan on monday became germany 's first muslim woman minister .
the hamburg lawyer has been named minister of social affairs for the northern state of lower saxony .
this was part of a cabinet shuffle in which christian democrat premier christian wulff replaced four of his ministers .
in addition to the 38-year-old oezkan there was also another first , as the newly appointed science minister , johanna wanka -lrb- 59 -rrb- of brandenburg , became the first eastern german woman to enter the cabinet of a western german state .
oezkan 's appointment was welcomed by serkan toeren , the liberal free democrats ' spokesman on integration policy at the federal level .
only a decade ago there was still discussion as to whether the public could accept having an immigrant as a minister , said toeren , who , like oezkan has turkish roots . but now germany has not only oezkan , but also philipp roesler , germany 's vietnamese-born health minister .
" who knows ? maybe she could become chancellor , too , " toeren told the rheinische post newspaper .
" i am aware that i 'll a role model , " oezkan said , shortly after learning of her appointment .
kenan kolat , chairman of the tgd , the turkish community in germany , said in a statement that he found it remarkable that the conservative christian democrats had taken this step .
he added that he hoped that other german parties would follow the cdu 's example. dl / ots / dpa editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the 38-year-old hamburg lawyer 's family emigrated to germany from turkey four decades ago . ayguel oezkan on monday became germany 's first muslim woman minister .
the hamburg lawyer has been named minister of social affairs for the northern state of lower saxony .
this was part of a cabinet shuffle in which christian democrat premier christian wulff replaced four of his ministers .
in addition to the 38-year-old oezkan there was also another first , as the newly appointed science minister , johanna wanka -lrb- 59 -rrb- of brandenburg , became the first eastern german woman to enter the cabinet of a western german state .
oezkan 's appointment was welcomed by serkan toeren , the liberal free democrats ' spokesman on integration policy at the federal level .
only a decade ago there was still discussion as to whether the public could accept having an immigrant as a minister , said toeren , who , like oezkan has turkish roots . but now germany has not only oezkan , but also philipp roesler , germany 's vietnamese-born health minister .
" who knows ? maybe she could become chancellor , too , " toeren told the rheinische post newspaper .
" i am aware that i 'll a role model , " oezkan said , shortly after learning of her appointment .
kenan kolat , chairman of the tgd , the turkish community in germany , said in a statement that he found it remarkable that the conservative christian democrats had taken this step .
he added that he hoped that other german parties would follow the cdu 's example. dl / ots / dpa editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

at the weekend , a door came loose and smashed into an oncoming train . deutsche bahn has announced it will investigate the failure of a door over the weekend and check all the operating trains for faults .
the trains will also run at reduced speed in tunnels until the reason for the accident has been determined .
on saturday , a train travelling from amsterdam to basel lost a door in a tunnel on the track between cologne and frankfurt .
the door came loose and crashed into the restaurant car of an oncoming train .
six people were injured , four of whom had to be treated in hospital .
the door was later recovered in a tunnel near the town of montabauer .
the track remained closed for ten hours of investigation .
the high speed ice train travels at up to 300 kilometers per hour between cologne and frankfurt .
a troubled safety record deutsche bahn 's prestigious ice trains are already facing hefty criticism over their safety record .
in july 2008 , a train derailed when its axle broke .
subsequent checks of the same generation trains revealed small cracks in the axles to be a widespread problem .
many of the trains had to be taken out of service to have the malfunctioning parts replaced .
as the wear and tear of material turned out to be higher than previously thought , the trains now have to undergo more frequent checks , leading to disruption in german rail services . ai / dpa / ap / apn editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but they should n't underestimate their opponents . going into the home-and-away tie against french side olympique lyon , to be played on april 21 and 27 , the words " bayern " and " major roll " were being used a lot together .
not only had the bavarians knocked out manchester united in the quarterfinals , they engaged in a bit of target practice in a 7-0 thrashing of hanover in the bundesliga .
with lyon in third place in france ligue 1 , this season represents the bavarians ' best chance of getting back to the champions league final since they won the title in 2000-01 .
and indeed , the bookmakers are tipping bayern as the clear favorites in this encounter .
this is the first time lyon have made it as far as the semifinals in the champions league , and bayern are a richer club that currently rides atop the table in a better league .

he 's scored seven goals in the champions league thus far , including a pair that sent lyon past rivals bordeaux in the quarterfinals .
but olympique 's real strength is defense .
puels usually gets 10 men behind the ball , and both liverpool and real were frustrated by lyon 's tenacity , wearing themselves out and getting punished on the counter-attack .

olic is one of the hardest working players in the business , and the bavarians will hope that his tireless forechecking will allow him to capitalize on defensive lapses in concentration , much as he did when he scored on a crucial last-second poach against manchester united in the quarterfinals .
olic could be key since bayern 's pair of true center forwards , mario gomez and miroslav klose , have both been out of form .
robben has been little short of unstoppable , confounding defenses with his incisive runs and lightning-quick shots on goal .
lyon will likely devote at least a couple of defenders to the dutch winger , which should open space on the left for his counterpart , frank ribery .
ribery , though , has become something of an enigma .
injured for much of the season , he seems to have temporarily lost some of his assurance with the ball , and his lone goal in the manchester united tie came on a terribly taken free kick that was lucky to be deflected off the wall .
and the frenchman is not bayern 's only worry .
question marks bildunterschrift : badstuber -lrb- right -rrb- , is one of bayern 's young defenders in both of their previous champions league ties , bayern have lost their away matches .
to take the pressure off , they need not only to win their home match but avoid conceding what could be deadly goals .
the bavarians ' defense has looked very solid in the league , but the squad van gaal is fielding is young .
on the left , both 19-year-old diego contento and 21-year-old holger badstuber have sometimes looked out of their depth against top european opposition .
moreover , on the right philipp lahm - usually one of the best defensive players in the world - has looked out of sorts for most of this season .
nonetheless , despite these potential weaknesses and regardless of what bayern 's bosses were saying before the tie , munich are the favorites in this match-up , and they know it .
if their defense can rise to the occasion and their men up front get the job done in the allianz arena , they 'll be in an excellent position to return to european club football 's biggest match .

but early signs of disaster , like increasingly saline groundwater and dwindling freshwater reserves , are already visible . last fall , island nations made a dramatic appeal to industrialized countries : " my country is on the verge of being submerged , " emanuel mori , the president of micronesia , told representatives of the european union at the time .
he demanded that western countries finally rethink their climate policies .
island states like micronesia have been hit particularly hard by global warming , primarily through rising sea levels .
there are real fears that the country could disappear from the world map in the not-too-distant future .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rising water levels are threatening micronesia 's coastlines the signs of the looming disaster are already there : rising sea levels have mixed salt water with the groundwater in several areas .
that , in turn , is shrinking drinking water reserves and making it harder to irrigate agricultural land .
the high level of salinity has poisoned the ground and made it infertile for years .
" it 's a particularly tough situation for small island nations , " juergen kropp of the potsdam institute of climate impact research said .
he added that these nations already had limited groundwater reserves .
island states not the only ones affected but it 's not just places like micronesia that are grappling with the problem of increasing salinity in the groundwater .
many other regions with long coastlines , for instance the gaza strip , are faced with similar problems .
the gaza strip is one of the most crowded places in the world , and that dense population puts great pressure on the region 's water supply .
experts say it is another important cause of saline groundwater .
" sea water can only intrude in places where water has been drained previously , " kropp said .
if groundwater turns saline , he said , it shows that more groundwater was used than can be replaced .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more demand for water can lead to rising salinity in groundwater philip magiera of the state-funded gtz development organization in germany said there are two ways to tackle the issue - either by increasing the existing water supply , or by limiting demand for it .
" i 'm a big fan of water efficiency , " magiera said .
there are lots of examples of how water usage can be reduced , he said , particularly in the agricultural sector .
in many regions , up to 70 percent of the groundwater is used to irrigate fields .
but with systems such as drip irrigation , it 's possible to save large quantities of water .
water wastage a major problem often , a lot of water is simply wasted on the way to the end consumer .
many countries struggle with leaky piping systems .
in such cases , experts say , it makes more sense to first fix the leaks before more water is pumped into the system .
" even in households , there are often possibilities to save water , " magiera said .
effective use of water can also be achieved through economic measures such as regulating water prices .
if all water-saving measures are exhausted , then increasing fresh water reserves is the only option .
if water can not be imported , then the sea water must be desalinated .
" technically , that 's not a problem anymore today , " said kropp .
sea water desalination is practiced in countries such as israel or saudi arabia .
the united arab emirates are almost entirely dependent on desalinated sea water .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the uae meets its needs for freshwater through desalination plants but one of the problems that can crop up is that desalination plants are highly energy-intensive .
and that energy is largely achieved in the middle east by burning fossil-based fuel .
that releases carbon dioxide into the atmosphere and in turn accelerates climate change .
traditional solutions desalination plants have been set up in places like micronesia .
but these are mostly small plants with very low capacities .
bigger installations are too expensive .
and there 's a lack of energy reserves to power them .
magiera said that in this case , the answer would be to turn to traditional measures - such as harvesting rainwater - instead of high-tech solutions .

but early signs of disaster , like increasingly saline groundwater and dwindling freshwater reserves , are already visible . last fall , island nations made a dramatic appeal to industrialized countries : " my country is on the verge of being submerged , " emanuel mori , the president of micronesia , told representatives of the european union at the time .
he demanded that western countries finally rethink their climate policies .
island states like micronesia have been hit particularly hard by global warming , primarily through rising sea levels .
there are real fears that the country could disappear from the world map in the not-too-distant future .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rising water levels are threatening micronesia 's coastlines the signs of the looming disaster are already there : rising sea levels have mixed salt water with the groundwater in several areas .
that , in turn , is shrinking drinking water reserves and making it harder to irrigate agricultural land .
the high level of salinity has poisoned the ground and made it infertile for years .
" it 's a particularly tough situation for small island nations , " juergen kropp of the potsdam institute of climate impact research said .
he added that these nations already had limited groundwater reserves .
island states not the only ones affected but it 's not just places like micronesia that are grappling with the problem of increasing salinity in the groundwater .
many other regions with long coastlines , for instance the gaza strip , are faced with similar problems .
the gaza strip is one of the most crowded places in the world , and that dense population puts great pressure on the region 's water supply .
experts say it is another important cause of saline groundwater .
" sea water can only intrude in places where water has been drained previously , " kropp said .
if groundwater turns saline , he said , it shows that more groundwater was used than can be replaced .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more demand for water can lead to rising salinity in groundwater philip magiera of the state-funded gtz development organization in germany said there are two ways to tackle the issue - either by increasing the existing water supply , or by limiting demand for it .
" i 'm a big fan of water efficiency , " magiera said .
there are lots of examples of how water usage can be reduced , he said , particularly in the agricultural sector .
in many regions , up to 70 percent of the groundwater is used to irrigate fields .
but with systems such as drip irrigation , it 's possible to save large quantities of water .
water wastage a major problem often , a lot of water is simply wasted on the way to the end consumer .
many countries struggle with leaky piping systems .
in such cases , experts say , it makes more sense to first fix the leaks before more water is pumped into the system .
" even in households , there are often possibilities to save water , " magiera said .
effective use of water can also be achieved through economic measures such as regulating water prices .
if all water-saving measures are exhausted , then increasing fresh water reserves is the only option .
if water can not be imported , then the sea water must be desalinated .
" technically , that 's not a problem anymore today , " said kropp .
sea water desalination is practiced in countries such as israel or saudi arabia .
the united arab emirates are almost entirely dependent on desalinated sea water .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the uae meets its needs for freshwater through desalination plants but one of the problems that can crop up is that desalination plants are highly energy-intensive .
and that energy is largely achieved in the middle east by burning fossil-based fuel .
that releases carbon dioxide into the atmosphere and in turn accelerates climate change .
traditional solutions desalination plants have been set up in places like micronesia .
but these are mostly small plants with very low capacities .
bigger installations are too expensive .
and there 's a lack of energy reserves to power them .
magiera said that in this case , the answer would be to turn to traditional measures - such as harvesting rainwater - instead of high-tech solutions .

but analysts are still cautious about its prospects . at a press conference on monday , nato secretary general anders rasmussen spoke about what he believed was the most serious security threat faced by europe .
" there is a growing missile threat , including from iran , " he said .
" and the politicians have a responsibility to protect the population . "
europe must " take its share in the joint protection from missile attacks . "
as far as nato is concerned , any hope of creating a missile defense system for europe rests on the cooperation of russia . moscow has persistently voiced its opposition to missile installations in eastern europe that it believes could be used as offensive weapons .
to this end , rasmussen has been working to bring nato and russia together to discuss the possibility .
speaking during a recent visit to london , nato spokesman james appathurai told reporters , " russia should be included in a missile defense system which covers europe . "
he said plans for a " new security architecture " should be " one roof which includes the russians as part of the same security family . "
the attempted cooperation has apparently met with some success .
at least one newspaper , the british independent , reported that secret talks had already begun between washington and moscow on the subject , though no further details were reported .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nmds are much more expensive than close range tmds the end of the george w. bush presidency certainly opened the door to a rapprochement between russia and the west , a process that has culminated in the recent signing of the nuclear disarmament strategic arms reduction treaty -lrb- start -rrb- treaty in prague .
many analysts were impressed at the speed with which president barack obama managed to instil enough trust in opposite number dmitry medvedev to bring him to a disarmament agreement .
just a start but many experts are still concerned whether obama 's so-called ' reset ' policy will be enough to allay russian concerns about a european missile shield .
margarete klein , senior associate at the german institute for international and security affairs -lrb- swp -rrb- , believes the former superpower enemies are still locked in a catch-22 stand-off .
" the crux of the problem is that such a defense shield would create a lot of trust between russia and nato , but would require a lot of trust in the first place , " she told deutsche welle .
but klein emphasized that there was a real willingness in russia to negotiate with the us , albeit with certain caveats .
" i think russia is open to cooperation with nato on a defence shield , on condition that the us postpones the deployment of parts of its global missile defense shield in eastern europe , " she said .
this rapprochement is partly motivated by a common threat - iran .
as francis tusa , veteran british defense analyst and writer military affairs , told deutsche welle , " if you look around at the world 's borders , you 'll see that russia is in a more risky position . "
bildunterschrift : us-russian relations have improved considerably under obama klein believes that russia 's signing of the start treaty was also motivated by necessity .
" russia saw that its strategic nuclear weapons arsenal will downsize anyway due to the age of the missiles , " she says .
" therefore , reducing its arsenal together with the usa offers the opportunity to remain on par with washington and reduce the financial burdens of its strategic nuclear arsenal . "
for its part , the us has been desperate to prevent russia selling arms to iran , and making a major agreement on a missile shield could be seen as an effective way to control the trade .
" the us has been very active in trying to persuade russia not to sell weapons to iran , " says tusa .
" but we know that russia has made deals with the iran in the past . "
several ways to skin a cat but the devil in any international agreement is in the proverbial details .
in this case , the detail is the actual military hardware up for discussion .
" there is some confusion about what kind of missile defense shields are being talked about , " says klein .
" there are theater missile defense -lrb- tmd -rrb- systems , designed to defend troops against shorter-range missiles , and the national missile defense -lrb- nmd -rrb- systems , designed to protect a whole nation or group of nations . "
though the more mobile tmds are typically used in actual war scenarios like afghanistan , they can be deployed as domestic defense systems instead of the larger nmds .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the air crash in smolensk may have improved polish-russian relations " there are several ways of skinning the cat , " says tusa .
" you could have linked batteries of tmd systems , which would be a lot cheaper . "
the variety of options and weapons technology is likely to dominate any negotiations , and could easily scupper the project .
both sides are likely to be wary of revealing too much of their own technology .
" i think the us state department 's concern at the moment is probably whether the russians are just there to have a look-see , " said tusa .
" they may say they 're interested in creating a joint defense shield just to see what the us has to offer , and then back out if it 's not enough . "
experience suggests that armies are extremely cagey about sharing technology , even with their partners .
" america 's main nato allies in europe - the uk and germany - basically never get to see any us military technology .
do we really believe that the state department is suddenly going to let russia see everything ? " asked tusa .
european complications but this does not exhaust all the complications that any large-scale collaboration would involve .
the european nato states where missile defense systems would be installed are unlikely to allow the negotiations to take place without their opinions being heard .
and these opinions are wide-ranging .
" europe encompasses several different views - eastern european countries obviously have a very different attitude to russia than western ones , " said tusa .
" the countries to the south-east will be more concerned about the threat from missiles , while countries in north-western europe less so . "
as so often , the importance of poland 's strategic position in europe could prove vital , and the country 's recently improved relations with russia may open to the door to a global project .
klein is optimistic : " poland is a very important member state in nato , and poland 's relations with russia will play an important part in the development of the missile defense shield .
for that reason the recent rapprochement between the two countries , which began well before the recent tragedy in smolensk , is a good sign . "

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nmds are much more expensive than close range tmds the end of the george w. bush presidency certainly opened the door to a rapprochement between russia and the west , a process that has culminated in the recent signing of the nuclear disarmament strategic arms reduction treaty -lrb- start -rrb- treaty in prague .
many analysts were impressed at the speed with which president barack obama managed to instil enough trust in opposite number dmitry medvedev to bring him to a disarmament agreement .
just a start but many experts are still concerned whether obama 's so-called ' reset ' policy will be enough to allay russian concerns about a european missile shield .
margarete klein , senior associate at the german institute for international and security affairs -lrb- swp -rrb- , believes the former superpower enemies are still locked in a catch-22 stand-off .
" the crux of the problem is that such a defense shield would create a lot of trust between russia and nato , but would require a lot of trust in the first place , " she told deutsche welle .
but klein emphasized that there was a real willingness in russia to negotiate with the us , albeit with certain caveats .
" i think russia is open to cooperation with nato on a defence shield , on condition that the us postpones the deployment of parts of its global missile defense shield in eastern europe , " she said .
this rapprochement is partly motivated by a common threat - iran .
as francis tusa , veteran british defense analyst and writer military affairs , told deutsche welle , " if you look around at the world 's borders , you 'll see that russia is in a more risky position . "
bildunterschrift : us-russian relations have improved considerably under obama klein believes that russia 's signing of the start treaty was also motivated by necessity .
" russia saw that its strategic nuclear weapons arsenal will downsize anyway due to the age of the missiles , " she says .
" therefore , reducing its arsenal together with the usa offers the opportunity to remain on par with washington and reduce the financial burdens of its strategic nuclear arsenal . "
for its part , the us has been desperate to prevent russia selling arms to iran , and making a major agreement on a missile shield could be seen as an effective way to control the trade .
" the us has been very active in trying to persuade russia not to sell weapons to iran , " says tusa .
" but we know that russia has made deals with the iran in the past . "
several ways to skin a cat but the devil in any international agreement is in the proverbial details .
in this case , the detail is the actual military hardware up for discussion .
" there is some confusion about what kind of missile defense shields are being talked about , " says klein .
" there are theater missile defense -lrb- tmd -rrb- systems , designed to defend troops against shorter-range missiles , and the national missile defense -lrb- nmd -rrb- systems , designed to protect a whole nation or group of nations . "
though the more mobile tmds are typically used in actual war scenarios like afghanistan , they can be deployed as domestic defense systems instead of the larger nmds .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the air crash in smolensk may have improved polish-russian relations " there are several ways of skinning the cat , " says tusa .
" you could have linked batteries of tmd systems , which would be a lot cheaper . "
the variety of options and weapons technology is likely to dominate any negotiations , and could easily scupper the project .
both sides are likely to be wary of revealing too much of their own technology .
" i think the us state department 's concern at the moment is probably whether the russians are just there to have a look-see , " said tusa .
" they may say they 're interested in creating a joint defense shield just to see what the us has to offer , and then back out if it 's not enough . "
experience suggests that armies are extremely cagey about sharing technology , even with their partners .
" america 's main nato allies in europe - the uk and germany - basically never get to see any us military technology .
do we really believe that the state department is suddenly going to let russia see everything ? " asked tusa .
european complications but this does not exhaust all the complications that any large-scale collaboration would involve .
the european nato states where missile defense systems would be installed are unlikely to allow the negotiations to take place without their opinions being heard .
and these opinions are wide-ranging .
" europe encompasses several different views - eastern european countries obviously have a very different attitude to russia than western ones , " said tusa .
" the countries to the south-east will be more concerned about the threat from missiles , while countries in north-western europe less so . "
as so often , the importance of poland 's strategic position in europe could prove vital , and the country 's recently improved relations with russia may open to the door to a global project .
klein is optimistic : " poland is a very important member state in nato , and poland 's relations with russia will play an important part in the development of the missile defense shield .
for that reason the recent rapprochement between the two countries , which began well before the recent tragedy in smolensk , is a good sign . "

the european nato states where missile defense systems would be installed are unlikely to allow the negotiations to take place without their opinions being heard .
and these opinions are wide-ranging .
" europe encompasses several different views - eastern european countries obviously have a very different attitude to russia than western ones , " said tusa .
" the countries to the south-east will be more concerned about the threat from missiles , while countries in north-western europe less so . "
as so often , the importance of poland 's strategic position in europe could prove vital , and the country 's recently improved relations with russia may open to the door to a global project .
klein is optimistic : " poland is a very important member state in nato , and poland 's relations with russia will play an important part in the development of the missile defense shield .
for that reason the recent rapprochement between the two countries , which began well before the recent tragedy in smolensk , is a good sign . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : focus : nato faces a changing world with new challenges nato and russia seek to bury past differences lightning-fast us-eu summit in lisbon aims to revive ties nato to withdraw from afghanistan by 2014 as summit begins , nato missile shield a test of turkey 's allegiance nato -pipe- 20.04.2010 nato and russia edge warily toward a joint missile defense shield großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rasmussen has been trying to bring the usa and russia together nato secretary general anders rasmussen has appealed for a joint missile defense shield with russia to cover europe and offer protection from a possible terror attack .
but analysts are still cautious about its prospects . at a press conference on monday , nato secretary general anders rasmussen spoke about what he believed was the most serious security threat faced by europe .
" there is a growing missile threat , including from iran , " he said .
" and the politicians have a responsibility to protect the population . "
europe must " take its share in the joint protection from missile attacks . "
as far as nato is concerned , any hope of creating a missile defense system for europe rests on the cooperation of russia . moscow has persistently voiced its opposition to missile installations in eastern europe that it believes could be used as offensive weapons .
to this end , rasmussen has been working to bring nato and russia together to discuss the possibility .
speaking during a recent visit to london , nato spokesman james appathurai told reporters , " russia should be included in a missile defense system which covers europe . "
he said plans for a " new security architecture " should be " one roof which includes the russians as part of the same security family . "
the attempted cooperation has apparently met with some success .
at least one newspaper , the british independent , reported that secret talks had already begun between washington and moscow on the subject , though no further details were reported .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nmds are much more expensive than close range tmds the end of the george w. bush presidency certainly opened the door to a rapprochement between russia and the west , a process that has culminated in the recent signing of the nuclear disarmament strategic arms reduction treaty -lrb- start -rrb- treaty in prague .
many analysts were impressed at the speed with which president barack obama managed to instil enough trust in opposite number dmitry medvedev to bring him to a disarmament agreement .
just a start but many experts are still concerned whether obama 's so-called ' reset ' policy will be enough to allay russian concerns about a european missile shield .
margarete klein , senior associate at the german institute for international and security affairs -lrb- swp -rrb- , believes the former superpower enemies are still locked in a catch-22 stand-off .
" the crux of the problem is that such a defense shield would create a lot of trust between russia and nato , but would require a lot of trust in the first place , " she told deutsche welle .
but klein emphasized that there was a real willingness in russia to negotiate with the us , albeit with certain caveats .
" i think russia is open to cooperation with nato on a defence shield , on condition that the us postpones the deployment of parts of its global missile defense shield in eastern europe , " she said .
this rapprochement is partly motivated by a common threat - iran .
as francis tusa , veteran british defense analyst and writer military affairs , told deutsche welle , " if you look around at the world 's borders , you 'll see that russia is in a more risky position . "
bildunterschrift : us-russian relations have improved considerably under obama klein believes that russia 's signing of the start treaty was also motivated by necessity .
" russia saw that its strategic nuclear weapons arsenal will downsize anyway due to the age of the missiles , " she says .
" therefore , reducing its arsenal together with the usa offers the opportunity to remain on par with washington and reduce the financial burdens of its strategic nuclear arsenal . "
for its part , the us has been desperate to prevent russia selling arms to iran , and making a major agreement on a missile shield could be seen as an effective way to control the trade .
" the us has been very active in trying to persuade russia not to sell weapons to iran , " says tusa .
" but we know that russia has made deals with the iran in the past . "
several ways to skin a cat but the devil in any international agreement is in the proverbial details .
in this case , the detail is the actual military hardware up for discussion .
" there is some confusion about what kind of missile defense shields are being talked about , " says klein .
" there are theater missile defense -lrb- tmd -rrb- systems , designed to defend troops against shorter-range missiles , and the national missile defense -lrb- nmd -rrb- systems , designed to protect a whole nation or group of nations . "
though the more mobile tmds are typically used in actual war scenarios like afghanistan , they can be deployed as domestic defense systems instead of the larger nmds .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the air crash in smolensk may have improved polish-russian relations " there are several ways of skinning the cat , " says tusa .
" you could have linked batteries of tmd systems , which would be a lot cheaper . "
the variety of options and weapons technology is likely to dominate any negotiations , and could easily scupper the project .
both sides are likely to be wary of revealing too much of their own technology .
" i think the us state department 's concern at the moment is probably whether the russians are just there to have a look-see , " said tusa .
" they may say they 're interested in creating a joint defense shield just to see what the us has to offer , and then back out if it 's not enough . "
experience suggests that armies are extremely cagey about sharing technology , even with their partners .
" america 's main nato allies in europe - the uk and germany - basically never get to see any us military technology .
do we really believe that the state department is suddenly going to let russia see everything ? " asked tusa .
european complications but this does not exhaust all the complications that any large-scale collaboration would involve .
the european nato states where missile defense systems would be installed are unlikely to allow the negotiations to take place without their opinions being heard .
and these opinions are wide-ranging .
" europe encompasses several different views - eastern european countries obviously have a very different attitude to russia than western ones , " said tusa .
