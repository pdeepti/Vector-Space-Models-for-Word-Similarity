some 200,000 children endured scorn and often hid their father 's identity .
now some have begun applying for german citizenship . more than 200,000 children fathered by german soldiers were raised by their french mothers after the nazi occupation of france during world war ii , according to paris historian fabrice vergili .
the author of the book " naitre ennemi " -lrb- born an enemy -rrb- also estimates that 20,000 french women were hounded through streets and brutally given short haircuts by their french compatriots , who accused them of " horizontal collaboration " with the nazis .
many of these " war children " grew up not knowing their full identities and ashamed of their german roots , until recently .
since 2009 dozens have sought and obtained german nationality without having to relinquish their french citizenship , as is generally required of resident foreigners under german law .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mijo panier spent decades looking for her father mijo panier , fathered by a wehrmacht soldier and born in 1943 , recently applied for german citizenship .
" i am proud to be german and french , proud of my dual nationality .
i will use one and then the other , " she said .
the liaison that started with a sneeze powder prank not until she turned 16 did panier learn that her father had been german .
her french step-father , who accepted her as his own child , forbade her to talk about her origins .
her biological parents met in a paris cafe during the four-year occupation .
" my mother went into a cafe where young french and germans met one another , but as groups kept apart , " panier said . " my mother and her friend scattered sneeze powder under the chairs of the german soldiers . "
her father was amused and moved over to sit with the girls at their table .
that was the start of a forbidden liaison .
after a search that lasted for decades , she found her father , willi welsch , five years ago with the assistance of a berlin-based organization . welsch and his daughter mijo exchanged letters before finally meeting near frankfurt .
tender encounter near frankfurt welsch was seriously ill and had been in hospital .
" to me he was unbelievably nice .
he had blue eyes and despite his illness he drew me into the train .
i sat down next to him and there we remained silent for a long time .
then we exchanged a few words in english , german and french . "
with tears in her eyes , panier adds , " it was as though i had found my second half . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : societies of war children have been formed in france welsch died a few months later , but since then panier has fostered intense contacts with her recently-discovered family in germany .
there is a photo of her paternal sister in her french living room .
months ago she sent a letter to the german embassy - in german .
" i was a child of shame .
in the end , however , i am a child of love , " she wrote .
although panier now speaks openly about her father 's origins her mother still does not want to talk about it .
shrugging off shame prompts search for family roots the urge to free themselves from shame motivates many of france 's " war children " to apply officially for their german nationality .
the surge began after a broadcast on french television in 2003 .
many former war children then contacted the paris historian virgili and went on to set up groups such as the national friendship association for war children to help each other to trace their roots .
their wartime experiences soon became a talking point in france .
hewige roberval sent her application to the german embassy shortly before her marriage .
" not long before my wedding i told my fiance about my father .
i was really scared that he might no longer want to marry me .
fortunately , he only laughed about it . "
panier says that if her application for german citzenship is granted , she plans to officially adopt her deceased father 's family name .
it is already on her letter box .

since then the country has made good progress , but what will the next two decades bring ?
experts say the outlook is positive . it was perhaps somewhat symbolic that namibia 's celebrations on sunday , march 21 , coincided with the swearing-in of its reelected president hifikepunye pohamba .
for 20 years , the southern african nation has been one of the most stable democracies on the continent .
unlike other african countries , perhaps most notably nearby zimbabwe , politics is not a main problem for namibia .
the challenges , say experts , lie elsewhere .
" the problems are the same ones as 20 years ago - providing work , food and places to live for the country 's two to three million inhabitants , " says publisher michael iwanowski , who wrote the first-ever german travel guide to namibia and led a number of official german delegations through the country .
" there 's no industry , and most people live from mining , tourism and subsistence farming .
but the elections were free and fair , and the government works well with the people . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : namibia is a country of stark , and often uninhabited , beauty namibia is the second-least densely populated country in the world , and has a nominal per capita gdp of only 3,178 euros -lrb- $ 4,278 -rrb- annually .
" the reason so few people live there is that there 's so little water , " says andre suren , a journalist for dw-tv , who was born in namibia and recently returned from filming a report there .
" provision of water is one problem , as are unemployment and poverty , which the government has made its top priority .
there also needs to be further reconciliation between tribes and between blacks and whites .
but the country has found its form of democracy . "
these are the sorts of issues that many african countries face .
but namibia is anything but a typical african nation in either its population or its history .
german south-west africa bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this plaque commemorates namibian victims of german colonial rule in the waning decades of the 19th century , namibia was one of the few places that germany , a belated colonial starter , was able to gain a foothold .
the territory officially became a colony in 1884 and was known as german south-west africa .
but germany 's rule there was hardly happy .
from 1904 to 1907 , the herero and nama tribes rebelled against their colonial master , and in the resultant fighting some 65,000 hereros , about 80 percent of the population , were killed .
in the course of world war i , south africa , which was controlled by britain , occupied namibia thanks to a league of nations mandate .
in 1946 , south africa refused to surrender that mandate even though it had been superseded by a united nations trusteeship agreement .
in 1966 , the south-west africa people 's organization , swapo , led a fight for independence , with heavy participation from the owambo tribe , which today makes up the majority of namibia 's population .
but it took until 1988 for south africa to agree to give up control over the country .
namibia officially gained sovereignty in 1990 , making it africa 's youngest country .
uranium and tourists bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : conditions in namibian townships are simple , but not inhuman namibia may be young and sparsely populated , but experts say those attributes help make its future prospects bright .
" namibia could profit from natural resources like copper and uranium , as those commodities get scarcer , " iwanowski told deutsche welle .
" but the big industry is tourism .
at least one third of the country is a nature reservation with deserts , savannahs and national parks , and most parts of the country are virtually uninhabited .
tourism has grown by 15 to 18 percent annually , and though those numbers are down a bit due to the global financial crisis , it 's still booming . "
probably among namibia 's most famous attractions are the namib and kalahari deserts , and the country needs to be careful about preserving its natural beauty .
" tourism accounts for some 70 percent of namibia 's economy , " says suren .
" that 's because the country is quite safe and easy to get to and get around in .
but namibians need to watch out for crime and environmental destruction . "
uranium mines have often been blamed for contaminating surrounding areas and putting aboriginal peoples at risk .
namibia 's natural resources have attracted the attention of a number of the world 's larger countries , who may put profits ahead of building up namibia 's own economy or preserving its environment .
china , which is very active throughout africa , has come under particular criticism for exploiting namibia 's natural wealth while polluting the land and failing to give back anything to the namibian people .
coming to terms bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : evidence of germany 's presence in namibia crops up everywhere and what about germany , the country which , in light of the colonial past , has one of the closest connections to namibia ?
the experts say that namibia is a main focus of german foreign developmental aid , but that berlin could perhaps do more in other areas .
" there needs to be a coming to terms with colonial history , " suren says .
" that would help reconciliation between tribes like the owambos and the hereros and also between blacks and whites .
germany should also support namibian political parties , increase the exchange possibilities for politicians and do more to help the namibian media . "
and there 's more connecting germany and namibia than just history .
" germans make up two-thirds of all tourists to namibia , and german developmental aid is very significant , " iwanowki says .
" berlin is partner city to the namibian capital , windhoek , and there are many parallels .
just as namibia gained independence 20 years ago , it was 20 years ago since the berlin wall fell . "
nothing is certain in the world 's poorest continent .
but if these experts are correct , africa 's youngest nation has a comparatively bright future .

the aide , named only as timo n. , worked for andreas weigel , who represented a constituency in the eastern state of saxony for the social democratic party from 2002 to 2009 . timo n. allegedly held a contract with the berlin branch of the office for the protection of the constitution , germany 's interior intelligence agency , from 2003 to 2005 .
weigel said he was aware of the extra employment of timo n. , who was an expert in islamism and terrorism and had access to confidential documents as well as nato documents as part of his position . but weigel did not inform the head of his party or the parliamentary officials of the employment .
atypical situation such double-employment is highly unusual , according to the report , and could ultimately hurt the intelligence service 's goals .
" the damage that could be caused by an exposure does not counterbalance the potential usefulness of such an operation , " a high-ranking official said .
the office for the protection of the constitution declined to comment on the report , but admitted that parallel employment by the intelligence service and parliament was in principle " incompatible . "
it added , however , that exceptions could be made " in certain individual cases . "
opposition left party politician klaus ernst in berlin on tuesday demanded an explanation on the report , saying parliament should be off-limits to the secret service and that the law regarding double-employment must be clarified. acb / dpa / afp editor : ben knight send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in an interview on deutschlandfunk national radio westerwelle said , " germany is convinced that the settlement program must be frozen .
this is not just germany 's stance , but of the european union and the entire international community . "
he also stated that a two-state solution for israelis and palestinians is advocated not only by germany , but also by the rest of the eu and the united states .
" we want a two-state solution , " said westerwelle .
" a two-state solution is the only solution that can truly bring peace . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : goerzig says engaging hamas could be good leverage with israel when asked about an appropriate time for the eu to increase its pressure on israel , westerwelle said it would be best to first see what results come from last week 's middle east quartet talks in moscow between the eu , the us , russia , and the united nations .
increasing the pressure eu foreign ministers universally condemned israeli policies at a meeting on monday in brussels , but remained at odds on how to put more pressure on the country .
the eu is israel 's largest trading partner , and the bloc has so far declined to impose trade sanctions .
but carolin goerzig , an analyst at the european union institute for security studies in paris , told deutsche welle that if the eu wants to increase its leverage on israel in order to stop the building of further settlements , the bloc should engage greater discussion with hamas .
" so far the little pressure that has been exerted on israel has not proven fruitful really , and at the same time going to the other extreme could also backfire , " said goerzig .
" so what could really pressure israel is a moderation of hamas , because then israel would have to show face and react . "
goerzig added that the conditions set out by the quartet for a palestinian government , which include the renunciation of violence , the recognition of israel 's right to exist , and a commitment to all agreements signed by the palestine liberation organization and israel , do not encourage hamas to come to the negotiating table .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu has been looking to increase its international presence " i 'm not saying we should recognize hamas as a negotiation partner right away , but it has never been stated what they would gain from agreeing to these quartet conditions , " said goerzig .
" hamas has shown some steps of moderation , but the eu has never reacted positively , so hamas always stands to lose without any benefits if it becomes more moderate . " testing eu foreign policy ?
the issue of israeli settlements is in some ways testing the eu 's - and germany 's - international role . but goerzig says the eu 's presence in the quartet was not as strong as it could have been .
" the eu has been shy about asserting itself in the quartet , which could be related to its lack of coherence , " said goerzig .
" there is a need for debate on this issue in the eu , and i think germany could drive such a debate . "
the eu foreign policy chief catherine ashton said recently she will push for the launch of " proximity " talks between the israelis and the palestinians as a prologue to formal negotiations .

france has also opened an investigation into forged french passports . speaking to parliament on tuesday , british foreign secretary david miliband said there were " compelling reasons " to believe that the israeli intelligence agency mossad was behind the killing of mahmoud al-mabhouh in dubai on january 19 , and that israel 's position as a close ally to the uk added " insult to injury . "
" the government takes this matter extremely seriously , " he said .
" such misuse of british passports is intolerable . "
israel 's ambassador to london , ron prosor , said israel was " disappointed by the decision of the british government , " but his country remained committed to a relationship " of mutual importance . "
the expelled diplomat was not named by either country , although it was believed to be a member of the israeli embassy .
hamas leaders praised the uk 's actions and said they hoped israeli officials would eventually be brought to court over the killing .
ministry investigation britain 's foreign ministry briefed prosor on monday over the findings of an investigation into the passport forgeries .
miliband said 12 british citizens had their passports copied " when handed over for inspection to individuals linked to israel , " and that they were " wholly innocent victims of identity theft . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dubai authorities have 27 suspects in the murder investigation " given that this was a very sophisticated operation in which high-quality forgeries were made , the government judges it is highly likely that the forgeries were made by a state intelligence service , " he said .
miliband met israeli foreign minister avigdor lieberman in brussels on monday to discuss the issue , and said he asked for israel 's pledge that it would " never be party to the misuse of british passports in such a way . "
france probe meanwhile a paris prosecutor said tuesday that french authorities have opened their own investigation into forged french passports , four of which were also used in the hamas murder .
france began a preliminary investigation on march 12 .
the french passports were “ either delivered with a false identity or falsified with a photograph that did not correspond to the identity indicated , ” the prosecutor said in a statement .
president nicolas sarkozy has condemned al-mabhouh ’ s killing , but has not directly implied that the israeli secret service carried out the assassination .
israel has neither confirmed nor denied the allegations of mossad ’ s involvement , maintaining a strict policy of ambiguity with such sensitive matters .
dubai police say they have 27 suspects in the murder after closely examining security cameras at the hotel where al-mabhouh was killed. acb / dpa / ap / afp editor : ben knight send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

teachers were also protesting about job cuts and planned education reforms .
staff in ministries and courts walked out , and transport workers disrupted train and metro services .
street protests were expected later in the day .
unions unimpressed by new minister the strikes came as president nicholas sarkozy responded to an electoral disaster in regional polls which was partly blamed on the unpopularity of his social reform policy .
he dismissed xavier darcos as labor minister , who was responsible for pension reform , and replaced him with the budget minister eric woerth .
but this did not impress the unions .
bernard thibault , head of the cgt union , said woerth 's reputation was as the minister who had cut staffing levels in the public sector. mll / afp / dpa editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the year of the flood " is a futuristic account of the aftermath of a major natural disaster that seems to have obliterated most of humankind .
adam one - the leader of a religious group that melds science , religion and nature - had predicted such an event .
after it happens , he and his followers regroup in a world that is altered and unpredictable . born in 1939 , atwood has published short stories , critical studies , screenplays , books for children , and poems , but is best known for her novels .
her work has been translated into over 30 languages . click on the audio link below to listen to the complete interview with margaret atwood . deutsche welle : you lived in germany in the 1980s .
what did you experience during that time ? margaret atwood : i came to germany for the very first time for my german publisher in the 70s .
then , as it turned out , in 1984 , i began " the handmaid 's tale " in berlin before the wall came down .
i began it in berlin , i finished it in tuscaloosa , alabama , which is quite a contrast .
but both of them were situations that had built-in stresses , because west berlin at that time of course was encircled by the wall and every sunday the east german air force flew over and made sonic booms , just to remind us that they were there . -lrb- … -rrb- now in germany you 're presenting your new book " the year of the flood . "
how significant is it that this book was finished in the year of your 70th birthday ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the publication of atwood 's book was postponed because of the us elections it was actually finished a year earlier .
the publication was postponed for a year because if it had been published in 2008 , it would have coincided with the american election and the american publisher quite rightly said , nobody is going to be doing anything except watching this election because whether it 's hillary clinton or barack obama , it 'll be unprecedented and everyone will be glued to their screen , which they were . i started to think a lot about your childhood when i was reading this book - the experience of being in a forest and the work of your father . yes , he was an entomologist , but he was also an all-around naturalist and what they call in canada woodsman .
in other words , he was very experienced in what we call " the bush . " -lrb- ... -rrb- i would be very scared if this latest book of yours is a prophesy about the future . first of all , it 's not a prophesy because i do n't do prophesies ; no one can really predict the future .
even the old testament prophets were n't predicting the future , they were more or less saying this is the state of your soul now .
you ca n't really write about the future because nobody has been there .
it 's like dante writing about the inferno .
i hate to break this to you , but he did not actually go down into hell . -lrb- … -rrb- are you an optimist about the future ?
this book tells us about environmental devastation , which we hear about every day in the news . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dante never actually went to hell , quipped atwood it 's not actually about that so much .
the truth is , if you remove the people , nature comes back quite well , which is where we are when the book opens .
there 's quite a lot of nature .
it 's not that all of nature gets destroyed . -lrb- … -rrb- as william gibson says , the future is already here , but it 's unevenly distributed .
some people say global warming , but really they should say climate change because the weather gets more extreme .
things change .
it 's not that everything goes away , but things change .
and if they change too abruptly , what you get is a lot of die-off . what 's really scary in this book is not that so much , although that 's a motivator , but what 's scary is that we can make new species .
we already can make new species , and we 're doing it .
but the really scary thing is we can make new diseases .
we already have that capacity .
why has not some country made a disgusting new disease and unleashed it on everybody else ?
they 're afraid of the blow-back .
there 's no way of doing that without the possibility that your country will get it too , with things being so very spreadable . -lrb- … -rrb- what a lot of people do n't know is that your first publication was actually a book of poems . yes , but it was n't the first thing i wrote .
i was actually writing the prose and the poems at the same time .
it was just that in those days , in canada , where it what almost impossible to publish a full-length novel , poems were a lot cheaper , they were shorter .
and typically you started out writing them off on a mimeo machine or putting together a little cold type book or hand-setting them , which is what i did with my first little booklet of poems - i hand-set them on a flatbed press .
try hand-setting a novel on a flatbed press ! -lrb- … -rrb- would i be right in assuming that margaret atwood is an optimist ? anyone who writes a book is an optimist .

" the year of the flood " is a futuristic account of the aftermath of a major natural disaster that seems to have obliterated most of humankind .
adam one - the leader of a religious group that melds science , religion and nature - had predicted such an event .
after it happens , he and his followers regroup in a world that is altered and unpredictable . born in 1939 , atwood has published short stories , critical studies , screenplays , books for children , and poems , but is best known for her novels .
her work has been translated into over 30 languages . click on the audio link below to listen to the complete interview with margaret atwood . deutsche welle : you lived in germany in the 1980s .
what did you experience during that time ? margaret atwood : i came to germany for the very first time for my german publisher in the 70s .
then , as it turned out , in 1984 , i began " the handmaid 's tale " in berlin before the wall came down .
i began it in berlin , i finished it in tuscaloosa , alabama , which is quite a contrast .
but both of them were situations that had built-in stresses , because west berlin at that time of course was encircled by the wall and every sunday the east german air force flew over and made sonic booms , just to remind us that they were there . -lrb- … -rrb- now in germany you 're presenting your new book " the year of the flood . "
how significant is it that this book was finished in the year of your 70th birthday ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the publication of atwood 's book was postponed because of the us elections it was actually finished a year earlier .
the publication was postponed for a year because if it had been published in 2008 , it would have coincided with the american election and the american publisher quite rightly said , nobody is going to be doing anything except watching this election because whether it 's hillary clinton or barack obama , it 'll be unprecedented and everyone will be glued to their screen , which they were . i started to think a lot about your childhood when i was reading this book - the experience of being in a forest and the work of your father . yes , he was an entomologist , but he was also an all-around naturalist and what they call in canada woodsman .
in other words , he was very experienced in what we call " the bush . " -lrb- ... -rrb- i would be very scared if this latest book of yours is a prophesy about the future . first of all , it 's not a prophesy because i do n't do prophesies ; no one can really predict the future .
even the old testament prophets were n't predicting the future , they were more or less saying this is the state of your soul now .
you ca n't really write about the future because nobody has been there .
it 's like dante writing about the inferno .
i hate to break this to you , but he did not actually go down into hell . -lrb- … -rrb- are you an optimist about the future ?
this book tells us about environmental devastation , which we hear about every day in the news . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dante never actually went to hell , quipped atwood it 's not actually about that so much .
the truth is , if you remove the people , nature comes back quite well , which is where we are when the book opens .
there 's quite a lot of nature .
it 's not that all of nature gets destroyed . -lrb- … -rrb- as william gibson says , the future is already here , but it 's unevenly distributed .
some people say global warming , but really they should say climate change because the weather gets more extreme .
things change .
it 's not that everything goes away , but things change .
and if they change too abruptly , what you get is a lot of die-off . what 's really scary in this book is not that so much , although that 's a motivator , but what 's scary is that we can make new species .
we already can make new species , and we 're doing it .
but the really scary thing is we can make new diseases .
we already have that capacity .
why has not some country made a disgusting new disease and unleashed it on everybody else ?
they 're afraid of the blow-back .
there 's no way of doing that without the possibility that your country will get it too , with things being so very spreadable . -lrb- … -rrb- what a lot of people do n't know is that your first publication was actually a book of poems . yes , but it was n't the first thing i wrote .
i was actually writing the prose and the poems at the same time .
it was just that in those days , in canada , where it what almost impossible to publish a full-length novel , poems were a lot cheaper , they were shorter .
and typically you started out writing them off on a mimeo machine or putting together a little cold type book or hand-setting them , which is what i did with my first little booklet of poems - i hand-set them on a flatbed press .
try hand-setting a novel on a flatbed press ! -lrb- … -rrb- would i be right in assuming that margaret atwood is an optimist ? anyone who writes a book is an optimist .

in other words , he was very experienced in what we call " the bush . " -lrb- ... -rrb- i would be very scared if this latest book of yours is a prophesy about the future . first of all , it 's not a prophesy because i do n't do prophesies ; no one can really predict the future .
even the old testament prophets were n't predicting the future , they were more or less saying this is the state of your soul now .
you ca n't really write about the future because nobody has been there .
it 's like dante writing about the inferno .
i hate to break this to you , but he did not actually go down into hell . -lrb- … -rrb- are you an optimist about the future ?
this book tells us about environmental devastation , which we hear about every day in the news . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dante never actually went to hell , quipped atwood it 's not actually about that so much .
the truth is , if you remove the people , nature comes back quite well , which is where we are when the book opens .
there 's quite a lot of nature .
it 's not that all of nature gets destroyed . -lrb- … -rrb- as william gibson says , the future is already here , but it 's unevenly distributed .
some people say global warming , but really they should say climate change because the weather gets more extreme .
things change .
it 's not that everything goes away , but things change .
and if they change too abruptly , what you get is a lot of die-off . what 's really scary in this book is not that so much , although that 's a motivator , but what 's scary is that we can make new species .
we already can make new species , and we 're doing it .
but the really scary thing is we can make new diseases .
we already have that capacity .
why has not some country made a disgusting new disease and unleashed it on everybody else ?
they 're afraid of the blow-back .
there 's no way of doing that without the possibility that your country will get it too , with things being so very spreadable . -lrb- … -rrb- what a lot of people do n't know is that your first publication was actually a book of poems . yes , but it was n't the first thing i wrote .
i was actually writing the prose and the poems at the same time .
it was just that in those days , in canada , where it what almost impossible to publish a full-length novel , poems were a lot cheaper , they were shorter .
and typically you started out writing them off on a mimeo machine or putting together a little cold type book or hand-setting them , which is what i did with my first little booklet of poems - i hand-set them on a flatbed press .
try hand-setting a novel on a flatbed press ! -lrb- … -rrb- would i be right in assuming that margaret atwood is an optimist ? anyone who writes a book is an optimist .

" the year of the flood " is a futuristic account of the aftermath of a major natural disaster that seems to have obliterated most of humankind .
adam one - the leader of a religious group that melds science , religion and nature - had predicted such an event .
after it happens , he and his followers regroup in a world that is altered and unpredictable . born in 1939 , atwood has published short stories , critical studies , screenplays , books for children , and poems , but is best known for her novels .
her work has been translated into over 30 languages . click on the audio link below to listen to the complete interview with margaret atwood . deutsche welle : you lived in germany in the 1980s .
what did you experience during that time ? margaret atwood : i came to germany for the very first time for my german publisher in the 70s .
then , as it turned out , in 1984 , i began " the handmaid 's tale " in berlin before the wall came down .
i began it in berlin , i finished it in tuscaloosa , alabama , which is quite a contrast .
but both of them were situations that had built-in stresses , because west berlin at that time of course was encircled by the wall and every sunday the east german air force flew over and made sonic booms , just to remind us that they were there . -lrb- … -rrb- now in germany you 're presenting your new book " the year of the flood .

" we are not disappointed , we are shocked at what happened , " said ekmeleddin ihsanoglu , the turkish head of the organization of the islamic conference -lrb- oic -rrb- , which had convened sunday 's donor conference .
the organizers raised $ 841 million -lrb- 622 million euros -rrb- for infrastructure projects for displaced people in darfur in western sudan - less than half the targeted amount of $ 2 billion .
egyptian foreign minister ahmed abul gheit told the closing session that the countries which made pledges included algeria , australia , brazil , morocco , qatar , and turkey .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : organizers hoped to raise $ 2 billion ahead of the international donor conference several western countries opted to keep their hands in their pockets , citing security concerns in sudan .
" in the absence of proper conditions on the ground , our focus remains on humanitarian assistance , " a norwegian delegate said , echoing the view of many of the western diplomats in attendance .
" our presence here constitutes a political message , " one unnamed western diplomat told news agency afp , adding that his country would not donate money because of " the uncertainty of how the money will be used or channelled . "
the timing of the conference may have been especially poor , coming as it did just three weeks before sudan is due to hold its first multi-party elections since 1986 .
the country 's veteran leader , president omar hassan al-bashir , who was indicted by the international criminal court -lrb- icc -rrb- last year for war crimes and crimes against humanity during sudan 's seven-year rebellion in darfur , is seeking reelection .
many sudan experts doubt the country 's readiness for a democratic election process .
just the organization and sheer number of ballots involved represent a significant logistical hurdle , said sara pantuliano , a research fellow at the london-based overseas development institute .
" mock elections were held at the university of khartoum , and it took a university graduate an average of 23 minutes to fill out all the ballots , " she told deutsche welle . " and in mock elections held by an ngo in the south , it took illiterate women an average of three hours to fill out the ballots .
so even if the election was free and fair , there will be such a degree of confusion that even in the best of scenarios , there will still be results that will not reflect the wishes of the population . "
given the momentous challenge , she said she was not surprised that the donor conference in cairo failed to muster its target sum .
" the election is an important landmark , and we 've seen a similar holding back for southern sudan , amid discussions of reallocating funding for the south , so there is a wait-and-see attitude at the moment which applies to the whole country , " pantuliano said .
political rift ahead of elections political tensions ahead of the election are high as bashir has for the first time faced calls from senior government members to surrender to the icc .
on saturday , the head of intelligence for the sudan people 's liberation movement -lrb- splm -rrb- , edward lino , told reuters that bashir has no option but to respond to the icc .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sudanese president omar al bashir said the icc warrant against him has increased his popularity " there are many dignitaries who were taken and he is not an exception .
for the good of the country , bashir should take leave and go to the hague , " lino said .
the splm 's presidential candidate , yasir arman , has also challenged bashir to withdraw from the poll in order to encourage southerners to vote for unity in the south 's self-determination referendum , which must be held before january 9 , 2011 .
according to the brussels-based international crisis group -lrb- icg -rrb- , efforts to resolve both the country 's ongoing north-south civil war and the conflict in darfur have been hampered by the intransigence of bashir 's national congress party -lrb- ncp -rrb- .
the comments from lino and arman over the weekend serve as further proof of the rift that has developed between the ncp and the splm , who signed a 2005 peace deal with bashir , joining him as junior coalition partners .
until now , the splm had been careful to steer clear of the sensitive issue of the icc , hoping to preserve their partnership until the referendum .
international efforts needed to secure peace now , the icg says both of sudan 's major conflicts could boil over again unless the april 11 election and the southern referendum lead to democratic transformation .
and , in a recent assessment of the situation in sudan , the group added that the international community has a responsibility to act .
" unless the international community , notably the us , the un , the african union -lrb- au -rrb- peace and security council , and the horn of africa inter-government authority on development -lrb- igad -rrb- , cooperate to support both comprehensive peace agreement implementation and vital additional negotiations , a return to north-south war and escalation of conflict in darfur are likely , " the icg concluded .
pantuliano of the overseas development institute agrees that there is a risk of more intense conflict following next month 's election .
" the result of the elections will almost inevitably create local tensions , and these have a risk of escalating , and having national consequences ; that is the most tangible danger , " she told deutsche welle .

" we are not disappointed , we are shocked at what happened , " said ekmeleddin ihsanoglu , the turkish head of the organization of the islamic conference -lrb- oic -rrb- , which had convened sunday 's donor conference .
the organizers raised $ 841 million -lrb- 622 million euros -rrb- for infrastructure projects for displaced people in darfur in western sudan - less than half the targeted amount of $ 2 billion .
egyptian foreign minister ahmed abul gheit told the closing session that the countries which made pledges included algeria , australia , brazil , morocco , qatar , and turkey .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : organizers hoped to raise $ 2 billion ahead of the international donor conference several western countries opted to keep their hands in their pockets , citing security concerns in sudan .
" in the absence of proper conditions on the ground , our focus remains on humanitarian assistance , " a norwegian delegate said , echoing the view of many of the western diplomats in attendance .
" our presence here constitutes a political message , " one unnamed western diplomat told news agency afp , adding that his country would not donate money because of " the uncertainty of how the money will be used or channelled . "
the timing of the conference may have been especially poor , coming as it did just three weeks before sudan is due to hold its first multi-party elections since 1986 .
the country 's veteran leader , president omar hassan al-bashir , who was indicted by the international criminal court -lrb- icc -rrb- last year for war crimes and crimes against humanity during sudan 's seven-year rebellion in darfur , is seeking reelection .
many sudan experts doubt the country 's readiness for a democratic election process .
just the organization and sheer number of ballots involved represent a significant logistical hurdle , said sara pantuliano , a research fellow at the london-based overseas development institute .
" mock elections were held at the university of khartoum , and it took a university graduate an average of 23 minutes to fill out all the ballots , " she told deutsche welle . " and in mock elections held by an ngo in the south , it took illiterate women an average of three hours to fill out the ballots .
so even if the election was free and fair , there will be such a degree of confusion that even in the best of scenarios , there will still be results that will not reflect the wishes of the population . "
given the momentous challenge , she said she was not surprised that the donor conference in cairo failed to muster its target sum .
" the election is an important landmark , and we 've seen a similar holding back for southern sudan , amid discussions of reallocating funding for the south , so there is a wait-and-see attitude at the moment which applies to the whole country , " pantuliano said .
political rift ahead of elections political tensions ahead of the election are high as bashir has for the first time faced calls from senior government members to surrender to the icc .
on saturday , the head of intelligence for the sudan people 's liberation movement -lrb- splm -rrb- , edward lino , told reuters that bashir has no option but to respond to the icc .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sudanese president omar al bashir said the icc warrant against him has increased his popularity " there are many dignitaries who were taken and he is not an exception .
for the good of the country , bashir should take leave and go to the hague , " lino said .
the splm 's presidential candidate , yasir arman , has also challenged bashir to withdraw from the poll in order to encourage southerners to vote for unity in the south 's self-determination referendum , which must be held before january 9 , 2011 .
according to the brussels-based international crisis group -lrb- icg -rrb- , efforts to resolve both the country 's ongoing north-south civil war and the conflict in darfur have been hampered by the intransigence of bashir 's national congress party -lrb- ncp -rrb- .
the comments from lino and arman over the weekend serve as further proof of the rift that has developed between the ncp and the splm , who signed a 2005 peace deal with bashir , joining him as junior coalition partners .
until now , the splm had been careful to steer clear of the sensitive issue of the icc , hoping to preserve their partnership until the referendum .
international efforts needed to secure peace now , the icg says both of sudan 's major conflicts could boil over again unless the april 11 election and the southern referendum lead to democratic transformation .
and , in a recent assessment of the situation in sudan , the group added that the international community has a responsibility to act .
" unless the international community , notably the us , the un , the african union -lrb- au -rrb- peace and security council , and the horn of africa inter-government authority on development -lrb- igad -rrb- , cooperate to support both comprehensive peace agreement implementation and vital additional negotiations , a return to north-south war and escalation of conflict in darfur are likely , " the icg concluded .
pantuliano of the overseas development institute agrees that there is a risk of more intense conflict following next month 's election .
" the result of the elections will almost inevitably create local tensions , and these have a risk of escalating , and having national consequences ; that is the most tangible danger , " she told deutsche welle .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de diplomacy -pipe- 23.03.2010 britain expels israeli diplomat over forged passport row großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : miliband spoke to parliament on tuesday britain has expelled an unnamed israeli diplomat for israel 's supposed forgery of 12 british passports in the murder of a hamas official in january .
france has also opened an investigation into forged french passports . speaking to parliament on tuesday , british foreign secretary david miliband said there were " compelling reasons " to believe that the israeli intelligence agency mossad was behind the killing of mahmoud al-mabhouh in dubai on january 19 , and that israel 's position as a close ally to the uk added " insult to injury . "
" the government takes this matter extremely seriously , " he said .
" such misuse of british passports is intolerable . "
israel 's ambassador to london , ron prosor , said israel was " disappointed by the decision of the british government , " but his country remained committed to a relationship " of mutual importance . "
the expelled diplomat was not named by either country , although it was believed to be a member of the israeli embassy .
hamas leaders praised the uk 's actions and said they hoped israeli officials would eventually be brought to court over the killing .
ministry investigation britain 's foreign ministry briefed prosor on monday over the findings of an investigation into the passport forgeries .
miliband said 12 british citizens had their passports copied " when handed over for inspection to individuals linked to israel , " and that they were " wholly innocent victims of identity theft . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dubai authorities have 27 suspects in the murder investigation " given that this was a very sophisticated operation in which high-quality forgeries were made , the government judges it is highly likely that the forgeries were made by a state intelligence service , " he said .
miliband met israeli foreign minister avigdor lieberman in brussels on monday to discuss the issue , and said he asked for israel 's pledge that it would " never be party to the misuse of british passports in such a way . "
france probe meanwhile a paris prosecutor said tuesday that french authorities have opened their own investigation into forged french passports , four of which were also used in the hamas murder .
france began a preliminary investigation on march 12 .

france has also opened an investigation into forged french passports . speaking to parliament on tuesday , british foreign secretary david miliband said there were " compelling reasons " to believe that the israeli intelligence agency mossad was behind the killing of mahmoud al-mabhouh in dubai on january 19 , and that israel 's position as a close ally to the uk added " insult to injury . "
" the government takes this matter extremely seriously , " he said .
" such misuse of british passports is intolerable . "
israel 's ambassador to london , ron prosor , said israel was " disappointed by the decision of the british government , " but his country remained committed to a relationship " of mutual importance . "
the expelled diplomat was not named by either country , although it was believed to be a member of the israeli embassy .
hamas leaders praised the uk 's actions and said they hoped israeli officials would eventually be brought to court over the killing .
ministry investigation britain 's foreign ministry briefed prosor on monday over the findings of an investigation into the passport forgeries .
miliband said 12 british citizens had their passports copied " when handed over for inspection to individuals linked to israel , " and that they were " wholly innocent victims of identity theft . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dubai authorities have 27 suspects in the murder investigation " given that this was a very sophisticated operation in which high-quality forgeries were made , the government judges it is highly likely that the forgeries were made by a state intelligence service , " he said .
miliband met israeli foreign minister avigdor lieberman in brussels on monday to discuss the issue , and said he asked for israel 's pledge that it would " never be party to the misuse of british passports in such a way . "
france probe meanwhile a paris prosecutor said tuesday that french authorities have opened their own investigation into forged french passports , four of which were also used in the hamas murder .
france began a preliminary investigation on march 12 .
the french passports were “ either delivered with a false identity or falsified with a photograph that did not correspond to the identity indicated , ” the prosecutor said in a statement .
president nicolas sarkozy has condemned al-mabhouh ’ s killing , but has not directly implied that the israeli secret service carried out the assassination .
israel has neither confirmed nor denied the allegations of mossad ’ s involvement , maintaining a strict policy of ambiguity with such sensitive matters .

in an interview on deutschlandfunk national radio westerwelle said , " germany is convinced that the settlement program must be frozen .
this is not just germany 's stance , but of the european union and the entire international community . "
he also stated that a two-state solution for israelis and palestinians is advocated not only by germany , but also by the rest of the eu and the united states .
" we want a two-state solution , " said westerwelle .
" a two-state solution is the only solution that can truly bring peace . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : goerzig says engaging hamas could be good leverage with israel when asked about an appropriate time for the eu to increase its pressure on israel , westerwelle said it would be best to first see what results come from last week 's middle east quartet talks in moscow between the eu , the us , russia , and the united nations .
increasing the pressure eu foreign ministers universally condemned israeli policies at a meeting on monday in brussels , but remained at odds on how to put more pressure on the country .
the eu is israel 's largest trading partner , and the bloc has so far declined to impose trade sanctions .
but carolin goerzig , an analyst at the european union institute for security studies in paris , told deutsche welle that if the eu wants to increase its leverage on israel in order to stop the building of further settlements , the bloc should engage greater discussion with hamas .
" so far the little pressure that has been exerted on israel has not proven fruitful really , and at the same time going to the other extreme could also backfire , " said goerzig .
" so what could really pressure israel is a moderation of hamas , because then israel would have to show face and react . "
goerzig added that the conditions set out by the quartet for a palestinian government , which include the renunciation of violence , the recognition of israel 's right to exist , and a commitment to all agreements signed by the palestine liberation organization and israel , do not encourage hamas to come to the negotiating table .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu has been looking to increase its international presence " i 'm not saying we should recognize hamas as a negotiation partner right away , but it has never been stated what they would gain from agreeing to these quartet conditions , " said goerzig .
" hamas has shown some steps of moderation , but the eu has never reacted positively , so hamas always stands to lose without any benefits if it becomes more moderate . " testing eu foreign policy ?
the issue of israeli settlements is in some ways testing the eu 's - and germany 's - international role . but goerzig says the eu 's presence in the quartet was not as strong as it could have been .
" the eu has been shy about asserting itself in the quartet , which could be related to its lack of coherence , " said goerzig .
" there is a need for debate on this issue in the eu , and i think germany could drive such a debate . "
the eu foreign policy chief catherine ashton said recently she will push for the launch of " proximity " talks between the israelis and the palestinians as a prologue to formal negotiations .

in an interview on deutschlandfunk national radio westerwelle said , " germany is convinced that the settlement program must be frozen .
this is not just germany 's stance , but of the european union and the entire international community . "
he also stated that a two-state solution for israelis and palestinians is advocated not only by germany , but also by the rest of the eu and the united states .
" we want a two-state solution , " said westerwelle .
" a two-state solution is the only solution that can truly bring peace . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : goerzig says engaging hamas could be good leverage with israel when asked about an appropriate time for the eu to increase its pressure on israel , westerwelle said it would be best to first see what results come from last week 's middle east quartet talks in moscow between the eu , the us , russia , and the united nations .
increasing the pressure eu foreign ministers universally condemned israeli policies at a meeting on monday in brussels , but remained at odds on how to put more pressure on the country .
the eu is israel 's largest trading partner , and the bloc has so far declined to impose trade sanctions .
but carolin goerzig , an analyst at the european union institute for security studies in paris , told deutsche welle that if the eu wants to increase its leverage on israel in order to stop the building of further settlements , the bloc should engage greater discussion with hamas .
" so far the little pressure that has been exerted on israel has not proven fruitful really , and at the same time going to the other extreme could also backfire , " said goerzig .
" so what could really pressure israel is a moderation of hamas , because then israel would have to show face and react . "
goerzig added that the conditions set out by the quartet for a palestinian government , which include the renunciation of violence , the recognition of israel 's right to exist , and a commitment to all agreements signed by the palestine liberation organization and israel , do not encourage hamas to come to the negotiating table .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu has been looking to increase its international presence " i 'm not saying we should recognize hamas as a negotiation partner right away , but it has never been stated what they would gain from agreeing to these quartet conditions , " said goerzig .
" hamas has shown some steps of moderation , but the eu has never reacted positively , so hamas always stands to lose without any benefits if it becomes more moderate . " testing eu foreign policy ?
the issue of israeli settlements is in some ways testing the eu 's - and germany 's - international role . but goerzig says the eu 's presence in the quartet was not as strong as it could have been .
" the eu has been shy about asserting itself in the quartet , which could be related to its lack of coherence , " said goerzig .
" there is a need for debate on this issue in the eu , and i think germany could drive such a debate . "
the eu foreign policy chief catherine ashton said recently she will push for the launch of " proximity " talks between the israelis and the palestinians as a prologue to formal negotiations .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de world war ii -pipe- 23.03.2010 french children of wehrmacht soldiers seek german nationality großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of german soldiers fathered children in occupied france their mothers were french , their fathers were german soldiers in nazi-occupied france .
some 200,000 children endured scorn and often hid their father 's identity .
now some have begun applying for german citizenship . more than 200,000 children fathered by german soldiers were raised by their french mothers after the nazi occupation of france during world war ii , according to paris historian fabrice vergili .
the author of the book " naitre ennemi " -lrb- born an enemy -rrb- also estimates that 20,000 french women were hounded through streets and brutally given short haircuts by their french compatriots , who accused them of " horizontal collaboration " with the nazis .
many of these " war children " grew up not knowing their full identities and ashamed of their german roots , until recently .
since 2009 dozens have sought and obtained german nationality without having to relinquish their french citizenship , as is generally required of resident foreigners under german law .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mijo panier spent decades looking for her father mijo panier , fathered by a wehrmacht soldier and born in 1943 , recently applied for german citizenship .
" i am proud to be german and french , proud of my dual nationality .
i will use one and then the other , " she said .
the liaison that started with a sneeze powder prank not until she turned 16 did panier learn that her father had been german .
her french step-father , who accepted her as his own child , forbade her to talk about her origins .
her biological parents met in a paris cafe during the four-year occupation .
" my mother went into a cafe where young french and germans met one another , but as groups kept apart , " panier said . " my mother and her friend scattered sneeze powder under the chairs of the german soldiers . "
her father was amused and moved over to sit with the girls at their table .
that was the start of a forbidden liaison .
after a search that lasted for decades , she found her father , willi welsch , five years ago with the assistance of a berlin-based organization . welsch and his daughter mijo exchanged letters before finally meeting near frankfurt .
tender encounter near frankfurt welsch was seriously ill and had been in hospital .
" to me he was unbelievably nice .
he had blue eyes and despite his illness he drew me into the train .
i sat down next to him and there we remained silent for a long time .
then we exchanged a few words in english , german and french . "
with tears in her eyes , panier adds , " it was as though i had found my second half . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : societies of war children have been formed in france welsch died a few months later , but since then panier has fostered intense contacts with her recently-discovered family in germany .
there is a photo of her paternal sister in her french living room .
months ago she sent a letter to the german embassy - in german .
" i was a child of shame .
in the end , however , i am a child of love , " she wrote .
although panier now speaks openly about her father 's origins her mother still does not want to talk about it .
shrugging off shame prompts search for family roots the urge to free themselves from shame motivates many of france 's " war children " to apply officially for their german nationality .
the surge began after a broadcast on french television in 2003 .
many former war children then contacted the paris historian virgili and went on to set up groups such as the national friendship association for war children to help each other to trace their roots .
their wartime experiences soon became a talking point in france .
hewige roberval sent her application to the german embassy shortly before her marriage .
" not long before my wedding i told my fiance about my father .
i was really scared that he might no longer want to marry me .
fortunately , he only laughed about it . "
panier says that if her application for german citzenship is granted , she plans to officially adopt her deceased father 's family name .
it is already on her letter box .

some 200,000 children endured scorn and often hid their father 's identity .
now some have begun applying for german citizenship . more than 200,000 children fathered by german soldiers were raised by their french mothers after the nazi occupation of france during world war ii , according to paris historian fabrice vergili .
the author of the book " naitre ennemi " -lrb- born an enemy -rrb- also estimates that 20,000 french women were hounded through streets and brutally given short haircuts by their french compatriots , who accused them of " horizontal collaboration " with the nazis .
many of these " war children " grew up not knowing their full identities and ashamed of their german roots , until recently .
since 2009 dozens have sought and obtained german nationality without having to relinquish their french citizenship , as is generally required of resident foreigners under german law .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mijo panier spent decades looking for her father mijo panier , fathered by a wehrmacht soldier and born in 1943 , recently applied for german citizenship .
" i am proud to be german and french , proud of my dual nationality .
i will use one and then the other , " she said .
the liaison that started with a sneeze powder prank not until she turned 16 did panier learn that her father had been german .
her french step-father , who accepted her as his own child , forbade her to talk about her origins .
her biological parents met in a paris cafe during the four-year occupation .
" my mother went into a cafe where young french and germans met one another , but as groups kept apart , " panier said . " my mother and her friend scattered sneeze powder under the chairs of the german soldiers . "
her father was amused and moved over to sit with the girls at their table .
that was the start of a forbidden liaison .
after a search that lasted for decades , she found her father , willi welsch , five years ago with the assistance of a berlin-based organization . welsch and his daughter mijo exchanged letters before finally meeting near frankfurt .
tender encounter near frankfurt welsch was seriously ill and had been in hospital .
" to me he was unbelievably nice .
he had blue eyes and despite his illness he drew me into the train .
i sat down next to him and there we remained silent for a long time .
then we exchanged a few words in english , german and french . "
with tears in her eyes , panier adds , " it was as though i had found my second half . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : societies of war children have been formed in france welsch died a few months later , but since then panier has fostered intense contacts with her recently-discovered family in germany .
there is a photo of her paternal sister in her french living room .
months ago she sent a letter to the german embassy - in german .
" i was a child of shame .
in the end , however , i am a child of love , " she wrote .
although panier now speaks openly about her father 's origins her mother still does not want to talk about it .
shrugging off shame prompts search for family roots the urge to free themselves from shame motivates many of france 's " war children " to apply officially for their german nationality .
the surge began after a broadcast on french television in 2003 .
many former war children then contacted the paris historian virgili and went on to set up groups such as the national friendship association for war children to help each other to trace their roots .
their wartime experiences soon became a talking point in france .
hewige roberval sent her application to the german embassy shortly before her marriage .
" not long before my wedding i told my fiance about my father .
i was really scared that he might no longer want to marry me .
fortunately , he only laughed about it . "
panier says that if her application for german citzenship is granted , she plans to officially adopt her deceased father 's family name .
it is already on her letter box .

human rights watchdog amnesty international said in a statement that they were executed last week . amnesty international has condemned the execution of two prisoners in belarus and has urged president alexander lukashenko to impose a moratorium on the death penalty .
the group 's belarus expert heather mcgill told deutsche welle on tuesday that the organization had been campaigning on behalf of the prisoners since june 2009 .
" we are very disappointed that the belarus government has seen fit to actually carry out these executions , " she said .
mcgill said no executions were reported in the former soviet republic in 2009 , and that there had been signs of progress .
" there have been moves toward changing legislation , introducing life imprisonment as an alternative to the death penalty and reducing the number of crimes punished by the death penalty , " she said .
" those are all positive signs , but in the end , if they are still shooting people , those other changes do n't count very much . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lukashenko has come under pressure to ban the death penalty executed without meeting their families mcgill said that zhuk 's mother came to visit her son on friday , but was turned back at the gate by guards who said both men had been moved , and she should wait for notification from the court .
the mother returned on monday only to be informed by a prison guard that both men , who had shared the same cell , had been shot .
there has recently been a lot of pressure on belarus to abolish the death sentence , mcgill said .
the council of europe has offered to reinstate belarus ' special guest status if it places a moratorium on the death penalty as a step towards the complete abolition of capital punishment .
the previous status was withdrawn in 1997 after minsk was seen as having fallen short in advancing democracy and human rights .
" possibly , they wanted to get these men out of the way in order to clear the field to declare a moratorium , " mcgill suspected .
she believes this happened in ukraine when that country joined the council of europe , which oversees human rights standards in its 47 member states .

the decision brings croatia one step closer to its goal of eu membership . the slovenian constitutional court on tuesday ruled as constitutional a deal to negotiate an end to the nearly 19-year-old border dispute with croatia , raising the likelihood of zagreb 's european union accession by its goal of 2012 .
the slovenian parliament must still ratify the agreement , which croatia did last november .
speaking to reporters after the decision , slovenian prime minister borut pahor said he was " very pleased . "
he also suggested the ruling center-left coalition government may not seek a public referendum on the issue as it had previously planned .

this domestic victory could also help the administration make progress in the foreign policy arena . it does n't happen very often that germany 's political leadership celebrates the passage of a purely domestic bill by us congress .
but that was the case when h. r. 4872 was cleared by the house of representatives last weekend , even though the health care and education affordability reconciliation act of 2010 has nothing to do with transatlantic relations , international trade , climate change or security policy . the day after the vote , german chancellor angela merkel congratulated president obama for passing a central reform project of his presidency .
and germany 's foreign minister and vice-chancellor guido westerwelle said he expected that this success would provide a boost to the president 's foreign policy agenda .
the fact that both the german chancellor and foreign minister praised the passage of domestic legislative measure in congress underscores that the symbolic importance of this health care vote transcends national politics .
" the admiration for an american president who reached this worldwide accepted goal will increase because everybody knows that starting with president kennedy several american presidents tried to realize that goal and now obama has achieved this big success , " werner weidenfeld , who served for 12 years as the german government 's coordinator of transatlantic relations and now heads the center for applied policy research at the university of munich , told deutsche welle .
crucial vote the passage of the health care bill has gained particular importance because obama had proclaimed it as one of the main goals for his presidency , but failed to get it through congress during his first year in office .
what 's more , since the president could n't point to any other major successes following his inauguration , the health care vote had morphed from a mere legislative procedure into a make-or-break-situation for the obama presidency . bildunterschrift : health care reform is a highly contentious issue in the us after this domestic power battle , his political counterparts everywhere will realize that he is not just a president who announces initiatives , but one that can also follow through with it , said weidenfeld .
" he had to survive months of political fights and in the end he was victorious . "
this , added weidenfeld , will not go unnoticed on the international stage : " not that overnight now all his challenges will vanish , but professional observers , top politicians everywhere around the world will immediately realize ' do n't underestimate the capacity of this president . " '
while christian tuschhoff , professor for international relations at johannes gutenberg university mainz , does n't think the health care vote will have a direct effect on us foreign policy , he believes that the passage of the bill presents a good opportunity for obama .
" he has achieved the first step and will be able to build momentum if he can add a couple of successes to the one that happened last weekend .
if that scenario becomes true a lot of things will simply fall in place , " tuschhoff told deutsche welle .
arms reduction in the foreign policy realm , the experts believe that the disarmament issue would be a suitable next step for obama to build on his domestic success .
the successor to the start nuclear arms reduction treaty with russia is long overdue and could be unveiled in the coming weeks to coincide with a major global nuclear disarmament conference obama will convene next month in washington .
an agreement by the us and russia , the world 's main nuclear powers , to slash their arsenals would increase the leverage for obama to convince other nations to reduce their nuclear weapons stockpile .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us and russia still have n't agreed on a successor to the start treaty weidenfeld says that obama can now claim that he tackled a huge health care reform with historic implications when nobody thought he could get it done .
" in international politics the nuclear weapons challenge is of a similar dimension , so let 's tackle that too , " is how obama might approach this issue , according to weidenfeld .
but while the successful passage of the health care bill may increase his international stature and leverage it does n't guarantee that most of obama 's stalled foreign policy initiatives will fare any better now .
that 's because of a major difference between domestic and foreign policy : in domestic policy , the us government is the main actor , in international affairs , washington is a major , but never the only actor as is exemplified by the middle east conflict .
" if anything the israeli-palestinian conflict is more difficult than the health care issue , simply because obama can put pressure on both sides , but he can not act on behalf of them , " said tuschhoff .
whether the boost that obama stands to gain from the health care passage will last depends on whether he can replicate that achievement , say the experts .

this domestic victory could also help the administration make progress in the foreign policy arena . it does n't happen very often that germany 's political leadership celebrates the passage of a purely domestic bill by us congress .
but that was the case when h. r. 4872 was cleared by the house of representatives last weekend , even though the health care and education affordability reconciliation act of 2010 has nothing to do with transatlantic relations , international trade , climate change or security policy . the day after the vote , german chancellor angela merkel congratulated president obama for passing a central reform project of his presidency .
and germany 's foreign minister and vice-chancellor guido westerwelle said he expected that this success would provide a boost to the president 's foreign policy agenda .
the fact that both the german chancellor and foreign minister praised the passage of domestic legislative measure in congress underscores that the symbolic importance of this health care vote transcends national politics .
" the admiration for an american president who reached this worldwide accepted goal will increase because everybody knows that starting with president kennedy several american presidents tried to realize that goal and now obama has achieved this big success , " werner weidenfeld , who served for 12 years as the german government 's coordinator of transatlantic relations and now heads the center for applied policy research at the university of munich , told deutsche welle .
crucial vote the passage of the health care bill has gained particular importance because obama had proclaimed it as one of the main goals for his presidency , but failed to get it through congress during his first year in office .
what 's more , since the president could n't point to any other major successes following his inauguration , the health care vote had morphed from a mere legislative procedure into a make-or-break-situation for the obama presidency . bildunterschrift : health care reform is a highly contentious issue in the us after this domestic power battle , his political counterparts everywhere will realize that he is not just a president who announces initiatives , but one that can also follow through with it , said weidenfeld .
" he had to survive months of political fights and in the end he was victorious . "
this , added weidenfeld , will not go unnoticed on the international stage : " not that overnight now all his challenges will vanish , but professional observers , top politicians everywhere around the world will immediately realize ' do n't underestimate the capacity of this president . " '
while christian tuschhoff , professor for international relations at johannes gutenberg university mainz , does n't think the health care vote will have a direct effect on us foreign policy , he believes that the passage of the bill presents a good opportunity for obama .
" he has achieved the first step and will be able to build momentum if he can add a couple of successes to the one that happened last weekend .
if that scenario becomes true a lot of things will simply fall in place , " tuschhoff told deutsche welle .
arms reduction in the foreign policy realm , the experts believe that the disarmament issue would be a suitable next step for obama to build on his domestic success .
the successor to the start nuclear arms reduction treaty with russia is long overdue and could be unveiled in the coming weeks to coincide with a major global nuclear disarmament conference obama will convene next month in washington .
an agreement by the us and russia , the world 's main nuclear powers , to slash their arsenals would increase the leverage for obama to convince other nations to reduce their nuclear weapons stockpile .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us and russia still have n't agreed on a successor to the start treaty weidenfeld says that obama can now claim that he tackled a huge health care reform with historic implications when nobody thought he could get it done .
" in international politics the nuclear weapons challenge is of a similar dimension , so let 's tackle that too , " is how obama might approach this issue , according to weidenfeld .
but while the successful passage of the health care bill may increase his international stature and leverage it does n't guarantee that most of obama 's stalled foreign policy initiatives will fare any better now .
that 's because of a major difference between domestic and foreign policy : in domestic policy , the us government is the main actor , in international affairs , washington is a major , but never the only actor as is exemplified by the middle east conflict .
" if anything the israeli-palestinian conflict is more difficult than the health care issue , simply because obama can put pressure on both sides , but he can not act on behalf of them , " said tuschhoff .
whether the boost that obama stands to gain from the health care passage will last depends on whether he can replicate that achievement , say the experts .

businesses operating in markets such as energy generation , environmental technology , security services as well as the space and aviation industry were the focus of the government program , bruederle said at a news conference in berlin .
" the global economy is expected to grow by 6 percent this year , and we want to profit from this growth , " he said , adding that countries such as china , india and brazil were leading the world economy out of the current slump .
silver lining the government 's export program comes after the steepest decline in german exports in more than half a century .
the global economic crisis caused german exports to fall by a staggering 18 percent last year to 803 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.1 trillion -rrb- , after a record in 2008 of about 947 billion euros . this means that germany lost its position as the world 's leading export nation to china last year .
bildunterschrift : solar companies stand to profit from the measures a slow recovery of german exports in the second half of 2009 could now come to a halt as the stimulus packages introduced by governments worldwide run out .
" the upswing is fragile and not yet self-sustaining , " bruederle argued as he outlined his program .
set of instruments key elements of the new plan are government loan guarantees for export deals , as well as state funding for companies seeking to explore new markets .
for that the government plans to open new chambers of commerce and trade in azerbaijan , ghana , iraq , kenya and libya .
bruederle plans to sign bilateral free trade agreements with countries in asia and latin america intended to open up markets there for german exports .
he also wants to reduce bureaucracy in his ministry so that funding could be provided more easily and quickly .

since then the country has made good progress , but what will the next two decades bring ?
experts say the outlook is positive . it was perhaps somewhat symbolic that namibia 's celebrations on sunday , march 21 , coincided with the swearing-in of its reelected president hifikepunye pohamba .
for 20 years , the southern african nation has been one of the most stable democracies on the continent .
unlike other african countries , perhaps most notably nearby zimbabwe , politics is not a main problem for namibia .
the challenges , say experts , lie elsewhere .
" the problems are the same ones as 20 years ago - providing work , food and places to live for the country 's two to three million inhabitants , " says publisher michael iwanowski , who wrote the first-ever german travel guide to namibia and led a number of official german delegations through the country .
" there 's no industry , and most people live from mining , tourism and subsistence farming .
but the elections were free and fair , and the government works well with the people . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : namibia is a country of stark , and often uninhabited , beauty namibia is the second-least densely populated country in the world , and has a nominal per capita gdp of only 3,178 euros -lrb- $ 4,278 -rrb- annually .
" the reason so few people live there is that there 's so little water , " says andre suren , a journalist for dw-tv , who was born in namibia and recently returned from filming a report there .
" provision of water is one problem , as are unemployment and poverty , which the government has made its top priority .
there also needs to be further reconciliation between tribes and between blacks and whites .
but the country has found its form of democracy . "
these are the sorts of issues that many african countries face .
but namibia is anything but a typical african nation in either its population or its history .
german south-west africa bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this plaque commemorates namibian victims of german colonial rule in the waning decades of the 19th century , namibia was one of the few places that germany , a belated colonial starter , was able to gain a foothold .
the territory officially became a colony in 1884 and was known as german south-west africa .
but germany 's rule there was hardly happy .
from 1904 to 1907 , the herero and nama tribes rebelled against their colonial master , and in the resultant fighting some 65,000 hereros , about 80 percent of the population , were killed .
in the course of world war i , south africa , which was controlled by britain , occupied namibia thanks to a league of nations mandate .
in 1946 , south africa refused to surrender that mandate even though it had been superseded by a united nations trusteeship agreement .
in 1966 , the south-west africa people 's organization , swapo , led a fight for independence , with heavy participation from the owambo tribe , which today makes up the majority of namibia 's population .
but it took until 1988 for south africa to agree to give up control over the country .
namibia officially gained sovereignty in 1990 , making it africa 's youngest country .
uranium and tourists bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : conditions in namibian townships are simple , but not inhuman namibia may be young and sparsely populated , but experts say those attributes help make its future prospects bright .
" namibia could profit from natural resources like copper and uranium , as those commodities get scarcer , " iwanowski told deutsche welle .
" but the big industry is tourism .
at least one third of the country is a nature reservation with deserts , savannahs and national parks , and most parts of the country are virtually uninhabited .
tourism has grown by 15 to 18 percent annually , and though those numbers are down a bit due to the global financial crisis , it 's still booming . "
probably among namibia 's most famous attractions are the namib and kalahari deserts , and the country needs to be careful about preserving its natural beauty .
" tourism accounts for some 70 percent of namibia 's economy , " says suren .
" that 's because the country is quite safe and easy to get to and get around in .
but namibians need to watch out for crime and environmental destruction . "
uranium mines have often been blamed for contaminating surrounding areas and putting aboriginal peoples at risk .
namibia 's natural resources have attracted the attention of a number of the world 's larger countries , who may put profits ahead of building up namibia 's own economy or preserving its environment .
china , which is very active throughout africa , has come under particular criticism for exploiting namibia 's natural wealth while polluting the land and failing to give back anything to the namibian people .
coming to terms bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : evidence of germany 's presence in namibia crops up everywhere and what about germany , the country which , in light of the colonial past , has one of the closest connections to namibia ?
the experts say that namibia is a main focus of german foreign developmental aid , but that berlin could perhaps do more in other areas .
" there needs to be a coming to terms with colonial history , " suren says .
" that would help reconciliation between tribes like the owambos and the hereros and also between blacks and whites .
germany should also support namibian political parties , increase the exchange possibilities for politicians and do more to help the namibian media . "
and there 's more connecting germany and namibia than just history .
" germans make up two-thirds of all tourists to namibia , and german developmental aid is very significant , " iwanowki says .
" berlin is partner city to the namibian capital , windhoek , and there are many parallels .
just as namibia gained independence 20 years ago , it was 20 years ago since the berlin wall fell . "
nothing is certain in the world 's poorest continent .
but if these experts are correct , africa 's youngest nation has a comparatively bright future .

but it took until 1988 for south africa to agree to give up control over the country .
namibia officially gained sovereignty in 1990 , making it africa 's youngest country .
uranium and tourists bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : conditions in namibian townships are simple , but not inhuman namibia may be young and sparsely populated , but experts say those attributes help make its future prospects bright .
" namibia could profit from natural resources like copper and uranium , as those commodities get scarcer , " iwanowski told deutsche welle .
" but the big industry is tourism .
at least one third of the country is a nature reservation with deserts , savannahs and national parks , and most parts of the country are virtually uninhabited .
tourism has grown by 15 to 18 percent annually , and though those numbers are down a bit due to the global financial crisis , it 's still booming . "
probably among namibia 's most famous attractions are the namib and kalahari deserts , and the country needs to be careful about preserving its natural beauty .
" tourism accounts for some 70 percent of namibia 's economy , " says suren .
" that 's because the country is quite safe and easy to get to and get around in .
but namibians need to watch out for crime and environmental destruction . "
uranium mines have often been blamed for contaminating surrounding areas and putting aboriginal peoples at risk .
namibia 's natural resources have attracted the attention of a number of the world 's larger countries , who may put profits ahead of building up namibia 's own economy or preserving its environment .
china , which is very active throughout africa , has come under particular criticism for exploiting namibia 's natural wealth while polluting the land and failing to give back anything to the namibian people .
coming to terms bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : evidence of germany 's presence in namibia crops up everywhere and what about germany , the country which , in light of the colonial past , has one of the closest connections to namibia ?
the experts say that namibia is a main focus of german foreign developmental aid , but that berlin could perhaps do more in other areas .
" there needs to be a coming to terms with colonial history , " suren says .
" that would help reconciliation between tribes like the owambos and the hereros and also between blacks and whites .
germany should also support namibian political parties , increase the exchange possibilities for politicians and do more to help the namibian media . "
and there 's more connecting germany and namibia than just history .
" germans make up two-thirds of all tourists to namibia , and german developmental aid is very significant , " iwanowki says .
" berlin is partner city to the namibian capital , windhoek , and there are many parallels .
just as namibia gained independence 20 years ago , it was 20 years ago since the berlin wall fell . "
nothing is certain in the world 's poorest continent .
but if these experts are correct , africa 's youngest nation has a comparatively bright future .

since then the country has made good progress , but what will the next two decades bring ?
experts say the outlook is positive . it was perhaps somewhat symbolic that namibia 's celebrations on sunday , march 21 , coincided with the swearing-in of its reelected president hifikepunye pohamba .
for 20 years , the southern african nation has been one of the most stable democracies on the continent .
unlike other african countries , perhaps most notably nearby zimbabwe , politics is not a main problem for namibia .
the challenges , say experts , lie elsewhere .
" the problems are the same ones as 20 years ago - providing work , food and places to live for the country 's two to three million inhabitants , " says publisher michael iwanowski , who wrote the first-ever german travel guide to namibia and led a number of official german delegations through the country .
" there 's no industry , and most people live from mining , tourism and subsistence farming .
but the elections were free and fair , and the government works well with the people . "

there also needs to be further reconciliation between tribes and between blacks and whites .

these are the sorts of issues that many african countries face .
but namibia is anything but a typical african nation in either its population or its history .
german south-west africa bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this plaque commemorates namibian victims of german colonial rule in the waning decades of the 19th century , namibia was one of the few places that germany , a belated colonial starter , was able to gain a foothold .
the territory officially became a colony in 1884 and was known as german south-west africa .
but germany 's rule there was hardly happy .
from 1904 to 1907 , the herero and nama tribes rebelled against their colonial master , and in the resultant fighting some 65,000 hereros , about 80 percent of the population , were killed .

since then the country has made good progress , but what will the next two decades bring ?
experts say the outlook is positive . it was perhaps somewhat symbolic that namibia 's celebrations on sunday , march 21 , coincided with the swearing-in of its reelected president hifikepunye pohamba .
for 20 years , the southern african nation has been one of the most stable democracies on the continent .
unlike other african countries , perhaps most notably nearby zimbabwe , politics is not a main problem for namibia .
the challenges , say experts , lie elsewhere .
" the problems are the same ones as 20 years ago - providing work , food and places to live for the country 's two to three million inhabitants , " says publisher michael iwanowski , who wrote the first-ever german travel guide to namibia and led a number of official german delegations through the country .
" there 's no industry , and most people live from mining , tourism and subsistence farming .
but the elections were free and fair , and the government works well with the people . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : namibia is a country of stark , and often uninhabited , beauty namibia is the second-least densely populated country in the world , and has a nominal per capita gdp of only 3,178 euros -lrb- $ 4,278 -rrb- annually .
" the reason so few people live there is that there 's so little water , " says andre suren , a journalist for dw-tv , who was born in namibia and recently returned from filming a report there .
" provision of water is one problem , as are unemployment and poverty , which the government has made its top priority .
there also needs to be further reconciliation between tribes and between blacks and whites .
but the country has found its form of democracy . "
these are the sorts of issues that many african countries face .
but namibia is anything but a typical african nation in either its population or its history .
german south-west africa bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this plaque commemorates namibian victims of german colonial rule in the waning decades of the 19th century , namibia was one of the few places that germany , a belated colonial starter , was able to gain a foothold .
the territory officially became a colony in 1884 and was known as german south-west africa .
but germany 's rule there was hardly happy .
from 1904 to 1907 , the herero and nama tribes rebelled against their colonial master , and in the resultant fighting some 65,000 hereros , about 80 percent of the population , were killed .
in the course of world war i , south africa , which was controlled by britain , occupied namibia thanks to a league of nations mandate .
in 1946 , south africa refused to surrender that mandate even though it had been superseded by a united nations trusteeship agreement .
in 1966 , the south-west africa people 's organization , swapo , led a fight for independence , with heavy participation from the owambo tribe , which today makes up the majority of namibia 's population .
but it took until 1988 for south africa to agree to give up control over the country .
namibia officially gained sovereignty in 1990 , making it africa 's youngest country .
uranium and tourists bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : conditions in namibian townships are simple , but not inhuman namibia may be young and sparsely populated , but experts say those attributes help make its future prospects bright .
" namibia could profit from natural resources like copper and uranium , as those commodities get scarcer , " iwanowski told deutsche welle .
" but the big industry is tourism .
at least one third of the country is a nature reservation with deserts , savannahs and national parks , and most parts of the country are virtually uninhabited .
tourism has grown by 15 to 18 percent annually , and though those numbers are down a bit due to the global financial crisis , it 's still booming . "
probably among namibia 's most famous attractions are the namib and kalahari deserts , and the country needs to be careful about preserving its natural beauty .
" tourism accounts for some 70 percent of namibia 's economy , " says suren .
" that 's because the country is quite safe and easy to get to and get around in .
but namibians need to watch out for crime and environmental destruction . "
uranium mines have often been blamed for contaminating surrounding areas and putting aboriginal peoples at risk .
namibia 's natural resources have attracted the attention of a number of the world 's larger countries , who may put profits ahead of building up namibia 's own economy or preserving its environment .
china , which is very active throughout africa , has come under particular criticism for exploiting namibia 's natural wealth while polluting the land and failing to give back anything to the namibian people .
coming to terms bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : evidence of germany 's presence in namibia crops up everywhere and what about germany , the country which , in light of the colonial past , has one of the closest connections to namibia ?
the experts say that namibia is a main focus of german foreign developmental aid , but that berlin could perhaps do more in other areas .
" there needs to be a coming to terms with colonial history , " suren says .
" that would help reconciliation between tribes like the owambos and the hereros and also between blacks and whites .
germany should also support namibian political parties , increase the exchange possibilities for politicians and do more to help the namibian media . "
and there 's more connecting germany and namibia than just history .
" germans make up two-thirds of all tourists to namibia , and german developmental aid is very significant , " iwanowki says .
" berlin is partner city to the namibian capital , windhoek , and there are many parallels .
just as namibia gained independence 20 years ago , it was 20 years ago since the berlin wall fell . "
nothing is certain in the world 's poorest continent .
but if these experts are correct , africa 's youngest nation has a comparatively bright future .

but nyan win added that she had also said she wanted the party to decide on her own .
the junta recently announced new elections laws , which have been very controversial .
one of them bars people who are currently serving prison terms from being members of political parties .
it therefore stops suu kyi , who is currently under house arrest , from being a member of her own party , let alone allowing her to vote and herself run for election .
the nobel laureate has already spent 14 of the past 20 years in detention .
lawsuit against election laws the nld party recently challenged the new election laws in the supreme court , claiming they were unlawful but the suit was rejected on tuesday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : senior nld leaders such as win tin have to decide whether their party will register the court said it did not have the powers to handle such a case , according to suu kyi 's lawyer nyan win .
political parties in myanmar -lrb- also known as burma -rrb- have fewer than 60 days to register for the polls .
the nld has so far not decided whether it will participate .
the party members plan to meet on friday to discuss the issue .
the junta has not yet announced a date for the elections but it is widely expected that they will take place in october this year .
the last general elections in the military-run country took place in 1990 .
the opposition nld won them by a landslide but the junta never recognized the results .
international criticism the new election laws have also drawn criticism from outside myanmar .
britain , among others , has asked the united nations to call an emergency meeting to discuss the terms of the polls set by the junta in myanmar .
un secretary-general ban ki-moon 's so-called " group of friends " on myanmar is expected to meet on march 25 to discuss the situation in the military-ruled country .
the group includes the united states , britain , france , china , japan , australia , norway , russia , singapore and thailand. du / ap / afp / dpa / ips editor : anne thomas send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

for 57 years , wolfgang wagner directed the festival , celebrating his grandfather 's operas .
hardly any other director has been the source of more controversy . there 's no question that wolfgang wagner was often controversial as a director and as a person .
people considered him too conservative or suggested that he was overshadowed by his brother wieland .
critics were often underwhelmed by his work as a director even though both of his productions of the classic " ring of the nibelungen " opera cycle were at least technically on point . but wagner quickly adjusted to the critical reaction and invited renowned directors from elsewhere to take over the opera 's production .
all of the great wagner directors from hans knappertbusch to christian thielemann came to bayreuth .
perhaps his most memorable staging came in 1976 with the " ring " production led by patrice chereau .
chereau , a french film and theater director , ushered in a new era in the modern reception of wagner together with the composer and director pierre boulez . the new wagner in recent years , unconventional productions by heiner mueller and christoph schlingensief sparked heated debate .
the " workshop " concept , in which young , unknown artists were given the chance to prove themselves on stage , proved disastrous .
this experiment particularly annoyed the longstanding stars of the bayreuth stage . wagner 's tenure had another handicap though : his mother was a friend of adolf hitler 's .
a 1970s documentary featured his mother praising hitler as " our blessed adolf , " which proved problematic for the festival itself .
even today , the wagner family is still trying to account for this part of its history . unparalleled contributions but wolfgang wagner 's greatest contribution to the " ring " festival was in his practical handling of the details .
he contributed like no one else to the appreciation of his grandfather 's work during the 20th century , and he helped oversee more than 1,700 productions in his career .
he succeeded in founding the richard wagner foundation in bayreuth in which public institutions contribute alongside the wagner family to offer a financial safety net for the future of the wagner festival .
under his direction , the festival has become one of the most publicized musical events in the world . the festival 's renown is part of the reason that the music world has followed the wagner clan 's conflicts so attentively .
at times , there were calls that wagner should step down and make room for someone new .
he refused , insisting on his lifetime contract and the opportunity it granted him to ensure that the wagner heritage would be preserved .
he was called stubborn and cranky , but he perfected the art of knowing when to sit a battle out . brand name bayreuth perhaps his daughters eva and katharina were named as his followers so that the then 89-year-old could no longer stand in the way of modernization and further progress in bayreuth .
but nevertheless , when wolfgang wagner stepped down from his post at the end of 2008 , he withdrew as a victor .
in the more than five decades in which he led the opera festival , he developed it into a brand and an event that is one of the most sought-after in the cultural arena .
each year , about 500,000 people go after the 60,000 tickets available each season - and they can encounter waiting times of up to 10 years . music lovers make their way alongside celebrities each year to bayreuth - which would have remained nothing more than another bavarian province were it not for wolfgang wagner .

for 57 years , wolfgang wagner directed the festival , celebrating his grandfather 's operas .
hardly any other director has been the source of more controversy . there 's no question that wolfgang wagner was often controversial as a director and as a person .
people considered him too conservative or suggested that he was overshadowed by his brother wieland .
critics were often underwhelmed by his work as a director even though both of his productions of the classic " ring of the nibelungen " opera cycle were at least technically on point . but wagner quickly adjusted to the critical reaction and invited renowned directors from elsewhere to take over the opera 's production .
all of the great wagner directors from hans knappertbusch to christian thielemann came to bayreuth .
perhaps his most memorable staging came in 1976 with the " ring " production led by patrice chereau .
chereau , a french film and theater director , ushered in a new era in the modern reception of wagner together with the composer and director pierre boulez . the new wagner in recent years , unconventional productions by heiner mueller and christoph schlingensief sparked heated debate .
the " workshop " concept , in which young , unknown artists were given the chance to prove themselves on stage , proved disastrous .
this experiment particularly annoyed the longstanding stars of the bayreuth stage . wagner 's tenure had another handicap though : his mother was a friend of adolf hitler 's .
a 1970s documentary featured his mother praising hitler as " our blessed adolf , " which proved problematic for the festival itself .
even today , the wagner family is still trying to account for this part of its history . unparalleled contributions but wolfgang wagner 's greatest contribution to the " ring " festival was in his practical handling of the details .
he contributed like no one else to the appreciation of his grandfather 's work during the 20th century , and he helped oversee more than 1,700 productions in his career .
he succeeded in founding the richard wagner foundation in bayreuth in which public institutions contribute alongside the wagner family to offer a financial safety net for the future of the wagner festival .
under his direction , the festival has become one of the most publicized musical events in the world . the festival 's renown is part of the reason that the music world has followed the wagner clan 's conflicts so attentively .
at times , there were calls that wagner should step down and make room for someone new .

germany said it would make more than a billion euros available , a day ahead of an international ruling on subsidies . us aerospace giant boeing has condemned a german plan to make 1.1 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.5 billion -rrb- available to its arch-rival airbus .
the aircraft maker also criticized the timing of the announcement , a day ahead of an expected world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- ruling on state aid for aircraft makers .
german government aerospace coordinator peter hintze confirmed plans on monday to make development funds available for the medium-sized a350 passenger jet .
the aircraft is seen as a possible future market rival for the boeing 787 dreamliner .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : washington has complained to the world trade organization the us government along with boeing claims that loan payments by european governments to airbus aircraft are , in reality , unfair subsidies .
boeing believes that the wto is set to rule in its favor .
" on the eve of such an important decision , it is unfortunate and disappointing to see news reports quoting a senior german official saying that germany is prepared to provide 1.1 billion euros for the development of the airbus a350 , " said ted austell , vice president of boeing 's executive , legislative and regulatory affairs .
move defies the rules austell said the deal was " a move that flies in the face of both the expected wto decision and the rules-based global trading system we 've all endorsed . "
however , in a newspaper interview , the german aerospace co-ordinator said that the latest round of funding broke no rules .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hintze has said that the loan complies with trade rules " on our side all the pre-conditions are fulfilled .
the conditions of the loan are in conformity with wto rules and the funds are available , " hintze told german daily newspaper die welt .
the us complaint to the wto is that airbus received 150 billion euros in loans and other benefits on unfair terms from britain , france , germany and spain , over two decades .
although the wto ruling is not directly related to the a350 loan , it could affect the speed at which the money must be paid back .
the european commission has brought a counter-claim over financial aid to boeing against washington .
the two cases , combined , amount to the biggest dispute ever to be handled by the wto .
although governments expect to receive the final wto report on tuesday afternoon , the public release will not be until april. rc / ap / reuters / afp editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de music -pipe- 23.03.2010 opinion : wolfgang wagner transformed bayreuth großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bayreuth festival has lost its patriarch .
for 57 years , wolfgang wagner directed the festival , celebrating his grandfather 's operas .
hardly any other director has been the source of more controversy . there 's no question that wolfgang wagner was often controversial as a director and as a person .
people considered him too conservative or suggested that he was overshadowed by his brother wieland .
critics were often underwhelmed by his work as a director even though both of his productions of the classic " ring of the nibelungen " opera cycle were at least technically on point . but wagner quickly adjusted to the critical reaction and invited renowned directors from elsewhere to take over the opera 's production .
all of the great wagner directors from hans knappertbusch to christian thielemann came to bayreuth .
perhaps his most memorable staging came in 1976 with the " ring " production led by patrice chereau .
chereau , a french film and theater director , ushered in a new era in the modern reception of wagner together with the composer and director pierre boulez . the new wagner in recent years , unconventional productions by heiner mueller and christoph schlingensief sparked heated debate .
the " workshop " concept , in which young , unknown artists were given the chance to prove themselves on stage , proved disastrous .
this experiment particularly annoyed the longstanding stars of the bayreuth stage . wagner 's tenure had another handicap though : his mother was a friend of adolf hitler 's .

for 57 years , wolfgang wagner directed the festival , celebrating his grandfather 's operas .
hardly any other director has been the source of more controversy . there 's no question that wolfgang wagner was often controversial as a director and as a person .
people considered him too conservative or suggested that he was overshadowed by his brother wieland .
critics were often underwhelmed by his work as a director even though both of his productions of the classic " ring of the nibelungen " opera cycle were at least technically on point . but wagner quickly adjusted to the critical reaction and invited renowned directors from elsewhere to take over the opera 's production .
all of the great wagner directors from hans knappertbusch to christian thielemann came to bayreuth .
perhaps his most memorable staging came in 1976 with the " ring " production led by patrice chereau .
chereau , a french film and theater director , ushered in a new era in the modern reception of wagner together with the composer and director pierre boulez . the new wagner in recent years , unconventional productions by heiner mueller and christoph schlingensief sparked heated debate .
the " workshop " concept , in which young , unknown artists were given the chance to prove themselves on stage , proved disastrous .
this experiment particularly annoyed the longstanding stars of the bayreuth stage . wagner 's tenure had another handicap though : his mother was a friend of adolf hitler 's .

eu commission president barroso , however , has said he believes chancellor merkel will agree to a rescue plan . germany is braced for further confrontation with fellow eu members this week as the row intensified over aid for debt-ridden greece on monday .
chancellor angela merkel said that there was " no question of an urgent decision in the european council about aid for greece " when eu leaders meet in brussels on thursday .
merkel said that because greece had yet not asked for a bailout , the matter should not be considered .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel said that the greece rescue package should not be on the summit agenda but calls for action came as eu foreign ministers met on monday in the run-up to the leaders ' summit , led by european commission president jose manuel barroso .
action to protect stability barroso said that action was necessary before faith in the economic stability of the euro zone – and the euro itself – was undermined .
" we need a decision at this summit , " warned barroso .
" we ca n't keep going this way , we risk endangering the stability of the euro zone and feeding speculation . "
calls for intervention in the debt crisis faced by greece , which has introduced austerity measures of its own , were echoed at the brussels meeting by countries including france and italy .
" the french position is very clear , " said french foreign minister bernard kouchner .
" we can not , we must not abandon our greek friends . "
' not in total agreement ' after the meeting , kouchner added that " on this issue , we are not totally in agreement with our german friends . "
german foreign minister guido westerwelle had resisted the idea of any immediate rescue plan at the meeting .
" at the moment we see no need to make a final decision on any kind of option , " said westerwelle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso expressed confidence that merkel will help in an interview with the financial times published on tuesday , the commission president said he was confident that germany would provide financial help if necessary .
" i know chancellor angela merkel , " said barroso .
" she is a committed european and i have no doubts that she will , if needed , be in favor of providing financial assistance to greece . "
greek deputy prime minister theodoros pangalos on monday accused berlin of allowing its banks to take part in a " deplorable game " of speculating on greek bonds while german exporters profited from a weaker euro due to athens ' budget problems. rc / reuters / afp / ap / dpa editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

eu commission president barroso , however , has said he believes chancellor merkel will agree to a rescue plan . germany is braced for further confrontation with fellow eu members this week as the row intensified over aid for debt-ridden greece on monday .
chancellor angela merkel said that there was " no question of an urgent decision in the european council about aid for greece " when eu leaders meet in brussels on thursday .
merkel said that because greece had yet not asked for a bailout , the matter should not be considered .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel said that the greece rescue package should not be on the summit agenda but calls for action came as eu foreign ministers met on monday in the run-up to the leaders ' summit , led by european commission president jose manuel barroso .
action to protect stability barroso said that action was necessary before faith in the economic stability of the euro zone – and the euro itself – was undermined .
" we need a decision at this summit , " warned barroso .
" we ca n't keep going this way , we risk endangering the stability of the euro zone and feeding speculation . "
calls for intervention in the debt crisis faced by greece , which has introduced austerity measures of its own , were echoed at the brussels meeting by countries including france and italy .
" the french position is very clear , " said french foreign minister bernard kouchner .
" we can not , we must not abandon our greek friends . "
' not in total agreement ' after the meeting , kouchner added that " on this issue , we are not totally in agreement with our german friends . "
german foreign minister guido westerwelle had resisted the idea of any immediate rescue plan at the meeting .
" at the moment we see no need to make a final decision on any kind of option , " said westerwelle .

" at no point did i feel like i was committing a crime .
now i see things from a different perspective , " he said . following ss orders bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : boere -lrb- left -rrb- and his lawyer say he only followed orders boere described how he and another ss man wore civilian clothes during unannounced visits to the premises of people believed to oppose the nazis .
after asking them if they were in fact the persons sought , the two ss men shot them point blank with silenced pistols . boere said that , as a soldier , he was just following the orders of his superior officers who told him to execute the dutch citizens . but the prosecution argued boere was a willing member of the ss , which he joined shortly after the nazis had overrun his hometown of maastricht and the rest of the netherlands in 1940 . bringing boere to justice the attempt to bring heinrich boere 's case to trial has been a long process for prosecutors , as he has evaded conviction for over sixty years . dr. ephraim zuroff from the group ' operation : last chance ' which campaigns to bring nazi war criminals to justice , told deutsche welle it was a " great day . " " i think it sends a very powerful message , " dr. zuroff said .
" even today , decades after the crime , nazi war criminals can be brought to justice . " despite a dutch court sentencing him to death in absentia in 1949 , boere avoided extradition by claiming he had german citizenship .
germany as a rule does not extradite its citizens . years of legal wrangling between german and dutch courts left boere a free man living in germany , until the start of his trial in october 2009 . the demjanjuk case continues bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the trial of suspected nazi prison guard john demjanjuk continues in munich since the nuremberg trials after the war , where several top nazi officials were sentenced to death , german authorities have examined more than 25,000 cases but the vast majority have never come to court . however now , as the suspected war criminals approach their nineties , there has been a minor flurry of arrests and court cases . in the most high-profile , 89-year old john demjanjuk went on trial in munich november 2009 on charges of assisting in the murder of 27,900 people at the sobibor death camp , where prosecutors say he was a guard . despite the age of suspects such as denjanjuk and boere , dr. zuroff argues many are still well enough to take part in a trial . " the issue is not the age of the suspects but rather their mental or physical health , " he states . " people who commit terrible crimes should not be ignored simply because their birth certificate says 1919 or 1920 .

" the year of the flood " is a futuristic account of the aftermath of a major natural disaster that seems to have obliterated most of humankind .
adam one - the leader of a religious group that melds science , religion and nature - had predicted such an event .
after it happens , he and his followers regroup in a world that is altered and unpredictable . born in 1939 , atwood has published short stories , critical studies , screenplays , books for children , and poems , but is best known for her novels .
her work has been translated into over 30 languages . click on the audio link below to listen to the complete interview with margaret atwood . deutsche welle : you lived in germany in the 1980s .
what did you experience during that time ? margaret atwood : i came to germany for the very first time for my german publisher in the 70s .
then , as it turned out , in 1984 , i began " the handmaid 's tale " in berlin before the wall came down .
i began it in berlin , i finished it in tuscaloosa , alabama , which is quite a contrast .
but both of them were situations that had built-in stresses , because west berlin at that time of course was encircled by the wall and every sunday the east german air force flew over and made sonic booms , just to remind us that they were there . -lrb- … -rrb- now in germany you 're presenting your new book " the year of the flood . "
how significant is it that this book was finished in the year of your 70th birthday ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the publication of atwood 's book was postponed because of the us elections it was actually finished a year earlier .
the publication was postponed for a year because if it had been published in 2008 , it would have coincided with the american election and the american publisher quite rightly said , nobody is going to be doing anything except watching this election because whether it 's hillary clinton or barack obama , it 'll be unprecedented and everyone will be glued to their screen , which they were . i started to think a lot about your childhood when i was reading this book - the experience of being in a forest and the work of your father . yes , he was an entomologist , but he was also an all-around naturalist and what they call in canada woodsman .
in other words , he was very experienced in what we call " the bush . " -lrb- ... -rrb- i would be very scared if this latest book of yours is a prophesy about the future . first of all , it 's not a prophesy because i do n't do prophesies ; no one can really predict the future .
even the old testament prophets were n't predicting the future , they were more or less saying this is the state of your soul now .
you ca n't really write about the future because nobody has been there .
it 's like dante writing about the inferno .
i hate to break this to you , but he did not actually go down into hell . -lrb- … -rrb- are you an optimist about the future ?
this book tells us about environmental devastation , which we hear about every day in the news . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dante never actually went to hell , quipped atwood it 's not actually about that so much .
the truth is , if you remove the people , nature comes back quite well , which is where we are when the book opens .
there 's quite a lot of nature .
it 's not that all of nature gets destroyed . -lrb- … -rrb- as william gibson says , the future is already here , but it 's unevenly distributed .
some people say global warming , but really they should say climate change because the weather gets more extreme .
things change .
it 's not that everything goes away , but things change .
and if they change too abruptly , what you get is a lot of die-off . what 's really scary in this book is not that so much , although that 's a motivator , but what 's scary is that we can make new species .
we already can make new species , and we 're doing it .
but the really scary thing is we can make new diseases .
we already have that capacity .
why has not some country made a disgusting new disease and unleashed it on everybody else ?
they 're afraid of the blow-back .
there 's no way of doing that without the possibility that your country will get it too , with things being so very spreadable . -lrb- … -rrb- what a lot of people do n't know is that your first publication was actually a book of poems . yes , but it was n't the first thing i wrote .
i was actually writing the prose and the poems at the same time .
it was just that in those days , in canada , where it what almost impossible to publish a full-length novel , poems were a lot cheaper , they were shorter .
and typically you started out writing them off on a mimeo machine or putting together a little cold type book or hand-setting them , which is what i did with my first little booklet of poems - i hand-set them on a flatbed press .
try hand-setting a novel on a flatbed press ! -lrb- … -rrb- would i be right in assuming that margaret atwood is an optimist ? anyone who writes a book is an optimist .

" the year of the flood " is a futuristic account of the aftermath of a major natural disaster that seems to have obliterated most of humankind .
adam one - the leader of a religious group that melds science , religion and nature - had predicted such an event .
after it happens , he and his followers regroup in a world that is altered and unpredictable . born in 1939 , atwood has published short stories , critical studies , screenplays , books for children , and poems , but is best known for her novels .
her work has been translated into over 30 languages . click on the audio link below to listen to the complete interview with margaret atwood . deutsche welle : you lived in germany in the 1980s .
what did you experience during that time ? margaret atwood : i came to germany for the very first time for my german publisher in the 70s .
then , as it turned out , in 1984 , i began " the handmaid 's tale " in berlin before the wall came down .
i began it in berlin , i finished it in tuscaloosa , alabama , which is quite a contrast .
but both of them were situations that had built-in stresses , because west berlin at that time of course was encircled by the wall and every sunday the east german air force flew over and made sonic booms , just to remind us that they were there . -lrb- … -rrb- now in germany you 're presenting your new book " the year of the flood . "
how significant is it that this book was finished in the year of your 70th birthday ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the publication of atwood 's book was postponed because of the us elections it was actually finished a year earlier .
the publication was postponed for a year because if it had been published in 2008 , it would have coincided with the american election and the american publisher quite rightly said , nobody is going to be doing anything except watching this election because whether it 's hillary clinton or barack obama , it 'll be unprecedented and everyone will be glued to their screen , which they were . i started to think a lot about your childhood when i was reading this book - the experience of being in a forest and the work of your father . yes , he was an entomologist , but he was also an all-around naturalist and what they call in canada woodsman .
in other words , he was very experienced in what we call " the bush . " -lrb- ... -rrb- i would be very scared if this latest book of yours is a prophesy about the future . first of all , it 's not a prophesy because i do n't do prophesies ; no one can really predict the future .
even the old testament prophets were n't predicting the future , they were more or less saying this is the state of your soul now .
you ca n't really write about the future because nobody has been there .
it 's like dante writing about the inferno .
i hate to break this to you , but he did not actually go down into hell . -lrb- … -rrb- are you an optimist about the future ?
this book tells us about environmental devastation , which we hear about every day in the news . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dante never actually went to hell , quipped atwood it 's not actually about that so much .
the truth is , if you remove the people , nature comes back quite well , which is where we are when the book opens .
there 's quite a lot of nature .
it 's not that all of nature gets destroyed . -lrb- … -rrb- as william gibson says , the future is already here , but it 's unevenly distributed .
some people say global warming , but really they should say climate change because the weather gets more extreme .
things change .
it 's not that everything goes away , but things change .
and if they change too abruptly , what you get is a lot of die-off . what 's really scary in this book is not that so much , although that 's a motivator , but what 's scary is that we can make new species .
we already can make new species , and we 're doing it .
but the really scary thing is we can make new diseases .
we already have that capacity .
why has not some country made a disgusting new disease and unleashed it on everybody else ?
they 're afraid of the blow-back .

the appointments may help him garner support within his party . although president nicolas sarkozy has said that the regional election results were not an indictment of his national government , he met with prime minister francois fillon on monday to discuss a cabinet reshuffle . following those talks , the president announced that he was sacking a senior minister in what was seen as an effort to regain the initiative . labor minister xavier darcos , who had been set to lead negotiations over controversial pension reforms , was sent packing because his party 's defeat in sunday 's vote meant he no longer had the necessary credibility to oversee the overhaul of the costly french pension system .
he is to be replaced by eric woerth , the current budget minister . francois baroin , a close ally of former president jacques chirac , is to replace woerth in a move expected to appease the chirac " old guard " in sarkozy ’ s conservative ump party .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president sarkozy said the results were not an indictment of his government sarkozy has nominated georges tron , who is an ally of former prime minister dominique de villepin , as junior minister for the civil service . villepin , an opponent of the president , is expected to announce later this week that he will set up a rival centre-right political party .
the appointment of tron deprives villepin of a possible ally .
another conservative , marc-philippe daubresse , became minister for youth .
he effectively replaces centre-left politician martin hirsch , who had been a symbol of sarkozy ’ s effort to recruit talent from the opposition . future reshuffle possible with only two officials leaving the government , the changes are seen as relatively minor , with a more wide-ranging reshuffle possible ahead of presidential elections in 2012 .
in sunday 's second-round run-off vote , the socialist-led opposition beat sarkozy 's union for a popular movement -lrb- ump -rrb- by a margin of 54 percent to 36 percent .
the left gained control of 21 of france 's 22 mainland regions . the far-right front national came away with 9.3 percent nationwide , after qualifying for the second round in nine regions .
but veteran party leader jean-marie le pen scored big in his home region in southern france , winning more than 22 percent of the vote .
voter turnout , at 51 percent , was four points higher than last sunday 's first round of polling .
pollsters say the country 's anemic economy and growing unemployment as well as sarkozy 's relentless reform course have disillusioned voters .
also , a string of recent controversies , ranging from a debate on national identity to accusations of nepotism , have been eroding his popularity .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : villepin is set to announce plans to form a rival party alsace remains conservative although sunday 's election outcome was a triumph for the socialists , the ump looks set to hold on to its traditional stronghold , the alsace region along the german border . but the island of corsica , another conservative bastion , was snatched from the ump by the socialist alliance .
the ump held on to french guyana and reunion , while guadeloupe went to the socialists .
the result is very similar to the last regional poll in 2004 when the socialists came away with 20 of the 22 mainland districts , but were defeated in the presidential election three years later .
even so , the poll is seen as a rejection of sarkozy and his policies and perhaps the worst defeat of his political career .
the president has already announced a hiatus in reform plans for next year and this loss could make him even more cautious about pushing painful changes. gb / db / afp / apn / dpa / reuters editor : ben knight send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the appointments may help him garner support within his party . although president nicolas sarkozy has said that the regional election results were not an indictment of his national government , he met with prime minister francois fillon on monday to discuss a cabinet reshuffle . following those talks , the president announced that he was sacking a senior minister in what was seen as an effort to regain the initiative . labor minister xavier darcos , who had been set to lead negotiations over controversial pension reforms , was sent packing because his party 's defeat in sunday 's vote meant he no longer had the necessary credibility to oversee the overhaul of the costly french pension system .
he is to be replaced by eric woerth , the current budget minister . francois baroin , a close ally of former president jacques chirac , is to replace woerth in a move expected to appease the chirac " old guard " in sarkozy ’ s conservative ump party .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president sarkozy said the results were not an indictment of his government sarkozy has nominated georges tron , who is an ally of former prime minister dominique de villepin , as junior minister for the civil service . villepin , an opponent of the president , is expected to announce later this week that he will set up a rival centre-right political party .
the appointment of tron deprives villepin of a possible ally .
another conservative , marc-philippe daubresse , became minister for youth .
he effectively replaces centre-left politician martin hirsch , who had been a symbol of sarkozy ’ s effort to recruit talent from the opposition . future reshuffle possible with only two officials leaving the government , the changes are seen as relatively minor , with a more wide-ranging reshuffle possible ahead of presidential elections in 2012 .
in sunday 's second-round run-off vote , the socialist-led opposition beat sarkozy 's union for a popular movement -lrb- ump -rrb- by a margin of 54 percent to 36 percent .
the left gained control of 21 of france 's 22 mainland regions . the far-right front national came away with 9.3 percent nationwide , after qualifying for the second round in nine regions .
but veteran party leader jean-marie le pen scored big in his home region in southern france , winning more than 22 percent of the vote .
voter turnout , at 51 percent , was four points higher than last sunday 's first round of polling .
pollsters say the country 's anemic economy and growing unemployment as well as sarkozy 's relentless reform course have disillusioned voters .
also , a string of recent controversies , ranging from a debate on national identity to accusations of nepotism , have been eroding his popularity .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : villepin is set to announce plans to form a rival party alsace remains conservative although sunday 's election outcome was a triumph for the socialists , the ump looks set to hold on to its traditional stronghold , the alsace region along the german border . but the island of corsica , another conservative bastion , was snatched from the ump by the socialist alliance .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de auto industry -pipe- 23.03.2010 german industry invests more abroad großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vw already manufacturers cars in china where it sees huge growth potential foreign investments by german manufacturers are poised to bounce back this year as the global economic climate improves , according to a new study .
but experts warn jobs could also go out the door . recovering from its worst slump since world war two , german industry plans to step up investments in international sales and distribution networks as well as production facilities in key foreign markets . according to a new report by the german chambers of industry and commerce -lrb- dihk -rrb- , 44 percent of the 9,000 companies surveyed said they intend to make investments in foreign countries , up from 40 percent last year .
more than a third -lrb- 37 percent -rrb- of the companies said they had plans to invest in china , up from 32 percent .
" need to start investing again " “ after experiencing a drop in exports of as much as 80 percent in some cases , german industrial companies see signs of a recovery , ” volker treier , chief economist at dihk , told deutsche welle .
“ many recognize a need to start investing again to maintain their presence abroad ; they do n't want to lose what they 've built up . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : low labor costs are no longer that main reason why german companies invest abroad financing is an issue , treier conceded .
he pointed to the reluctance of numerous banks stung by the global economic crisis to lend money to industrial companies - especially those planning investments in projects far away from germany .
“ this is definitely a problem but it is one where the banks , the government and other groups have been working together with industry to find solutions , ” treier said .
“ there are some measures underway to ensure the flow of credit . ”
today , 100 of germany 's largest publicly-listed companies generate more than two thirds of their sales outside the country .
a sizable chunk of these sales still come from products that are “ made in germany ” and sold in china .
german exports to china rose by 7 percent in 2009 , the federal statistical office reported monday .
the increase bucked the trend in a dismal year for germany , where overall exports slumped by 18 percent .
the exported goods were valued at 36.5 billion euros .
building logistics networks and new factories cheap labor is no longer a key driver of foreign investments by german industry , according to the dihk survey ; only 28 percent of the polled companies cited low production costs as a reason for their investments abroad – and only 20 percent for their investments in china .
“ that was the reason about five years ago but german manufacturers have since done much to increase productivity in their domestic operations , ” economist treier said .
“ the investments that are being made today or are planned in the near future are all about building up local sales and logistics networks and even new factories to take full advantage of huge emerging markets such as china , india and brazil ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daimler already builds cars in brazil and has plans for manufacturing in the us german car manufacturing , perhaps more than any other industry in the country , is racing ahead to win market share in these emerging markets .
volkswagen , for instance , is currently expanding its local production facilities in china and india as well as in the us .
“ german carmakers really do n't have an alternative , ” said thomas kautzsch , a manufacturing consultant with the management consultancy oliver wyman in munich . jobs in germany will go martin haubensak , a consultant with at kearny agrees .
“ vw tried to build everything in wolfsburg and then ship everything around the globe , ” he said .
“ now they realize it makes more sense , from an economic and competitive perspective , to build regionally . ”
investments in new production facilities abroad , however , will come at the expense of jobs in germany in the long term , experts agree .
“ we are definitely going to see some adjustments , ” said ferdinand dudenhoeffer , a professor at the university of duisburg-essen and an expert on the german car industry .
“ german carmakers need to manufacturer cars abroad for a number of reasons , including low labor costs and import duties .
the number of jobs in germany will definitely go down . ”
dudenhoeffer expects germany 's auto industry to shed 50,000 of its current 700,000 jobs by 2015 .
“ the future is in the new markets , ” he said .
“ production is already moving there . ”

but experts warn jobs could also go out the door . recovering from its worst slump since world war two , german industry plans to step up investments in international sales and distribution networks as well as production facilities in key foreign markets . according to a new report by the german chambers of industry and commerce -lrb- dihk -rrb- , 44 percent of the 9,000 companies surveyed said they intend to make investments in foreign countries , up from 40 percent last year .
more than a third -lrb- 37 percent -rrb- of the companies said they had plans to invest in china , up from 32 percent .
" need to start investing again " “ after experiencing a drop in exports of as much as 80 percent in some cases , german industrial companies see signs of a recovery , ” volker treier , chief economist at dihk , told deutsche welle .
“ many recognize a need to start investing again to maintain their presence abroad ; they do n't want to lose what they 've built up . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : low labor costs are no longer that main reason why german companies invest abroad financing is an issue , treier conceded .
he pointed to the reluctance of numerous banks stung by the global economic crisis to lend money to industrial companies - especially those planning investments in projects far away from germany .
“ this is definitely a problem but it is one where the banks , the government and other groups have been working together with industry to find solutions , ” treier said .
“ there are some measures underway to ensure the flow of credit . ”
today , 100 of germany 's largest publicly-listed companies generate more than two thirds of their sales outside the country .
a sizable chunk of these sales still come from products that are “ made in germany ” and sold in china .
german exports to china rose by 7 percent in 2009 , the federal statistical office reported monday .
the increase bucked the trend in a dismal year for germany , where overall exports slumped by 18 percent .
the exported goods were valued at 36.5 billion euros .
building logistics networks and new factories cheap labor is no longer a key driver of foreign investments by german industry , according to the dihk survey ; only 28 percent of the polled companies cited low production costs as a reason for their investments abroad – and only 20 percent for their investments in china .
“ that was the reason about five years ago but german manufacturers have since done much to increase productivity in their domestic operations , ” economist treier said .
“ the investments that are being made today or are planned in the near future are all about building up local sales and logistics networks and even new factories to take full advantage of huge emerging markets such as china , india and brazil ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daimler already builds cars in brazil and has plans for manufacturing in the us german car manufacturing , perhaps more than any other industry in the country , is racing ahead to win market share in these emerging markets .
volkswagen , for instance , is currently expanding its local production facilities in china and india as well as in the us .
“ german carmakers really do n't have an alternative , ” said thomas kautzsch , a manufacturing consultant with the management consultancy oliver wyman in munich . jobs in germany will go martin haubensak , a consultant with at kearny agrees .
“ vw tried to build everything in wolfsburg and then ship everything around the globe , ” he said .
“ now they realize it makes more sense , from an economic and competitive perspective , to build regionally . ”
investments in new production facilities abroad , however , will come at the expense of jobs in germany in the long term , experts agree .
“ we are definitely going to see some adjustments , ” said ferdinand dudenhoeffer , a professor at the university of duisburg-essen and an expert on the german car industry .
“ german carmakers need to manufacturer cars abroad for a number of reasons , including low labor costs and import duties .
the number of jobs in germany will definitely go down . ”
dudenhoeffer expects germany 's auto industry to shed 50,000 of its current 700,000 jobs by 2015 .
“ the future is in the new markets , ” he said .
“ production is already moving there . ”

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de africa -pipe- 23.03.2010 sudan instability hampering international aid to darfur großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sudan 's april elections will be keenly watched by the international community at an international donor conference for darfur on the weekend , organizers in cairo fell far short of the $ 2 billion they 'd hoped to raise , due to concerns over sudan 's security situation ahead of april 's elections . " we are not disappointed , we are shocked at what happened , " said ekmeleddin ihsanoglu , the turkish head of the organization of the islamic conference -lrb- oic -rrb- , which had convened sunday 's donor conference .
the organizers raised $ 841 million -lrb- 622 million euros -rrb- for infrastructure projects for displaced people in darfur in western sudan - less than half the targeted amount of $ 2 billion .
egyptian foreign minister ahmed abul gheit told the closing session that the countries which made pledges included algeria , australia , brazil , morocco , qatar , and turkey .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : organizers hoped to raise $ 2 billion ahead of the international donor conference several western countries opted to keep their hands in their pockets , citing security concerns in sudan .
" in the absence of proper conditions on the ground , our focus remains on humanitarian assistance , " a norwegian delegate said , echoing the view of many of the western diplomats in attendance .
" our presence here constitutes a political message , " one unnamed western diplomat told news agency afp , adding that his country would not donate money because of " the uncertainty of how the money will be used or channelled . "
the timing of the conference may have been especially poor , coming as it did just three weeks before sudan is due to hold its first multi-party elections since 1986 .
the country 's veteran leader , president omar hassan al-bashir , who was indicted by the international criminal court -lrb- icc -rrb- last year for war crimes and crimes against humanity during sudan 's seven-year rebellion in darfur , is seeking reelection .
many sudan experts doubt the country 's readiness for a democratic election process .
just the organization and sheer number of ballots involved represent a significant logistical hurdle , said sara pantuliano , a research fellow at the london-based overseas development institute .
" mock elections were held at the university of khartoum , and it took a university graduate an average of 23 minutes to fill out all the ballots , " she told deutsche welle . " and in mock elections held by an ngo in the south , it took illiterate women an average of three hours to fill out the ballots .
so even if the election was free and fair , there will be such a degree of confusion that even in the best of scenarios , there will still be results that will not reflect the wishes of the population . "
given the momentous challenge , she said she was not surprised that the donor conference in cairo failed to muster its target sum .
" the election is an important landmark , and we 've seen a similar holding back for southern sudan , amid discussions of reallocating funding for the south , so there is a wait-and-see attitude at the moment which applies to the whole country , " pantuliano said .
political rift ahead of elections political tensions ahead of the election are high as bashir has for the first time faced calls from senior government members to surrender to the icc .
on saturday , the head of intelligence for the sudan people 's liberation movement -lrb- splm -rrb- , edward lino , told reuters that bashir has no option but to respond to the icc .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sudanese president omar al bashir said the icc warrant against him has increased his popularity " there are many dignitaries who were taken and he is not an exception .
for the good of the country , bashir should take leave and go to the hague , " lino said .
the splm 's presidential candidate , yasir arman , has also challenged bashir to withdraw from the poll in order to encourage southerners to vote for unity in the south 's self-determination referendum , which must be held before january 9 , 2011 .
according to the brussels-based international crisis group -lrb- icg -rrb- , efforts to resolve both the country 's ongoing north-south civil war and the conflict in darfur have been hampered by the intransigence of bashir 's national congress party -lrb- ncp -rrb- .
the comments from lino and arman over the weekend serve as further proof of the rift that has developed between the ncp and the splm , who signed a 2005 peace deal with bashir , joining him as junior coalition partners .
until now , the splm had been careful to steer clear of the sensitive issue of the icc , hoping to preserve their partnership until the referendum .
international efforts needed to secure peace now , the icg says both of sudan 's major conflicts could boil over again unless the april 11 election and the southern referendum lead to democratic transformation .
and , in a recent assessment of the situation in sudan , the group added that the international community has a responsibility to act .
" unless the international community , notably the us , the un , the african union -lrb- au -rrb- peace and security council , and the horn of africa inter-government authority on development -lrb- igad -rrb- , cooperate to support both comprehensive peace agreement implementation and vital additional negotiations , a return to north-south war and escalation of conflict in darfur are likely , " the icg concluded .
pantuliano of the overseas development institute agrees that there is a risk of more intense conflict following next month 's election .
" the result of the elections will almost inevitably create local tensions , and these have a risk of escalating , and having national consequences ; that is the most tangible danger , " she told deutsche welle .

the country 's veteran leader , president omar hassan al-bashir , who was indicted by the international criminal court -lrb- icc -rrb- last year for war crimes and crimes against humanity during sudan 's seven-year rebellion in darfur , is seeking reelection .
many sudan experts doubt the country 's readiness for a democratic election process .
just the organization and sheer number of ballots involved represent a significant logistical hurdle , said sara pantuliano , a research fellow at the london-based overseas development institute .
" mock elections were held at the university of khartoum , and it took a university graduate an average of 23 minutes to fill out all the ballots , " she told deutsche welle . " and in mock elections held by an ngo in the south , it took illiterate women an average of three hours to fill out the ballots .
so even if the election was free and fair , there will be such a degree of confusion that even in the best of scenarios , there will still be results that will not reflect the wishes of the population . "
given the momentous challenge , she said she was not surprised that the donor conference in cairo failed to muster its target sum .
" the election is an important landmark , and we 've seen a similar holding back for southern sudan , amid discussions of reallocating funding for the south , so there is a wait-and-see attitude at the moment which applies to the whole country , " pantuliano said .
political rift ahead of elections political tensions ahead of the election are high as bashir has for the first time faced calls from senior government members to surrender to the icc .
on saturday , the head of intelligence for the sudan people 's liberation movement -lrb- splm -rrb- , edward lino , told reuters that bashir has no option but to respond to the icc .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sudanese president omar al bashir said the icc warrant against him has increased his popularity " there are many dignitaries who were taken and he is not an exception .
for the good of the country , bashir should take leave and go to the hague , " lino said .
the splm 's presidential candidate , yasir arman , has also challenged bashir to withdraw from the poll in order to encourage southerners to vote for unity in the south 's self-determination referendum , which must be held before january 9 , 2011 .
according to the brussels-based international crisis group -lrb- icg -rrb- , efforts to resolve both the country 's ongoing north-south civil war and the conflict in darfur have been hampered by the intransigence of bashir 's national congress party -lrb- ncp -rrb- .
the comments from lino and arman over the weekend serve as further proof of the rift that has developed between the ncp and the splm , who signed a 2005 peace deal with bashir , joining him as junior coalition partners .
until now , the splm had been careful to steer clear of the sensitive issue of the icc , hoping to preserve their partnership until the referendum .
international efforts needed to secure peace now , the icg says both of sudan 's major conflicts could boil over again unless the april 11 election and the southern referendum lead to democratic transformation .
and , in a recent assessment of the situation in sudan , the group added that the international community has a responsibility to act .
" unless the international community , notably the us , the un , the african union -lrb- au -rrb- peace and security council , and the horn of africa inter-government authority on development -lrb- igad -rrb- , cooperate to support both comprehensive peace agreement implementation and vital additional negotiations , a return to north-south war and escalation of conflict in darfur are likely , " the icg concluded .
pantuliano of the overseas development institute agrees that there is a risk of more intense conflict following next month 's election .
" the result of the elections will almost inevitably create local tensions , and these have a risk of escalating , and having national consequences ; that is the most tangible danger , " she told deutsche welle .

" the year of the flood " is a futuristic account of the aftermath of a major natural disaster that seems to have obliterated most of humankind .
adam one - the leader of a religious group that melds science , religion and nature - had predicted such an event .
after it happens , he and his followers regroup in a world that is altered and unpredictable . born in 1939 , atwood has published short stories , critical studies , screenplays , books for children , and poems , but is best known for her novels .
her work has been translated into over 30 languages . click on the audio link below to listen to the complete interview with margaret atwood . deutsche welle : you lived in germany in the 1980s .
what did you experience during that time ? margaret atwood : i came to germany for the very first time for my german publisher in the 70s .
then , as it turned out , in 1984 , i began " the handmaid 's tale " in berlin before the wall came down .
i began it in berlin , i finished it in tuscaloosa , alabama , which is quite a contrast .
but both of them were situations that had built-in stresses , because west berlin at that time of course was encircled by the wall and every sunday the east german air force flew over and made sonic booms , just to remind us that they were there . -lrb- … -rrb- now in germany you 're presenting your new book " the year of the flood . "
how significant is it that this book was finished in the year of your 70th birthday ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the publication of atwood 's book was postponed because of the us elections it was actually finished a year earlier .
the publication was postponed for a year because if it had been published in 2008 , it would have coincided with the american election and the american publisher quite rightly said , nobody is going to be doing anything except watching this election because whether it 's hillary clinton or barack obama , it 'll be unprecedented and everyone will be glued to their screen , which they were . i started to think a lot about your childhood when i was reading this book - the experience of being in a forest and the work of your father . yes , he was an entomologist , but he was also an all-around naturalist and what they call in canada woodsman .
in other words , he was very experienced in what we call " the bush . " -lrb- ... -rrb- i would be very scared if this latest book of yours is a prophesy about the future . first of all , it 's not a prophesy because i do n't do prophesies ; no one can really predict the future .
even the old testament prophets were n't predicting the future , they were more or less saying this is the state of your soul now .
you ca n't really write about the future because nobody has been there .
it 's like dante writing about the inferno .
i hate to break this to you , but he did not actually go down into hell . -lrb- … -rrb- are you an optimist about the future ?
this book tells us about environmental devastation , which we hear about every day in the news . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dante never actually went to hell , quipped atwood it 's not actually about that so much .
the truth is , if you remove the people , nature comes back quite well , which is where we are when the book opens .
there 's quite a lot of nature .
it 's not that all of nature gets destroyed . -lrb- … -rrb- as william gibson says , the future is already here , but it 's unevenly distributed .
some people say global warming , but really they should say climate change because the weather gets more extreme .
things change .
it 's not that everything goes away , but things change .
and if they change too abruptly , what you get is a lot of die-off . what 's really scary in this book is not that so much , although that 's a motivator , but what 's scary is that we can make new species .
we already can make new species , and we 're doing it .
but the really scary thing is we can make new diseases .
we already have that capacity .
why has not some country made a disgusting new disease and unleashed it on everybody else ?
they 're afraid of the blow-back .
there 's no way of doing that without the possibility that your country will get it too , with things being so very spreadable . -lrb- … -rrb- what a lot of people do n't know is that your first publication was actually a book of poems . yes , but it was n't the first thing i wrote .
i was actually writing the prose and the poems at the same time .
it was just that in those days , in canada , where it what almost impossible to publish a full-length novel , poems were a lot cheaper , they were shorter .
and typically you started out writing them off on a mimeo machine or putting together a little cold type book or hand-setting them , which is what i did with my first little booklet of poems - i hand-set them on a flatbed press .
try hand-setting a novel on a flatbed press ! -lrb- … -rrb- would i be right in assuming that margaret atwood is an optimist ? anyone who writes a book is an optimist .
no matter what the content .
the optimistic thing about this thing is : it 's a book .
it has n't happened yet .

it 's even possible to earn money buy cutting emissions . from africa to south america to asia , when it comes to cooking , many people around the world face similar problems .
family members are forced to sit close by an open fireplace so smoky that the kitchen walls have been coated in black soot .
the children have coughs , and the women have already developed lung disease .
they 're the ones who do the majority of cooking , after all .
and that means long exposure to fires which cause bronchitis , asthma , and lung cancer .
according to the world health organization -lrb- who -rrb- , some 1.5 million people die each year from lung diseases resulting from wood-burning fires – more than the number of people who die each year from malaria .
firewood 's vicious cycle almost half the world 's population – around three billion people – cooks over open fires .
wood is the main fuel source but crop residue , dung , and charcoal are used as well .
it 's an economic and environmental vicious cycle .
forests are chopped down for firewood , resulting in an increase of erosion .
rain sweeps fertile topsoil from the fields , and harvests get smaller .
and the weather becomes drier , because the absence of forests changes the regional climate .
those who cook over open fires also lose valuable working time in the gathering of firewood – another factor that contributes to poverty .
and it 's a well-known fact that wood burning fires damage the climate , causing some 17 percent of carbon dioxide emissions globally .
bildunterschrift : a large pot over an open fire - many poor people still cook this way because of all these problems , development aid workers are pushing for greater availability of efficient stoves and ovens worldwide .
" they are a key factor in rural development , because they reduce poverty and illness and they help protect the climate , " said verena brinkmann , who works on the household energy program for germany 's technical aid organization , gtz .
used optimally , a new stove can help a family cut their annual fuel consumption in half , saving 1.5 tons of carbon dioxide .
clean cooking with the " rocket stove " efficient stoves and ovens are easy to build , says svane bender of the german environmental organization , nabu , which is working on a project to provide stoves to families in ethiopia .
" that 's the advantage they have in comparison to solar ovens , for example , which need a lot of imported parts , " bender said .
due to different regional factors such as fuel methods and what kind of food is commonly prepared determine which kind of oven meets the populations ' needs , a wide variety of efficient ovens are available " ethiopians eat a kind of flat , round bread known as injera , so an oven was developed for that purpose , " said bender .
in many projects , people learn how to build their own ovens out of clay , metal , or bricks .
well-insulated combustion chambers and wind protection that keeps cool air away from the cooking pot ensure efficiency .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in africa , 90 percent of all food is cooked - mainly the traditional way , over an open fire emerging economies like china and india currently have the most modern efficient stoves , thanks to strong government support for their expansion .
" purchasing power is important for success – and there 's plenty of purchasing power in both of these booming emerging nations , " said brinkmann .
but the new stoves are also becoming more popular in developing countries , especially in eastern africa .
in addition to ethiopia and kenya , uganda is considered to be a model example .
there , half a million households are cooking with the clay oven known as the rocket stove , which emits hardly any smoke .
according to the gtz , this particular model saves households a ton of wood each year .
the organization is training villagers to become professional stove builders .
without such commitment on the ground , even such well-intentioned projects can often fail after a very short time .
climate protection and profit modern cooking methods are also increasingly becoming important in south america , particularly in bolivia and peru .
the peruvian government aims to distribute some 500,000 efficient stoves among its people , with the help of companies such as microsol .
after all , they can earn money with efficient stoves , thanks to the clean development mechanism -lrb- cdm -rrb- within the framework of the kyoto protocol on climate protection .
it allows companies from the signatory nations to buy emissions credits for climate protection projects in developing countries .
they can either sell them , or use them to offset their own co2 reduction goals .
companies buy the certificates from firms such as microsol , which develop their own climate projects specifically for this purpose .
emissions certificates from projects which have achieved the so-called " gold standard " are especially expensive .
companies commit to such projects voluntarily , as they get a huge image boost from the standard 's rigorous criteria .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in uganda , the rocket stove has become popular .
it 's built out of clay and has a chimney until now , only four stove projects have registered globally for emissions trading ; 13 others projects are currently being evaluated by independent bodies on behalf of the cdm advisory board .
but many more projects are needed because , as the gtz has noted , efficient stoves and ovens have not yet achieved the global breakthrough that the united nations once hoped for .
the un millennium development goals agreed on in 2000 aimed to reduce the number of people still using traditional cooking methods by half .
but in order to reach this goal , some 500,000 modern stoves would have to be introduced each day – a utopian number .
despite this , development workers are hopeful .
through the measures put in place by the cdm , large sums of money from private investors can finally be made available , turning efficient stoves and ovens into mass market products .
" we have to see now , what the effects of the latest cdm business have been , " said brinkmann .
" but it seems clear that it offers new development potential to efficient cooking methods . "
that 's also the goal of the private un foundation that will found the " global alliance for clean ovens " at the end of march .
it aims to provide 50 million new units to developing countries in the next five years .

it 's even possible to earn money buy cutting emissions . from africa to south america to asia , when it comes to cooking , many people around the world face similar problems .
family members are forced to sit close by an open fireplace so smoky that the kitchen walls have been coated in black soot .
the children have coughs , and the women have already developed lung disease .
they 're the ones who do the majority of cooking , after all .
and that means long exposure to fires which cause bronchitis , asthma , and lung cancer .
according to the world health organization -lrb- who -rrb- , some 1.5 million people die each year from lung diseases resulting from wood-burning fires – more than the number of people who die each year from malaria .
firewood 's vicious cycle almost half the world 's population – around three billion people – cooks over open fires .
wood is the main fuel source but crop residue , dung , and charcoal are used as well .
it 's an economic and environmental vicious cycle .
forests are chopped down for firewood , resulting in an increase of erosion .
rain sweeps fertile topsoil from the fields , and harvests get smaller .
and the weather becomes drier , because the absence of forests changes the regional climate .
those who cook over open fires also lose valuable working time in the gathering of firewood – another factor that contributes to poverty .
and it 's a well-known fact that wood burning fires damage the climate , causing some 17 percent of carbon dioxide emissions globally .
bildunterschrift : a large pot over an open fire - many poor people still cook this way because of all these problems , development aid workers are pushing for greater availability of efficient stoves and ovens worldwide .
" they are a key factor in rural development , because they reduce poverty and illness and they help protect the climate , " said verena brinkmann , who works on the household energy program for germany 's technical aid organization , gtz .
used optimally , a new stove can help a family cut their annual fuel consumption in half , saving 1.5 tons of carbon dioxide .
clean cooking with the " rocket stove " efficient stoves and ovens are easy to build , says svane bender of the german environmental organization , nabu , which is working on a project to provide stoves to families in ethiopia .
" that 's the advantage they have in comparison to solar ovens , for example , which need a lot of imported parts , " bender said .
due to different regional factors such as fuel methods and what kind of food is commonly prepared determine which kind of oven meets the populations ' needs , a wide variety of efficient ovens are available " ethiopians eat a kind of flat , round bread known as injera , so an oven was developed for that purpose , " said bender .
in many projects , people learn how to build their own ovens out of clay , metal , or bricks .
well-insulated combustion chambers and wind protection that keeps cool air away from the cooking pot ensure efficiency .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in africa , 90 percent of all food is cooked - mainly the traditional way , over an open fire emerging economies like china and india currently have the most modern efficient stoves , thanks to strong government support for their expansion .
" purchasing power is important for success – and there 's plenty of purchasing power in both of these booming emerging nations , " said brinkmann .
but the new stoves are also becoming more popular in developing countries , especially in eastern africa .
in addition to ethiopia and kenya , uganda is considered to be a model example .
there , half a million households are cooking with the clay oven known as the rocket stove , which emits hardly any smoke .
according to the gtz , this particular model saves households a ton of wood each year .
the organization is training villagers to become professional stove builders .
without such commitment on the ground , even such well-intentioned projects can often fail after a very short time .
climate protection and profit modern cooking methods are also increasingly becoming important in south america , particularly in bolivia and peru .
the peruvian government aims to distribute some 500,000 efficient stoves among its people , with the help of companies such as microsol .
after all , they can earn money with efficient stoves , thanks to the clean development mechanism -lrb- cdm -rrb- within the framework of the kyoto protocol on climate protection .
it allows companies from the signatory nations to buy emissions credits for climate protection projects in developing countries .
they can either sell them , or use them to offset their own co2 reduction goals .
companies buy the certificates from firms such as microsol , which develop their own climate projects specifically for this purpose .
emissions certificates from projects which have achieved the so-called " gold standard " are especially expensive .
companies commit to such projects voluntarily , as they get a huge image boost from the standard 's rigorous criteria .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in uganda , the rocket stove has become popular .
it 's built out of clay and has a chimney until now , only four stove projects have registered globally for emissions trading ; 13 others projects are currently being evaluated by independent bodies on behalf of the cdm advisory board .
but many more projects are needed because , as the gtz has noted , efficient stoves and ovens have not yet achieved the global breakthrough that the united nations once hoped for .
the un millennium development goals agreed on in 2000 aimed to reduce the number of people still using traditional cooking methods by half .
but in order to reach this goal , some 500,000 modern stoves would have to be introduced each day – a utopian number .
despite this , development workers are hopeful .
through the measures put in place by the cdm , large sums of money from private investors can finally be made available , turning efficient stoves and ovens into mass market products .
" we have to see now , what the effects of the latest cdm business have been , " said brinkmann .
" but it seems clear that it offers new development potential to efficient cooking methods . "
that 's also the goal of the private un foundation that will found the " global alliance for clean ovens " at the end of march .
it aims to provide 50 million new units to developing countries in the next five years .

and it 's a well-known fact that wood burning fires damage the climate , causing some 17 percent of carbon dioxide emissions globally .
bildunterschrift : a large pot over an open fire - many poor people still cook this way because of all these problems , development aid workers are pushing for greater availability of efficient stoves and ovens worldwide .
" they are a key factor in rural development , because they reduce poverty and illness and they help protect the climate , " said verena brinkmann , who works on the household energy program for germany 's technical aid organization , gtz .
used optimally , a new stove can help a family cut their annual fuel consumption in half , saving 1.5 tons of carbon dioxide .
clean cooking with the " rocket stove " efficient stoves and ovens are easy to build , says svane bender of the german environmental organization , nabu , which is working on a project to provide stoves to families in ethiopia .
" that 's the advantage they have in comparison to solar ovens , for example , which need a lot of imported parts , " bender said .
due to different regional factors such as fuel methods and what kind of food is commonly prepared determine which kind of oven meets the populations ' needs , a wide variety of efficient ovens are available " ethiopians eat a kind of flat , round bread known as injera , so an oven was developed for that purpose , " said bender .
in many projects , people learn how to build their own ovens out of clay , metal , or bricks .
well-insulated combustion chambers and wind protection that keeps cool air away from the cooking pot ensure efficiency .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in africa , 90 percent of all food is cooked - mainly the traditional way , over an open fire emerging economies like china and india currently have the most modern efficient stoves , thanks to strong government support for their expansion .
" purchasing power is important for success – and there 's plenty of purchasing power in both of these booming emerging nations , " said brinkmann .
but the new stoves are also becoming more popular in developing countries , especially in eastern africa .
in addition to ethiopia and kenya , uganda is considered to be a model example .
there , half a million households are cooking with the clay oven known as the rocket stove , which emits hardly any smoke .
according to the gtz , this particular model saves households a ton of wood each year .
the organization is training villagers to become professional stove builders .
without such commitment on the ground , even such well-intentioned projects can often fail after a very short time .
climate protection and profit modern cooking methods are also increasingly becoming important in south america , particularly in bolivia and peru .
the peruvian government aims to distribute some 500,000 efficient stoves among its people , with the help of companies such as microsol .
after all , they can earn money with efficient stoves , thanks to the clean development mechanism -lrb- cdm -rrb- within the framework of the kyoto protocol on climate protection .
it allows companies from the signatory nations to buy emissions credits for climate protection projects in developing countries .
they can either sell them , or use them to offset their own co2 reduction goals .
companies buy the certificates from firms such as microsol , which develop their own climate projects specifically for this purpose .
emissions certificates from projects which have achieved the so-called " gold standard " are especially expensive .
companies commit to such projects voluntarily , as they get a huge image boost from the standard 's rigorous criteria .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in uganda , the rocket stove has become popular .
it 's built out of clay and has a chimney until now , only four stove projects have registered globally for emissions trading ; 13 others projects are currently being evaluated by independent bodies on behalf of the cdm advisory board .
but many more projects are needed because , as the gtz has noted , efficient stoves and ovens have not yet achieved the global breakthrough that the united nations once hoped for .
the un millennium development goals agreed on in 2000 aimed to reduce the number of people still using traditional cooking methods by half .
but in order to reach this goal , some 500,000 modern stoves would have to be introduced each day – a utopian number .
despite this , development workers are hopeful .
through the measures put in place by the cdm , large sums of money from private investors can finally be made available , turning efficient stoves and ovens into mass market products .
" we have to see now , what the effects of the latest cdm business have been , " said brinkmann .
" but it seems clear that it offers new development potential to efficient cooking methods . "
that 's also the goal of the private un foundation that will found the " global alliance for clean ovens " at the end of march .
it aims to provide 50 million new units to developing countries in the next five years .

" the year of the flood " is a futuristic account of the aftermath of a major natural disaster that seems to have obliterated most of humankind .
adam one - the leader of a religious group that melds science , religion and nature - had predicted such an event .
after it happens , he and his followers regroup in a world that is altered and unpredictable . born in 1939 , atwood has published short stories , critical studies , screenplays , books for children , and poems , but is best known for her novels .
her work has been translated into over 30 languages . click on the audio link below to listen to the complete interview with margaret atwood . deutsche welle : you lived in germany in the 1980s .
what did you experience during that time ? margaret atwood : i came to germany for the very first time for my german publisher in the 70s .
then , as it turned out , in 1984 , i began " the handmaid 's tale " in berlin before the wall came down .
i began it in berlin , i finished it in tuscaloosa , alabama , which is quite a contrast .
but both of them were situations that had built-in stresses , because west berlin at that time of course was encircled by the wall and every sunday the east german air force flew over and made sonic booms , just to remind us that they were there . -lrb- … -rrb- now in germany you 're presenting your new book " the year of the flood . "
how significant is it that this book was finished in the year of your 70th birthday ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the publication of atwood 's book was postponed because of the us elections it was actually finished a year earlier .
the publication was postponed for a year because if it had been published in 2008 , it would have coincided with the american election and the american publisher quite rightly said , nobody is going to be doing anything except watching this election because whether it 's hillary clinton or barack obama , it 'll be unprecedented and everyone will be glued to their screen , which they were . i started to think a lot about your childhood when i was reading this book - the experience of being in a forest and the work of your father . yes , he was an entomologist , but he was also an all-around naturalist and what they call in canada woodsman .
in other words , he was very experienced in what we call " the bush . " -lrb- ... -rrb- i would be very scared if this latest book of yours is a prophesy about the future . first of all , it 's not a prophesy because i do n't do prophesies ; no one can really predict the future .
even the old testament prophets were n't predicting the future , they were more or less saying this is the state of your soul now .
you ca n't really write about the future because nobody has been there .
it 's like dante writing about the inferno .
i hate to break this to you , but he did not actually go down into hell . -lrb- … -rrb- are you an optimist about the future ?
this book tells us about environmental devastation , which we hear about every day in the news . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dante never actually went to hell , quipped atwood it 's not actually about that so much .
the truth is , if you remove the people , nature comes back quite well , which is where we are when the book opens .
there 's quite a lot of nature .
it 's not that all of nature gets destroyed . -lrb- … -rrb- as william gibson says , the future is already here , but it 's unevenly distributed .
some people say global warming , but really they should say climate change because the weather gets more extreme .
things change .
it 's not that everything goes away , but things change .
and if they change too abruptly , what you get is a lot of die-off . what 's really scary in this book is not that so much , although that 's a motivator , but what 's scary is that we can make new species .
we already can make new species , and we 're doing it .
but the really scary thing is we can make new diseases .
we already have that capacity .
why has not some country made a disgusting new disease and unleashed it on everybody else ?
they 're afraid of the blow-back .
there 's no way of doing that without the possibility that your country will get it too , with things being so very spreadable . -lrb- … -rrb- what a lot of people do n't know is that your first publication was actually a book of poems . yes , but it was n't the first thing i wrote .
i was actually writing the prose and the poems at the same time .
it was just that in those days , in canada , where it what almost impossible to publish a full-length novel , poems were a lot cheaper , they were shorter .
and typically you started out writing them off on a mimeo machine or putting together a little cold type book or hand-setting them , which is what i did with my first little booklet of poems - i hand-set them on a flatbed press .
try hand-setting a novel on a flatbed press ! -lrb- … -rrb- would i be right in assuming that margaret atwood is an optimist ? anyone who writes a book is an optimist .
no matter what the content .

france has also opened an investigation into forged french passports . speaking to parliament on tuesday , british foreign secretary david miliband said there were " compelling reasons " to believe that the israeli intelligence agency mossad was behind the killing of mahmoud al-mabhouh in dubai on january 19 , and that israel 's position as a close ally to the uk added " insult to injury . "
" the government takes this matter extremely seriously , " he said .
" such misuse of british passports is intolerable . "
israel 's ambassador to london , ron prosor , said israel was " disappointed by the decision of the british government , " but his country remained committed to a relationship " of mutual importance . "
the expelled diplomat was not named by either country , although it was believed to be a member of the israeli embassy .
hamas leaders praised the uk 's actions and said they hoped israeli officials would eventually be brought to court over the killing .
ministry investigation britain 's foreign ministry briefed prosor on monday over the findings of an investigation into the passport forgeries .
miliband said 12 british citizens had their passports copied " when handed over for inspection to individuals linked to israel , " and that they were " wholly innocent victims of identity theft . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dubai authorities have 27 suspects in the murder investigation " given that this was a very sophisticated operation in which high-quality forgeries were made , the government judges it is highly likely that the forgeries were made by a state intelligence service , " he said .
miliband met israeli foreign minister avigdor lieberman in brussels on monday to discuss the issue , and said he asked for israel 's pledge that it would " never be party to the misuse of british passports in such a way . "
france probe meanwhile a paris prosecutor said tuesday that french authorities have opened their own investigation into forged french passports , four of which were also used in the hamas murder .
france began a preliminary investigation on march 12 .
the french passports were “ either delivered with a false identity or falsified with a photograph that did not correspond to the identity indicated , ” the prosecutor said in a statement .
president nicolas sarkozy has condemned al-mabhouh ’ s killing , but has not directly implied that the israeli secret service carried out the assassination .
israel has neither confirmed nor denied the allegations of mossad ’ s involvement , maintaining a strict policy of ambiguity with such sensitive matters .
dubai police say they have 27 suspects in the murder after closely examining security cameras at the hotel where al-mabhouh was killed. acb / dpa / ap / afp editor : ben knight send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

since then the country has made good progress , but what will the next two decades bring ?
experts say the outlook is positive . it was perhaps somewhat symbolic that namibia 's celebrations on sunday , march 21 , coincided with the swearing-in of its reelected president hifikepunye pohamba .
for 20 years , the southern african nation has been one of the most stable democracies on the continent .
unlike other african countries , perhaps most notably nearby zimbabwe , politics is not a main problem for namibia .
the challenges , say experts , lie elsewhere .
" the problems are the same ones as 20 years ago - providing work , food and places to live for the country 's two to three million inhabitants , " says publisher michael iwanowski , who wrote the first-ever german travel guide to namibia and led a number of official german delegations through the country .
" there 's no industry , and most people live from mining , tourism and subsistence farming .
but the elections were free and fair , and the government works well with the people . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : namibia is a country of stark , and often uninhabited , beauty namibia is the second-least densely populated country in the world , and has a nominal per capita gdp of only 3,178 euros -lrb- $ 4,278 -rrb- annually .
" the reason so few people live there is that there 's so little water , " says andre suren , a journalist for dw-tv , who was born in namibia and recently returned from filming a report there .
" provision of water is one problem , as are unemployment and poverty , which the government has made its top priority .
there also needs to be further reconciliation between tribes and between blacks and whites .
but the country has found its form of democracy . "
these are the sorts of issues that many african countries face .
but namibia is anything but a typical african nation in either its population or its history .
german south-west africa bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this plaque commemorates namibian victims of german colonial rule in the waning decades of the 19th century , namibia was one of the few places that germany , a belated colonial starter , was able to gain a foothold .
the territory officially became a colony in 1884 and was known as german south-west africa .
but germany 's rule there was hardly happy .
from 1904 to 1907 , the herero and nama tribes rebelled against their colonial master , and in the resultant fighting some 65,000 hereros , about 80 percent of the population , were killed .
in the course of world war i , south africa , which was controlled by britain , occupied namibia thanks to a league of nations mandate .
in 1946 , south africa refused to surrender that mandate even though it had been superseded by a united nations trusteeship agreement .
in 1966 , the south-west africa people 's organization , swapo , led a fight for independence , with heavy participation from the owambo tribe , which today makes up the majority of namibia 's population .
but it took until 1988 for south africa to agree to give up control over the country .
namibia officially gained sovereignty in 1990 , making it africa 's youngest country .
uranium and tourists bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : conditions in namibian townships are simple , but not inhuman namibia may be young and sparsely populated , but experts say those attributes help make its future prospects bright .
" namibia could profit from natural resources like copper and uranium , as those commodities get scarcer , " iwanowski told deutsche welle .
" but the big industry is tourism .
at least one third of the country is a nature reservation with deserts , savannahs and national parks , and most parts of the country are virtually uninhabited .
tourism has grown by 15 to 18 percent annually , and though those numbers are down a bit due to the global financial crisis , it 's still booming . "
probably among namibia 's most famous attractions are the namib and kalahari deserts , and the country needs to be careful about preserving its natural beauty .
" tourism accounts for some 70 percent of namibia 's economy , " says suren .
" that 's because the country is quite safe and easy to get to and get around in .
but namibians need to watch out for crime and environmental destruction . "
uranium mines have often been blamed for contaminating surrounding areas and putting aboriginal peoples at risk .
namibia 's natural resources have attracted the attention of a number of the world 's larger countries , who may put profits ahead of building up namibia 's own economy or preserving its environment .
china , which is very active throughout africa , has come under particular criticism for exploiting namibia 's natural wealth while polluting the land and failing to give back anything to the namibian people .
coming to terms bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : evidence of germany 's presence in namibia crops up everywhere and what about germany , the country which , in light of the colonial past , has one of the closest connections to namibia ?
the experts say that namibia is a main focus of german foreign developmental aid , but that berlin could perhaps do more in other areas .
" there needs to be a coming to terms with colonial history , " suren says .
" that would help reconciliation between tribes like the owambos and the hereros and also between blacks and whites .
germany should also support namibian political parties , increase the exchange possibilities for politicians and do more to help the namibian media . "
and there 's more connecting germany and namibia than just history .
" germans make up two-thirds of all tourists to namibia , and german developmental aid is very significant , " iwanowki says .
" berlin is partner city to the namibian capital , windhoek , and there are many parallels .
just as namibia gained independence 20 years ago , it was 20 years ago since the berlin wall fell . "
nothing is certain in the world 's poorest continent .
but if these experts are correct , africa 's youngest nation has a comparatively bright future .

in an interview on deutschlandfunk national radio westerwelle said , " germany is convinced that the settlement program must be frozen .
this is not just germany 's stance , but of the european union and the entire international community . "
he also stated that a two-state solution for israelis and palestinians is advocated not only by germany , but also by the rest of the eu and the united states .
" we want a two-state solution , " said westerwelle .
" a two-state solution is the only solution that can truly bring peace . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : goerzig says engaging hamas could be good leverage with israel when asked about an appropriate time for the eu to increase its pressure on israel , westerwelle said it would be best to first see what results come from last week 's middle east quartet talks in moscow between the eu , the us , russia , and the united nations .
increasing the pressure eu foreign ministers universally condemned israeli policies at a meeting on monday in brussels , but remained at odds on how to put more pressure on the country .
the eu is israel 's largest trading partner , and the bloc has so far declined to impose trade sanctions .
but carolin goerzig , an analyst at the european union institute for security studies in paris , told deutsche welle that if the eu wants to increase its leverage on israel in order to stop the building of further settlements , the bloc should engage greater discussion with hamas .
" so far the little pressure that has been exerted on israel has not proven fruitful really , and at the same time going to the other extreme could also backfire , " said goerzig .
" so what could really pressure israel is a moderation of hamas , because then israel would have to show face and react . "
goerzig added that the conditions set out by the quartet for a palestinian government , which include the renunciation of violence , the recognition of israel 's right to exist , and a commitment to all agreements signed by the palestine liberation organization and israel , do not encourage hamas to come to the negotiating table .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu has been looking to increase its international presence " i 'm not saying we should recognize hamas as a negotiation partner right away , but it has never been stated what they would gain from agreeing to these quartet conditions , " said goerzig .
" hamas has shown some steps of moderation , but the eu has never reacted positively , so hamas always stands to lose without any benefits if it becomes more moderate . " testing eu foreign policy ?
the issue of israeli settlements is in some ways testing the eu 's - and germany 's - international role . but goerzig says the eu 's presence in the quartet was not as strong as it could have been .
" the eu has been shy about asserting itself in the quartet , which could be related to its lack of coherence , " said goerzig .

for 57 years , wolfgang wagner directed the festival , celebrating his grandfather 's operas .
hardly any other director has been the source of more controversy . there 's no question that wolfgang wagner was often controversial as a director and as a person .
people considered him too conservative or suggested that he was overshadowed by his brother wieland .
critics were often underwhelmed by his work as a director even though both of his productions of the classic " ring of the nibelungen " opera cycle were at least technically on point . but wagner quickly adjusted to the critical reaction and invited renowned directors from elsewhere to take over the opera 's production .
all of the great wagner directors from hans knappertbusch to christian thielemann came to bayreuth .
perhaps his most memorable staging came in 1976 with the " ring " production led by patrice chereau .
chereau , a french film and theater director , ushered in a new era in the modern reception of wagner together with the composer and director pierre boulez . the new wagner in recent years , unconventional productions by heiner mueller and christoph schlingensief sparked heated debate .
the " workshop " concept , in which young , unknown artists were given the chance to prove themselves on stage , proved disastrous .
this experiment particularly annoyed the longstanding stars of the bayreuth stage . wagner 's tenure had another handicap though : his mother was a friend of adolf hitler 's .
a 1970s documentary featured his mother praising hitler as " our blessed adolf , " which proved problematic for the festival itself .
even today , the wagner family is still trying to account for this part of its history . unparalleled contributions but wolfgang wagner 's greatest contribution to the " ring " festival was in his practical handling of the details .
he contributed like no one else to the appreciation of his grandfather 's work during the 20th century , and he helped oversee more than 1,700 productions in his career .
he succeeded in founding the richard wagner foundation in bayreuth in which public institutions contribute alongside the wagner family to offer a financial safety net for the future of the wagner festival .
under his direction , the festival has become one of the most publicized musical events in the world . the festival 's renown is part of the reason that the music world has followed the wagner clan 's conflicts so attentively .
at times , there were calls that wagner should step down and make room for someone new .
he refused , insisting on his lifetime contract and the opportunity it granted him to ensure that the wagner heritage would be preserved .
he was called stubborn and cranky , but he perfected the art of knowing when to sit a battle out . brand name bayreuth perhaps his daughters eva and katharina were named as his followers so that the then 89-year-old could no longer stand in the way of modernization and further progress in bayreuth .
but nevertheless , when wolfgang wagner stepped down from his post at the end of 2008 , he withdrew as a victor .
in the more than five decades in which he led the opera festival , he developed it into a brand and an event that is one of the most sought-after in the cultural arena .
each year , about 500,000 people go after the 60,000 tickets available each season - and they can encounter waiting times of up to 10 years . music lovers make their way alongside celebrities each year to bayreuth - which would have remained nothing more than another bavarian province were it not for wolfgang wagner .

in an interview on deutschlandfunk national radio westerwelle said , " germany is convinced that the settlement program must be frozen .
this is not just germany 's stance , but of the european union and the entire international community . "
he also stated that a two-state solution for israelis and palestinians is advocated not only by germany , but also by the rest of the eu and the united states .
" we want a two-state solution , " said westerwelle .
" a two-state solution is the only solution that can truly bring peace . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : goerzig says engaging hamas could be good leverage with israel when asked about an appropriate time for the eu to increase its pressure on israel , westerwelle said it would be best to first see what results come from last week 's middle east quartet talks in moscow between the eu , the us , russia , and the united nations .
increasing the pressure eu foreign ministers universally condemned israeli policies at a meeting on monday in brussels , but remained at odds on how to put more pressure on the country .
the eu is israel 's largest trading partner , and the bloc has so far declined to impose trade sanctions .
but carolin goerzig , an analyst at the european union institute for security studies in paris , told deutsche welle that if the eu wants to increase its leverage on israel in order to stop the building of further settlements , the bloc should engage greater discussion with hamas .
" so far the little pressure that has been exerted on israel has not proven fruitful really , and at the same time going to the other extreme could also backfire , " said goerzig .
" so what could really pressure israel is a moderation of hamas , because then israel would have to show face and react . "
goerzig added that the conditions set out by the quartet for a palestinian government , which include the renunciation of violence , the recognition of israel 's right to exist , and a commitment to all agreements signed by the palestine liberation organization and israel , do not encourage hamas to come to the negotiating table .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu has been looking to increase its international presence " i 'm not saying we should recognize hamas as a negotiation partner right away , but it has never been stated what they would gain from agreeing to these quartet conditions , " said goerzig .
" hamas has shown some steps of moderation , but the eu has never reacted positively , so hamas always stands to lose without any benefits if it becomes more moderate . " testing eu foreign policy ?
the issue of israeli settlements is in some ways testing the eu 's - and germany 's - international role . but goerzig says the eu 's presence in the quartet was not as strong as it could have been .
" the eu has been shy about asserting itself in the quartet , which could be related to its lack of coherence , " said goerzig .
" there is a need for debate on this issue in the eu , and i think germany could drive such a debate . "
the eu foreign policy chief catherine ashton said recently she will push for the launch of " proximity " talks between the israelis and the palestinians as a prologue to formal negotiations .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de music -pipe- 23.03.2010 opinion : wolfgang wagner transformed bayreuth großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bayreuth festival has lost its patriarch .
for 57 years , wolfgang wagner directed the festival , celebrating his grandfather 's operas .
hardly any other director has been the source of more controversy . there 's no question that wolfgang wagner was often controversial as a director and as a person .
people considered him too conservative or suggested that he was overshadowed by his brother wieland .
critics were often underwhelmed by his work as a director even though both of his productions of the classic " ring of the nibelungen " opera cycle were at least technically on point . but wagner quickly adjusted to the critical reaction and invited renowned directors from elsewhere to take over the opera 's production .
all of the great wagner directors from hans knappertbusch to christian thielemann came to bayreuth .
perhaps his most memorable staging came in 1976 with the " ring " production led by patrice chereau .
chereau , a french film and theater director , ushered in a new era in the modern reception of wagner together with the composer and director pierre boulez . the new wagner in recent years , unconventional productions by heiner mueller and christoph schlingensief sparked heated debate .
the " workshop " concept , in which young , unknown artists were given the chance to prove themselves on stage , proved disastrous .
this experiment particularly annoyed the longstanding stars of the bayreuth stage . wagner 's tenure had another handicap though : his mother was a friend of adolf hitler 's .
a 1970s documentary featured his mother praising hitler as " our blessed adolf , " which proved problematic for the festival itself .
even today , the wagner family is still trying to account for this part of its history . unparalleled contributions but wolfgang wagner 's greatest contribution to the " ring " festival was in his practical handling of the details .
he contributed like no one else to the appreciation of his grandfather 's work during the 20th century , and he helped oversee more than 1,700 productions in his career .
he succeeded in founding the richard wagner foundation in bayreuth in which public institutions contribute alongside the wagner family to offer a financial safety net for the future of the wagner festival .
under his direction , the festival has become one of the most publicized musical events in the world . the festival 's renown is part of the reason that the music world has followed the wagner clan 's conflicts so attentively .
at times , there were calls that wagner should step down and make room for someone new .
he refused , insisting on his lifetime contract and the opportunity it granted him to ensure that the wagner heritage would be preserved .
he was called stubborn and cranky , but he perfected the art of knowing when to sit a battle out . brand name bayreuth perhaps his daughters eva and katharina were named as his followers so that the then 89-year-old could no longer stand in the way of modernization and further progress in bayreuth .
but nevertheless , when wolfgang wagner stepped down from his post at the end of 2008 , he withdrew as a victor .
in the more than five decades in which he led the opera festival , he developed it into a brand and an event that is one of the most sought-after in the cultural arena .
each year , about 500,000 people go after the 60,000 tickets available each season - and they can encounter waiting times of up to 10 years . music lovers make their way alongside celebrities each year to bayreuth - which would have remained nothing more than another bavarian province were it not for wolfgang wagner .
the bayreuth festival now mourns its director , who was at once the head of a family , a skilled organizer and a businessman .
his contributions at the green hill of bayreuth will endure . gudrun stegen is the music editor for deutsche welle 's german service . -lrb- gsw -rrb- editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the year of the flood " is a futuristic account of the aftermath of a major natural disaster that seems to have obliterated most of humankind .
adam one - the leader of a religious group that melds science , religion and nature - had predicted such an event .
after it happens , he and his followers regroup in a world that is altered and unpredictable . born in 1939 , atwood has published short stories , critical studies , screenplays , books for children , and poems , but is best known for her novels .
her work has been translated into over 30 languages . click on the audio link below to listen to the complete interview with margaret atwood . deutsche welle : you lived in germany in the 1980s .
what did you experience during that time ? margaret atwood : i came to germany for the very first time for my german publisher in the 70s .
then , as it turned out , in 1984 , i began " the handmaid 's tale " in berlin before the wall came down .
i began it in berlin , i finished it in tuscaloosa , alabama , which is quite a contrast .
but both of them were situations that had built-in stresses , because west berlin at that time of course was encircled by the wall and every sunday the east german air force flew over and made sonic booms , just to remind us that they were there . -lrb- … -rrb- now in germany you 're presenting your new book " the year of the flood . "
how significant is it that this book was finished in the year of your 70th birthday ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the publication of atwood 's book was postponed because of the us elections it was actually finished a year earlier .
the publication was postponed for a year because if it had been published in 2008 , it would have coincided with the american election and the american publisher quite rightly said , nobody is going to be doing anything except watching this election because whether it 's hillary clinton or barack obama , it 'll be unprecedented and everyone will be glued to their screen , which they were . i started to think a lot about your childhood when i was reading this book - the experience of being in a forest and the work of your father . yes , he was an entomologist , but he was also an all-around naturalist and what they call in canada woodsman .
in other words , he was very experienced in what we call " the bush . " -lrb- ... -rrb- i would be very scared if this latest book of yours is a prophesy about the future . first of all , it 's not a prophesy because i do n't do prophesies ; no one can really predict the future .
even the old testament prophets were n't predicting the future , they were more or less saying this is the state of your soul now .
you ca n't really write about the future because nobody has been there .
it 's like dante writing about the inferno .

this book tells us about environmental devastation , which we hear about every day in the news . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dante never actually went to hell , quipped atwood it 's not actually about that so much .
the truth is , if you remove the people , nature comes back quite well , which is where we are when the book opens .
there 's quite a lot of nature .
it 's not that all of nature gets destroyed . -lrb- … -rrb- as william gibson says , the future is already here , but it 's unevenly distributed .
some people say global warming , but really they should say climate change because the weather gets more extreme .
things change .
it 's not that everything goes away , but things change .
and if they change too abruptly , what you get is a lot of die-off . what 's really scary in this book is not that so much , although that 's a motivator , but what 's scary is that we can make new species .

i was actually writing the prose and the poems at the same time .
it was just that in those days , in canada , where it what almost impossible to publish a full-length novel , poems were a lot cheaper , they were shorter .
and typically you started out writing them off on a mimeo machine or putting together a little cold type book or hand-setting them , which is what i did with my first little booklet of poems - i hand-set them on a flatbed press .

the decision brings croatia one step closer to its goal of eu membership . the slovenian constitutional court on tuesday ruled as constitutional a deal to negotiate an end to the nearly 19-year-old border dispute with croatia , raising the likelihood of zagreb 's european union accession by its goal of 2012 .
the slovenian parliament must still ratify the agreement , which croatia did last november .
speaking to reporters after the decision , slovenian prime minister borut pahor said he was " very pleased . "
he also suggested the ruling center-left coalition government may not seek a public referendum on the issue as it had previously planned .
" personally , i 'm ready to seek ratification in parliament even without a referendum and i plan to talk with parliamentary parties about that , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : control of piran bay would give slovenia direct access to international waters pahor and croatian prime minister jadranka kosor agreed on the arbitration plan last september , but pahor asked the court to rule on the agreement 's constitutionality in light of criticism from opposition parties .
threat of referendum recent polls suggest about 60 percent of slovenians support the arbitration agreement , but analysts say a public referendum could turn into a vote of confidence on the government , which is declining in popularity .
opposition parties in slovenia have said arbitration with croatia would harm their country 's interests , and have vowed to push for a public vote .
the agreement would allow international arbitrators to help settle the dispute , which centers on the idyllic piran bay in the northern adriatic sea .
control of the land would give slovenia direct access to international waters .
slovenia was admitted to the eu in 2004 and is still the only former yugoslavian state to have done so .
it blocked a third of croatia 's negotiations on eu accession in december 2008 because of the border dispute , and kept them on hold until it reached the arbitration agreement with zagreb last september. acb / afp / reuters editor : ben knight send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de elections -pipe- 23.03.2010 sarkozy reshuffles cabinet after crushing election defeat großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : socialists took control in all but one region of france french president nicolas sarkozy has made only minor cabinet changes after his center-right bloc suffered heavy defeats in regional elections .
the appointments may help him garner support within his party . although president nicolas sarkozy has said that the regional election results were not an indictment of his national government , he met with prime minister francois fillon on monday to discuss a cabinet reshuffle . following those talks , the president announced that he was sacking a senior minister in what was seen as an effort to regain the initiative . labor minister xavier darcos , who had been set to lead negotiations over controversial pension reforms , was sent packing because his party 's defeat in sunday 's vote meant he no longer had the necessary credibility to oversee the overhaul of the costly french pension system .
he is to be replaced by eric woerth , the current budget minister . francois baroin , a close ally of former president jacques chirac , is to replace woerth in a move expected to appease the chirac " old guard " in sarkozy ’ s conservative ump party .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president sarkozy said the results were not an indictment of his government sarkozy has nominated georges tron , who is an ally of former prime minister dominique de villepin , as junior minister for the civil service . villepin , an opponent of the president , is expected to announce later this week that he will set up a rival centre-right political party .
the appointment of tron deprives villepin of a possible ally .
another conservative , marc-philippe daubresse , became minister for youth .
he effectively replaces centre-left politician martin hirsch , who had been a symbol of sarkozy ’ s effort to recruit talent from the opposition . future reshuffle possible with only two officials leaving the government , the changes are seen as relatively minor , with a more wide-ranging reshuffle possible ahead of presidential elections in 2012 .
in sunday 's second-round run-off vote , the socialist-led opposition beat sarkozy 's union for a popular movement -lrb- ump -rrb- by a margin of 54 percent to 36 percent .
the left gained control of 21 of france 's 22 mainland regions . the far-right front national came away with 9.3 percent nationwide , after qualifying for the second round in nine regions .
but veteran party leader jean-marie le pen scored big in his home region in southern france , winning more than 22 percent of the vote .
voter turnout , at 51 percent , was four points higher than last sunday 's first round of polling .
pollsters say the country 's anemic economy and growing unemployment as well as sarkozy 's relentless reform course have disillusioned voters .
also , a string of recent controversies , ranging from a debate on national identity to accusations of nepotism , have been eroding his popularity .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : villepin is set to announce plans to form a rival party alsace remains conservative although sunday 's election outcome was a triumph for the socialists , the ump looks set to hold on to its traditional stronghold , the alsace region along the german border . but the island of corsica , another conservative bastion , was snatched from the ump by the socialist alliance .
the ump held on to french guyana and reunion , while guadeloupe went to the socialists .
the result is very similar to the last regional poll in 2004 when the socialists came away with 20 of the 22 mainland districts , but were defeated in the presidential election three years later .
even so , the poll is seen as a rejection of sarkozy and his policies and perhaps the worst defeat of his political career .
the president has already announced a hiatus in reform plans for next year and this loss could make him even more cautious about pushing painful changes. gb / db / afp / apn / dpa / reuters editor : ben knight send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the appointments may help him garner support within his party . although president nicolas sarkozy has said that the regional election results were not an indictment of his national government , he met with prime minister francois fillon on monday to discuss a cabinet reshuffle . following those talks , the president announced that he was sacking a senior minister in what was seen as an effort to regain the initiative . labor minister xavier darcos , who had been set to lead negotiations over controversial pension reforms , was sent packing because his party 's defeat in sunday 's vote meant he no longer had the necessary credibility to oversee the overhaul of the costly french pension system .
he is to be replaced by eric woerth , the current budget minister . francois baroin , a close ally of former president jacques chirac , is to replace woerth in a move expected to appease the chirac " old guard " in sarkozy ’ s conservative ump party .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president sarkozy said the results were not an indictment of his government sarkozy has nominated georges tron , who is an ally of former prime minister dominique de villepin , as junior minister for the civil service . villepin , an opponent of the president , is expected to announce later this week that he will set up a rival centre-right political party .
the appointment of tron deprives villepin of a possible ally .
another conservative , marc-philippe daubresse , became minister for youth .
he effectively replaces centre-left politician martin hirsch , who had been a symbol of sarkozy ’ s effort to recruit talent from the opposition . future reshuffle possible with only two officials leaving the government , the changes are seen as relatively minor , with a more wide-ranging reshuffle possible ahead of presidential elections in 2012 .
in sunday 's second-round run-off vote , the socialist-led opposition beat sarkozy 's union for a popular movement -lrb- ump -rrb- by a margin of 54 percent to 36 percent .
the left gained control of 21 of france 's 22 mainland regions . the far-right front national came away with 9.3 percent nationwide , after qualifying for the second round in nine regions .
but veteran party leader jean-marie le pen scored big in his home region in southern france , winning more than 22 percent of the vote .
voter turnout , at 51 percent , was four points higher than last sunday 's first round of polling .
pollsters say the country 's anemic economy and growing unemployment as well as sarkozy 's relentless reform course have disillusioned voters .
also , a string of recent controversies , ranging from a debate on national identity to accusations of nepotism , have been eroding his popularity .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : villepin is set to announce plans to form a rival party alsace remains conservative although sunday 's election outcome was a triumph for the socialists , the ump looks set to hold on to its traditional stronghold , the alsace region along the german border . but the island of corsica , another conservative bastion , was snatched from the ump by the socialist alliance .
the ump held on to french guyana and reunion , while guadeloupe went to the socialists .
the result is very similar to the last regional poll in 2004 when the socialists came away with 20 of the 22 mainland districts , but were defeated in the presidential election three years later .
even so , the poll is seen as a rejection of sarkozy and his policies and perhaps the worst defeat of his political career .
the president has already announced a hiatus in reform plans for next year and this loss could make him even more cautious about pushing painful changes. gb / db / afp / apn / dpa / reuters editor : ben knight send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

since then the country has made good progress , but what will the next two decades bring ?
experts say the outlook is positive . it was perhaps somewhat symbolic that namibia 's celebrations on sunday , march 21 , coincided with the swearing-in of its reelected president hifikepunye pohamba .
for 20 years , the southern african nation has been one of the most stable democracies on the continent .
unlike other african countries , perhaps most notably nearby zimbabwe , politics is not a main problem for namibia .
the challenges , say experts , lie elsewhere .
" the problems are the same ones as 20 years ago - providing work , food and places to live for the country 's two to three million inhabitants , " says publisher michael iwanowski , who wrote the first-ever german travel guide to namibia and led a number of official german delegations through the country .
" there 's no industry , and most people live from mining , tourism and subsistence farming .
but the elections were free and fair , and the government works well with the people . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : namibia is a country of stark , and often uninhabited , beauty namibia is the second-least densely populated country in the world , and has a nominal per capita gdp of only 3,178 euros -lrb- $ 4,278 -rrb- annually .
" the reason so few people live there is that there 's so little water , " says andre suren , a journalist for dw-tv , who was born in namibia and recently returned from filming a report there .
" provision of water is one problem , as are unemployment and poverty , which the government has made its top priority .
there also needs to be further reconciliation between tribes and between blacks and whites .
but the country has found its form of democracy . "
these are the sorts of issues that many african countries face .
but namibia is anything but a typical african nation in either its population or its history .
german south-west africa bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this plaque commemorates namibian victims of german colonial rule in the waning decades of the 19th century , namibia was one of the few places that germany , a belated colonial starter , was able to gain a foothold .
the territory officially became a colony in 1884 and was known as german south-west africa .
but germany 's rule there was hardly happy .
from 1904 to 1907 , the herero and nama tribes rebelled against their colonial master , and in the resultant fighting some 65,000 hereros , about 80 percent of the population , were killed .
in the course of world war i , south africa , which was controlled by britain , occupied namibia thanks to a league of nations mandate .
in 1946 , south africa refused to surrender that mandate even though it had been superseded by a united nations trusteeship agreement .
in 1966 , the south-west africa people 's organization , swapo , led a fight for independence , with heavy participation from the owambo tribe , which today makes up the majority of namibia 's population .
but it took until 1988 for south africa to agree to give up control over the country .
namibia officially gained sovereignty in 1990 , making it africa 's youngest country .
uranium and tourists bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : conditions in namibian townships are simple , but not inhuman namibia may be young and sparsely populated , but experts say those attributes help make its future prospects bright .
" namibia could profit from natural resources like copper and uranium , as those commodities get scarcer , " iwanowski told deutsche welle .
" but the big industry is tourism .
at least one third of the country is a nature reservation with deserts , savannahs and national parks , and most parts of the country are virtually uninhabited .
tourism has grown by 15 to 18 percent annually , and though those numbers are down a bit due to the global financial crisis , it 's still booming . "
probably among namibia 's most famous attractions are the namib and kalahari deserts , and the country needs to be careful about preserving its natural beauty .
" tourism accounts for some 70 percent of namibia 's economy , " says suren .
" that 's because the country is quite safe and easy to get to and get around in .
but namibians need to watch out for crime and environmental destruction . "
uranium mines have often been blamed for contaminating surrounding areas and putting aboriginal peoples at risk .
namibia 's natural resources have attracted the attention of a number of the world 's larger countries , who may put profits ahead of building up namibia 's own economy or preserving its environment .
china , which is very active throughout africa , has come under particular criticism for exploiting namibia 's natural wealth while polluting the land and failing to give back anything to the namibian people .
coming to terms bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : evidence of germany 's presence in namibia crops up everywhere and what about germany , the country which , in light of the colonial past , has one of the closest connections to namibia ?
the experts say that namibia is a main focus of german foreign developmental aid , but that berlin could perhaps do more in other areas .
" there needs to be a coming to terms with colonial history , " suren says .
" that would help reconciliation between tribes like the owambos and the hereros and also between blacks and whites .
germany should also support namibian political parties , increase the exchange possibilities for politicians and do more to help the namibian media . "
and there 's more connecting germany and namibia than just history .
" germans make up two-thirds of all tourists to namibia , and german developmental aid is very significant , " iwanowki says .
" berlin is partner city to the namibian capital , windhoek , and there are many parallels .
just as namibia gained independence 20 years ago , it was 20 years ago since the berlin wall fell . "
nothing is certain in the world 's poorest continent .
but if these experts are correct , africa 's youngest nation has a comparatively bright future .

businesses operating in markets such as energy generation , environmental technology , security services as well as the space and aviation industry were the focus of the government program , bruederle said at a news conference in berlin .
" the global economy is expected to grow by 6 percent this year , and we want to profit from this growth , " he said , adding that countries such as china , india and brazil were leading the world economy out of the current slump .
silver lining the government 's export program comes after the steepest decline in german exports in more than half a century .
the global economic crisis caused german exports to fall by a staggering 18 percent last year to 803 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.1 trillion -rrb- , after a record in 2008 of about 947 billion euros . this means that germany lost its position as the world 's leading export nation to china last year .
bildunterschrift : solar companies stand to profit from the measures a slow recovery of german exports in the second half of 2009 could now come to a halt as the stimulus packages introduced by governments worldwide run out .
" the upswing is fragile and not yet self-sustaining , " bruederle argued as he outlined his program .
set of instruments key elements of the new plan are government loan guarantees for export deals , as well as state funding for companies seeking to explore new markets .
for that the government plans to open new chambers of commerce and trade in azerbaijan , ghana , iraq , kenya and libya .
bruederle plans to sign bilateral free trade agreements with countries in asia and latin america intended to open up markets there for german exports .
he also wants to reduce bureaucracy in his ministry so that funding could be provided more easily and quickly .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bruederle said german exports were n't responsible for the crisis successful completion of the doha round of free trade talks is also high on bruederle 's agenda for this year .
' unfounded criticism ' the economy minister rejected recent criticism of germany 's export boom voiced by his french counterpart christine lagarde .
last week lagarde argued that germany 's huge trade surpluses with countries in europe had created imbalances that were partly responsible for the budget problems in greece and other eu nations .
" such criticism is unfounded , " bruederle said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de international relations -pipe- 23.03.2010 health care success may provide boost for obama on the world stage großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama 's health care success was noted internationally as well the passage of health care reform by congress was not only an historic success for president barack obama .
this domestic victory could also help the administration make progress in the foreign policy arena . it does n't happen very often that germany 's political leadership celebrates the passage of a purely domestic bill by us congress .
but that was the case when h. r. 4872 was cleared by the house of representatives last weekend , even though the health care and education affordability reconciliation act of 2010 has nothing to do with transatlantic relations , international trade , climate change or security policy . the day after the vote , german chancellor angela merkel congratulated president obama for passing a central reform project of his presidency .
and germany 's foreign minister and vice-chancellor guido westerwelle said he expected that this success would provide a boost to the president 's foreign policy agenda .
the fact that both the german chancellor and foreign minister praised the passage of domestic legislative measure in congress underscores that the symbolic importance of this health care vote transcends national politics .
" the admiration for an american president who reached this worldwide accepted goal will increase because everybody knows that starting with president kennedy several american presidents tried to realize that goal and now obama has achieved this big success , " werner weidenfeld , who served for 12 years as the german government 's coordinator of transatlantic relations and now heads the center for applied policy research at the university of munich , told deutsche welle .
crucial vote the passage of the health care bill has gained particular importance because obama had proclaimed it as one of the main goals for his presidency , but failed to get it through congress during his first year in office .
what 's more , since the president could n't point to any other major successes following his inauguration , the health care vote had morphed from a mere legislative procedure into a make-or-break-situation for the obama presidency . bildunterschrift : health care reform is a highly contentious issue in the us after this domestic power battle , his political counterparts everywhere will realize that he is not just a president who announces initiatives , but one that can also follow through with it , said weidenfeld .
" he had to survive months of political fights and in the end he was victorious . "
this , added weidenfeld , will not go unnoticed on the international stage : " not that overnight now all his challenges will vanish , but professional observers , top politicians everywhere around the world will immediately realize ' do n't underestimate the capacity of this president . " '
while christian tuschhoff , professor for international relations at johannes gutenberg university mainz , does n't think the health care vote will have a direct effect on us foreign policy , he believes that the passage of the bill presents a good opportunity for obama .
" he has achieved the first step and will be able to build momentum if he can add a couple of successes to the one that happened last weekend .
if that scenario becomes true a lot of things will simply fall in place , " tuschhoff told deutsche welle .
arms reduction in the foreign policy realm , the experts believe that the disarmament issue would be a suitable next step for obama to build on his domestic success .
the successor to the start nuclear arms reduction treaty with russia is long overdue and could be unveiled in the coming weeks to coincide with a major global nuclear disarmament conference obama will convene next month in washington .
an agreement by the us and russia , the world 's main nuclear powers , to slash their arsenals would increase the leverage for obama to convince other nations to reduce their nuclear weapons stockpile .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us and russia still have n't agreed on a successor to the start treaty weidenfeld says that obama can now claim that he tackled a huge health care reform with historic implications when nobody thought he could get it done .
" in international politics the nuclear weapons challenge is of a similar dimension , so let 's tackle that too , " is how obama might approach this issue , according to weidenfeld .
but while the successful passage of the health care bill may increase his international stature and leverage it does n't guarantee that most of obama 's stalled foreign policy initiatives will fare any better now .
that 's because of a major difference between domestic and foreign policy : in domestic policy , the us government is the main actor , in international affairs , washington is a major , but never the only actor as is exemplified by the middle east conflict .
" if anything the israeli-palestinian conflict is more difficult than the health care issue , simply because obama can put pressure on both sides , but he can not act on behalf of them , " said tuschhoff .
whether the boost that obama stands to gain from the health care passage will last depends on whether he can replicate that achievement , say the experts .

but experts warn jobs could also go out the door . recovering from its worst slump since world war two , german industry plans to step up investments in international sales and distribution networks as well as production facilities in key foreign markets . according to a new report by the german chambers of industry and commerce -lrb- dihk -rrb- , 44 percent of the 9,000 companies surveyed said they intend to make investments in foreign countries , up from 40 percent last year .
more than a third -lrb- 37 percent -rrb- of the companies said they had plans to invest in china , up from 32 percent .
" need to start investing again " “ after experiencing a drop in exports of as much as 80 percent in some cases , german industrial companies see signs of a recovery , ” volker treier , chief economist at dihk , told deutsche welle .
“ many recognize a need to start investing again to maintain their presence abroad ; they do n't want to lose what they 've built up . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : low labor costs are no longer that main reason why german companies invest abroad financing is an issue , treier conceded .
he pointed to the reluctance of numerous banks stung by the global economic crisis to lend money to industrial companies - especially those planning investments in projects far away from germany .
“ this is definitely a problem but it is one where the banks , the government and other groups have been working together with industry to find solutions , ” treier said .
“ there are some measures underway to ensure the flow of credit . ”
today , 100 of germany 's largest publicly-listed companies generate more than two thirds of their sales outside the country .
a sizable chunk of these sales still come from products that are “ made in germany ” and sold in china .
german exports to china rose by 7 percent in 2009 , the federal statistical office reported monday .
the increase bucked the trend in a dismal year for germany , where overall exports slumped by 18 percent .
the exported goods were valued at 36.5 billion euros .
building logistics networks and new factories cheap labor is no longer a key driver of foreign investments by german industry , according to the dihk survey ; only 28 percent of the polled companies cited low production costs as a reason for their investments abroad – and only 20 percent for their investments in china .
“ that was the reason about five years ago but german manufacturers have since done much to increase productivity in their domestic operations , ” economist treier said .
“ the investments that are being made today or are planned in the near future are all about building up local sales and logistics networks and even new factories to take full advantage of huge emerging markets such as china , india and brazil ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daimler already builds cars in brazil and has plans for manufacturing in the us german car manufacturing , perhaps more than any other industry in the country , is racing ahead to win market share in these emerging markets .
volkswagen , for instance , is currently expanding its local production facilities in china and india as well as in the us .
“ german carmakers really do n't have an alternative , ” said thomas kautzsch , a manufacturing consultant with the management consultancy oliver wyman in munich . jobs in germany will go martin haubensak , a consultant with at kearny agrees .
“ vw tried to build everything in wolfsburg and then ship everything around the globe , ” he said .
“ now they realize it makes more sense , from an economic and competitive perspective , to build regionally . ”
investments in new production facilities abroad , however , will come at the expense of jobs in germany in the long term , experts agree .
“ we are definitely going to see some adjustments , ” said ferdinand dudenhoeffer , a professor at the university of duisburg-essen and an expert on the german car industry .
“ german carmakers need to manufacturer cars abroad for a number of reasons , including low labor costs and import duties .
the number of jobs in germany will definitely go down . ”
dudenhoeffer expects germany 's auto industry to shed 50,000 of its current 700,000 jobs by 2015 .
“ the future is in the new markets , ” he said .
“ production is already moving there . ”

the appointments may help him garner support within his party . although president nicolas sarkozy has said that the regional election results were not an indictment of his national government , he met with prime minister francois fillon on monday to discuss a cabinet reshuffle . following those talks , the president announced that he was sacking a senior minister in what was seen as an effort to regain the initiative . labor minister xavier darcos , who had been set to lead negotiations over controversial pension reforms , was sent packing because his party 's defeat in sunday 's vote meant he no longer had the necessary credibility to oversee the overhaul of the costly french pension system .
he is to be replaced by eric woerth , the current budget minister . francois baroin , a close ally of former president jacques chirac , is to replace woerth in a move expected to appease the chirac " old guard " in sarkozy ’ s conservative ump party .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president sarkozy said the results were not an indictment of his government sarkozy has nominated georges tron , who is an ally of former prime minister dominique de villepin , as junior minister for the civil service . villepin , an opponent of the president , is expected to announce later this week that he will set up a rival centre-right political party .
the appointment of tron deprives villepin of a possible ally .
another conservative , marc-philippe daubresse , became minister for youth .
he effectively replaces centre-left politician martin hirsch , who had been a symbol of sarkozy ’ s effort to recruit talent from the opposition . future reshuffle possible with only two officials leaving the government , the changes are seen as relatively minor , with a more wide-ranging reshuffle possible ahead of presidential elections in 2012 .
in sunday 's second-round run-off vote , the socialist-led opposition beat sarkozy 's union for a popular movement -lrb- ump -rrb- by a margin of 54 percent to 36 percent .
the left gained control of 21 of france 's 22 mainland regions . the far-right front national came away with 9.3 percent nationwide , after qualifying for the second round in nine regions .
but veteran party leader jean-marie le pen scored big in his home region in southern france , winning more than 22 percent of the vote .
voter turnout , at 51 percent , was four points higher than last sunday 's first round of polling .
pollsters say the country 's anemic economy and growing unemployment as well as sarkozy 's relentless reform course have disillusioned voters .
also , a string of recent controversies , ranging from a debate on national identity to accusations of nepotism , have been eroding his popularity .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : villepin is set to announce plans to form a rival party alsace remains conservative although sunday 's election outcome was a triumph for the socialists , the ump looks set to hold on to its traditional stronghold , the alsace region along the german border . but the island of corsica , another conservative bastion , was snatched from the ump by the socialist alliance .
the ump held on to french guyana and reunion , while guadeloupe went to the socialists .
the result is very similar to the last regional poll in 2004 when the socialists came away with 20 of the 22 mainland districts , but were defeated in the presidential election three years later .
even so , the poll is seen as a rejection of sarkozy and his policies and perhaps the worst defeat of his political career .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de literature -pipe- 23.03.2010 anyone who writes a book is an optimist , says author margaret atwood großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : margaret atwood celebrated her 70th birthday last year at the tail end of her latest international book tour , canadian-born author margaret atwood told deutsche welle about her most recent novel , " the year of the flood " - and hand-setting her very first publication . " the year of the flood " is a futuristic account of the aftermath of a major natural disaster that seems to have obliterated most of humankind .
adam one - the leader of a religious group that melds science , religion and nature - had predicted such an event .
after it happens , he and his followers regroup in a world that is altered and unpredictable . born in 1939 , atwood has published short stories , critical studies , screenplays , books for children , and poems , but is best known for her novels .
her work has been translated into over 30 languages . click on the audio link below to listen to the complete interview with margaret atwood . deutsche welle : you lived in germany in the 1980s .
what did you experience during that time ? margaret atwood : i came to germany for the very first time for my german publisher in the 70s .
then , as it turned out , in 1984 , i began " the handmaid 's tale " in berlin before the wall came down .
i began it in berlin , i finished it in tuscaloosa , alabama , which is quite a contrast .
but both of them were situations that had built-in stresses , because west berlin at that time of course was encircled by the wall and every sunday the east german air force flew over and made sonic booms , just to remind us that they were there . -lrb- … -rrb- now in germany you 're presenting your new book " the year of the flood . "
how significant is it that this book was finished in the year of your 70th birthday ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the publication of atwood 's book was postponed because of the us elections it was actually finished a year earlier .
the publication was postponed for a year because if it had been published in 2008 , it would have coincided with the american election and the american publisher quite rightly said , nobody is going to be doing anything except watching this election because whether it 's hillary clinton or barack obama , it 'll be unprecedented and everyone will be glued to their screen , which they were . i started to think a lot about your childhood when i was reading this book - the experience of being in a forest and the work of your father . yes , he was an entomologist , but he was also an all-around naturalist and what they call in canada woodsman .
in other words , he was very experienced in what we call " the bush . " -lrb- ... -rrb- i would be very scared if this latest book of yours is a prophesy about the future . first of all , it 's not a prophesy because i do n't do prophesies ; no one can really predict the future .
even the old testament prophets were n't predicting the future , they were more or less saying this is the state of your soul now .
you ca n't really write about the future because nobody has been there .
it 's like dante writing about the inferno .
i hate to break this to you , but he did not actually go down into hell . -lrb- … -rrb- are you an optimist about the future ?
this book tells us about environmental devastation , which we hear about every day in the news . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dante never actually went to hell , quipped atwood it 's not actually about that so much .
the truth is , if you remove the people , nature comes back quite well , which is where we are when the book opens .
there 's quite a lot of nature .
it 's not that all of nature gets destroyed . -lrb- … -rrb- as william gibson says , the future is already here , but it 's unevenly distributed .
some people say global warming , but really they should say climate change because the weather gets more extreme .
things change .
it 's not that everything goes away , but things change .
and if they change too abruptly , what you get is a lot of die-off . what 's really scary in this book is not that so much , although that 's a motivator , but what 's scary is that we can make new species .
we already can make new species , and we 're doing it .
but the really scary thing is we can make new diseases .
we already have that capacity .
why has not some country made a disgusting new disease and unleashed it on everybody else ?
they 're afraid of the blow-back .
there 's no way of doing that without the possibility that your country will get it too , with things being so very spreadable . -lrb- … -rrb- what a lot of people do n't know is that your first publication was actually a book of poems . yes , but it was n't the first thing i wrote .
i was actually writing the prose and the poems at the same time .
it was just that in those days , in canada , where it what almost impossible to publish a full-length novel , poems were a lot cheaper , they were shorter .
and typically you started out writing them off on a mimeo machine or putting together a little cold type book or hand-setting them , which is what i did with my first little booklet of poems - i hand-set them on a flatbed press .
try hand-setting a novel on a flatbed press ! -lrb- … -rrb- would i be right in assuming that margaret atwood is an optimist ? anyone who writes a book is an optimist .
no matter what the content .
the optimistic thing about this thing is : it 's a book .
it has n't happened yet .

but nyan win added that she had also said she wanted the party to decide on her own .
the junta recently announced new elections laws , which have been very controversial .
one of them bars people who are currently serving prison terms from being members of political parties .
it therefore stops suu kyi , who is currently under house arrest , from being a member of her own party , let alone allowing her to vote and herself run for election .
the nobel laureate has already spent 14 of the past 20 years in detention .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de auto industry -pipe- 23.03.2010 german industry invests more abroad großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vw already manufacturers cars in china where it sees huge growth potential foreign investments by german manufacturers are poised to bounce back this year as the global economic climate improves , according to a new study .
but experts warn jobs could also go out the door . recovering from its worst slump since world war two , german industry plans to step up investments in international sales and distribution networks as well as production facilities in key foreign markets . according to a new report by the german chambers of industry and commerce -lrb- dihk -rrb- , 44 percent of the 9,000 companies surveyed said they intend to make investments in foreign countries , up from 40 percent last year .
more than a third -lrb- 37 percent -rrb- of the companies said they had plans to invest in china , up from 32 percent .
" need to start investing again " “ after experiencing a drop in exports of as much as 80 percent in some cases , german industrial companies see signs of a recovery , ” volker treier , chief economist at dihk , told deutsche welle .
“ many recognize a need to start investing again to maintain their presence abroad ; they do n't want to lose what they 've built up . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : low labor costs are no longer that main reason why german companies invest abroad financing is an issue , treier conceded .
he pointed to the reluctance of numerous banks stung by the global economic crisis to lend money to industrial companies - especially those planning investments in projects far away from germany .
“ this is definitely a problem but it is one where the banks , the government and other groups have been working together with industry to find solutions , ” treier said .
“ there are some measures underway to ensure the flow of credit . ”
today , 100 of germany 's largest publicly-listed companies generate more than two thirds of their sales outside the country .
a sizable chunk of these sales still come from products that are “ made in germany ” and sold in china .
german exports to china rose by 7 percent in 2009 , the federal statistical office reported monday .
the increase bucked the trend in a dismal year for germany , where overall exports slumped by 18 percent .
the exported goods were valued at 36.5 billion euros .
building logistics networks and new factories cheap labor is no longer a key driver of foreign investments by german industry , according to the dihk survey ; only 28 percent of the polled companies cited low production costs as a reason for their investments abroad – and only 20 percent for their investments in china .
“ that was the reason about five years ago but german manufacturers have since done much to increase productivity in their domestic operations , ” economist treier said .
“ the investments that are being made today or are planned in the near future are all about building up local sales and logistics networks and even new factories to take full advantage of huge emerging markets such as china , india and brazil ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daimler already builds cars in brazil and has plans for manufacturing in the us german car manufacturing , perhaps more than any other industry in the country , is racing ahead to win market share in these emerging markets .
volkswagen , for instance , is currently expanding its local production facilities in china and india as well as in the us .
“ german carmakers really do n't have an alternative , ” said thomas kautzsch , a manufacturing consultant with the management consultancy oliver wyman in munich . jobs in germany will go martin haubensak , a consultant with at kearny agrees .

“ we are definitely going to see some adjustments , ” said ferdinand dudenhoeffer , a professor at the university of duisburg-essen and an expert on the german car industry .
“ german carmakers need to manufacturer cars abroad for a number of reasons , including low labor costs and import duties .
the number of jobs in germany will definitely go down . ”
dudenhoeffer expects germany 's auto industry to shed 50,000 of its current 700,000 jobs by 2015 .
“ the future is in the new markets , ” he said .
“ production is already moving there . ”

this domestic victory could also help the administration make progress in the foreign policy arena . it does n't happen very often that germany 's political leadership celebrates the passage of a purely domestic bill by us congress .
but that was the case when h. r. 4872 was cleared by the house of representatives last weekend , even though the health care and education affordability reconciliation act of 2010 has nothing to do with transatlantic relations , international trade , climate change or security policy . the day after the vote , german chancellor angela merkel congratulated president obama for passing a central reform project of his presidency .
and germany 's foreign minister and vice-chancellor guido westerwelle said he expected that this success would provide a boost to the president 's foreign policy agenda .
the fact that both the german chancellor and foreign minister praised the passage of domestic legislative measure in congress underscores that the symbolic importance of this health care vote transcends national politics .
" the admiration for an american president who reached this worldwide accepted goal will increase because everybody knows that starting with president kennedy several american presidents tried to realize that goal and now obama has achieved this big success , " werner weidenfeld , who served for 12 years as the german government 's coordinator of transatlantic relations and now heads the center for applied policy research at the university of munich , told deutsche welle .
crucial vote the passage of the health care bill has gained particular importance because obama had proclaimed it as one of the main goals for his presidency , but failed to get it through congress during his first year in office .
what 's more , since the president could n't point to any other major successes following his inauguration , the health care vote had morphed from a mere legislative procedure into a make-or-break-situation for the obama presidency . bildunterschrift : health care reform is a highly contentious issue in the us after this domestic power battle , his political counterparts everywhere will realize that he is not just a president who announces initiatives , but one that can also follow through with it , said weidenfeld .
" he had to survive months of political fights and in the end he was victorious . "
this , added weidenfeld , will not go unnoticed on the international stage : " not that overnight now all his challenges will vanish , but professional observers , top politicians everywhere around the world will immediately realize ' do n't underestimate the capacity of this president . " '
while christian tuschhoff , professor for international relations at johannes gutenberg university mainz , does n't think the health care vote will have a direct effect on us foreign policy , he believes that the passage of the bill presents a good opportunity for obama .
" he has achieved the first step and will be able to build momentum if he can add a couple of successes to the one that happened last weekend .
if that scenario becomes true a lot of things will simply fall in place , " tuschhoff told deutsche welle .
arms reduction in the foreign policy realm , the experts believe that the disarmament issue would be a suitable next step for obama to build on his domestic success .
the successor to the start nuclear arms reduction treaty with russia is long overdue and could be unveiled in the coming weeks to coincide with a major global nuclear disarmament conference obama will convene next month in washington .
an agreement by the us and russia , the world 's main nuclear powers , to slash their arsenals would increase the leverage for obama to convince other nations to reduce their nuclear weapons stockpile .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us and russia still have n't agreed on a successor to the start treaty weidenfeld says that obama can now claim that he tackled a huge health care reform with historic implications when nobody thought he could get it done .
" in international politics the nuclear weapons challenge is of a similar dimension , so let 's tackle that too , " is how obama might approach this issue , according to weidenfeld .
but while the successful passage of the health care bill may increase his international stature and leverage it does n't guarantee that most of obama 's stalled foreign policy initiatives will fare any better now .
that 's because of a major difference between domestic and foreign policy : in domestic policy , the us government is the main actor , in international affairs , washington is a major , but never the only actor as is exemplified by the middle east conflict .
" if anything the israeli-palestinian conflict is more difficult than the health care issue , simply because obama can put pressure on both sides , but he can not act on behalf of them , " said tuschhoff .
whether the boost that obama stands to gain from the health care passage will last depends on whether he can replicate that achievement , say the experts .

it 's even possible to earn money buy cutting emissions . from africa to south america to asia , when it comes to cooking , many people around the world face similar problems .
family members are forced to sit close by an open fireplace so smoky that the kitchen walls have been coated in black soot .
the children have coughs , and the women have already developed lung disease .
they 're the ones who do the majority of cooking , after all .
and that means long exposure to fires which cause bronchitis , asthma , and lung cancer .
according to the world health organization -lrb- who -rrb- , some 1.5 million people die each year from lung diseases resulting from wood-burning fires – more than the number of people who die each year from malaria .
firewood 's vicious cycle almost half the world 's population – around three billion people – cooks over open fires .
wood is the main fuel source but crop residue , dung , and charcoal are used as well .
it 's an economic and environmental vicious cycle .
forests are chopped down for firewood , resulting in an increase of erosion .
rain sweeps fertile topsoil from the fields , and harvests get smaller .
and the weather becomes drier , because the absence of forests changes the regional climate .
those who cook over open fires also lose valuable working time in the gathering of firewood – another factor that contributes to poverty .
and it 's a well-known fact that wood burning fires damage the climate , causing some 17 percent of carbon dioxide emissions globally .
bildunterschrift : a large pot over an open fire - many poor people still cook this way because of all these problems , development aid workers are pushing for greater availability of efficient stoves and ovens worldwide .
" they are a key factor in rural development , because they reduce poverty and illness and they help protect the climate , " said verena brinkmann , who works on the household energy program for germany 's technical aid organization , gtz .
used optimally , a new stove can help a family cut their annual fuel consumption in half , saving 1.5 tons of carbon dioxide .
clean cooking with the " rocket stove " efficient stoves and ovens are easy to build , says svane bender of the german environmental organization , nabu , which is working on a project to provide stoves to families in ethiopia .
" that 's the advantage they have in comparison to solar ovens , for example , which need a lot of imported parts , " bender said .
due to different regional factors such as fuel methods and what kind of food is commonly prepared determine which kind of oven meets the populations ' needs , a wide variety of efficient ovens are available " ethiopians eat a kind of flat , round bread known as injera , so an oven was developed for that purpose , " said bender .
in many projects , people learn how to build their own ovens out of clay , metal , or bricks .
well-insulated combustion chambers and wind protection that keeps cool air away from the cooking pot ensure efficiency .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in africa , 90 percent of all food is cooked - mainly the traditional way , over an open fire emerging economies like china and india currently have the most modern efficient stoves , thanks to strong government support for their expansion .
" purchasing power is important for success – and there 's plenty of purchasing power in both of these booming emerging nations , " said brinkmann .
but the new stoves are also becoming more popular in developing countries , especially in eastern africa .
in addition to ethiopia and kenya , uganda is considered to be a model example .
there , half a million households are cooking with the clay oven known as the rocket stove , which emits hardly any smoke .
according to the gtz , this particular model saves households a ton of wood each year .
the organization is training villagers to become professional stove builders .
without such commitment on the ground , even such well-intentioned projects can often fail after a very short time .
climate protection and profit modern cooking methods are also increasingly becoming important in south america , particularly in bolivia and peru .
the peruvian government aims to distribute some 500,000 efficient stoves among its people , with the help of companies such as microsol .
after all , they can earn money with efficient stoves , thanks to the clean development mechanism -lrb- cdm -rrb- within the framework of the kyoto protocol on climate protection .
it allows companies from the signatory nations to buy emissions credits for climate protection projects in developing countries .
they can either sell them , or use them to offset their own co2 reduction goals .
companies buy the certificates from firms such as microsol , which develop their own climate projects specifically for this purpose .
emissions certificates from projects which have achieved the so-called " gold standard " are especially expensive .
companies commit to such projects voluntarily , as they get a huge image boost from the standard 's rigorous criteria .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in uganda , the rocket stove has become popular .
it 's built out of clay and has a chimney until now , only four stove projects have registered globally for emissions trading ; 13 others projects are currently being evaluated by independent bodies on behalf of the cdm advisory board .
but many more projects are needed because , as the gtz has noted , efficient stoves and ovens have not yet achieved the global breakthrough that the united nations once hoped for .
the un millennium development goals agreed on in 2000 aimed to reduce the number of people still using traditional cooking methods by half .
but in order to reach this goal , some 500,000 modern stoves would have to be introduced each day – a utopian number .
despite this , development workers are hopeful .
through the measures put in place by the cdm , large sums of money from private investors can finally be made available , turning efficient stoves and ovens into mass market products .
" we have to see now , what the effects of the latest cdm business have been , " said brinkmann .
" but it seems clear that it offers new development potential to efficient cooking methods . "
that 's also the goal of the private un foundation that will found the " global alliance for clean ovens " at the end of march .
it aims to provide 50 million new units to developing countries in the next five years .

germany said it would make more than a billion euros available , a day ahead of an international ruling on subsidies . us aerospace giant boeing has condemned a german plan to make 1.1 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.5 billion -rrb- available to its arch-rival airbus .
the aircraft maker also criticized the timing of the announcement , a day ahead of an expected world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- ruling on state aid for aircraft makers .
german government aerospace coordinator peter hintze confirmed plans on monday to make development funds available for the medium-sized a350 passenger jet .
the aircraft is seen as a possible future market rival for the boeing 787 dreamliner .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : washington has complained to the world trade organization the us government along with boeing claims that loan payments by european governments to airbus aircraft are , in reality , unfair subsidies .
boeing believes that the wto is set to rule in its favor .
" on the eve of such an important decision , it is unfortunate and disappointing to see news reports quoting a senior german official saying that germany is prepared to provide 1.1 billion euros for the development of the airbus a350 , " said ted austell , vice president of boeing 's executive , legislative and regulatory affairs .
move defies the rules austell said the deal was " a move that flies in the face of both the expected wto decision and the rules-based global trading system we 've all endorsed . "
however , in a newspaper interview , the german aerospace co-ordinator said that the latest round of funding broke no rules .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hintze has said that the loan complies with trade rules " on our side all the pre-conditions are fulfilled .
the conditions of the loan are in conformity with wto rules and the funds are available , " hintze told german daily newspaper die welt .
the us complaint to the wto is that airbus received 150 billion euros in loans and other benefits on unfair terms from britain , france , germany and spain , over two decades .
although the wto ruling is not directly related to the a350 loan , it could affect the speed at which the money must be paid back .
the european commission has brought a counter-claim over financial aid to boeing against washington .
the two cases , combined , amount to the biggest dispute ever to be handled by the wto .
although governments expect to receive the final wto report on tuesday afternoon , the public release will not be until april. rc / ap / reuters / afp editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

germany said it would make more than a billion euros available , a day ahead of an international ruling on subsidies . us aerospace giant boeing has condemned a german plan to make 1.1 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.5 billion -rrb- available to its arch-rival airbus .
the aircraft maker also criticized the timing of the announcement , a day ahead of an expected world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- ruling on state aid for aircraft makers .
german government aerospace coordinator peter hintze confirmed plans on monday to make development funds available for the medium-sized a350 passenger jet .
the aircraft is seen as a possible future market rival for the boeing 787 dreamliner .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : washington has complained to the world trade organization the us government along with boeing claims that loan payments by european governments to airbus aircraft are , in reality , unfair subsidies .
boeing believes that the wto is set to rule in its favor .
" on the eve of such an important decision , it is unfortunate and disappointing to see news reports quoting a senior german official saying that germany is prepared to provide 1.1 billion euros for the development of the airbus a350 , " said ted austell , vice president of boeing 's executive , legislative and regulatory affairs .
move defies the rules austell said the deal was " a move that flies in the face of both the expected wto decision and the rules-based global trading system we 've all endorsed . "
however , in a newspaper interview , the german aerospace co-ordinator said that the latest round of funding broke no rules .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hintze has said that the loan complies with trade rules " on our side all the pre-conditions are fulfilled .
the conditions of the loan are in conformity with wto rules and the funds are available , " hintze told german daily newspaper die welt .
the us complaint to the wto is that airbus received 150 billion euros in loans and other benefits on unfair terms from britain , france , germany and spain , over two decades .
although the wto ruling is not directly related to the a350 loan , it could affect the speed at which the money must be paid back .
the european commission has brought a counter-claim over financial aid to boeing against washington .
the two cases , combined , amount to the biggest dispute ever to be handled by the wto .
although governments expect to receive the final wto report on tuesday afternoon , the public release will not be until april. rc / ap / reuters / afp editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

eu commission president barroso , however , has said he believes chancellor merkel will agree to a rescue plan . germany is braced for further confrontation with fellow eu members this week as the row intensified over aid for debt-ridden greece on monday .
chancellor angela merkel said that there was " no question of an urgent decision in the european council about aid for greece " when eu leaders meet in brussels on thursday .
merkel said that because greece had yet not asked for a bailout , the matter should not be considered .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel said that the greece rescue package should not be on the summit agenda but calls for action came as eu foreign ministers met on monday in the run-up to the leaders ' summit , led by european commission president jose manuel barroso .
action to protect stability barroso said that action was necessary before faith in the economic stability of the euro zone – and the euro itself – was undermined .
" we need a decision at this summit , " warned barroso .
" we ca n't keep going this way , we risk endangering the stability of the euro zone and feeding speculation . "
calls for intervention in the debt crisis faced by greece , which has introduced austerity measures of its own , were echoed at the brussels meeting by countries including france and italy .
" the french position is very clear , " said french foreign minister bernard kouchner .
" we can not , we must not abandon our greek friends . "
' not in total agreement ' after the meeting , kouchner added that " on this issue , we are not totally in agreement with our german friends . "
german foreign minister guido westerwelle had resisted the idea of any immediate rescue plan at the meeting .
" at the moment we see no need to make a final decision on any kind of option , " said westerwelle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso expressed confidence that merkel will help in an interview with the financial times published on tuesday , the commission president said he was confident that germany would provide financial help if necessary .
" i know chancellor angela merkel , " said barroso .
" she is a committed european and i have no doubts that she will , if needed , be in favor of providing financial assistance to greece . "
greek deputy prime minister theodoros pangalos on monday accused berlin of allowing its banks to take part in a " deplorable game " of speculating on greek bonds while german exporters profited from a weaker euro due to athens ' budget problems. rc / reuters / afp / ap / dpa editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

this domestic victory could also help the administration make progress in the foreign policy arena . it does n't happen very often that germany 's political leadership celebrates the passage of a purely domestic bill by us congress .
but that was the case when h. r. 4872 was cleared by the house of representatives last weekend , even though the health care and education affordability reconciliation act of 2010 has nothing to do with transatlantic relations , international trade , climate change or security policy . the day after the vote , german chancellor angela merkel congratulated president obama for passing a central reform project of his presidency .
and germany 's foreign minister and vice-chancellor guido westerwelle said he expected that this success would provide a boost to the president 's foreign policy agenda .
the fact that both the german chancellor and foreign minister praised the passage of domestic legislative measure in congress underscores that the symbolic importance of this health care vote transcends national politics .
" the admiration for an american president who reached this worldwide accepted goal will increase because everybody knows that starting with president kennedy several american presidents tried to realize that goal and now obama has achieved this big success , " werner weidenfeld , who served for 12 years as the german government 's coordinator of transatlantic relations and now heads the center for applied policy research at the university of munich , told deutsche welle .
crucial vote the passage of the health care bill has gained particular importance because obama had proclaimed it as one of the main goals for his presidency , but failed to get it through congress during his first year in office .
what 's more , since the president could n't point to any other major successes following his inauguration , the health care vote had morphed from a mere legislative procedure into a make-or-break-situation for the obama presidency . bildunterschrift : health care reform is a highly contentious issue in the us after this domestic power battle , his political counterparts everywhere will realize that he is not just a president who announces initiatives , but one that can also follow through with it , said weidenfeld .
" he had to survive months of political fights and in the end he was victorious . "
this , added weidenfeld , will not go unnoticed on the international stage : " not that overnight now all his challenges will vanish , but professional observers , top politicians everywhere around the world will immediately realize ' do n't underestimate the capacity of this president . " '
while christian tuschhoff , professor for international relations at johannes gutenberg university mainz , does n't think the health care vote will have a direct effect on us foreign policy , he believes that the passage of the bill presents a good opportunity for obama .
" he has achieved the first step and will be able to build momentum if he can add a couple of successes to the one that happened last weekend .
if that scenario becomes true a lot of things will simply fall in place , " tuschhoff told deutsche welle .
arms reduction in the foreign policy realm , the experts believe that the disarmament issue would be a suitable next step for obama to build on his domestic success .
the successor to the start nuclear arms reduction treaty with russia is long overdue and could be unveiled in the coming weeks to coincide with a major global nuclear disarmament conference obama will convene next month in washington .
an agreement by the us and russia , the world 's main nuclear powers , to slash their arsenals would increase the leverage for obama to convince other nations to reduce their nuclear weapons stockpile .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us and russia still have n't agreed on a successor to the start treaty weidenfeld says that obama can now claim that he tackled a huge health care reform with historic implications when nobody thought he could get it done .
" in international politics the nuclear weapons challenge is of a similar dimension , so let 's tackle that too , " is how obama might approach this issue , according to weidenfeld .
but while the successful passage of the health care bill may increase his international stature and leverage it does n't guarantee that most of obama 's stalled foreign policy initiatives will fare any better now .
that 's because of a major difference between domestic and foreign policy : in domestic policy , the us government is the main actor , in international affairs , washington is a major , but never the only actor as is exemplified by the middle east conflict .
" if anything the israeli-palestinian conflict is more difficult than the health care issue , simply because obama can put pressure on both sides , but he can not act on behalf of them , " said tuschhoff .
whether the boost that obama stands to gain from the health care passage will last depends on whether he can replicate that achievement , say the experts .

" the year of the flood " is a futuristic account of the aftermath of a major natural disaster that seems to have obliterated most of humankind .
adam one - the leader of a religious group that melds science , religion and nature - had predicted such an event .
after it happens , he and his followers regroup in a world that is altered and unpredictable . born in 1939 , atwood has published short stories , critical studies , screenplays , books for children , and poems , but is best known for her novels .
her work has been translated into over 30 languages . click on the audio link below to listen to the complete interview with margaret atwood . deutsche welle : you lived in germany in the 1980s .
what did you experience during that time ? margaret atwood : i came to germany for the very first time for my german publisher in the 70s .
then , as it turned out , in 1984 , i began " the handmaid 's tale " in berlin before the wall came down .
i began it in berlin , i finished it in tuscaloosa , alabama , which is quite a contrast .
but both of them were situations that had built-in stresses , because west berlin at that time of course was encircled by the wall and every sunday the east german air force flew over and made sonic booms , just to remind us that they were there . -lrb- … -rrb- now in germany you 're presenting your new book " the year of the flood . "
how significant is it that this book was finished in the year of your 70th birthday ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the publication of atwood 's book was postponed because of the us elections it was actually finished a year earlier .
the publication was postponed for a year because if it had been published in 2008 , it would have coincided with the american election and the american publisher quite rightly said , nobody is going to be doing anything except watching this election because whether it 's hillary clinton or barack obama , it 'll be unprecedented and everyone will be glued to their screen , which they were . i started to think a lot about your childhood when i was reading this book - the experience of being in a forest and the work of your father . yes , he was an entomologist , but he was also an all-around naturalist and what they call in canada woodsman .
in other words , he was very experienced in what we call " the bush . " -lrb- ... -rrb- i would be very scared if this latest book of yours is a prophesy about the future . first of all , it 's not a prophesy because i do n't do prophesies ; no one can really predict the future .
even the old testament prophets were n't predicting the future , they were more or less saying this is the state of your soul now .
you ca n't really write about the future because nobody has been there .
it 's like dante writing about the inferno .
i hate to break this to you , but he did not actually go down into hell . -lrb- … -rrb- are you an optimist about the future ?
this book tells us about environmental devastation , which we hear about every day in the news . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dante never actually went to hell , quipped atwood it 's not actually about that so much .
the truth is , if you remove the people , nature comes back quite well , which is where we are when the book opens .
there 's quite a lot of nature .
it 's not that all of nature gets destroyed . -lrb- … -rrb- as william gibson says , the future is already here , but it 's unevenly distributed .
some people say global warming , but really they should say climate change because the weather gets more extreme .
things change .
it 's not that everything goes away , but things change .
and if they change too abruptly , what you get is a lot of die-off . what 's really scary in this book is not that so much , although that 's a motivator , but what 's scary is that we can make new species .
we already can make new species , and we 're doing it .
but the really scary thing is we can make new diseases .
we already have that capacity .
why has not some country made a disgusting new disease and unleashed it on everybody else ?
they 're afraid of the blow-back .
there 's no way of doing that without the possibility that your country will get it too , with things being so very spreadable . -lrb- … -rrb- what a lot of people do n't know is that your first publication was actually a book of poems . yes , but it was n't the first thing i wrote .
i was actually writing the prose and the poems at the same time .
it was just that in those days , in canada , where it what almost impossible to publish a full-length novel , poems were a lot cheaper , they were shorter .
and typically you started out writing them off on a mimeo machine or putting together a little cold type book or hand-setting them , which is what i did with my first little booklet of poems - i hand-set them on a flatbed press .
try hand-setting a novel on a flatbed press ! -lrb- … -rrb- would i be right in assuming that margaret atwood is an optimist ? anyone who writes a book is an optimist .
no matter what the content .
the optimistic thing about this thing is : it 's a book .
it has n't happened yet .

eu commission president barroso , however , has said he believes chancellor merkel will agree to a rescue plan . germany is braced for further confrontation with fellow eu members this week as the row intensified over aid for debt-ridden greece on monday .
chancellor angela merkel said that there was " no question of an urgent decision in the european council about aid for greece " when eu leaders meet in brussels on thursday .
merkel said that because greece had yet not asked for a bailout , the matter should not be considered .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel said that the greece rescue package should not be on the summit agenda but calls for action came as eu foreign ministers met on monday in the run-up to the leaders ' summit , led by european commission president jose manuel barroso .
action to protect stability barroso said that action was necessary before faith in the economic stability of the euro zone – and the euro itself – was undermined .
" we need a decision at this summit , " warned barroso .
" we ca n't keep going this way , we risk endangering the stability of the euro zone and feeding speculation . "
calls for intervention in the debt crisis faced by greece , which has introduced austerity measures of its own , were echoed at the brussels meeting by countries including france and italy .
" the french position is very clear , " said french foreign minister bernard kouchner .
" we can not , we must not abandon our greek friends . "
' not in total agreement ' after the meeting , kouchner added that " on this issue , we are not totally in agreement with our german friends . "
german foreign minister guido westerwelle had resisted the idea of any immediate rescue plan at the meeting .
" at the moment we see no need to make a final decision on any kind of option , " said westerwelle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso expressed confidence that merkel will help in an interview with the financial times published on tuesday , the commission president said he was confident that germany would provide financial help if necessary .
" i know chancellor angela merkel , " said barroso .
" she is a committed european and i have no doubts that she will , if needed , be in favor of providing financial assistance to greece . "
greek deputy prime minister theodoros pangalos on monday accused berlin of allowing its banks to take part in a " deplorable game " of speculating on greek bonds while german exporters profited from a weaker euro due to athens ' budget problems. rc / reuters / afp / ap / dpa editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it 's even possible to earn money buy cutting emissions . from africa to south america to asia , when it comes to cooking , many people around the world face similar problems .
family members are forced to sit close by an open fireplace so smoky that the kitchen walls have been coated in black soot .
the children have coughs , and the women have already developed lung disease .
they 're the ones who do the majority of cooking , after all .
and that means long exposure to fires which cause bronchitis , asthma , and lung cancer .
according to the world health organization -lrb- who -rrb- , some 1.5 million people die each year from lung diseases resulting from wood-burning fires – more than the number of people who die each year from malaria .
firewood 's vicious cycle almost half the world 's population – around three billion people – cooks over open fires .
wood is the main fuel source but crop residue , dung , and charcoal are used as well .
it 's an economic and environmental vicious cycle .
forests are chopped down for firewood , resulting in an increase of erosion .
rain sweeps fertile topsoil from the fields , and harvests get smaller .
and the weather becomes drier , because the absence of forests changes the regional climate .
those who cook over open fires also lose valuable working time in the gathering of firewood – another factor that contributes to poverty .
and it 's a well-known fact that wood burning fires damage the climate , causing some 17 percent of carbon dioxide emissions globally .
bildunterschrift : a large pot over an open fire - many poor people still cook this way because of all these problems , development aid workers are pushing for greater availability of efficient stoves and ovens worldwide .
" they are a key factor in rural development , because they reduce poverty and illness and they help protect the climate , " said verena brinkmann , who works on the household energy program for germany 's technical aid organization , gtz .
used optimally , a new stove can help a family cut their annual fuel consumption in half , saving 1.5 tons of carbon dioxide .
clean cooking with the " rocket stove " efficient stoves and ovens are easy to build , says svane bender of the german environmental organization , nabu , which is working on a project to provide stoves to families in ethiopia .
" that 's the advantage they have in comparison to solar ovens , for example , which need a lot of imported parts , " bender said .
due to different regional factors such as fuel methods and what kind of food is commonly prepared determine which kind of oven meets the populations ' needs , a wide variety of efficient ovens are available " ethiopians eat a kind of flat , round bread known as injera , so an oven was developed for that purpose , " said bender .
in many projects , people learn how to build their own ovens out of clay , metal , or bricks .
well-insulated combustion chambers and wind protection that keeps cool air away from the cooking pot ensure efficiency .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in africa , 90 percent of all food is cooked - mainly the traditional way , over an open fire emerging economies like china and india currently have the most modern efficient stoves , thanks to strong government support for their expansion .
" purchasing power is important for success – and there 's plenty of purchasing power in both of these booming emerging nations , " said brinkmann .
but the new stoves are also becoming more popular in developing countries , especially in eastern africa .
in addition to ethiopia and kenya , uganda is considered to be a model example .
there , half a million households are cooking with the clay oven known as the rocket stove , which emits hardly any smoke .
according to the gtz , this particular model saves households a ton of wood each year .
the organization is training villagers to become professional stove builders .
without such commitment on the ground , even such well-intentioned projects can often fail after a very short time .
climate protection and profit modern cooking methods are also increasingly becoming important in south america , particularly in bolivia and peru .
the peruvian government aims to distribute some 500,000 efficient stoves among its people , with the help of companies such as microsol .
after all , they can earn money with efficient stoves , thanks to the clean development mechanism -lrb- cdm -rrb- within the framework of the kyoto protocol on climate protection .
it allows companies from the signatory nations to buy emissions credits for climate protection projects in developing countries .
they can either sell them , or use them to offset their own co2 reduction goals .
companies buy the certificates from firms such as microsol , which develop their own climate projects specifically for this purpose .
emissions certificates from projects which have achieved the so-called " gold standard " are especially expensive .
companies commit to such projects voluntarily , as they get a huge image boost from the standard 's rigorous criteria .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in uganda , the rocket stove has become popular .
it 's built out of clay and has a chimney until now , only four stove projects have registered globally for emissions trading ; 13 others projects are currently being evaluated by independent bodies on behalf of the cdm advisory board .
but many more projects are needed because , as the gtz has noted , efficient stoves and ovens have not yet achieved the global breakthrough that the united nations once hoped for .
the un millennium development goals agreed on in 2000 aimed to reduce the number of people still using traditional cooking methods by half .
but in order to reach this goal , some 500,000 modern stoves would have to be introduced each day – a utopian number .
despite this , development workers are hopeful .
through the measures put in place by the cdm , large sums of money from private investors can finally be made available , turning efficient stoves and ovens into mass market products .
" we have to see now , what the effects of the latest cdm business have been , " said brinkmann .
" but it seems clear that it offers new development potential to efficient cooking methods . "
that 's also the goal of the private un foundation that will found the " global alliance for clean ovens " at the end of march .
it aims to provide 50 million new units to developing countries in the next five years .

but experts warn jobs could also go out the door . recovering from its worst slump since world war two , german industry plans to step up investments in international sales and distribution networks as well as production facilities in key foreign markets . according to a new report by the german chambers of industry and commerce -lrb- dihk -rrb- , 44 percent of the 9,000 companies surveyed said they intend to make investments in foreign countries , up from 40 percent last year .
more than a third -lrb- 37 percent -rrb- of the companies said they had plans to invest in china , up from 32 percent .
" need to start investing again " “ after experiencing a drop in exports of as much as 80 percent in some cases , german industrial companies see signs of a recovery , ” volker treier , chief economist at dihk , told deutsche welle .
“ many recognize a need to start investing again to maintain their presence abroad ; they do n't want to lose what they 've built up . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : low labor costs are no longer that main reason why german companies invest abroad financing is an issue , treier conceded .
he pointed to the reluctance of numerous banks stung by the global economic crisis to lend money to industrial companies - especially those planning investments in projects far away from germany .
“ this is definitely a problem but it is one where the banks , the government and other groups have been working together with industry to find solutions , ” treier said .
“ there are some measures underway to ensure the flow of credit . ”
today , 100 of germany 's largest publicly-listed companies generate more than two thirds of their sales outside the country .
a sizable chunk of these sales still come from products that are “ made in germany ” and sold in china .
german exports to china rose by 7 percent in 2009 , the federal statistical office reported monday .
the increase bucked the trend in a dismal year for germany , where overall exports slumped by 18 percent .
the exported goods were valued at 36.5 billion euros .
building logistics networks and new factories cheap labor is no longer a key driver of foreign investments by german industry , according to the dihk survey ; only 28 percent of the polled companies cited low production costs as a reason for their investments abroad – and only 20 percent for their investments in china .
“ that was the reason about five years ago but german manufacturers have since done much to increase productivity in their domestic operations , ” economist treier said .
“ the investments that are being made today or are planned in the near future are all about building up local sales and logistics networks and even new factories to take full advantage of huge emerging markets such as china , india and brazil ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daimler already builds cars in brazil and has plans for manufacturing in the us german car manufacturing , perhaps more than any other industry in the country , is racing ahead to win market share in these emerging markets .
volkswagen , for instance , is currently expanding its local production facilities in china and india as well as in the us .
“ german carmakers really do n't have an alternative , ” said thomas kautzsch , a manufacturing consultant with the management consultancy oliver wyman in munich . jobs in germany will go martin haubensak , a consultant with at kearny agrees .
“ vw tried to build everything in wolfsburg and then ship everything around the globe , ” he said .
“ now they realize it makes more sense , from an economic and competitive perspective , to build regionally . ”
investments in new production facilities abroad , however , will come at the expense of jobs in germany in the long term , experts agree .
“ we are definitely going to see some adjustments , ” said ferdinand dudenhoeffer , a professor at the university of duisburg-essen and an expert on the german car industry .
“ german carmakers need to manufacturer cars abroad for a number of reasons , including low labor costs and import duties .
the number of jobs in germany will definitely go down . ”
dudenhoeffer expects germany 's auto industry to shed 50,000 of its current 700,000 jobs by 2015 .
“ the future is in the new markets , ” he said .
“ production is already moving there . ”

the appointments may help him garner support within his party . although president nicolas sarkozy has said that the regional election results were not an indictment of his national government , he met with prime minister francois fillon on monday to discuss a cabinet reshuffle . following those talks , the president announced that he was sacking a senior minister in what was seen as an effort to regain the initiative . labor minister xavier darcos , who had been set to lead negotiations over controversial pension reforms , was sent packing because his party 's defeat in sunday 's vote meant he no longer had the necessary credibility to oversee the overhaul of the costly french pension system .
he is to be replaced by eric woerth , the current budget minister . francois baroin , a close ally of former president jacques chirac , is to replace woerth in a move expected to appease the chirac " old guard " in sarkozy ’ s conservative ump party .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president sarkozy said the results were not an indictment of his government sarkozy has nominated georges tron , who is an ally of former prime minister dominique de villepin , as junior minister for the civil service . villepin , an opponent of the president , is expected to announce later this week that he will set up a rival centre-right political party .
the appointment of tron deprives villepin of a possible ally .
another conservative , marc-philippe daubresse , became minister for youth .
he effectively replaces centre-left politician martin hirsch , who had been a symbol of sarkozy ’ s effort to recruit talent from the opposition . future reshuffle possible with only two officials leaving the government , the changes are seen as relatively minor , with a more wide-ranging reshuffle possible ahead of presidential elections in 2012 .
in sunday 's second-round run-off vote , the socialist-led opposition beat sarkozy 's union for a popular movement -lrb- ump -rrb- by a margin of 54 percent to 36 percent .
the left gained control of 21 of france 's 22 mainland regions . the far-right front national came away with 9.3 percent nationwide , after qualifying for the second round in nine regions .
but veteran party leader jean-marie le pen scored big in his home region in southern france , winning more than 22 percent of the vote .
voter turnout , at 51 percent , was four points higher than last sunday 's first round of polling .
pollsters say the country 's anemic economy and growing unemployment as well as sarkozy 's relentless reform course have disillusioned voters .
also , a string of recent controversies , ranging from a debate on national identity to accusations of nepotism , have been eroding his popularity .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : villepin is set to announce plans to form a rival party alsace remains conservative although sunday 's election outcome was a triumph for the socialists , the ump looks set to hold on to its traditional stronghold , the alsace region along the german border . but the island of corsica , another conservative bastion , was snatched from the ump by the socialist alliance .
the ump held on to french guyana and reunion , while guadeloupe went to the socialists .
the result is very similar to the last regional poll in 2004 when the socialists came away with 20 of the 22 mainland districts , but were defeated in the presidential election three years later .
even so , the poll is seen as a rejection of sarkozy and his policies and perhaps the worst defeat of his political career .
the president has already announced a hiatus in reform plans for next year and this loss could make him even more cautious about pushing painful changes. gb / db / afp / apn / dpa / reuters editor : ben knight send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it 's even possible to earn money buy cutting emissions . from africa to south america to asia , when it comes to cooking , many people around the world face similar problems .
family members are forced to sit close by an open fireplace so smoky that the kitchen walls have been coated in black soot .
the children have coughs , and the women have already developed lung disease .
they 're the ones who do the majority of cooking , after all .
and that means long exposure to fires which cause bronchitis , asthma , and lung cancer .
according to the world health organization -lrb- who -rrb- , some 1.5 million people die each year from lung diseases resulting from wood-burning fires – more than the number of people who die each year from malaria .
firewood 's vicious cycle almost half the world 's population – around three billion people – cooks over open fires .
wood is the main fuel source but crop residue , dung , and charcoal are used as well .
it 's an economic and environmental vicious cycle .
forests are chopped down for firewood , resulting in an increase of erosion .
rain sweeps fertile topsoil from the fields , and harvests get smaller .
and the weather becomes drier , because the absence of forests changes the regional climate .
those who cook over open fires also lose valuable working time in the gathering of firewood – another factor that contributes to poverty .
and it 's a well-known fact that wood burning fires damage the climate , causing some 17 percent of carbon dioxide emissions globally .
bildunterschrift : a large pot over an open fire - many poor people still cook this way because of all these problems , development aid workers are pushing for greater availability of efficient stoves and ovens worldwide .
" they are a key factor in rural development , because they reduce poverty and illness and they help protect the climate , " said verena brinkmann , who works on the household energy program for germany 's technical aid organization , gtz .
used optimally , a new stove can help a family cut their annual fuel consumption in half , saving 1.5 tons of carbon dioxide .
clean cooking with the " rocket stove " efficient stoves and ovens are easy to build , says svane bender of the german environmental organization , nabu , which is working on a project to provide stoves to families in ethiopia .
" that 's the advantage they have in comparison to solar ovens , for example , which need a lot of imported parts , " bender said .
due to different regional factors such as fuel methods and what kind of food is commonly prepared determine which kind of oven meets the populations ' needs , a wide variety of efficient ovens are available " ethiopians eat a kind of flat , round bread known as injera , so an oven was developed for that purpose , " said bender .
in many projects , people learn how to build their own ovens out of clay , metal , or bricks .
well-insulated combustion chambers and wind protection that keeps cool air away from the cooking pot ensure efficiency .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in africa , 90 percent of all food is cooked - mainly the traditional way , over an open fire emerging economies like china and india currently have the most modern efficient stoves , thanks to strong government support for their expansion .
" purchasing power is important for success – and there 's plenty of purchasing power in both of these booming emerging nations , " said brinkmann .
but the new stoves are also becoming more popular in developing countries , especially in eastern africa .
in addition to ethiopia and kenya , uganda is considered to be a model example .
there , half a million households are cooking with the clay oven known as the rocket stove , which emits hardly any smoke .
according to the gtz , this particular model saves households a ton of wood each year .
the organization is training villagers to become professional stove builders .
without such commitment on the ground , even such well-intentioned projects can often fail after a very short time .
climate protection and profit modern cooking methods are also increasingly becoming important in south america , particularly in bolivia and peru .
the peruvian government aims to distribute some 500,000 efficient stoves among its people , with the help of companies such as microsol .
after all , they can earn money with efficient stoves , thanks to the clean development mechanism -lrb- cdm -rrb- within the framework of the kyoto protocol on climate protection .
it allows companies from the signatory nations to buy emissions credits for climate protection projects in developing countries .
they can either sell them , or use them to offset their own co2 reduction goals .
companies buy the certificates from firms such as microsol , which develop their own climate projects specifically for this purpose .
emissions certificates from projects which have achieved the so-called " gold standard " are especially expensive .
companies commit to such projects voluntarily , as they get a huge image boost from the standard 's rigorous criteria .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in uganda , the rocket stove has become popular .
it 's built out of clay and has a chimney until now , only four stove projects have registered globally for emissions trading ; 13 others projects are currently being evaluated by independent bodies on behalf of the cdm advisory board .
but many more projects are needed because , as the gtz has noted , efficient stoves and ovens have not yet achieved the global breakthrough that the united nations once hoped for .
the un millennium development goals agreed on in 2000 aimed to reduce the number of people still using traditional cooking methods by half .
but in order to reach this goal , some 500,000 modern stoves would have to be introduced each day – a utopian number .
despite this , development workers are hopeful .
through the measures put in place by the cdm , large sums of money from private investors can finally be made available , turning efficient stoves and ovens into mass market products .
" we have to see now , what the effects of the latest cdm business have been , " said brinkmann .
" but it seems clear that it offers new development potential to efficient cooking methods . "
that 's also the goal of the private un foundation that will found the " global alliance for clean ovens " at the end of march .
it aims to provide 50 million new units to developing countries in the next five years .

since then the country has made good progress , but what will the next two decades bring ?
experts say the outlook is positive . it was perhaps somewhat symbolic that namibia 's celebrations on sunday , march 21 , coincided with the swearing-in of its reelected president hifikepunye pohamba .
for 20 years , the southern african nation has been one of the most stable democracies on the continent .
unlike other african countries , perhaps most notably nearby zimbabwe , politics is not a main problem for namibia .
the challenges , say experts , lie elsewhere .
" the problems are the same ones as 20 years ago - providing work , food and places to live for the country 's two to three million inhabitants , " says publisher michael iwanowski , who wrote the first-ever german travel guide to namibia and led a number of official german delegations through the country .
" there 's no industry , and most people live from mining , tourism and subsistence farming .
but the elections were free and fair , and the government works well with the people . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : namibia is a country of stark , and often uninhabited , beauty namibia is the second-least densely populated country in the world , and has a nominal per capita gdp of only 3,178 euros -lrb- $ 4,278 -rrb- annually .
" the reason so few people live there is that there 's so little water , " says andre suren , a journalist for dw-tv , who was born in namibia and recently returned from filming a report there .
" provision of water is one problem , as are unemployment and poverty , which the government has made its top priority .
there also needs to be further reconciliation between tribes and between blacks and whites .
but the country has found its form of democracy . "
these are the sorts of issues that many african countries face .
but namibia is anything but a typical african nation in either its population or its history .
german south-west africa bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this plaque commemorates namibian victims of german colonial rule in the waning decades of the 19th century , namibia was one of the few places that germany , a belated colonial starter , was able to gain a foothold .
the territory officially became a colony in 1884 and was known as german south-west africa .
but germany 's rule there was hardly happy .
from 1904 to 1907 , the herero and nama tribes rebelled against their colonial master , and in the resultant fighting some 65,000 hereros , about 80 percent of the population , were killed .
in the course of world war i , south africa , which was controlled by britain , occupied namibia thanks to a league of nations mandate .
in 1946 , south africa refused to surrender that mandate even though it had been superseded by a united nations trusteeship agreement .
in 1966 , the south-west africa people 's organization , swapo , led a fight for independence , with heavy participation from the owambo tribe , which today makes up the majority of namibia 's population .
but it took until 1988 for south africa to agree to give up control over the country .
namibia officially gained sovereignty in 1990 , making it africa 's youngest country .
uranium and tourists bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : conditions in namibian townships are simple , but not inhuman namibia may be young and sparsely populated , but experts say those attributes help make its future prospects bright .
" namibia could profit from natural resources like copper and uranium , as those commodities get scarcer , " iwanowski told deutsche welle .
" but the big industry is tourism .
at least one third of the country is a nature reservation with deserts , savannahs and national parks , and most parts of the country are virtually uninhabited .
tourism has grown by 15 to 18 percent annually , and though those numbers are down a bit due to the global financial crisis , it 's still booming . "
probably among namibia 's most famous attractions are the namib and kalahari deserts , and the country needs to be careful about preserving its natural beauty .
" tourism accounts for some 70 percent of namibia 's economy , " says suren .
" that 's because the country is quite safe and easy to get to and get around in .
but namibians need to watch out for crime and environmental destruction . "
uranium mines have often been blamed for contaminating surrounding areas and putting aboriginal peoples at risk .
namibia 's natural resources have attracted the attention of a number of the world 's larger countries , who may put profits ahead of building up namibia 's own economy or preserving its environment .
china , which is very active throughout africa , has come under particular criticism for exploiting namibia 's natural wealth while polluting the land and failing to give back anything to the namibian people .
coming to terms bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : evidence of germany 's presence in namibia crops up everywhere and what about germany , the country which , in light of the colonial past , has one of the closest connections to namibia ?
the experts say that namibia is a main focus of german foreign developmental aid , but that berlin could perhaps do more in other areas .
" there needs to be a coming to terms with colonial history , " suren says .
" that would help reconciliation between tribes like the owambos and the hereros and also between blacks and whites .
germany should also support namibian political parties , increase the exchange possibilities for politicians and do more to help the namibian media . "
and there 's more connecting germany and namibia than just history .
" germans make up two-thirds of all tourists to namibia , and german developmental aid is very significant , " iwanowki says .
" berlin is partner city to the namibian capital , windhoek , and there are many parallels .
just as namibia gained independence 20 years ago , it was 20 years ago since the berlin wall fell . "
nothing is certain in the world 's poorest continent .
but if these experts are correct , africa 's youngest nation has a comparatively bright future .

that 's why there are many different kinds of efficient stoves .
an overview . the newest invention is the rocket stove .
with its elbow-shaped combustion chamber , the do-it-yourself model out of clay and straw , metal or bricks reduces energy use by up to 80 percent , and cuts the amount of firewood used by anywhere from 40 to 80 percent .
it is also almost completely smoke-free .
families use the smaller models , and larger ones are being used in school cafeterias or small restaurants .
depending on the model , size , and country , prices of rocket stoves are anywhere from three to 15 euros -lrb- four to 20 us dollars -rrb- per household .
a cafeteria-sized stove costs between 90 and 200 euros .
an example of a special regional use is the round mirt stove from ethiopia , which consists of a cement ring and a metal or clay stovetop .
the region 's traditional , round injera bread is baked on the flat stovetop with a diameter of about 60 centimeters .
compared to an open fire , the mirt stove reduces firewood use by 50 percent , and is priced at about four to six euros .
the vesto stove , which burns different organic matter , is mainly sold in south america .
it 's industrially produced , and costs around 25 euros .
the jiko charcoal stove , developed in kenya , specializes in the burning of charcoal .
today , it 's available in many african countries at a cost of between three and 10 euros .
it cuts charcoal use by 50 percent .
the upesi clay oven , also known as mandaleo , is a particularly simple construction that costs about one euro , meaning even the poorest people can afford it .
in comparison to an open fire , it saves 50 percent of firewood .
food warmers are also being used more frequently .
these are bags or baskets which are lined with naturally insulating materials such as dried banana leaves , where food can be placed after it 's been cooked to stay warm - another way of saving energy .

france has also opened an investigation into forged french passports . speaking to parliament on tuesday , british foreign secretary david miliband said there were " compelling reasons " to believe that the israeli intelligence agency mossad was behind the killing of mahmoud al-mabhouh in dubai on january 19 , and that israel 's position as a close ally to the uk added " insult to injury . "
" the government takes this matter extremely seriously , " he said .
" such misuse of british passports is intolerable . "
israel 's ambassador to london , ron prosor , said israel was " disappointed by the decision of the british government , " but his country remained committed to a relationship " of mutual importance . "
the expelled diplomat was not named by either country , although it was believed to be a member of the israeli embassy .
hamas leaders praised the uk 's actions and said they hoped israeli officials would eventually be brought to court over the killing .
ministry investigation britain 's foreign ministry briefed prosor on monday over the findings of an investigation into the passport forgeries .
miliband said 12 british citizens had their passports copied " when handed over for inspection to individuals linked to israel , " and that they were " wholly innocent victims of identity theft . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dubai authorities have 27 suspects in the murder investigation " given that this was a very sophisticated operation in which high-quality forgeries were made , the government judges it is highly likely that the forgeries were made by a state intelligence service , " he said .
miliband met israeli foreign minister avigdor lieberman in brussels on monday to discuss the issue , and said he asked for israel 's pledge that it would " never be party to the misuse of british passports in such a way . "
france probe meanwhile a paris prosecutor said tuesday that french authorities have opened their own investigation into forged french passports , four of which were also used in the hamas murder .
france began a preliminary investigation on march 12 .
the french passports were “ either delivered with a false identity or falsified with a photograph that did not correspond to the identity indicated , ” the prosecutor said in a statement .
president nicolas sarkozy has condemned al-mabhouh ’ s killing , but has not directly implied that the israeli secret service carried out the assassination .
israel has neither confirmed nor denied the allegations of mossad ’ s involvement , maintaining a strict policy of ambiguity with such sensitive matters .

france has also opened an investigation into forged french passports . speaking to parliament on tuesday , british foreign secretary david miliband said there were " compelling reasons " to believe that the israeli intelligence agency mossad was behind the killing of mahmoud al-mabhouh in dubai on january 19 , and that israel 's position as a close ally to the uk added " insult to injury . "
" the government takes this matter extremely seriously , " he said .
" such misuse of british passports is intolerable . "
israel 's ambassador to london , ron prosor , said israel was " disappointed by the decision of the british government , " but his country remained committed to a relationship " of mutual importance . "
the expelled diplomat was not named by either country , although it was believed to be a member of the israeli embassy .
hamas leaders praised the uk 's actions and said they hoped israeli officials would eventually be brought to court over the killing .

it 's even possible to earn money buy cutting emissions . from africa to south america to asia , when it comes to cooking , many people around the world face similar problems .
family members are forced to sit close by an open fireplace so smoky that the kitchen walls have been coated in black soot .
the children have coughs , and the women have already developed lung disease .
they 're the ones who do the majority of cooking , after all .
and that means long exposure to fires which cause bronchitis , asthma , and lung cancer .
according to the world health organization -lrb- who -rrb- , some 1.5 million people die each year from lung diseases resulting from wood-burning fires – more than the number of people who die each year from malaria .
firewood 's vicious cycle almost half the world 's population – around three billion people – cooks over open fires .
wood is the main fuel source but crop residue , dung , and charcoal are used as well .
it 's an economic and environmental vicious cycle .
forests are chopped down for firewood , resulting in an increase of erosion .
rain sweeps fertile topsoil from the fields , and harvests get smaller .
and the weather becomes drier , because the absence of forests changes the regional climate .
those who cook over open fires also lose valuable working time in the gathering of firewood – another factor that contributes to poverty .
and it 's a well-known fact that wood burning fires damage the climate , causing some 17 percent of carbon dioxide emissions globally .
bildunterschrift : a large pot over an open fire - many poor people still cook this way because of all these problems , development aid workers are pushing for greater availability of efficient stoves and ovens worldwide .
" they are a key factor in rural development , because they reduce poverty and illness and they help protect the climate , " said verena brinkmann , who works on the household energy program for germany 's technical aid organization , gtz .
used optimally , a new stove can help a family cut their annual fuel consumption in half , saving 1.5 tons of carbon dioxide .
clean cooking with the " rocket stove " efficient stoves and ovens are easy to build , says svane bender of the german environmental organization , nabu , which is working on a project to provide stoves to families in ethiopia .
" that 's the advantage they have in comparison to solar ovens , for example , which need a lot of imported parts , " bender said .
due to different regional factors such as fuel methods and what kind of food is commonly prepared determine which kind of oven meets the populations ' needs , a wide variety of efficient ovens are available " ethiopians eat a kind of flat , round bread known as injera , so an oven was developed for that purpose , " said bender .
in many projects , people learn how to build their own ovens out of clay , metal , or bricks .
well-insulated combustion chambers and wind protection that keeps cool air away from the cooking pot ensure efficiency .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in africa , 90 percent of all food is cooked - mainly the traditional way , over an open fire emerging economies like china and india currently have the most modern efficient stoves , thanks to strong government support for their expansion .
" purchasing power is important for success – and there 's plenty of purchasing power in both of these booming emerging nations , " said brinkmann .
but the new stoves are also becoming more popular in developing countries , especially in eastern africa .
in addition to ethiopia and kenya , uganda is considered to be a model example .
there , half a million households are cooking with the clay oven known as the rocket stove , which emits hardly any smoke .
according to the gtz , this particular model saves households a ton of wood each year .
the organization is training villagers to become professional stove builders .
without such commitment on the ground , even such well-intentioned projects can often fail after a very short time .
climate protection and profit modern cooking methods are also increasingly becoming important in south america , particularly in bolivia and peru .
the peruvian government aims to distribute some 500,000 efficient stoves among its people , with the help of companies such as microsol .
after all , they can earn money with efficient stoves , thanks to the clean development mechanism -lrb- cdm -rrb- within the framework of the kyoto protocol on climate protection .
it allows companies from the signatory nations to buy emissions credits for climate protection projects in developing countries .
they can either sell them , or use them to offset their own co2 reduction goals .
companies buy the certificates from firms such as microsol , which develop their own climate projects specifically for this purpose .
emissions certificates from projects which have achieved the so-called " gold standard " are especially expensive .
companies commit to such projects voluntarily , as they get a huge image boost from the standard 's rigorous criteria .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in uganda , the rocket stove has become popular .
it 's built out of clay and has a chimney until now , only four stove projects have registered globally for emissions trading ; 13 others projects are currently being evaluated by independent bodies on behalf of the cdm advisory board .
but many more projects are needed because , as the gtz has noted , efficient stoves and ovens have not yet achieved the global breakthrough that the united nations once hoped for .
the un millennium development goals agreed on in 2000 aimed to reduce the number of people still using traditional cooking methods by half .
but in order to reach this goal , some 500,000 modern stoves would have to be introduced each day – a utopian number .
despite this , development workers are hopeful .
through the measures put in place by the cdm , large sums of money from private investors can finally be made available , turning efficient stoves and ovens into mass market products .
" we have to see now , what the effects of the latest cdm business have been , " said brinkmann .
" but it seems clear that it offers new development potential to efficient cooking methods . "
that 's also the goal of the private un foundation that will found the " global alliance for clean ovens " at the end of march .
it aims to provide 50 million new units to developing countries in the next five years .

france has also opened an investigation into forged french passports . speaking to parliament on tuesday , british foreign secretary david miliband said there were " compelling reasons " to believe that the israeli intelligence agency mossad was behind the killing of mahmoud al-mabhouh in dubai on january 19 , and that israel 's position as a close ally to the uk added " insult to injury . "
" the government takes this matter extremely seriously , " he said .
" such misuse of british passports is intolerable . "
israel 's ambassador to london , ron prosor , said israel was " disappointed by the decision of the british government , " but his country remained committed to a relationship " of mutual importance . "
the expelled diplomat was not named by either country , although it was believed to be a member of the israeli embassy .
hamas leaders praised the uk 's actions and said they hoped israeli officials would eventually be brought to court over the killing .
ministry investigation britain 's foreign ministry briefed prosor on monday over the findings of an investigation into the passport forgeries .
miliband said 12 british citizens had their passports copied " when handed over for inspection to individuals linked to israel , " and that they were " wholly innocent victims of identity theft . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dubai authorities have 27 suspects in the murder investigation " given that this was a very sophisticated operation in which high-quality forgeries were made , the government judges it is highly likely that the forgeries were made by a state intelligence service , " he said .
miliband met israeli foreign minister avigdor lieberman in brussels on monday to discuss the issue , and said he asked for israel 's pledge that it would " never be party to the misuse of british passports in such a way . "
france probe meanwhile a paris prosecutor said tuesday that french authorities have opened their own investigation into forged french passports , four of which were also used in the hamas murder .
france began a preliminary investigation on march 12 .
the french passports were “ either delivered with a false identity or falsified with a photograph that did not correspond to the identity indicated , ” the prosecutor said in a statement .
president nicolas sarkozy has condemned al-mabhouh ’ s killing , but has not directly implied that the israeli secret service carried out the assassination .

france has also opened an investigation into forged french passports . speaking to parliament on tuesday , british foreign secretary david miliband said there were " compelling reasons " to believe that the israeli intelligence agency mossad was behind the killing of mahmoud al-mabhouh in dubai on january 19 , and that israel 's position as a close ally to the uk added " insult to injury . "
" the government takes this matter extremely seriously , " he said .
" such misuse of british passports is intolerable . "
israel 's ambassador to london , ron prosor , said israel was " disappointed by the decision of the british government , " but his country remained committed to a relationship " of mutual importance . "
the expelled diplomat was not named by either country , although it was believed to be a member of the israeli embassy .
hamas leaders praised the uk 's actions and said they hoped israeli officials would eventually be brought to court over the killing .
ministry investigation britain 's foreign ministry briefed prosor on monday over the findings of an investigation into the passport forgeries .
miliband said 12 british citizens had their passports copied " when handed over for inspection to individuals linked to israel , " and that they were " wholly innocent victims of identity theft . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dubai authorities have 27 suspects in the murder investigation " given that this was a very sophisticated operation in which high-quality forgeries were made , the government judges it is highly likely that the forgeries were made by a state intelligence service , " he said .
miliband met israeli foreign minister avigdor lieberman in brussels on monday to discuss the issue , and said he asked for israel 's pledge that it would " never be party to the misuse of british passports in such a way . "
france probe meanwhile a paris prosecutor said tuesday that french authorities have opened their own investigation into forged french passports , four of which were also used in the hamas murder .
france began a preliminary investigation on march 12 .
the french passports were “ either delivered with a false identity or falsified with a photograph that did not correspond to the identity indicated , ” the prosecutor said in a statement .
president nicolas sarkozy has condemned al-mabhouh ’ s killing , but has not directly implied that the israeli secret service carried out the assassination .

in an interview on deutschlandfunk national radio westerwelle said , " germany is convinced that the settlement program must be frozen .
this is not just germany 's stance , but of the european union and the entire international community . "
he also stated that a two-state solution for israelis and palestinians is advocated not only by germany , but also by the rest of the eu and the united states .
" we want a two-state solution , " said westerwelle .
" a two-state solution is the only solution that can truly bring peace . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : goerzig says engaging hamas could be good leverage with israel when asked about an appropriate time for the eu to increase its pressure on israel , westerwelle said it would be best to first see what results come from last week 's middle east quartet talks in moscow between the eu , the us , russia , and the united nations .
increasing the pressure eu foreign ministers universally condemned israeli policies at a meeting on monday in brussels , but remained at odds on how to put more pressure on the country .
the eu is israel 's largest trading partner , and the bloc has so far declined to impose trade sanctions .
but carolin goerzig , an analyst at the european union institute for security studies in paris , told deutsche welle that if the eu wants to increase its leverage on israel in order to stop the building of further settlements , the bloc should engage greater discussion with hamas .
" so far the little pressure that has been exerted on israel has not proven fruitful really , and at the same time going to the other extreme could also backfire , " said goerzig .
" so what could really pressure israel is a moderation of hamas , because then israel would have to show face and react . "
goerzig added that the conditions set out by the quartet for a palestinian government , which include the renunciation of violence , the recognition of israel 's right to exist , and a commitment to all agreements signed by the palestine liberation organization and israel , do not encourage hamas to come to the negotiating table .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu has been looking to increase its international presence " i 'm not saying we should recognize hamas as a negotiation partner right away , but it has never been stated what they would gain from agreeing to these quartet conditions , " said goerzig .
" hamas has shown some steps of moderation , but the eu has never reacted positively , so hamas always stands to lose without any benefits if it becomes more moderate . " testing eu foreign policy ?
the issue of israeli settlements is in some ways testing the eu 's - and germany 's - international role . but goerzig says the eu 's presence in the quartet was not as strong as it could have been .
" the eu has been shy about asserting itself in the quartet , which could be related to its lack of coherence , " said goerzig .
" there is a need for debate on this issue in the eu , and i think germany could drive such a debate . "
the eu foreign policy chief catherine ashton said recently she will push for the launch of " proximity " talks between the israelis and the palestinians as a prologue to formal negotiations .

the decision brings croatia one step closer to its goal of eu membership . the slovenian constitutional court on tuesday ruled as constitutional a deal to negotiate an end to the nearly 19-year-old border dispute with croatia , raising the likelihood of zagreb 's european union accession by its goal of 2012 .
the slovenian parliament must still ratify the agreement , which croatia did last november .
speaking to reporters after the decision , slovenian prime minister borut pahor said he was " very pleased . "
he also suggested the ruling center-left coalition government may not seek a public referendum on the issue as it had previously planned .
" personally , i 'm ready to seek ratification in parliament even without a referendum and i plan to talk with parliamentary parties about that , " he said .

human rights watchdog amnesty international said in a statement that they were executed last week . amnesty international has condemned the execution of two prisoners in belarus and has urged president alexander lukashenko to impose a moratorium on the death penalty .
the group 's belarus expert heather mcgill told deutsche welle on tuesday that the organization had been campaigning on behalf of the prisoners since june 2009 .
" we are very disappointed that the belarus government has seen fit to actually carry out these executions , " she said .
mcgill said no executions were reported in the former soviet republic in 2009 , and that there had been signs of progress .
" there have been moves toward changing legislation , introducing life imprisonment as an alternative to the death penalty and reducing the number of crimes punished by the death penalty , " she said .
" those are all positive signs , but in the end , if they are still shooting people , those other changes do n't count very much . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lukashenko has come under pressure to ban the death penalty executed without meeting their families mcgill said that zhuk 's mother came to visit her son on friday , but was turned back at the gate by guards who said both men had been moved , and she should wait for notification from the court .
the mother returned on monday only to be informed by a prison guard that both men , who had shared the same cell , had been shot .
there has recently been a lot of pressure on belarus to abolish the death sentence , mcgill said .
the council of europe has offered to reinstate belarus ' special guest status if it places a moratorium on the death penalty as a step towards the complete abolition of capital punishment .
the previous status was withdrawn in 1997 after minsk was seen as having fallen short in advancing democracy and human rights .
" possibly , they wanted to get these men out of the way in order to clear the field to declare a moratorium , " mcgill suspected .
she believes this happened in ukraine when that country joined the council of europe , which oversees human rights standards in its 47 member states .
" ukraine abolished the death penalty , but they executed a lot of people before they made the final declaration of a moratorium . " db / afp / kna editor : ben knight send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in an interview on deutschlandfunk national radio westerwelle said , " germany is convinced that the settlement program must be frozen .
this is not just germany 's stance , but of the european union and the entire international community . "
he also stated that a two-state solution for israelis and palestinians is advocated not only by germany , but also by the rest of the eu and the united states .
" we want a two-state solution , " said westerwelle .
" a two-state solution is the only solution that can truly bring peace . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : goerzig says engaging hamas could be good leverage with israel when asked about an appropriate time for the eu to increase its pressure on israel , westerwelle said it would be best to first see what results come from last week 's middle east quartet talks in moscow between the eu , the us , russia , and the united nations .
increasing the pressure eu foreign ministers universally condemned israeli policies at a meeting on monday in brussels , but remained at odds on how to put more pressure on the country .
the eu is israel 's largest trading partner , and the bloc has so far declined to impose trade sanctions .
but carolin goerzig , an analyst at the european union institute for security studies in paris , told deutsche welle that if the eu wants to increase its leverage on israel in order to stop the building of further settlements , the bloc should engage greater discussion with hamas .
" so far the little pressure that has been exerted on israel has not proven fruitful really , and at the same time going to the other extreme could also backfire , " said goerzig .
" so what could really pressure israel is a moderation of hamas , because then israel would have to show face and react . "
goerzig added that the conditions set out by the quartet for a palestinian government , which include the renunciation of violence , the recognition of israel 's right to exist , and a commitment to all agreements signed by the palestine liberation organization and israel , do not encourage hamas to come to the negotiating table .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu has been looking to increase its international presence " i 'm not saying we should recognize hamas as a negotiation partner right away , but it has never been stated what they would gain from agreeing to these quartet conditions , " said goerzig .
" hamas has shown some steps of moderation , but the eu has never reacted positively , so hamas always stands to lose without any benefits if it becomes more moderate . " testing eu foreign policy ?
the issue of israeli settlements is in some ways testing the eu 's - and germany 's - international role . but goerzig says the eu 's presence in the quartet was not as strong as it could have been .
" the eu has been shy about asserting itself in the quartet , which could be related to its lack of coherence , " said goerzig .
" there is a need for debate on this issue in the eu , and i think germany could drive such a debate . "
the eu foreign policy chief catherine ashton said recently she will push for the launch of " proximity " talks between the israelis and the palestinians as a prologue to formal negotiations .

" so far the little pressure that has been exerted on israel has not proven fruitful really , and at the same time going to the other extreme could also backfire , " said goerzig .
" so what could really pressure israel is a moderation of hamas , because then israel would have to show face and react . "
goerzig added that the conditions set out by the quartet for a palestinian government , which include the renunciation of violence , the recognition of israel 's right to exist , and a commitment to all agreements signed by the palestine liberation organization and israel , do not encourage hamas to come to the negotiating table .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu has been looking to increase its international presence " i 'm not saying we should recognize hamas as a negotiation partner right away , but it has never been stated what they would gain from agreeing to these quartet conditions , " said goerzig .
" hamas has shown some steps of moderation , but the eu has never reacted positively , so hamas always stands to lose without any benefits if it becomes more moderate . " testing eu foreign policy ?
the issue of israeli settlements is in some ways testing the eu 's - and germany 's - international role . but goerzig says the eu 's presence in the quartet was not as strong as it could have been .
" the eu has been shy about asserting itself in the quartet , which could be related to its lack of coherence , " said goerzig .
" there is a need for debate on this issue in the eu , and i think germany could drive such a debate . "
the eu foreign policy chief catherine ashton said recently she will push for the launch of " proximity " talks between the israelis and the palestinians as a prologue to formal negotiations .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de world war ii -pipe- 23.03.2010 french children of wehrmacht soldiers seek german nationality großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of german soldiers fathered children in occupied france their mothers were french , their fathers were german soldiers in nazi-occupied france .
some 200,000 children endured scorn and often hid their father 's identity .
now some have begun applying for german citizenship . more than 200,000 children fathered by german soldiers were raised by their french mothers after the nazi occupation of france during world war ii , according to paris historian fabrice vergili .
the author of the book " naitre ennemi " -lrb- born an enemy -rrb- also estimates that 20,000 french women were hounded through streets and brutally given short haircuts by their french compatriots , who accused them of " horizontal collaboration " with the nazis .
many of these " war children " grew up not knowing their full identities and ashamed of their german roots , until recently .
since 2009 dozens have sought and obtained german nationality without having to relinquish their french citizenship , as is generally required of resident foreigners under german law .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mijo panier spent decades looking for her father mijo panier , fathered by a wehrmacht soldier and born in 1943 , recently applied for german citizenship .
" i am proud to be german and french , proud of my dual nationality .
i will use one and then the other , " she said .
the liaison that started with a sneeze powder prank not until she turned 16 did panier learn that her father had been german .
her french step-father , who accepted her as his own child , forbade her to talk about her origins .
her biological parents met in a paris cafe during the four-year occupation .
" my mother went into a cafe where young french and germans met one another , but as groups kept apart , " panier said . " my mother and her friend scattered sneeze powder under the chairs of the german soldiers . "
her father was amused and moved over to sit with the girls at their table .
that was the start of a forbidden liaison .
after a search that lasted for decades , she found her father , willi welsch , five years ago with the assistance of a berlin-based organization . welsch and his daughter mijo exchanged letters before finally meeting near frankfurt .
tender encounter near frankfurt welsch was seriously ill and had been in hospital .
" to me he was unbelievably nice .
he had blue eyes and despite his illness he drew me into the train .
i sat down next to him and there we remained silent for a long time .
then we exchanged a few words in english , german and french . "
with tears in her eyes , panier adds , " it was as though i had found my second half . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : societies of war children have been formed in france welsch died a few months later , but since then panier has fostered intense contacts with her recently-discovered family in germany .
there is a photo of her paternal sister in her french living room .
months ago she sent a letter to the german embassy - in german .
" i was a child of shame .
in the end , however , i am a child of love , " she wrote .
although panier now speaks openly about her father 's origins her mother still does not want to talk about it .
shrugging off shame prompts search for family roots the urge to free themselves from shame motivates many of france 's " war children " to apply officially for their german nationality .
the surge began after a broadcast on french television in 2003 .
many former war children then contacted the paris historian virgili and went on to set up groups such as the national friendship association for war children to help each other to trace their roots .
their wartime experiences soon became a talking point in france .
hewige roberval sent her application to the german embassy shortly before her marriage .
" not long before my wedding i told my fiance about my father .
i was really scared that he might no longer want to marry me .
fortunately , he only laughed about it . "
panier says that if her application for german citzenship is granted , she plans to officially adopt her deceased father 's family name .
it is already on her letter box .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de elections -pipe- 23.03.2010 sarkozy reshuffles cabinet after crushing election defeat großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : socialists took control in all but one region of france french president nicolas sarkozy has made only minor cabinet changes after his center-right bloc suffered heavy defeats in regional elections .
the appointments may help him garner support within his party . although president nicolas sarkozy has said that the regional election results were not an indictment of his national government , he met with prime minister francois fillon on monday to discuss a cabinet reshuffle . following those talks , the president announced that he was sacking a senior minister in what was seen as an effort to regain the initiative . labor minister xavier darcos , who had been set to lead negotiations over controversial pension reforms , was sent packing because his party 's defeat in sunday 's vote meant he no longer had the necessary credibility to oversee the overhaul of the costly french pension system .
he is to be replaced by eric woerth , the current budget minister . francois baroin , a close ally of former president jacques chirac , is to replace woerth in a move expected to appease the chirac " old guard " in sarkozy ’ s conservative ump party .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president sarkozy said the results were not an indictment of his government sarkozy has nominated georges tron , who is an ally of former prime minister dominique de villepin , as junior minister for the civil service . villepin , an opponent of the president , is expected to announce later this week that he will set up a rival centre-right political party .
the appointment of tron deprives villepin of a possible ally .
another conservative , marc-philippe daubresse , became minister for youth .
he effectively replaces centre-left politician martin hirsch , who had been a symbol of sarkozy ’ s effort to recruit talent from the opposition . future reshuffle possible with only two officials leaving the government , the changes are seen as relatively minor , with a more wide-ranging reshuffle possible ahead of presidential elections in 2012 .
in sunday 's second-round run-off vote , the socialist-led opposition beat sarkozy 's union for a popular movement -lrb- ump -rrb- by a margin of 54 percent to 36 percent .
the left gained control of 21 of france 's 22 mainland regions . the far-right front national came away with 9.3 percent nationwide , after qualifying for the second round in nine regions .
but veteran party leader jean-marie le pen scored big in his home region in southern france , winning more than 22 percent of the vote .
voter turnout , at 51 percent , was four points higher than last sunday 's first round of polling .
pollsters say the country 's anemic economy and growing unemployment as well as sarkozy 's relentless reform course have disillusioned voters .
also , a string of recent controversies , ranging from a debate on national identity to accusations of nepotism , have been eroding his popularity .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : villepin is set to announce plans to form a rival party alsace remains conservative although sunday 's election outcome was a triumph for the socialists , the ump looks set to hold on to its traditional stronghold , the alsace region along the german border . but the island of corsica , another conservative bastion , was snatched from the ump by the socialist alliance .
the ump held on to french guyana and reunion , while guadeloupe went to the socialists .
the result is very similar to the last regional poll in 2004 when the socialists came away with 20 of the 22 mainland districts , but were defeated in the presidential election three years later .
even so , the poll is seen as a rejection of sarkozy and his policies and perhaps the worst defeat of his political career .
the president has already announced a hiatus in reform plans for next year and this loss could make him even more cautious about pushing painful changes. gb / db / afp / apn / dpa / reuters editor : ben knight send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the appointments may help him garner support within his party . although president nicolas sarkozy has said that the regional election results were not an indictment of his national government , he met with prime minister francois fillon on monday to discuss a cabinet reshuffle . following those talks , the president announced that he was sacking a senior minister in what was seen as an effort to regain the initiative . labor minister xavier darcos , who had been set to lead negotiations over controversial pension reforms , was sent packing because his party 's defeat in sunday 's vote meant he no longer had the necessary credibility to oversee the overhaul of the costly french pension system .
he is to be replaced by eric woerth , the current budget minister . francois baroin , a close ally of former president jacques chirac , is to replace woerth in a move expected to appease the chirac " old guard " in sarkozy ’ s conservative ump party .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president sarkozy said the results were not an indictment of his government sarkozy has nominated georges tron , who is an ally of former prime minister dominique de villepin , as junior minister for the civil service . villepin , an opponent of the president , is expected to announce later this week that he will set up a rival centre-right political party .
the appointment of tron deprives villepin of a possible ally .
another conservative , marc-philippe daubresse , became minister for youth .
he effectively replaces centre-left politician martin hirsch , who had been a symbol of sarkozy ’ s effort to recruit talent from the opposition . future reshuffle possible with only two officials leaving the government , the changes are seen as relatively minor , with a more wide-ranging reshuffle possible ahead of presidential elections in 2012 .
in sunday 's second-round run-off vote , the socialist-led opposition beat sarkozy 's union for a popular movement -lrb- ump -rrb- by a margin of 54 percent to 36 percent .
the left gained control of 21 of france 's 22 mainland regions . the far-right front national came away with 9.3 percent nationwide , after qualifying for the second round in nine regions .
but veteran party leader jean-marie le pen scored big in his home region in southern france , winning more than 22 percent of the vote .
voter turnout , at 51 percent , was four points higher than last sunday 's first round of polling .
pollsters say the country 's anemic economy and growing unemployment as well as sarkozy 's relentless reform course have disillusioned voters .
also , a string of recent controversies , ranging from a debate on national identity to accusations of nepotism , have been eroding his popularity .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : villepin is set to announce plans to form a rival party alsace remains conservative although sunday 's election outcome was a triumph for the socialists , the ump looks set to hold on to its traditional stronghold , the alsace region along the german border . but the island of corsica , another conservative bastion , was snatched from the ump by the socialist alliance .
the ump held on to french guyana and reunion , while guadeloupe went to the socialists .
the result is very similar to the last regional poll in 2004 when the socialists came away with 20 of the 22 mainland districts , but were defeated in the presidential election three years later .
even so , the poll is seen as a rejection of sarkozy and his policies and perhaps the worst defeat of his political career .
the president has already announced a hiatus in reform plans for next year and this loss could make him even more cautious about pushing painful changes. gb / db / afp / apn / dpa / reuters editor : ben knight send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the appointments may help him garner support within his party . although president nicolas sarkozy has said that the regional election results were not an indictment of his national government , he met with prime minister francois fillon on monday to discuss a cabinet reshuffle . following those talks , the president announced that he was sacking a senior minister in what was seen as an effort to regain the initiative . labor minister xavier darcos , who had been set to lead negotiations over controversial pension reforms , was sent packing because his party 's defeat in sunday 's vote meant he no longer had the necessary credibility to oversee the overhaul of the costly french pension system .
he is to be replaced by eric woerth , the current budget minister . francois baroin , a close ally of former president jacques chirac , is to replace woerth in a move expected to appease the chirac " old guard " in sarkozy ’ s conservative ump party .

it 's even possible to earn money buy cutting emissions . from africa to south america to asia , when it comes to cooking , many people around the world face similar problems .
family members are forced to sit close by an open fireplace so smoky that the kitchen walls have been coated in black soot .
the children have coughs , and the women have already developed lung disease .
they 're the ones who do the majority of cooking , after all .
and that means long exposure to fires which cause bronchitis , asthma , and lung cancer .
according to the world health organization -lrb- who -rrb- , some 1.5 million people die each year from lung diseases resulting from wood-burning fires – more than the number of people who die each year from malaria .
firewood 's vicious cycle almost half the world 's population – around three billion people – cooks over open fires .
wood is the main fuel source but crop residue , dung , and charcoal are used as well .
it 's an economic and environmental vicious cycle .
forests are chopped down for firewood , resulting in an increase of erosion .
rain sweeps fertile topsoil from the fields , and harvests get smaller .
and the weather becomes drier , because the absence of forests changes the regional climate .
those who cook over open fires also lose valuable working time in the gathering of firewood – another factor that contributes to poverty .
and it 's a well-known fact that wood burning fires damage the climate , causing some 17 percent of carbon dioxide emissions globally .
bildunterschrift : a large pot over an open fire - many poor people still cook this way because of all these problems , development aid workers are pushing for greater availability of efficient stoves and ovens worldwide .
" they are a key factor in rural development , because they reduce poverty and illness and they help protect the climate , " said verena brinkmann , who works on the household energy program for germany 's technical aid organization , gtz .
used optimally , a new stove can help a family cut their annual fuel consumption in half , saving 1.5 tons of carbon dioxide .
clean cooking with the " rocket stove " efficient stoves and ovens are easy to build , says svane bender of the german environmental organization , nabu , which is working on a project to provide stoves to families in ethiopia .
" that 's the advantage they have in comparison to solar ovens , for example , which need a lot of imported parts , " bender said .
due to different regional factors such as fuel methods and what kind of food is commonly prepared determine which kind of oven meets the populations ' needs , a wide variety of efficient ovens are available " ethiopians eat a kind of flat , round bread known as injera , so an oven was developed for that purpose , " said bender .
in many projects , people learn how to build their own ovens out of clay , metal , or bricks .
well-insulated combustion chambers and wind protection that keeps cool air away from the cooking pot ensure efficiency .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in africa , 90 percent of all food is cooked - mainly the traditional way , over an open fire emerging economies like china and india currently have the most modern efficient stoves , thanks to strong government support for their expansion .
" purchasing power is important for success – and there 's plenty of purchasing power in both of these booming emerging nations , " said brinkmann .
but the new stoves are also becoming more popular in developing countries , especially in eastern africa .
in addition to ethiopia and kenya , uganda is considered to be a model example .
there , half a million households are cooking with the clay oven known as the rocket stove , which emits hardly any smoke .
according to the gtz , this particular model saves households a ton of wood each year .
the organization is training villagers to become professional stove builders .
without such commitment on the ground , even such well-intentioned projects can often fail after a very short time .
climate protection and profit modern cooking methods are also increasingly becoming important in south america , particularly in bolivia and peru .
the peruvian government aims to distribute some 500,000 efficient stoves among its people , with the help of companies such as microsol .
after all , they can earn money with efficient stoves , thanks to the clean development mechanism -lrb- cdm -rrb- within the framework of the kyoto protocol on climate protection .
it allows companies from the signatory nations to buy emissions credits for climate protection projects in developing countries .
they can either sell them , or use them to offset their own co2 reduction goals .
companies buy the certificates from firms such as microsol , which develop their own climate projects specifically for this purpose .
emissions certificates from projects which have achieved the so-called " gold standard " are especially expensive .
companies commit to such projects voluntarily , as they get a huge image boost from the standard 's rigorous criteria .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in uganda , the rocket stove has become popular .
it 's built out of clay and has a chimney until now , only four stove projects have registered globally for emissions trading ; 13 others projects are currently being evaluated by independent bodies on behalf of the cdm advisory board .
but many more projects are needed because , as the gtz has noted , efficient stoves and ovens have not yet achieved the global breakthrough that the united nations once hoped for .
the un millennium development goals agreed on in 2000 aimed to reduce the number of people still using traditional cooking methods by half .
but in order to reach this goal , some 500,000 modern stoves would have to be introduced each day – a utopian number .
despite this , development workers are hopeful .
through the measures put in place by the cdm , large sums of money from private investors can finally be made available , turning efficient stoves and ovens into mass market products .
" we have to see now , what the effects of the latest cdm business have been , " said brinkmann .
" but it seems clear that it offers new development potential to efficient cooking methods . "
that 's also the goal of the private un foundation that will found the " global alliance for clean ovens " at the end of march .
it aims to provide 50 million new units to developing countries in the next five years .

family members are forced to sit close by an open fireplace so smoky that the kitchen walls have been coated in black soot .
the children have coughs , and the women have already developed lung disease .
they 're the ones who do the majority of cooking , after all .
and that means long exposure to fires which cause bronchitis , asthma , and lung cancer .
according to the world health organization -lrb- who -rrb- , some 1.5 million people die each year from lung diseases resulting from wood-burning fires – more than the number of people who die each year from malaria .
firewood 's vicious cycle almost half the world 's population – around three billion people – cooks over open fires .
wood is the main fuel source but crop residue , dung , and charcoal are used as well .
it 's an economic and environmental vicious cycle .
forests are chopped down for firewood , resulting in an increase of erosion .
rain sweeps fertile topsoil from the fields , and harvests get smaller .
and the weather becomes drier , because the absence of forests changes the regional climate .
those who cook over open fires also lose valuable working time in the gathering of firewood – another factor that contributes to poverty .
and it 's a well-known fact that wood burning fires damage the climate , causing some 17 percent of carbon dioxide emissions globally .

" they are a key factor in rural development , because they reduce poverty and illness and they help protect the climate , " said verena brinkmann , who works on the household energy program for germany 's technical aid organization , gtz .
used optimally , a new stove can help a family cut their annual fuel consumption in half , saving 1.5 tons of carbon dioxide .
clean cooking with the " rocket stove " efficient stoves and ovens are easy to build , says svane bender of the german environmental organization , nabu , which is working on a project to provide stoves to families in ethiopia .
" that 's the advantage they have in comparison to solar ovens , for example , which need a lot of imported parts , " bender said .
due to different regional factors such as fuel methods and what kind of food is commonly prepared determine which kind of oven meets the populations ' needs , a wide variety of efficient ovens are available " ethiopians eat a kind of flat , round bread known as injera , so an oven was developed for that purpose , " said bender .
in many projects , people learn how to build their own ovens out of clay , metal , or bricks .
well-insulated combustion chambers and wind protection that keeps cool air away from the cooking pot ensure efficiency .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in africa , 90 percent of all food is cooked - mainly the traditional way , over an open fire emerging economies like china and india currently have the most modern efficient stoves , thanks to strong government support for their expansion .

it 's even possible to earn money buy cutting emissions . from africa to south america to asia , when it comes to cooking , many people around the world face similar problems .
family members are forced to sit close by an open fireplace so smoky that the kitchen walls have been coated in black soot .
the children have coughs , and the women have already developed lung disease .
they 're the ones who do the majority of cooking , after all .
and that means long exposure to fires which cause bronchitis , asthma , and lung cancer .
according to the world health organization -lrb- who -rrb- , some 1.5 million people die each year from lung diseases resulting from wood-burning fires – more than the number of people who die each year from malaria .
firewood 's vicious cycle almost half the world 's population – around three billion people – cooks over open fires .
wood is the main fuel source but crop residue , dung , and charcoal are used as well .
it 's an economic and environmental vicious cycle .
forests are chopped down for firewood , resulting in an increase of erosion .
rain sweeps fertile topsoil from the fields , and harvests get smaller .
and the weather becomes drier , because the absence of forests changes the regional climate .
those who cook over open fires also lose valuable working time in the gathering of firewood – another factor that contributes to poverty .
and it 's a well-known fact that wood burning fires damage the climate , causing some 17 percent of carbon dioxide emissions globally .
bildunterschrift : a large pot over an open fire - many poor people still cook this way because of all these problems , development aid workers are pushing for greater availability of efficient stoves and ovens worldwide .
" they are a key factor in rural development , because they reduce poverty and illness and they help protect the climate , " said verena brinkmann , who works on the household energy program for germany 's technical aid organization , gtz .
used optimally , a new stove can help a family cut their annual fuel consumption in half , saving 1.5 tons of carbon dioxide .
clean cooking with the " rocket stove " efficient stoves and ovens are easy to build , says svane bender of the german environmental organization , nabu , which is working on a project to provide stoves to families in ethiopia .
" that 's the advantage they have in comparison to solar ovens , for example , which need a lot of imported parts , " bender said .
due to different regional factors such as fuel methods and what kind of food is commonly prepared determine which kind of oven meets the populations ' needs , a wide variety of efficient ovens are available " ethiopians eat a kind of flat , round bread known as injera , so an oven was developed for that purpose , " said bender .
in many projects , people learn how to build their own ovens out of clay , metal , or bricks .
well-insulated combustion chambers and wind protection that keeps cool air away from the cooking pot ensure efficiency .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in africa , 90 percent of all food is cooked - mainly the traditional way , over an open fire emerging economies like china and india currently have the most modern efficient stoves , thanks to strong government support for their expansion .
" purchasing power is important for success – and there 's plenty of purchasing power in both of these booming emerging nations , " said brinkmann .
but the new stoves are also becoming more popular in developing countries , especially in eastern africa .
in addition to ethiopia and kenya , uganda is considered to be a model example .
there , half a million households are cooking with the clay oven known as the rocket stove , which emits hardly any smoke .
according to the gtz , this particular model saves households a ton of wood each year .
the organization is training villagers to become professional stove builders .
without such commitment on the ground , even such well-intentioned projects can often fail after a very short time .
climate protection and profit modern cooking methods are also increasingly becoming important in south america , particularly in bolivia and peru .
the peruvian government aims to distribute some 500,000 efficient stoves among its people , with the help of companies such as microsol .
after all , they can earn money with efficient stoves , thanks to the clean development mechanism -lrb- cdm -rrb- within the framework of the kyoto protocol on climate protection .
it allows companies from the signatory nations to buy emissions credits for climate protection projects in developing countries .
they can either sell them , or use them to offset their own co2 reduction goals .
companies buy the certificates from firms such as microsol , which develop their own climate projects specifically for this purpose .
emissions certificates from projects which have achieved the so-called " gold standard " are especially expensive .
companies commit to such projects voluntarily , as they get a huge image boost from the standard 's rigorous criteria .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in uganda , the rocket stove has become popular .
it 's built out of clay and has a chimney until now , only four stove projects have registered globally for emissions trading ; 13 others projects are currently being evaluated by independent bodies on behalf of the cdm advisory board .
but many more projects are needed because , as the gtz has noted , efficient stoves and ovens have not yet achieved the global breakthrough that the united nations once hoped for .
the un millennium development goals agreed on in 2000 aimed to reduce the number of people still using traditional cooking methods by half .
but in order to reach this goal , some 500,000 modern stoves would have to be introduced each day – a utopian number .
despite this , development workers are hopeful .
through the measures put in place by the cdm , large sums of money from private investors can finally be made available , turning efficient stoves and ovens into mass market products .
" we have to see now , what the effects of the latest cdm business have been , " said brinkmann .
" but it seems clear that it offers new development potential to efficient cooking methods . "
that 's also the goal of the private un foundation that will found the " global alliance for clean ovens " at the end of march .
it aims to provide 50 million new units to developing countries in the next five years .

but experts warn jobs could also go out the door . recovering from its worst slump since world war two , german industry plans to step up investments in international sales and distribution networks as well as production facilities in key foreign markets . according to a new report by the german chambers of industry and commerce -lrb- dihk -rrb- , 44 percent of the 9,000 companies surveyed said they intend to make investments in foreign countries , up from 40 percent last year .
more than a third -lrb- 37 percent -rrb- of the companies said they had plans to invest in china , up from 32 percent .
" need to start investing again " “ after experiencing a drop in exports of as much as 80 percent in some cases , german industrial companies see signs of a recovery , ” volker treier , chief economist at dihk , told deutsche welle .
“ many recognize a need to start investing again to maintain their presence abroad ; they do n't want to lose what they 've built up . ”

but experts warn jobs could also go out the door . recovering from its worst slump since world war two , german industry plans to step up investments in international sales and distribution networks as well as production facilities in key foreign markets . according to a new report by the german chambers of industry and commerce -lrb- dihk -rrb- , 44 percent of the 9,000 companies surveyed said they intend to make investments in foreign countries , up from 40 percent last year .
more than a third -lrb- 37 percent -rrb- of the companies said they had plans to invest in china , up from 32 percent .
" need to start investing again " “ after experiencing a drop in exports of as much as 80 percent in some cases , german industrial companies see signs of a recovery , ” volker treier , chief economist at dihk , told deutsche welle .
“ many recognize a need to start investing again to maintain their presence abroad ; they do n't want to lose what they 've built up . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : low labor costs are no longer that main reason why german companies invest abroad financing is an issue , treier conceded .
he pointed to the reluctance of numerous banks stung by the global economic crisis to lend money to industrial companies - especially those planning investments in projects far away from germany .
“ this is definitely a problem but it is one where the banks , the government and other groups have been working together with industry to find solutions , ” treier said .
“ there are some measures underway to ensure the flow of credit . ”
today , 100 of germany 's largest publicly-listed companies generate more than two thirds of their sales outside the country .
a sizable chunk of these sales still come from products that are “ made in germany ” and sold in china .
german exports to china rose by 7 percent in 2009 , the federal statistical office reported monday .
the increase bucked the trend in a dismal year for germany , where overall exports slumped by 18 percent .
the exported goods were valued at 36.5 billion euros .
building logistics networks and new factories cheap labor is no longer a key driver of foreign investments by german industry , according to the dihk survey ; only 28 percent of the polled companies cited low production costs as a reason for their investments abroad – and only 20 percent for their investments in china .
“ that was the reason about five years ago but german manufacturers have since done much to increase productivity in their domestic operations , ” economist treier said .
“ the investments that are being made today or are planned in the near future are all about building up local sales and logistics networks and even new factories to take full advantage of huge emerging markets such as china , india and brazil ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daimler already builds cars in brazil and has plans for manufacturing in the us german car manufacturing , perhaps more than any other industry in the country , is racing ahead to win market share in these emerging markets .
volkswagen , for instance , is currently expanding its local production facilities in china and india as well as in the us .
“ german carmakers really do n't have an alternative , ” said thomas kautzsch , a manufacturing consultant with the management consultancy oliver wyman in munich . jobs in germany will go martin haubensak , a consultant with at kearny agrees .
“ vw tried to build everything in wolfsburg and then ship everything around the globe , ” he said .
“ now they realize it makes more sense , from an economic and competitive perspective , to build regionally . ”
investments in new production facilities abroad , however , will come at the expense of jobs in germany in the long term , experts agree .
“ we are definitely going to see some adjustments , ” said ferdinand dudenhoeffer , a professor at the university of duisburg-essen and an expert on the german car industry .
“ german carmakers need to manufacturer cars abroad for a number of reasons , including low labor costs and import duties .
the number of jobs in germany will definitely go down . ”
dudenhoeffer expects germany 's auto industry to shed 50,000 of its current 700,000 jobs by 2015 .
“ the future is in the new markets , ” he said .
“ production is already moving there . ”

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : low labor costs are no longer that main reason why german companies invest abroad financing is an issue , treier conceded .
he pointed to the reluctance of numerous banks stung by the global economic crisis to lend money to industrial companies - especially those planning investments in projects far away from germany .
“ this is definitely a problem but it is one where the banks , the government and other groups have been working together with industry to find solutions , ” treier said .
“ there are some measures underway to ensure the flow of credit . ”
today , 100 of germany 's largest publicly-listed companies generate more than two thirds of their sales outside the country .
a sizable chunk of these sales still come from products that are “ made in germany ” and sold in china .
german exports to china rose by 7 percent in 2009 , the federal statistical office reported monday .
the increase bucked the trend in a dismal year for germany , where overall exports slumped by 18 percent .
the exported goods were valued at 36.5 billion euros .
building logistics networks and new factories cheap labor is no longer a key driver of foreign investments by german industry , according to the dihk survey ; only 28 percent of the polled companies cited low production costs as a reason for their investments abroad – and only 20 percent for their investments in china .
“ that was the reason about five years ago but german manufacturers have since done much to increase productivity in their domestic operations , ” economist treier said .
“ the investments that are being made today or are planned in the near future are all about building up local sales and logistics networks and even new factories to take full advantage of huge emerging markets such as china , india and brazil ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daimler already builds cars in brazil and has plans for manufacturing in the us german car manufacturing , perhaps more than any other industry in the country , is racing ahead to win market share in these emerging markets .
volkswagen , for instance , is currently expanding its local production facilities in china and india as well as in the us .
“ german carmakers really do n't have an alternative , ” said thomas kautzsch , a manufacturing consultant with the management consultancy oliver wyman in munich . jobs in germany will go martin haubensak , a consultant with at kearny agrees .
“ vw tried to build everything in wolfsburg and then ship everything around the globe , ” he said .
“ now they realize it makes more sense , from an economic and competitive perspective , to build regionally . ”
investments in new production facilities abroad , however , will come at the expense of jobs in germany in the long term , experts agree .
“ we are definitely going to see some adjustments , ” said ferdinand dudenhoeffer , a professor at the university of duisburg-essen and an expert on the german car industry .
“ german carmakers need to manufacturer cars abroad for a number of reasons , including low labor costs and import duties .
the number of jobs in germany will definitely go down . ”
dudenhoeffer expects germany 's auto industry to shed 50,000 of its current 700,000 jobs by 2015 .
“ the future is in the new markets , ” he said .
“ production is already moving there . ”

" the year of the flood " is a futuristic account of the aftermath of a major natural disaster that seems to have obliterated most of humankind .
adam one - the leader of a religious group that melds science , religion and nature - had predicted such an event .
after it happens , he and his followers regroup in a world that is altered and unpredictable . born in 1939 , atwood has published short stories , critical studies , screenplays , books for children , and poems , but is best known for her novels .
her work has been translated into over 30 languages . click on the audio link below to listen to the complete interview with margaret atwood . deutsche welle : you lived in germany in the 1980s .
what did you experience during that time ? margaret atwood : i came to germany for the very first time for my german publisher in the 70s .
then , as it turned out , in 1984 , i began " the handmaid 's tale " in berlin before the wall came down .
i began it in berlin , i finished it in tuscaloosa , alabama , which is quite a contrast .
but both of them were situations that had built-in stresses , because west berlin at that time of course was encircled by the wall and every sunday the east german air force flew over and made sonic booms , just to remind us that they were there . -lrb- … -rrb- now in germany you 're presenting your new book " the year of the flood . "
how significant is it that this book was finished in the year of your 70th birthday ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the publication of atwood 's book was postponed because of the us elections it was actually finished a year earlier .
the publication was postponed for a year because if it had been published in 2008 , it would have coincided with the american election and the american publisher quite rightly said , nobody is going to be doing anything except watching this election because whether it 's hillary clinton or barack obama , it 'll be unprecedented and everyone will be glued to their screen , which they were . i started to think a lot about your childhood when i was reading this book - the experience of being in a forest and the work of your father . yes , he was an entomologist , but he was also an all-around naturalist and what they call in canada woodsman .
in other words , he was very experienced in what we call " the bush . " -lrb- ... -rrb- i would be very scared if this latest book of yours is a prophesy about the future . first of all , it 's not a prophesy because i do n't do prophesies ; no one can really predict the future .
even the old testament prophets were n't predicting the future , they were more or less saying this is the state of your soul now .
you ca n't really write about the future because nobody has been there .
it 's like dante writing about the inferno .
i hate to break this to you , but he did not actually go down into hell . -lrb- … -rrb- are you an optimist about the future ?
this book tells us about environmental devastation , which we hear about every day in the news . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dante never actually went to hell , quipped atwood it 's not actually about that so much .
the truth is , if you remove the people , nature comes back quite well , which is where we are when the book opens .
there 's quite a lot of nature .
it 's not that all of nature gets destroyed . -lrb- … -rrb- as william gibson says , the future is already here , but it 's unevenly distributed .
some people say global warming , but really they should say climate change because the weather gets more extreme .
things change .
it 's not that everything goes away , but things change .
and if they change too abruptly , what you get is a lot of die-off . what 's really scary in this book is not that so much , although that 's a motivator , but what 's scary is that we can make new species .
we already can make new species , and we 're doing it .
but the really scary thing is we can make new diseases .
we already have that capacity .
why has not some country made a disgusting new disease and unleashed it on everybody else ?
they 're afraid of the blow-back .
there 's no way of doing that without the possibility that your country will get it too , with things being so very spreadable . -lrb- … -rrb- what a lot of people do n't know is that your first publication was actually a book of poems . yes , but it was n't the first thing i wrote .
i was actually writing the prose and the poems at the same time .
it was just that in those days , in canada , where it what almost impossible to publish a full-length novel , poems were a lot cheaper , they were shorter .
and typically you started out writing them off on a mimeo machine or putting together a little cold type book or hand-setting them , which is what i did with my first little booklet of poems - i hand-set them on a flatbed press .
try hand-setting a novel on a flatbed press ! -lrb- … -rrb- would i be right in assuming that margaret atwood is an optimist ? anyone who writes a book is an optimist .

" the year of the flood " is a futuristic account of the aftermath of a major natural disaster that seems to have obliterated most of humankind .
adam one - the leader of a religious group that melds science , religion and nature - had predicted such an event .
after it happens , he and his followers regroup in a world that is altered and unpredictable . born in 1939 , atwood has published short stories , critical studies , screenplays , books for children , and poems , but is best known for her novels .
her work has been translated into over 30 languages . click on the audio link below to listen to the complete interview with margaret atwood . deutsche welle : you lived in germany in the 1980s .
what did you experience during that time ? margaret atwood : i came to germany for the very first time for my german publisher in the 70s .
then , as it turned out , in 1984 , i began " the handmaid 's tale " in berlin before the wall came down .
i began it in berlin , i finished it in tuscaloosa , alabama , which is quite a contrast .
but both of them were situations that had built-in stresses , because west berlin at that time of course was encircled by the wall and every sunday the east german air force flew over and made sonic booms , just to remind us that they were there . -lrb- … -rrb- now in germany you 're presenting your new book " the year of the flood . "
how significant is it that this book was finished in the year of your 70th birthday ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the publication of atwood 's book was postponed because of the us elections it was actually finished a year earlier .
the publication was postponed for a year because if it had been published in 2008 , it would have coincided with the american election and the american publisher quite rightly said , nobody is going to be doing anything except watching this election because whether it 's hillary clinton or barack obama , it 'll be unprecedented and everyone will be glued to their screen , which they were . i started to think a lot about your childhood when i was reading this book - the experience of being in a forest and the work of your father . yes , he was an entomologist , but he was also an all-around naturalist and what they call in canada woodsman .
in other words , he was very experienced in what we call " the bush . " -lrb- ... -rrb- i would be very scared if this latest book of yours is a prophesy about the future . first of all , it 's not a prophesy because i do n't do prophesies ; no one can really predict the future .
even the old testament prophets were n't predicting the future , they were more or less saying this is the state of your soul now .
you ca n't really write about the future because nobody has been there .
it 's like dante writing about the inferno .
i hate to break this to you , but he did not actually go down into hell . -lrb- … -rrb- are you an optimist about the future ?
this book tells us about environmental devastation , which we hear about every day in the news . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dante never actually went to hell , quipped atwood it 's not actually about that so much .
the truth is , if you remove the people , nature comes back quite well , which is where we are when the book opens .
there 's quite a lot of nature .
it 's not that all of nature gets destroyed . -lrb- … -rrb- as william gibson says , the future is already here , but it 's unevenly distributed .
some people say global warming , but really they should say climate change because the weather gets more extreme .
things change .
it 's not that everything goes away , but things change .
and if they change too abruptly , what you get is a lot of die-off . what 's really scary in this book is not that so much , although that 's a motivator , but what 's scary is that we can make new species .
we already can make new species , and we 're doing it .
but the really scary thing is we can make new diseases .
we already have that capacity .
why has not some country made a disgusting new disease and unleashed it on everybody else ?
they 're afraid of the blow-back .
there 's no way of doing that without the possibility that your country will get it too , with things being so very spreadable . -lrb- … -rrb- what a lot of people do n't know is that your first publication was actually a book of poems . yes , but it was n't the first thing i wrote .
i was actually writing the prose and the poems at the same time .
it was just that in those days , in canada , where it what almost impossible to publish a full-length novel , poems were a lot cheaper , they were shorter .
and typically you started out writing them off on a mimeo machine or putting together a little cold type book or hand-setting them , which is what i did with my first little booklet of poems - i hand-set them on a flatbed press .
try hand-setting a novel on a flatbed press ! -lrb- … -rrb- would i be right in assuming that margaret atwood is an optimist ? anyone who writes a book is an optimist .

in other words , he was very experienced in what we call " the bush . " -lrb- ... -rrb- i would be very scared if this latest book of yours is a prophesy about the future . first of all , it 's not a prophesy because i do n't do prophesies ; no one can really predict the future .
even the old testament prophets were n't predicting the future , they were more or less saying this is the state of your soul now .
you ca n't really write about the future because nobody has been there .
it 's like dante writing about the inferno .
i hate to break this to you , but he did not actually go down into hell . -lrb- … -rrb- are you an optimist about the future ?
this book tells us about environmental devastation , which we hear about every day in the news . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dante never actually went to hell , quipped atwood it 's not actually about that so much .
the truth is , if you remove the people , nature comes back quite well , which is where we are when the book opens .
there 's quite a lot of nature .
it 's not that all of nature gets destroyed . -lrb- … -rrb- as william gibson says , the future is already here , but it 's unevenly distributed .
some people say global warming , but really they should say climate change because the weather gets more extreme .
things change .
it 's not that everything goes away , but things change .
and if they change too abruptly , what you get is a lot of die-off . what 's really scary in this book is not that so much , although that 's a motivator , but what 's scary is that we can make new species .
we already can make new species , and we 're doing it .
but the really scary thing is we can make new diseases .
we already have that capacity .
why has not some country made a disgusting new disease and unleashed it on everybody else ?
they 're afraid of the blow-back .
there 's no way of doing that without the possibility that your country will get it too , with things being so very spreadable . -lrb- … -rrb- what a lot of people do n't know is that your first publication was actually a book of poems . yes , but it was n't the first thing i wrote .
i was actually writing the prose and the poems at the same time .
it was just that in those days , in canada , where it what almost impossible to publish a full-length novel , poems were a lot cheaper , they were shorter .
and typically you started out writing them off on a mimeo machine or putting together a little cold type book or hand-setting them , which is what i did with my first little booklet of poems - i hand-set them on a flatbed press .
try hand-setting a novel on a flatbed press ! -lrb- … -rrb- would i be right in assuming that margaret atwood is an optimist ? anyone who writes a book is an optimist .
no matter what the content .
the optimistic thing about this thing is : it 's a book .
it has n't happened yet .
keep it inside those covers . interview : breandain o 'shea -lrb- kjb -rrb- editor : greg wiser send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we are not disappointed , we are shocked at what happened , " said ekmeleddin ihsanoglu , the turkish head of the organization of the islamic conference -lrb- oic -rrb- , which had convened sunday 's donor conference .
the organizers raised $ 841 million -lrb- 622 million euros -rrb- for infrastructure projects for displaced people in darfur in western sudan - less than half the targeted amount of $ 2 billion .
egyptian foreign minister ahmed abul gheit told the closing session that the countries which made pledges included algeria , australia , brazil , morocco , qatar , and turkey .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : organizers hoped to raise $ 2 billion ahead of the international donor conference several western countries opted to keep their hands in their pockets , citing security concerns in sudan .
" in the absence of proper conditions on the ground , our focus remains on humanitarian assistance , " a norwegian delegate said , echoing the view of many of the western diplomats in attendance .
" our presence here constitutes a political message , " one unnamed western diplomat told news agency afp , adding that his country would not donate money because of " the uncertainty of how the money will be used or channelled . "
the timing of the conference may have been especially poor , coming as it did just three weeks before sudan is due to hold its first multi-party elections since 1986 .
the country 's veteran leader , president omar hassan al-bashir , who was indicted by the international criminal court -lrb- icc -rrb- last year for war crimes and crimes against humanity during sudan 's seven-year rebellion in darfur , is seeking reelection .
many sudan experts doubt the country 's readiness for a democratic election process .
just the organization and sheer number of ballots involved represent a significant logistical hurdle , said sara pantuliano , a research fellow at the london-based overseas development institute .
" mock elections were held at the university of khartoum , and it took a university graduate an average of 23 minutes to fill out all the ballots , " she told deutsche welle . " and in mock elections held by an ngo in the south , it took illiterate women an average of three hours to fill out the ballots .
so even if the election was free and fair , there will be such a degree of confusion that even in the best of scenarios , there will still be results that will not reflect the wishes of the population . "
given the momentous challenge , she said she was not surprised that the donor conference in cairo failed to muster its target sum .
" the election is an important landmark , and we 've seen a similar holding back for southern sudan , amid discussions of reallocating funding for the south , so there is a wait-and-see attitude at the moment which applies to the whole country , " pantuliano said .
political rift ahead of elections political tensions ahead of the election are high as bashir has for the first time faced calls from senior government members to surrender to the icc .
on saturday , the head of intelligence for the sudan people 's liberation movement -lrb- splm -rrb- , edward lino , told reuters that bashir has no option but to respond to the icc .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sudanese president omar al bashir said the icc warrant against him has increased his popularity " there are many dignitaries who were taken and he is not an exception .
for the good of the country , bashir should take leave and go to the hague , " lino said .
the splm 's presidential candidate , yasir arman , has also challenged bashir to withdraw from the poll in order to encourage southerners to vote for unity in the south 's self-determination referendum , which must be held before january 9 , 2011 .
according to the brussels-based international crisis group -lrb- icg -rrb- , efforts to resolve both the country 's ongoing north-south civil war and the conflict in darfur have been hampered by the intransigence of bashir 's national congress party -lrb- ncp -rrb- .
the comments from lino and arman over the weekend serve as further proof of the rift that has developed between the ncp and the splm , who signed a 2005 peace deal with bashir , joining him as junior coalition partners .
until now , the splm had been careful to steer clear of the sensitive issue of the icc , hoping to preserve their partnership until the referendum .
international efforts needed to secure peace now , the icg says both of sudan 's major conflicts could boil over again unless the april 11 election and the southern referendum lead to democratic transformation .
and , in a recent assessment of the situation in sudan , the group added that the international community has a responsibility to act .
" unless the international community , notably the us , the un , the african union -lrb- au -rrb- peace and security council , and the horn of africa inter-government authority on development -lrb- igad -rrb- , cooperate to support both comprehensive peace agreement implementation and vital additional negotiations , a return to north-south war and escalation of conflict in darfur are likely , " the icg concluded .
pantuliano of the overseas development institute agrees that there is a risk of more intense conflict following next month 's election .
" the result of the elections will almost inevitably create local tensions , and these have a risk of escalating , and having national consequences ; that is the most tangible danger , " she told deutsche welle .

" we are not disappointed , we are shocked at what happened , " said ekmeleddin ihsanoglu , the turkish head of the organization of the islamic conference -lrb- oic -rrb- , which had convened sunday 's donor conference .
the organizers raised $ 841 million -lrb- 622 million euros -rrb- for infrastructure projects for displaced people in darfur in western sudan - less than half the targeted amount of $ 2 billion .
egyptian foreign minister ahmed abul gheit told the closing session that the countries which made pledges included algeria , australia , brazil , morocco , qatar , and turkey .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : organizers hoped to raise $ 2 billion ahead of the international donor conference several western countries opted to keep their hands in their pockets , citing security concerns in sudan .
" in the absence of proper conditions on the ground , our focus remains on humanitarian assistance , " a norwegian delegate said , echoing the view of many of the western diplomats in attendance .
" our presence here constitutes a political message , " one unnamed western diplomat told news agency afp , adding that his country would not donate money because of " the uncertainty of how the money will be used or channelled . "
the timing of the conference may have been especially poor , coming as it did just three weeks before sudan is due to hold its first multi-party elections since 1986 .
the country 's veteran leader , president omar hassan al-bashir , who was indicted by the international criminal court -lrb- icc -rrb- last year for war crimes and crimes against humanity during sudan 's seven-year rebellion in darfur , is seeking reelection .
many sudan experts doubt the country 's readiness for a democratic election process .
just the organization and sheer number of ballots involved represent a significant logistical hurdle , said sara pantuliano , a research fellow at the london-based overseas development institute .
" mock elections were held at the university of khartoum , and it took a university graduate an average of 23 minutes to fill out all the ballots , " she told deutsche welle . " and in mock elections held by an ngo in the south , it took illiterate women an average of three hours to fill out the ballots .
so even if the election was free and fair , there will be such a degree of confusion that even in the best of scenarios , there will still be results that will not reflect the wishes of the population . "
given the momentous challenge , she said she was not surprised that the donor conference in cairo failed to muster its target sum .
" the election is an important landmark , and we 've seen a similar holding back for southern sudan , amid discussions of reallocating funding for the south , so there is a wait-and-see attitude at the moment which applies to the whole country , " pantuliano said .
political rift ahead of elections political tensions ahead of the election are high as bashir has for the first time faced calls from senior government members to surrender to the icc .
on saturday , the head of intelligence for the sudan people 's liberation movement -lrb- splm -rrb- , edward lino , told reuters that bashir has no option but to respond to the icc .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sudanese president omar al bashir said the icc warrant against him has increased his popularity " there are many dignitaries who were taken and he is not an exception .
for the good of the country , bashir should take leave and go to the hague , " lino said .
the splm 's presidential candidate , yasir arman , has also challenged bashir to withdraw from the poll in order to encourage southerners to vote for unity in the south 's self-determination referendum , which must be held before january 9 , 2011 .
according to the brussels-based international crisis group -lrb- icg -rrb- , efforts to resolve both the country 's ongoing north-south civil war and the conflict in darfur have been hampered by the intransigence of bashir 's national congress party -lrb- ncp -rrb- .
the comments from lino and arman over the weekend serve as further proof of the rift that has developed between the ncp and the splm , who signed a 2005 peace deal with bashir , joining him as junior coalition partners .
until now , the splm had been careful to steer clear of the sensitive issue of the icc , hoping to preserve their partnership until the referendum .
international efforts needed to secure peace now , the icg says both of sudan 's major conflicts could boil over again unless the april 11 election and the southern referendum lead to democratic transformation .
and , in a recent assessment of the situation in sudan , the group added that the international community has a responsibility to act .
" unless the international community , notably the us , the un , the african union -lrb- au -rrb- peace and security council , and the horn of africa inter-government authority on development -lrb- igad -rrb- , cooperate to support both comprehensive peace agreement implementation and vital additional negotiations , a return to north-south war and escalation of conflict in darfur are likely , " the icg concluded .
pantuliano of the overseas development institute agrees that there is a risk of more intense conflict following next month 's election .
" the result of the elections will almost inevitably create local tensions , and these have a risk of escalating , and having national consequences ; that is the most tangible danger , " she told deutsche welle .

teachers were also protesting about job cuts and planned education reforms .
staff in ministries and courts walked out , and transport workers disrupted train and metro services .
street protests were expected later in the day .
unions unimpressed by new minister the strikes came as president nicholas sarkozy responded to an electoral disaster in regional polls which was partly blamed on the unpopularity of his social reform policy .
he dismissed xavier darcos as labor minister , who was responsible for pension reform , and replaced him with the budget minister eric woerth .
but this did not impress the unions .
bernard thibault , head of the cgt union , said woerth 's reputation was as the minister who had cut staffing levels in the public sector. mll / afp / dpa editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

an overview . the newest invention is the rocket stove .
with its elbow-shaped combustion chamber , the do-it-yourself model out of clay and straw , metal or bricks reduces energy use by up to 80 percent , and cuts the amount of firewood used by anywhere from 40 to 80 percent .

that 's why there are many different kinds of efficient stoves .
an overview . the newest invention is the rocket stove .
with its elbow-shaped combustion chamber , the do-it-yourself model out of clay and straw , metal or bricks reduces energy use by up to 80 percent , and cuts the amount of firewood used by anywhere from 40 to 80 percent .
it is also almost completely smoke-free .
families use the smaller models , and larger ones are being used in school cafeterias or small restaurants .
depending on the model , size , and country , prices of rocket stoves are anywhere from three to 15 euros -lrb- four to 20 us dollars -rrb- per household .
a cafeteria-sized stove costs between 90 and 200 euros .
an example of a special regional use is the round mirt stove from ethiopia , which consists of a cement ring and a metal or clay stovetop .
the region 's traditional , round injera bread is baked on the flat stovetop with a diameter of about 60 centimeters .
compared to an open fire , the mirt stove reduces firewood use by 50 percent , and is priced at about four to six euros .
the vesto stove , which burns different organic matter , is mainly sold in south america .
it 's industrially produced , and costs around 25 euros .
the jiko charcoal stove , developed in kenya , specializes in the burning of charcoal .
today , it 's available in many african countries at a cost of between three and 10 euros .
it cuts charcoal use by 50 percent .
the upesi clay oven , also known as mandaleo , is a particularly simple construction that costs about one euro , meaning even the poorest people can afford it .
in comparison to an open fire , it saves 50 percent of firewood .
food warmers are also being used more frequently .
these are bags or baskets which are lined with naturally insulating materials such as dried banana leaves , where food can be placed after it 's been cooked to stay warm - another way of saving energy .

for 57 years , wolfgang wagner directed the festival , celebrating his grandfather 's operas .
hardly any other director has been the source of more controversy . there 's no question that wolfgang wagner was often controversial as a director and as a person .
people considered him too conservative or suggested that he was overshadowed by his brother wieland .
critics were often underwhelmed by his work as a director even though both of his productions of the classic " ring of the nibelungen " opera cycle were at least technically on point . but wagner quickly adjusted to the critical reaction and invited renowned directors from elsewhere to take over the opera 's production .
all of the great wagner directors from hans knappertbusch to christian thielemann came to bayreuth .
perhaps his most memorable staging came in 1976 with the " ring " production led by patrice chereau .
chereau , a french film and theater director , ushered in a new era in the modern reception of wagner together with the composer and director pierre boulez . the new wagner in recent years , unconventional productions by heiner mueller and christoph schlingensief sparked heated debate .
the " workshop " concept , in which young , unknown artists were given the chance to prove themselves on stage , proved disastrous .
this experiment particularly annoyed the longstanding stars of the bayreuth stage . wagner 's tenure had another handicap though : his mother was a friend of adolf hitler 's .
a 1970s documentary featured his mother praising hitler as " our blessed adolf , " which proved problematic for the festival itself .
even today , the wagner family is still trying to account for this part of its history . unparalleled contributions but wolfgang wagner 's greatest contribution to the " ring " festival was in his practical handling of the details .
he contributed like no one else to the appreciation of his grandfather 's work during the 20th century , and he helped oversee more than 1,700 productions in his career .
he succeeded in founding the richard wagner foundation in bayreuth in which public institutions contribute alongside the wagner family to offer a financial safety net for the future of the wagner festival .
under his direction , the festival has become one of the most publicized musical events in the world . the festival 's renown is part of the reason that the music world has followed the wagner clan 's conflicts so attentively .
at times , there were calls that wagner should step down and make room for someone new .
he refused , insisting on his lifetime contract and the opportunity it granted him to ensure that the wagner heritage would be preserved .
he was called stubborn and cranky , but he perfected the art of knowing when to sit a battle out . brand name bayreuth perhaps his daughters eva and katharina were named as his followers so that the then 89-year-old could no longer stand in the way of modernization and further progress in bayreuth .
but nevertheless , when wolfgang wagner stepped down from his post at the end of 2008 , he withdrew as a victor .
in the more than five decades in which he led the opera festival , he developed it into a brand and an event that is one of the most sought-after in the cultural arena .
each year , about 500,000 people go after the 60,000 tickets available each season - and they can encounter waiting times of up to 10 years . music lovers make their way alongside celebrities each year to bayreuth - which would have remained nothing more than another bavarian province were it not for wolfgang wagner .

for 57 years , wolfgang wagner directed the festival , celebrating his grandfather 's operas .
hardly any other director has been the source of more controversy . there 's no question that wolfgang wagner was often controversial as a director and as a person .
people considered him too conservative or suggested that he was overshadowed by his brother wieland .
critics were often underwhelmed by his work as a director even though both of his productions of the classic " ring of the nibelungen " opera cycle were at least technically on point . but wagner quickly adjusted to the critical reaction and invited renowned directors from elsewhere to take over the opera 's production .
all of the great wagner directors from hans knappertbusch to christian thielemann came to bayreuth .
perhaps his most memorable staging came in 1976 with the " ring " production led by patrice chereau .
chereau , a french film and theater director , ushered in a new era in the modern reception of wagner together with the composer and director pierre boulez . the new wagner in recent years , unconventional productions by heiner mueller and christoph schlingensief sparked heated debate .
the " workshop " concept , in which young , unknown artists were given the chance to prove themselves on stage , proved disastrous .
this experiment particularly annoyed the longstanding stars of the bayreuth stage . wagner 's tenure had another handicap though : his mother was a friend of adolf hitler 's .
a 1970s documentary featured his mother praising hitler as " our blessed adolf , " which proved problematic for the festival itself .
even today , the wagner family is still trying to account for this part of its history . unparalleled contributions but wolfgang wagner 's greatest contribution to the " ring " festival was in his practical handling of the details .
he contributed like no one else to the appreciation of his grandfather 's work during the 20th century , and he helped oversee more than 1,700 productions in his career .
he succeeded in founding the richard wagner foundation in bayreuth in which public institutions contribute alongside the wagner family to offer a financial safety net for the future of the wagner festival .
under his direction , the festival has become one of the most publicized musical events in the world . the festival 's renown is part of the reason that the music world has followed the wagner clan 's conflicts so attentively .
at times , there were calls that wagner should step down and make room for someone new .
he refused , insisting on his lifetime contract and the opportunity it granted him to ensure that the wagner heritage would be preserved .
he was called stubborn and cranky , but he perfected the art of knowing when to sit a battle out . brand name bayreuth perhaps his daughters eva and katharina were named as his followers so that the then 89-year-old could no longer stand in the way of modernization and further progress in bayreuth .
but nevertheless , when wolfgang wagner stepped down from his post at the end of 2008 , he withdrew as a victor .
in the more than five decades in which he led the opera festival , he developed it into a brand and an event that is one of the most sought-after in the cultural arena .
each year , about 500,000 people go after the 60,000 tickets available each season - and they can encounter waiting times of up to 10 years . music lovers make their way alongside celebrities each year to bayreuth - which would have remained nothing more than another bavarian province were it not for wolfgang wagner .
the bayreuth festival now mourns its director , who was at once the head of a family , a skilled organizer and a businessman .
his contributions at the green hill of bayreuth will endure . gudrun stegen is the music editor for deutsche welle 's german service . -lrb- gsw -rrb- editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but nyan win added that she had also said she wanted the party to decide on her own .
the junta recently announced new elections laws , which have been very controversial .
one of them bars people who are currently serving prison terms from being members of political parties .
it therefore stops suu kyi , who is currently under house arrest , from being a member of her own party , let alone allowing her to vote and herself run for election .
the nobel laureate has already spent 14 of the past 20 years in detention .
lawsuit against election laws the nld party recently challenged the new election laws in the supreme court , claiming they were unlawful but the suit was rejected on tuesday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : senior nld leaders such as win tin have to decide whether their party will register the court said it did not have the powers to handle such a case , according to suu kyi 's lawyer nyan win .
political parties in myanmar -lrb- also known as burma -rrb- have fewer than 60 days to register for the polls .
the nld has so far not decided whether it will participate .
the party members plan to meet on friday to discuss the issue .
the junta has not yet announced a date for the elections but it is widely expected that they will take place in october this year .
the last general elections in the military-run country took place in 1990 .
the opposition nld won them by a landslide but the junta never recognized the results .
international criticism the new election laws have also drawn criticism from outside myanmar .
britain , among others , has asked the united nations to call an emergency meeting to discuss the terms of the polls set by the junta in myanmar .
un secretary-general ban ki-moon 's so-called " group of friends " on myanmar is expected to meet on march 25 to discuss the situation in the military-ruled country .
the group includes the united states , britain , france , china , japan , australia , norway , russia , singapore and thailand. du / ap / afp / dpa / ips editor : anne thomas send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

since then the country has made good progress , but what will the next two decades bring ?
experts say the outlook is positive . it was perhaps somewhat symbolic that namibia 's celebrations on sunday , march 21 , coincided with the swearing-in of its reelected president hifikepunye pohamba .
for 20 years , the southern african nation has been one of the most stable democracies on the continent .
unlike other african countries , perhaps most notably nearby zimbabwe , politics is not a main problem for namibia .
the challenges , say experts , lie elsewhere .
" the problems are the same ones as 20 years ago - providing work , food and places to live for the country 's two to three million inhabitants , " says publisher michael iwanowski , who wrote the first-ever german travel guide to namibia and led a number of official german delegations through the country .
" there 's no industry , and most people live from mining , tourism and subsistence farming .
but the elections were free and fair , and the government works well with the people . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : namibia is a country of stark , and often uninhabited , beauty namibia is the second-least densely populated country in the world , and has a nominal per capita gdp of only 3,178 euros -lrb- $ 4,278 -rrb- annually .
" the reason so few people live there is that there 's so little water , " says andre suren , a journalist for dw-tv , who was born in namibia and recently returned from filming a report there .
" provision of water is one problem , as are unemployment and poverty , which the government has made its top priority .
there also needs to be further reconciliation between tribes and between blacks and whites .

these are the sorts of issues that many african countries face .
but namibia is anything but a typical african nation in either its population or its history .
german south-west africa bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this plaque commemorates namibian victims of german colonial rule in the waning decades of the 19th century , namibia was one of the few places that germany , a belated colonial starter , was able to gain a foothold .
the territory officially became a colony in 1884 and was known as german south-west africa .
but germany 's rule there was hardly happy .
from 1904 to 1907 , the herero and nama tribes rebelled against their colonial master , and in the resultant fighting some 65,000 hereros , about 80 percent of the population , were killed .
in the course of world war i , south africa , which was controlled by britain , occupied namibia thanks to a league of nations mandate .
in 1946 , south africa refused to surrender that mandate even though it had been superseded by a united nations trusteeship agreement .
in 1966 , the south-west africa people 's organization , swapo , led a fight for independence , with heavy participation from the owambo tribe , which today makes up the majority of namibia 's population .
but it took until 1988 for south africa to agree to give up control over the country .
namibia officially gained sovereignty in 1990 , making it africa 's youngest country .
uranium and tourists bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : conditions in namibian townships are simple , but not inhuman namibia may be young and sparsely populated , but experts say those attributes help make its future prospects bright .
" namibia could profit from natural resources like copper and uranium , as those commodities get scarcer , " iwanowski told deutsche welle .
" but the big industry is tourism .
at least one third of the country is a nature reservation with deserts , savannahs and national parks , and most parts of the country are virtually uninhabited .
tourism has grown by 15 to 18 percent annually , and though those numbers are down a bit due to the global financial crisis , it 's still booming . "
probably among namibia 's most famous attractions are the namib and kalahari deserts , and the country needs to be careful about preserving its natural beauty .
" tourism accounts for some 70 percent of namibia 's economy , " says suren .
" that 's because the country is quite safe and easy to get to and get around in .
but namibians need to watch out for crime and environmental destruction . "
uranium mines have often been blamed for contaminating surrounding areas and putting aboriginal peoples at risk .
namibia 's natural resources have attracted the attention of a number of the world 's larger countries , who may put profits ahead of building up namibia 's own economy or preserving its environment .
china , which is very active throughout africa , has come under particular criticism for exploiting namibia 's natural wealth while polluting the land and failing to give back anything to the namibian people .
coming to terms bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : evidence of germany 's presence in namibia crops up everywhere and what about germany , the country which , in light of the colonial past , has one of the closest connections to namibia ?
the experts say that namibia is a main focus of german foreign developmental aid , but that berlin could perhaps do more in other areas .
" there needs to be a coming to terms with colonial history , " suren says .
" that would help reconciliation between tribes like the owambos and the hereros and also between blacks and whites .
germany should also support namibian political parties , increase the exchange possibilities for politicians and do more to help the namibian media . "
and there 's more connecting germany and namibia than just history .
" germans make up two-thirds of all tourists to namibia , and german developmental aid is very significant , " iwanowki says .
" berlin is partner city to the namibian capital , windhoek , and there are many parallels .
just as namibia gained independence 20 years ago , it was 20 years ago since the berlin wall fell . "
nothing is certain in the world 's poorest continent .
but if these experts are correct , africa 's youngest nation has a comparatively bright future .

for 20 years , the southern african nation has been one of the most stable democracies on the continent .
unlike other african countries , perhaps most notably nearby zimbabwe , politics is not a main problem for namibia .
the challenges , say experts , lie elsewhere .
" the problems are the same ones as 20 years ago - providing work , food and places to live for the country 's two to three million inhabitants , " says publisher michael iwanowski , who wrote the first-ever german travel guide to namibia and led a number of official german delegations through the country .

" there needs to be a coming to terms with colonial history , " suren says .
" that would help reconciliation between tribes like the owambos and the hereros and also between blacks and whites .
germany should also support namibian political parties , increase the exchange possibilities for politicians and do more to help the namibian media . "
and there 's more connecting germany and namibia than just history .
" germans make up two-thirds of all tourists to namibia , and german developmental aid is very significant , " iwanowki says .
" berlin is partner city to the namibian capital , windhoek , and there are many parallels .
just as namibia gained independence 20 years ago , it was 20 years ago since the berlin wall fell . "
nothing is certain in the world 's poorest continent .
but if these experts are correct , africa 's youngest nation has a comparatively bright future .

since then the country has made good progress , but what will the next two decades bring ?
experts say the outlook is positive . it was perhaps somewhat symbolic that namibia 's celebrations on sunday , march 21 , coincided with the swearing-in of its reelected president hifikepunye pohamba .
for 20 years , the southern african nation has been one of the most stable democracies on the continent .
unlike other african countries , perhaps most notably nearby zimbabwe , politics is not a main problem for namibia .
the challenges , say experts , lie elsewhere .
" the problems are the same ones as 20 years ago - providing work , food and places to live for the country 's two to three million inhabitants , " says publisher michael iwanowski , who wrote the first-ever german travel guide to namibia and led a number of official german delegations through the country .
" there 's no industry , and most people live from mining , tourism and subsistence farming .
but the elections were free and fair , and the government works well with the people . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : namibia is a country of stark , and often uninhabited , beauty namibia is the second-least densely populated country in the world , and has a nominal per capita gdp of only 3,178 euros -lrb- $ 4,278 -rrb- annually .
" the reason so few people live there is that there 's so little water , " says andre suren , a journalist for dw-tv , who was born in namibia and recently returned from filming a report there .
" provision of water is one problem , as are unemployment and poverty , which the government has made its top priority .
there also needs to be further reconciliation between tribes and between blacks and whites .
but the country has found its form of democracy . "
these are the sorts of issues that many african countries face .
but namibia is anything but a typical african nation in either its population or its history .
german south-west africa bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this plaque commemorates namibian victims of german colonial rule in the waning decades of the 19th century , namibia was one of the few places that germany , a belated colonial starter , was able to gain a foothold .
the territory officially became a colony in 1884 and was known as german south-west africa .
but germany 's rule there was hardly happy .
from 1904 to 1907 , the herero and nama tribes rebelled against their colonial master , and in the resultant fighting some 65,000 hereros , about 80 percent of the population , were killed .
in the course of world war i , south africa , which was controlled by britain , occupied namibia thanks to a league of nations mandate .
in 1946 , south africa refused to surrender that mandate even though it had been superseded by a united nations trusteeship agreement .
in 1966 , the south-west africa people 's organization , swapo , led a fight for independence , with heavy participation from the owambo tribe , which today makes up the majority of namibia 's population .
but it took until 1988 for south africa to agree to give up control over the country .
namibia officially gained sovereignty in 1990 , making it africa 's youngest country .
uranium and tourists bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : conditions in namibian townships are simple , but not inhuman namibia may be young and sparsely populated , but experts say those attributes help make its future prospects bright .
" namibia could profit from natural resources like copper and uranium , as those commodities get scarcer , " iwanowski told deutsche welle .
" but the big industry is tourism .
at least one third of the country is a nature reservation with deserts , savannahs and national parks , and most parts of the country are virtually uninhabited .
tourism has grown by 15 to 18 percent annually , and though those numbers are down a bit due to the global financial crisis , it 's still booming . "
probably among namibia 's most famous attractions are the namib and kalahari deserts , and the country needs to be careful about preserving its natural beauty .
" tourism accounts for some 70 percent of namibia 's economy , " says suren .
" that 's because the country is quite safe and easy to get to and get around in .
but namibians need to watch out for crime and environmental destruction . "
uranium mines have often been blamed for contaminating surrounding areas and putting aboriginal peoples at risk .
namibia 's natural resources have attracted the attention of a number of the world 's larger countries , who may put profits ahead of building up namibia 's own economy or preserving its environment .
china , which is very active throughout africa , has come under particular criticism for exploiting namibia 's natural wealth while polluting the land and failing to give back anything to the namibian people .

since then the country has made good progress , but what will the next two decades bring ?
experts say the outlook is positive . it was perhaps somewhat symbolic that namibia 's celebrations on sunday , march 21 , coincided with the swearing-in of its reelected president hifikepunye pohamba .
for 20 years , the southern african nation has been one of the most stable democracies on the continent .
unlike other african countries , perhaps most notably nearby zimbabwe , politics is not a main problem for namibia .
the challenges , say experts , lie elsewhere .
" the problems are the same ones as 20 years ago - providing work , food and places to live for the country 's two to three million inhabitants , " says publisher michael iwanowski , who wrote the first-ever german travel guide to namibia and led a number of official german delegations through the country .
" there 's no industry , and most people live from mining , tourism and subsistence farming .
but the elections were free and fair , and the government works well with the people . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : namibia is a country of stark , and often uninhabited , beauty namibia is the second-least densely populated country in the world , and has a nominal per capita gdp of only 3,178 euros -lrb- $ 4,278 -rrb- annually .
" the reason so few people live there is that there 's so little water , " says andre suren , a journalist for dw-tv , who was born in namibia and recently returned from filming a report there .
" provision of water is one problem , as are unemployment and poverty , which the government has made its top priority .
there also needs to be further reconciliation between tribes and between blacks and whites .
but the country has found its form of democracy . "
these are the sorts of issues that many african countries face .
but namibia is anything but a typical african nation in either its population or its history .
german south-west africa bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this plaque commemorates namibian victims of german colonial rule in the waning decades of the 19th century , namibia was one of the few places that germany , a belated colonial starter , was able to gain a foothold .
the territory officially became a colony in 1884 and was known as german south-west africa .
but germany 's rule there was hardly happy .
from 1904 to 1907 , the herero and nama tribes rebelled against their colonial master , and in the resultant fighting some 65,000 hereros , about 80 percent of the population , were killed .
in the course of world war i , south africa , which was controlled by britain , occupied namibia thanks to a league of nations mandate .
in 1946 , south africa refused to surrender that mandate even though it had been superseded by a united nations trusteeship agreement .
in 1966 , the south-west africa people 's organization , swapo , led a fight for independence , with heavy participation from the owambo tribe , which today makes up the majority of namibia 's population .
but it took until 1988 for south africa to agree to give up control over the country .
namibia officially gained sovereignty in 1990 , making it africa 's youngest country .
uranium and tourists bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : conditions in namibian townships are simple , but not inhuman namibia may be young and sparsely populated , but experts say those attributes help make its future prospects bright .
" namibia could profit from natural resources like copper and uranium , as those commodities get scarcer , " iwanowski told deutsche welle .
" but the big industry is tourism .
at least one third of the country is a nature reservation with deserts , savannahs and national parks , and most parts of the country are virtually uninhabited .
tourism has grown by 15 to 18 percent annually , and though those numbers are down a bit due to the global financial crisis , it 's still booming . "
probably among namibia 's most famous attractions are the namib and kalahari deserts , and the country needs to be careful about preserving its natural beauty .
" tourism accounts for some 70 percent of namibia 's economy , " says suren .
" that 's because the country is quite safe and easy to get to and get around in .
but namibians need to watch out for crime and environmental destruction . "
uranium mines have often been blamed for contaminating surrounding areas and putting aboriginal peoples at risk .
namibia 's natural resources have attracted the attention of a number of the world 's larger countries , who may put profits ahead of building up namibia 's own economy or preserving its environment .
china , which is very active throughout africa , has come under particular criticism for exploiting namibia 's natural wealth while polluting the land and failing to give back anything to the namibian people .
coming to terms bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : evidence of germany 's presence in namibia crops up everywhere and what about germany , the country which , in light of the colonial past , has one of the closest connections to namibia ?
the experts say that namibia is a main focus of german foreign developmental aid , but that berlin could perhaps do more in other areas .
" there needs to be a coming to terms with colonial history , " suren says .
" that would help reconciliation between tribes like the owambos and the hereros and also between blacks and whites .
germany should also support namibian political parties , increase the exchange possibilities for politicians and do more to help the namibian media . "
and there 's more connecting germany and namibia than just history .
" germans make up two-thirds of all tourists to namibia , and german developmental aid is very significant , " iwanowki says .
" berlin is partner city to the namibian capital , windhoek , and there are many parallels .
just as namibia gained independence 20 years ago , it was 20 years ago since the berlin wall fell . "
nothing is certain in the world 's poorest continent .
but if these experts are correct , africa 's youngest nation has a comparatively bright future .

businesses operating in markets such as energy generation , environmental technology , security services as well as the space and aviation industry were the focus of the government program , bruederle said at a news conference in berlin .
