mackay , writing in an article coauthored by royal navy commander steve tatham and published by the british ministry of defense ’ s -lrb- mod -rrb- defense academy , called for fresh thinking on the battlefield and highlighted a need for more focus on " behaviorist " strategy when dealing with the complex structure of afghan society . he added that the military " consistently failed " to understand the motivations of local afghans which was undermining western efforts while strengthening the resistance , saying that western efforts had to focus on understanding the culture , economy and psychology of the taliban if allied forces were to be truly successful in battle . " many of the choices that are currently presented are too stark : poppy bad / wheat good ; taliban evil / isaf good and so on , " mackay wrote .
" the reality is that we have consistently failed to understand that what seems to us as irrational behavior is entirely rational to the individual facing tough choices . " " we have sought to advance the idea that alongside kinetic power there is potentially a more behaviorist approach which , we believe , can affect the enemy 's will and be as , or arguably more , effective than kinetic power in future conflict , " mackay added . ignoring the mistakes of the past bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mackay believes more local understanding is required samina ahmed , the project director for the south asia department of the international crisis group in islamabad , says that while western knowledge of afghanistan was shaped largely by the anti-soviet jihad and hence unrelated to current day afghan dynamics , other factors have proved more costly . " it is less the lack of knowledge about afghanistan that has contributed to instability and an ineffectual military campaign as a propensity to repeatedly seek short cuts that have backfired , instead of a focus on institution building that would pay long term dividends and the failure , when the ground was ripe , to provide adequate military and economic resources , " she told deutsche welle . ahmed also pointed out that when the taliban were ousted , the afghan people fully supported the intervention in the hope that the western presence would restore and underwrite peace and help to rebuild their war-torn land .
instead , she claimed , the west and its allies failed to understand the need then to buttress institutions , instead of relying on individuals , including warlords , and providing the economic goods . " if the taliban are to be deprived of support , then the west must shun short-cuts that will only undercut political stability , for instance by supporting selected warlords and their militias , instead of building a professional military as well as a police force that is capable of protecting the citizen , " she said .
" in short , a state that is capable of protecting the lives of its citizens and providing basic services is the only way in which violent extremism can be defeated in afghanistan . " west accused of stagnation in face of evolving conflict bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : roadside bombs have proved to be an effective weapon mackay also accused senior military officers of being " institutionally incapable of keeping pace with rapid change and the associated willingness to adapt - and quickly - at the same time . " western efforts in dealing with the counter-insurgency , he said , had a sense of " making it up as we go along " and that there was a serious lack of clear direction from senior officers .
he also suggested that military planners had been educated by a system designed for a previous age and could not adapt to current and future challenges . giles merritt , the director of the security & defence agenda think-tank in brussels , agrees that western forces are suffering from a lack of clear direction . " we are losing but we 're not losing for military reasons not for strategic reasons , " merritt told deutsche welle .
" we do n't have a clear plan , we do n't know how to assess if we 're winning or losing except in terms of body count , and we do n't have a big picture .
you hold a bit of ground here , we reduce the level of instability there but we 're not really working towards a clearly defined goal . " merritt does not believe , however , that military planners are incapable of adapting to the conflict in afghanistan - mainly becaue the tactics and the approach of the taliban has changed little since coalition forces invaded in 2001 . " the taliban have n't actually changed since the 1930 's , " merritt said .
" they 're incredibly patient .
they wait to see what the weaknesses are , what the chinks in the armor are and then they exploit them .
i do n't think there has been an enormous change in the taliban 's tactics at all and the west have certainly not been surprised by them .
so they fight a war of attrition with roadside bombs and ambushes .
this was to be expected . " time to talk to the taliban ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us would be suspicious of any taliban settlement offer the growing concern over the western approach in afghanistan and the alleged failure by allied forces to get a grip on the methods employed by the taliban in its counter-insurgency has given rise to cautious suggestions that direct negotiations may be the only way to end the war . government sources in the us refused to confirm or deny whether washington would deal with the taliban but defense secretary robert gates was quoted as saying that he believed the taliban would only contemplate an agreement if they had first been forced into believing they would lose the war . " the taliban leadership is currently disinclined to negotiate because it believes the west has n't the will to stay on in afghanistan , " samina ahmed said . " until the taliban are willing to negotiate , there is no question of defining terms or demands .
however , should such an opportunity arise , then the minimum demands should include acceptance of the afghan constitution and a willingness to give up arms .

mackay , writing in an article coauthored by royal navy commander steve tatham and published by the british ministry of defense ’ s -lrb- mod -rrb- defense academy , called for fresh thinking on the battlefield and highlighted a need for more focus on " behaviorist " strategy when dealing with the complex structure of afghan society . he added that the military " consistently failed " to understand the motivations of local afghans which was undermining western efforts while strengthening the resistance , saying that western efforts had to focus on understanding the culture , economy and psychology of the taliban if allied forces were to be truly successful in battle . " many of the choices that are currently presented are too stark : poppy bad / wheat good ; taliban evil / isaf good and so on , " mackay wrote .
" the reality is that we have consistently failed to understand that what seems to us as irrational behavior is entirely rational to the individual facing tough choices . " " we have sought to advance the idea that alongside kinetic power there is potentially a more behaviorist approach which , we believe , can affect the enemy 's will and be as , or arguably more , effective than kinetic power in future conflict , " mackay added . ignoring the mistakes of the past bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mackay believes more local understanding is required samina ahmed , the project director for the south asia department of the international crisis group in islamabad , says that while western knowledge of afghanistan was shaped largely by the anti-soviet jihad and hence unrelated to current day afghan dynamics , other factors have proved more costly . " it is less the lack of knowledge about afghanistan that has contributed to instability and an ineffectual military campaign as a propensity to repeatedly seek short cuts that have backfired , instead of a focus on institution building that would pay long term dividends and the failure , when the ground was ripe , to provide adequate military and economic resources , " she told deutsche welle . ahmed also pointed out that when the taliban were ousted , the afghan people fully supported the intervention in the hope that the western presence would restore and underwrite peace and help to rebuild their war-torn land .
instead , she claimed , the west and its allies failed to understand the need then to buttress institutions , instead of relying on individuals , including warlords , and providing the economic goods . " if the taliban are to be deprived of support , then the west must shun short-cuts that will only undercut political stability , for instance by supporting selected warlords and their militias , instead of building a professional military as well as a police force that is capable of protecting the citizen , " she said .

“ now that this is behind us i hope that we have put an end to the wave of terror in our country , ” he said .
he was speaking just a month after two suicide attacks on two hotels in the capital city jakarta had killed nine people and injured dozens .
it was immediately blamed on the jemaah islamiyah militant network .
at the time , indonesian political scientist sony tanuwidjaja hinted that it could happen again : “ the fact that this happens , on this scale , in a place where security is very tight shows that there is a hole in that security and i think that the security , the police force still have a lot to learn . ”

he explains that many of them went to military training camps in peshawar , pakistan , to fight as mujahedeen in afghanistan and their ideas became more radical .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de asia -pipe- 06.01.2010 polluted water threatens millions of chinese großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many of china 's rivers are polluted by industrial waste a huge oil spill has drawn the world 's attention to the problem of china 's water pollution yet again .
on dec .
30 , 2009 , up to 150,000 litres of diesel leaked out into the chishui and wei rivers .
the accident was caused by a rupture in a pipeline belonging to the country 's top oil producer , the china national petroleum corporation , which blamed a third party .
on monday , diesel from the spill reached the yellow river . china is currently battling with polluted water and negative attention as well .
the diesel spill reaching the yellow river is a large concern because it is one of china 's longest rivers and the source of drinking water for millions of people .
" oil is detrimental to drinking water - it is not safe for people to drink water contaminated by diesel , ” said ma jun , director of the institute of public and environmental affairs in beijing .
“ efforts are being made in an intensive way to contain the spreading of the diesel spill - at this moment , one of the major reservoirs has been shut down , has stopped generating electricity in order to contain the diesel spill .
local residents along the river have been warned not to use water directly from the river . "
unfit for drinking but ok for agriculture water quality has reached level five in the rivers contaminated by the spill .
this is the lowest level of quality in chinese standards .
according to the government , this means the water is unfit for drinking but can be used for agricultural purposes .
pay drechsel from the international water management institute in sri lanka said he was “ very concerned about the water situation in china . ”
“ this goes far beyond those accidents , ” he explained .
“ the amount of normal domestic and industrial waste water , which is discharged into china 's water bodies daily , is huge .
except for a few big cities , waste water is not properly treated before being discharged , which affects drinking water and agricultural production .
the area under irrigation with polluted water or waste water is estimated today as four million hectares in china .
that is by far the largest area irrigated with waste water in the world . "
water experts agree waste water and contaminated river water contain high amounts of heavy metals and chemicals .
this can cause serious health issues in animals and humans who either drink the water directly or eat crops that have been irrigated with polluted water .
waste water treatment plants not sophisticated enough according to the international water management institute , china has about 200 waste water treatment plants but even then , the majority are not sophisticated enough to deliver good treatment .
pay drechsel points out that most small towns in china , which have been developing rapidly in recent years , do not have any waste water treatment plants at all .
“ china is making efforts to improve its water quality , by i.e. building new sewage plants .
however , there are still too many factories , whose discharge can not meet china 's national standards , ” says ma jun .
the institute of public and environmental affairs in beijing compiles a list of china 's big polluters and makes it public , thus creating awareness .
but it will take more effort .
according to government data , more than 200 million people do not have access to safe drinking water .
if china 's cities continue to grow at the current rate , the infrastructure will have to be significantly adapted to sustain the development .

“ efforts are being made in an intensive way to contain the spreading of the diesel spill - at this moment , one of the major reservoirs has been shut down , has stopped generating electricity in order to contain the diesel spill .
local residents along the river have been warned not to use water directly from the river . "
unfit for drinking but ok for agriculture water quality has reached level five in the rivers contaminated by the spill .
this is the lowest level of quality in chinese standards .
according to the government , this means the water is unfit for drinking but can be used for agricultural purposes .
pay drechsel from the international water management institute in sri lanka said he was “ very concerned about the water situation in china . ”
“ this goes far beyond those accidents , ” he explained .
“ the amount of normal domestic and industrial waste water , which is discharged into china 's water bodies daily , is huge .
except for a few big cities , waste water is not properly treated before being discharged , which affects drinking water and agricultural production .
the area under irrigation with polluted water or waste water is estimated today as four million hectares in china .
that is by far the largest area irrigated with waste water in the world . "
water experts agree waste water and contaminated river water contain high amounts of heavy metals and chemicals .
this can cause serious health issues in animals and humans who either drink the water directly or eat crops that have been irrigated with polluted water .
waste water treatment plants not sophisticated enough according to the international water management institute , china has about 200 waste water treatment plants but even then , the majority are not sophisticated enough to deliver good treatment .
pay drechsel points out that most small towns in china , which have been developing rapidly in recent years , do not have any waste water treatment plants at all .
“ china is making efforts to improve its water quality , by i.e. building new sewage plants .
however , there are still too many factories , whose discharge can not meet china 's national standards , ” says ma jun .
the institute of public and environmental affairs in beijing compiles a list of china 's big polluters and makes it public , thus creating awareness .
but it will take more effort .
according to government data , more than 200 million people do not have access to safe drinking water .
if china 's cities continue to grow at the current rate , the infrastructure will have to be significantly adapted to sustain the development .

he is one of the originators of the new growth theory and has been awarded the horst claus recktenwald prize in economics .
he was named one of the 25 most influential americans by time magazine .
he currently devotes all his time to his new project , " charter cities . "
deutsche welle : you have developed a new concept which you believe can reduce global poverty and empower underprivileged people better than traditional development policies can .
in a nutshell , what is your idea of the charter city ?
paul romer : one thing that we know works extremely well for raising standards of living and wages for people is to let them move from countries that have bad rules to countries that have better rules .
now there are n't that many spaces in countries with good rules to take hundreds of millions of people , so the charter city idea is to create places that have good quality rules where hundreds of millions of people could go .
you argue that a good system of rules as is found in most western societies is the key to economic prosperity and that such a rules-based system is attractive for people everywhere and therefore can basically be transplanted anywhere .
how do you respond to critics who say you underestimate cultural and historical factors , and that therefore charter cities may not be viable on a large scale ?
we know that people want access to these kinds of rule systems .
seven hundred million people around the world have said in response to survey questions that they would like to move permanently to a different country .
so people want this .
if you start with uninhabited land and invite people in to live under a new system of rules those rules can very quickly take hold and thrive .
another criticism of your idea of the charter city is that it is essentially colonialism revisited .
no one is forced to move or live in your charter city , and everyone is free to leave again , but essentially western countries are once again financing , setting up and running places where poor people can only come to sell their labor .
how do you counter that criticism ?
if you think about the question , picture someone from a very poor country , a family , a couple of young children , a father and a mother , and picture them moving to munich or zurich or vancouver .
we do n't think of that as colonial ; we think of that as something that gives them opportunities that they really want .
and this proposal is no more than saying if we ca n't let hundreds of millions of people go to those cities , let 's create some new cities that are run like those cities where large numbers of people could go .
as examples of possible charter cities you mention a canadian charter project in cuba , an australian project with indonesia or a project in india .
but how could a charter city work in the countries that really need help the most , i.e. the poorest countries in the world like eritrea or somalia ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hong kong is a well known historic example of a charter city the example of cuba and canada is not so much a literal proposal as a way to picture how this could work .
there happens to be a piece of land in cuba where by treaty cuba gave someone else the right to administer that land .
guantanamo bay is actually administered by the united states .
so countries like somalia or eritrea and other countries like that could sign treaties where relatively small pieces of land were assigned to other countries or perhaps a consortium of countries to set up new systems of rules there and create new cities in much the same way that the british created hong kong in a place where before they came no one lived .
for your concept to work , you need countries or private corporations to make large-scale investments .
those investors , of course , want to see a return on their investment .
how do you intend to attract investors for such a venture with an all but certain outcome , and on the other hand , how do you make sure that the investors are not merely trying to make a quick profit ?
this is why the rules are so important .
rules matter for families , because they want their children to be safe , they want to have a chance to get a job , they want rules that set up a good educational system .
but the rules also matter for investors .
a firm might come in and build a power system for a new city like this or build the infrastructure .
firms are quite willing to take market risks . what firms do not want to undertake is political risk , the risk that some government will just expropriate their property or suddenly enact policies that destroy the value of their investments .
so what the partner governments can do is make a credible commitment to rules that will remain in place for decades so that not only workers and families are attracted , but also investors and employers .
you 've been promoting the concept of charter cities since last year and have received lots of praise but also criticism for your idea .
has any country so far signed up to your idea ?
are there any concrete plans to develop the first charter city ?
there are preliminary conversations with various governments .
i tried this idea on possible participants in an arrangement like this and the reaction has been very positive .
the most surprising thing i 've learned is that the developing countries are very open to this idea .
they have seen how special zones were very effective development strategies - in china in particular - and they have seen how fast growth can take place when you get policy right .
china is now the new standard that countries are aspiring to and they are willing to try new things to get the kind of growth that they see in china .
-lsb- but -rsb- i think this would be an opportunity for governments that have not been as active on the world stage , including the government of germany , to really establish a whole new way of interacting with the rest of the world as a partner that could be distinctive and very beneficial .
what role could germany play in your concept of a charter city as a country with a comparatively brief colonial history ? one of the things that is interesting is that germany has relatively good ties with some of its former colonies , like namibia for example .
so as opposed to other countries where there is lingering resentment and bad feeling , there 's good feeling about the benefits that some of these countries receive from the german people .
so i think this good will is an asset that you could put to work in the future .
how has the development community reacted to your proposal , since you believe that the charter city could benefit more people across the globe than classical development aid can ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mauritius is considered a role model for the concept of a successful charter city i think the right way to describe it is that the reactions have been somewhat polarized .
on the one hand , there are many people who perceive the magnitude of the problem and the very slow pace of resolving that problem and who say your idea is very unusual and different , but it might be worth a try , because what we are doing right now is n't getting us where we want to go .
there are other people who are much more concerned , who say this is a very different approach , and it 's too risky , and we should n't try this .
but i think this gets the balance of the risks wrong .
i think the biggest risk is that we persist with the conditions that we now have in many parts of the world , where there are hundreds of millions of people who are desperate to go someplace where they can put their energies to work and create a better future for their children .
so i think there is very little risk in trying something different and we should be braver and we should have more imagination in solving this really pressing human problem .

but loud words seemed to rule the day at separate strategy meetings of the fdp and csu . the snow-covered hilltops of the southern german region around wildbad kreuth convey the impression of a place full of bliss and harmony .
but these days , harmony is solely left to mother nature .
everyone who matters in bavaria 's christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- - the sister party of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- - has flocked to the palace-like building at kreuth .
firing broadsides at both friend and foe has become an entertaining tradition at the csu 's three-day strategy meeting .
tax policies under fire the saber-rattling started wednesday morning , when csu head horst seehofer said his party had no reason to feel humble just because it had lost its absolute majority support in bavaria for the first time in its history .
seehofer attacked the free democrats ' -lrb- fdp -rrb- resolve to allow for 24 billion euros -lrb- $ 34.5 billion -rrb- in tax reductions as of 2011 despite the country facing record public debts , to be further increased by astronomic fresh borrowing this year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : csu head horst seehofer sees no reason to feel humble " i 'm sure the fdp will still learn what it means to assume government responsibility , " seehofer quipped in a statement directed at the conservatives ' coalition partner in berlin .
at their own gathering in stuttgart on wednesday , the pro-business fdp did n't wait long before responding to the verbal attack .
fdp floor leader birgit homburger said it was strange that the csu was so forgetful .
she recalled that all sides had agreed on tax reductions during coalition talks last year .
" we looked very hard at where taxes could be lowered and what measures could be financed and justified .
so why 's so much fuss being made about it now ? " , homburger asked in stuttgart .
body scanners not to everyone 's liking but tax policies are not the only bone of contention that berlin 's coalition partners almost seem to choke on these days .
there 's a controversy about whether or not body scanners should be used at german airports to increase security , with the fdp being far more concerned about any potential dignity issues than chancellor merkel 's conservatives .
and at least two foreign policy issues have shown time and again that the coalition partners are far from speaking with one voice .
number one is afghanistan , and with it the debate over whether germany should send in thousands of more troops in line with us president barack obama 's request to nato allies .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erika steinbach remains a controversial figure and then there 's the unresolved question of how to deal with erika steinbach , who heads germany 's federation of expellees -lrb- bdv -rrb- , a group which represents germans expelled from eastern europe after 1945 .
steinbach angered poland by not accepting the bilateral border treaty after german unification in 1990 .
her initial resolve to become a board member of a museum for european expellees has also caused an outcry in warsaw .
the conservatives and the fdp seem divided over how to deal with steinbach 's recent proposal to renounce the post in return for boosting the federation of expellees ' say in the museum work. hg / dpa / reuters / ap editor : trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de fdp meets to discuss party 's direction as efforts to cut taxes stall part of the ruling government for the first time in years , the free-market liberal fdp looked set to put its tax-lowering promises into action .
but as the new coalition stumbles , the fdp must re-evaluate its agenda .
-lrb- 06.01.2010 -rrb- steinbach offers to give up candidacy in compromise deal a vocal advocate for germans expelled from eastern europe after 1945 , erika steinbach has offered to withdraw her candidacy for a key post in a controversial museum that has strained ties between germany and poland .
-lrb- 05.01.2010 -rrb- cracks widening in german coalition government only two months after being sworn in , chancellor angela merkel 's coalition government is finding it increasingly difficult to paint over differences on issues ranging from tax cuts to anti-terror measures .

he is one of the originators of the new growth theory and has been awarded the horst claus recktenwald prize in economics .
he was named one of the 25 most influential americans by time magazine .
he currently devotes all his time to his new project , " charter cities . "
deutsche welle : you have developed a new concept which you believe can reduce global poverty and empower underprivileged people better than traditional development policies can .
in a nutshell , what is your idea of the charter city ?
paul romer : one thing that we know works extremely well for raising standards of living and wages for people is to let them move from countries that have bad rules to countries that have better rules .
now there are n't that many spaces in countries with good rules to take hundreds of millions of people , so the charter city idea is to create places that have good quality rules where hundreds of millions of people could go .
you argue that a good system of rules as is found in most western societies is the key to economic prosperity and that such a rules-based system is attractive for people everywhere and therefore can basically be transplanted anywhere .
how do you respond to critics who say you underestimate cultural and historical factors , and that therefore charter cities may not be viable on a large scale ?
we know that people want access to these kinds of rule systems .
seven hundred million people around the world have said in response to survey questions that they would like to move permanently to a different country .
so people want this .
if you start with uninhabited land and invite people in to live under a new system of rules those rules can very quickly take hold and thrive .
another criticism of your idea of the charter city is that it is essentially colonialism revisited .
no one is forced to move or live in your charter city , and everyone is free to leave again , but essentially western countries are once again financing , setting up and running places where poor people can only come to sell their labor .
how do you counter that criticism ?
if you think about the question , picture someone from a very poor country , a family , a couple of young children , a father and a mother , and picture them moving to munich or zurich or vancouver .
we do n't think of that as colonial ; we think of that as something that gives them opportunities that they really want .
and this proposal is no more than saying if we ca n't let hundreds of millions of people go to those cities , let 's create some new cities that are run like those cities where large numbers of people could go .
as examples of possible charter cities you mention a canadian charter project in cuba , an australian project with indonesia or a project in india .
but how could a charter city work in the countries that really need help the most , i.e. the poorest countries in the world like eritrea or somalia ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hong kong is a well known historic example of a charter city the example of cuba and canada is not so much a literal proposal as a way to picture how this could work .
there happens to be a piece of land in cuba where by treaty cuba gave someone else the right to administer that land .
guantanamo bay is actually administered by the united states .
so countries like somalia or eritrea and other countries like that could sign treaties where relatively small pieces of land were assigned to other countries or perhaps a consortium of countries to set up new systems of rules there and create new cities in much the same way that the british created hong kong in a place where before they came no one lived .
for your concept to work , you need countries or private corporations to make large-scale investments .
those investors , of course , want to see a return on their investment .
how do you intend to attract investors for such a venture with an all but certain outcome , and on the other hand , how do you make sure that the investors are not merely trying to make a quick profit ?
this is why the rules are so important .
rules matter for families , because they want their children to be safe , they want to have a chance to get a job , they want rules that set up a good educational system .
but the rules also matter for investors .
a firm might come in and build a power system for a new city like this or build the infrastructure .
firms are quite willing to take market risks . what firms do not want to undertake is political risk , the risk that some government will just expropriate their property or suddenly enact policies that destroy the value of their investments .
so what the partner governments can do is make a credible commitment to rules that will remain in place for decades so that not only workers and families are attracted , but also investors and employers .
you 've been promoting the concept of charter cities since last year and have received lots of praise but also criticism for your idea .
has any country so far signed up to your idea ?
are there any concrete plans to develop the first charter city ?
there are preliminary conversations with various governments .
i tried this idea on possible participants in an arrangement like this and the reaction has been very positive .
the most surprising thing i 've learned is that the developing countries are very open to this idea .
they have seen how special zones were very effective development strategies - in china in particular - and they have seen how fast growth can take place when you get policy right .
china is now the new standard that countries are aspiring to and they are willing to try new things to get the kind of growth that they see in china .
-lsb- but -rsb- i think this would be an opportunity for governments that have not been as active on the world stage , including the government of germany , to really establish a whole new way of interacting with the rest of the world as a partner that could be distinctive and very beneficial .
what role could germany play in your concept of a charter city as a country with a comparatively brief colonial history ? one of the things that is interesting is that germany has relatively good ties with some of its former colonies , like namibia for example .
so as opposed to other countries where there is lingering resentment and bad feeling , there 's good feeling about the benefits that some of these countries receive from the german people .
so i think this good will is an asset that you could put to work in the future .
how has the development community reacted to your proposal , since you believe that the charter city could benefit more people across the globe than classical development aid can ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mauritius is considered a role model for the concept of a successful charter city i think the right way to describe it is that the reactions have been somewhat polarized .
on the one hand , there are many people who perceive the magnitude of the problem and the very slow pace of resolving that problem and who say your idea is very unusual and different , but it might be worth a try , because what we are doing right now is n't getting us where we want to go .
there are other people who are much more concerned , who say this is a very different approach , and it 's too risky , and we should n't try this .
but i think this gets the balance of the risks wrong .
i think the biggest risk is that we persist with the conditions that we now have in many parts of the world , where there are hundreds of millions of people who are desperate to go someplace where they can put their energies to work and create a better future for their children .
so i think there is very little risk in trying something different and we should be braver and we should have more imagination in solving this really pressing human problem .

the attacker , reportedly driving a car packed with explosives , blew himself up outside traffic police headquarters in makhachkala , the capital of the russian republic .
makhachkala 's police chief said the bomber detonated the explosives at the gates to the station after a squad car had prevented him from driving through .
" the officers gave their lives to prevent a terrorist attack with an even greater number of victims , " a police official told the russian interfax news agency .
russia 's predominantly muslim republics in the north caucasus have seen a sharp rise in violence in the past year , with many of the attacks targeting pro-kremlin police and russian security forces .

but as the new coalition stumbles , the fdp must re-evaluate its agenda . germany 's free-market liberal democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- met on wednesday in stuttgart for their party meeting , held annually on january 6 .
the self-reflection session comes just a few months after the fdp joined the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- in a coalition government .
coalition negotiations between the two parties appeared to go smoothly and many of the fdp 's campaign promises made it into the coalition agreement .
the centerpiece of the policy blueprint was a plan to cut income taxes by 24 billion euros -lrb- $ 36 billion -rrb- and the parties agreed to pursue a simplification of the german tax system .
a difficult economy takes its toll but the reality of germany 's ongoing economic troubles have put a damper on the early excitement of the election .
politicians are beginning to voice their doubts , including bartholomaeus kalb , member of the cdu 's bavarian sister party the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- .
" we just wo n't have any money for tax relief or any additional expenditures for the foreseeable future , and by that i mean through the end of the legislative period , " wednesday 's edition of the financial times deutschland quoted kalb as saying .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's debt is set to continue to rise in 2010 the csu also held their annual party meeting on wednesday .
germany faces a ballooning budget deficit , with the 2010 budget approved by chancellor angela merkel 's cabinet calling for a record 85.8 billion euros in borrowed cash .
the european union has pressed germany to get its deficit under control .
as the party meets to discuss plans for 2010 , there 's been some backpedaling from fdp leaders , including economics minister rainer bruederle .
" it would be absolutely wrong to start off by cutting the budget , " he said on german radio .
fdp deputy party leader andreas pinkwart told the handelsblatt business daily this means that reaching the goals laid out in the coalition agreement might not happen for a few years .
" it 's enough if the complete 24 billion euros of relief is achieved in 2013 , " pinkwart said .
thus far only one tax cut of 8.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 123.1 billion -rrb- has been approved .
but he added that the restructuring of the tax system must begin this year .
the fdp had hoped to institute a three-tiered system with tax rates of 10 percent , 25 percent and 35 percent .
a new fdp ?
with the fdp no longer pushing for immediate tax relief , the meeting in stuttgart could give the free-market liberals the opportunity to redefine themselves .
the fdp 's current party platform dates back to 1997 and on the agenda wednesday is a discussion of a new platform .
when the daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung asked fdp secretary general christian lindner whether the fdp image as it now stands did n't fit the current times , lindner said the party 's mission is structurally sound .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even economics minister bruederle is n't calling for the cuts to take place right away " there 's no major need for revision of fdp positions , " he said .
" instead , it 's about evolution .
the new party platform is supposed to be worked on until 2012 .
we should take our time . "
but there are elements of the party that are already making changes .
the state of baden wuerttemberg 's fdp has already passed its own platform .
" when the disciplinary force of competition does not take hold … or is impeded by unfair conduct , the state has the mandate to regulate and intervene if necessary in the economy , " the new platform reads .

he is one of the originators of the new growth theory and has been awarded the horst claus recktenwald prize in economics .
he was named one of the 25 most influential americans by time magazine .
he currently devotes all his time to his new project , " charter cities . "
deutsche welle : you have developed a new concept which you believe can reduce global poverty and empower underprivileged people better than traditional development policies can .
in a nutshell , what is your idea of the charter city ?
paul romer : one thing that we know works extremely well for raising standards of living and wages for people is to let them move from countries that have bad rules to countries that have better rules .
now there are n't that many spaces in countries with good rules to take hundreds of millions of people , so the charter city idea is to create places that have good quality rules where hundreds of millions of people could go .
you argue that a good system of rules as is found in most western societies is the key to economic prosperity and that such a rules-based system is attractive for people everywhere and therefore can basically be transplanted anywhere .
how do you respond to critics who say you underestimate cultural and historical factors , and that therefore charter cities may not be viable on a large scale ?
we know that people want access to these kinds of rule systems .
seven hundred million people around the world have said in response to survey questions that they would like to move permanently to a different country .
so people want this .
if you start with uninhabited land and invite people in to live under a new system of rules those rules can very quickly take hold and thrive .
another criticism of your idea of the charter city is that it is essentially colonialism revisited .
no one is forced to move or live in your charter city , and everyone is free to leave again , but essentially western countries are once again financing , setting up and running places where poor people can only come to sell their labor .
how do you counter that criticism ?
if you think about the question , picture someone from a very poor country , a family , a couple of young children , a father and a mother , and picture them moving to munich or zurich or vancouver .
we do n't think of that as colonial ; we think of that as something that gives them opportunities that they really want .
and this proposal is no more than saying if we ca n't let hundreds of millions of people go to those cities , let 's create some new cities that are run like those cities where large numbers of people could go .
as examples of possible charter cities you mention a canadian charter project in cuba , an australian project with indonesia or a project in india .
but how could a charter city work in the countries that really need help the most , i.e. the poorest countries in the world like eritrea or somalia ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hong kong is a well known historic example of a charter city the example of cuba and canada is not so much a literal proposal as a way to picture how this could work .
there happens to be a piece of land in cuba where by treaty cuba gave someone else the right to administer that land .
guantanamo bay is actually administered by the united states .
so countries like somalia or eritrea and other countries like that could sign treaties where relatively small pieces of land were assigned to other countries or perhaps a consortium of countries to set up new systems of rules there and create new cities in much the same way that the british created hong kong in a place where before they came no one lived .
for your concept to work , you need countries or private corporations to make large-scale investments .
those investors , of course , want to see a return on their investment .
how do you intend to attract investors for such a venture with an all but certain outcome , and on the other hand , how do you make sure that the investors are not merely trying to make a quick profit ?
this is why the rules are so important .
rules matter for families , because they want their children to be safe , they want to have a chance to get a job , they want rules that set up a good educational system .
but the rules also matter for investors .
a firm might come in and build a power system for a new city like this or build the infrastructure .
firms are quite willing to take market risks . what firms do not want to undertake is political risk , the risk that some government will just expropriate their property or suddenly enact policies that destroy the value of their investments .
so what the partner governments can do is make a credible commitment to rules that will remain in place for decades so that not only workers and families are attracted , but also investors and employers .
you 've been promoting the concept of charter cities since last year and have received lots of praise but also criticism for your idea .
has any country so far signed up to your idea ?
are there any concrete plans to develop the first charter city ?
there are preliminary conversations with various governments .
i tried this idea on possible participants in an arrangement like this and the reaction has been very positive .
the most surprising thing i 've learned is that the developing countries are very open to this idea .
they have seen how special zones were very effective development strategies - in china in particular - and they have seen how fast growth can take place when you get policy right .
china is now the new standard that countries are aspiring to and they are willing to try new things to get the kind of growth that they see in china .
-lsb- but -rsb- i think this would be an opportunity for governments that have not been as active on the world stage , including the government of germany , to really establish a whole new way of interacting with the rest of the world as a partner that could be distinctive and very beneficial .
what role could germany play in your concept of a charter city as a country with a comparatively brief colonial history ? one of the things that is interesting is that germany has relatively good ties with some of its former colonies , like namibia for example .
so as opposed to other countries where there is lingering resentment and bad feeling , there 's good feeling about the benefits that some of these countries receive from the german people .
so i think this good will is an asset that you could put to work in the future .
how has the development community reacted to your proposal , since you believe that the charter city could benefit more people across the globe than classical development aid can ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mauritius is considered a role model for the concept of a successful charter city i think the right way to describe it is that the reactions have been somewhat polarized .
on the one hand , there are many people who perceive the magnitude of the problem and the very slow pace of resolving that problem and who say your idea is very unusual and different , but it might be worth a try , because what we are doing right now is n't getting us where we want to go .
there are other people who are much more concerned , who say this is a very different approach , and it 's too risky , and we should n't try this .
but i think this gets the balance of the risks wrong .
i think the biggest risk is that we persist with the conditions that we now have in many parts of the world , where there are hundreds of millions of people who are desperate to go someplace where they can put their energies to work and create a better future for their children .
so i think there is very little risk in trying something different and we should be braver and we should have more imagination in solving this really pressing human problem .

" i want to hear from the bishop herself how she came to her opinion , " guttenberg told the leipziger volkszeitung newspaper , after kaessmann called for a concrete plan for a withdrawal of troops .
the two are due to meet on january 11 .
in an interview she gave at christmas , kaessmann said , " this war is not justifiable , even by the broadest possible standards of the german protestant church . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guttenberg is keen to hear kaessmann 's views firsthand in a statement released by her office on tuesday , kaessmann welcomed the chance to speak to guttenberg and said she intended to discuss " the ethical position of the protestant church and the government 's afghanistan policy " with the minister .
comments clarified kaessmann also clarified her comments , saying she had never called for an immediate troop withdrawal , but rather for a " clear plan " for withdrawal .
ruprecht polenz , of the ruling christian democratic union , welcomed kaessmann 's revised statement .
" i 'm glad that she is now taking up a position that is much closer to what is , shall we say , the opinion of the majority of the parliament , " polenz told public broadcaster wdr .
" i am very grateful that both churches are helping to support our troops with spiritual guidance , " guttenberg said .
" i am certain that mrs. kaessmann does not want to see that debased . "
protestant bishops also gave kaessmann their support on tuesday .
" a lot of people do n't understand why the mission is necessary and what its purpose is .
and it 's not clear how it can be ended , " said bishop maria jepsen of hamburg .
berlin bishop markus droege said that a continuation of the afghanistan mission was only morally acceptable if the government gave " a long-overdue definition of its aim and an exit strategy . "
catholic military bishop walter mixa also called for " an open and honest debate about the situation our soldiers are in and their mission . "
mixa said that the question of whether the mission was justified " is always relevant . " bk / epd / dpa editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but as the new coalition stumbles , the fdp must re-evaluate its agenda . germany 's free-market liberal democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- met on wednesday in stuttgart for their party meeting , held annually on january 6 .
the self-reflection session comes just a few months after the fdp joined the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- in a coalition government .
coalition negotiations between the two parties appeared to go smoothly and many of the fdp 's campaign promises made it into the coalition agreement .
the centerpiece of the policy blueprint was a plan to cut income taxes by 24 billion euros -lrb- $ 36 billion -rrb- and the parties agreed to pursue a simplification of the german tax system .
a difficult economy takes its toll but the reality of germany 's ongoing economic troubles have put a damper on the early excitement of the election .
politicians are beginning to voice their doubts , including bartholomaeus kalb , member of the cdu 's bavarian sister party the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- .
" we just wo n't have any money for tax relief or any additional expenditures for the foreseeable future , and by that i mean through the end of the legislative period , " wednesday 's edition of the financial times deutschland quoted kalb as saying .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's debt is set to continue to rise in 2010 the csu also held their annual party meeting on wednesday .
germany faces a ballooning budget deficit , with the 2010 budget approved by chancellor angela merkel 's cabinet calling for a record 85.8 billion euros in borrowed cash .
the european union has pressed germany to get its deficit under control .
as the party meets to discuss plans for 2010 , there 's been some backpedaling from fdp leaders , including economics minister rainer bruederle .
" it would be absolutely wrong to start off by cutting the budget , " he said on german radio .
fdp deputy party leader andreas pinkwart told the handelsblatt business daily this means that reaching the goals laid out in the coalition agreement might not happen for a few years .
" it 's enough if the complete 24 billion euros of relief is achieved in 2013 , " pinkwart said .
thus far only one tax cut of 8.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 123.1 billion -rrb- has been approved .
but he added that the restructuring of the tax system must begin this year .
the fdp had hoped to institute a three-tiered system with tax rates of 10 percent , 25 percent and 35 percent .
a new fdp ?
with the fdp no longer pushing for immediate tax relief , the meeting in stuttgart could give the free-market liberals the opportunity to redefine themselves .
the fdp 's current party platform dates back to 1997 and on the agenda wednesday is a discussion of a new platform .
when the daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung asked fdp secretary general christian lindner whether the fdp image as it now stands did n't fit the current times , lindner said the party 's mission is structurally sound .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even economics minister bruederle is n't calling for the cuts to take place right away " there 's no major need for revision of fdp positions , " he said .
" instead , it 's about evolution .
the new party platform is supposed to be worked on until 2012 .
we should take our time . "
but there are elements of the party that are already making changes .
the state of baden wuerttemberg 's fdp has already passed its own platform .
" when the disciplinary force of competition does not take hold … or is impeded by unfair conduct , the state has the mandate to regulate and intervene if necessary in the economy , " the new platform reads .

the disarmament was verified by two independent witnesses , the former church of ireland primate , robin eames , and the former chairman of the ulster bank , george quigley .

mackay , writing in an article coauthored by royal navy commander steve tatham and published by the british ministry of defense ’ s -lrb- mod -rrb- defense academy , called for fresh thinking on the battlefield and highlighted a need for more focus on " behaviorist " strategy when dealing with the complex structure of afghan society . he added that the military " consistently failed " to understand the motivations of local afghans which was undermining western efforts while strengthening the resistance , saying that western efforts had to focus on understanding the culture , economy and psychology of the taliban if allied forces were to be truly successful in battle . " many of the choices that are currently presented are too stark : poppy bad / wheat good ; taliban evil / isaf good and so on , " mackay wrote .
" the reality is that we have consistently failed to understand that what seems to us as irrational behavior is entirely rational to the individual facing tough choices . " " we have sought to advance the idea that alongside kinetic power there is potentially a more behaviorist approach which , we believe , can affect the enemy 's will and be as , or arguably more , effective than kinetic power in future conflict , " mackay added . ignoring the mistakes of the past bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mackay believes more local understanding is required samina ahmed , the project director for the south asia department of the international crisis group in islamabad , says that while western knowledge of afghanistan was shaped largely by the anti-soviet jihad and hence unrelated to current day afghan dynamics , other factors have proved more costly . " it is less the lack of knowledge about afghanistan that has contributed to instability and an ineffectual military campaign as a propensity to repeatedly seek short cuts that have backfired , instead of a focus on institution building that would pay long term dividends and the failure , when the ground was ripe , to provide adequate military and economic resources , " she told deutsche welle . ahmed also pointed out that when the taliban were ousted , the afghan people fully supported the intervention in the hope that the western presence would restore and underwrite peace and help to rebuild their war-torn land .
instead , she claimed , the west and its allies failed to understand the need then to buttress institutions , instead of relying on individuals , including warlords , and providing the economic goods . " if the taliban are to be deprived of support , then the west must shun short-cuts that will only undercut political stability , for instance by supporting selected warlords and their militias , instead of building a professional military as well as a police force that is capable of protecting the citizen , " she said .
" in short , a state that is capable of protecting the lives of its citizens and providing basic services is the only way in which violent extremism can be defeated in afghanistan . " west accused of stagnation in face of evolving conflict bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : roadside bombs have proved to be an effective weapon mackay also accused senior military officers of being " institutionally incapable of keeping pace with rapid change and the associated willingness to adapt - and quickly - at the same time . " western efforts in dealing with the counter-insurgency , he said , had a sense of " making it up as we go along " and that there was a serious lack of clear direction from senior officers .
he also suggested that military planners had been educated by a system designed for a previous age and could not adapt to current and future challenges . giles merritt , the director of the security & defence agenda think-tank in brussels , agrees that western forces are suffering from a lack of clear direction . " we are losing but we 're not losing for military reasons not for strategic reasons , " merritt told deutsche welle .
" we do n't have a clear plan , we do n't know how to assess if we 're winning or losing except in terms of body count , and we do n't have a big picture .
you hold a bit of ground here , we reduce the level of instability there but we 're not really working towards a clearly defined goal . " merritt does not believe , however , that military planners are incapable of adapting to the conflict in afghanistan - mainly becaue the tactics and the approach of the taliban has changed little since coalition forces invaded in 2001 . " the taliban have n't actually changed since the 1930 's , " merritt said .
" they 're incredibly patient .
they wait to see what the weaknesses are , what the chinks in the armor are and then they exploit them .
i do n't think there has been an enormous change in the taliban 's tactics at all and the west have certainly not been surprised by them .
so they fight a war of attrition with roadside bombs and ambushes .
this was to be expected . " time to talk to the taliban ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us would be suspicious of any taliban settlement offer the growing concern over the western approach in afghanistan and the alleged failure by allied forces to get a grip on the methods employed by the taliban in its counter-insurgency has given rise to cautious suggestions that direct negotiations may be the only way to end the war . government sources in the us refused to confirm or deny whether washington would deal with the taliban but defense secretary robert gates was quoted as saying that he believed the taliban would only contemplate an agreement if they had first been forced into believing they would lose the war . " the taliban leadership is currently disinclined to negotiate because it believes the west has n't the will to stay on in afghanistan , " samina ahmed said . " until the taliban are willing to negotiate , there is no question of defining terms or demands .
however , should such an opportunity arise , then the minimum demands should include acceptance of the afghan constitution and a willingness to give up arms .

" i want to hear from the bishop herself how she came to her opinion , " guttenberg told the leipziger volkszeitung newspaper , after kaessmann called for a concrete plan for a withdrawal of troops .
the two are due to meet on january 11 .
in an interview she gave at christmas , kaessmann said , " this war is not justifiable , even by the broadest possible standards of the german protestant church . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guttenberg is keen to hear kaessmann 's views firsthand in a statement released by her office on tuesday , kaessmann welcomed the chance to speak to guttenberg and said she intended to discuss " the ethical position of the protestant church and the government 's afghanistan policy " with the minister .
comments clarified kaessmann also clarified her comments , saying she had never called for an immediate troop withdrawal , but rather for a " clear plan " for withdrawal .
ruprecht polenz , of the ruling christian democratic union , welcomed kaessmann 's revised statement .
" i 'm glad that she is now taking up a position that is much closer to what is , shall we say , the opinion of the majority of the parliament , " polenz told public broadcaster wdr .
" i am very grateful that both churches are helping to support our troops with spiritual guidance , " guttenberg said .
" i am certain that mrs. kaessmann does not want to see that debased . "
protestant bishops also gave kaessmann their support on tuesday .
" a lot of people do n't understand why the mission is necessary and what its purpose is .
and it 's not clear how it can be ended , " said bishop maria jepsen of hamburg .
berlin bishop markus droege said that a continuation of the afghanistan mission was only morally acceptable if the government gave " a long-overdue definition of its aim and an exit strategy . "
catholic military bishop walter mixa also called for " an open and honest debate about the situation our soldiers are in and their mission . "
mixa said that the question of whether the mission was justified " is always relevant . " bk / epd / dpa editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he is one of the originators of the new growth theory and has been awarded the horst claus recktenwald prize in economics .
he was named one of the 25 most influential americans by time magazine .
he currently devotes all his time to his new project , " charter cities . "
deutsche welle : you have developed a new concept which you believe can reduce global poverty and empower underprivileged people better than traditional development policies can .
in a nutshell , what is your idea of the charter city ?
paul romer : one thing that we know works extremely well for raising standards of living and wages for people is to let them move from countries that have bad rules to countries that have better rules .
now there are n't that many spaces in countries with good rules to take hundreds of millions of people , so the charter city idea is to create places that have good quality rules where hundreds of millions of people could go .
you argue that a good system of rules as is found in most western societies is the key to economic prosperity and that such a rules-based system is attractive for people everywhere and therefore can basically be transplanted anywhere .
how do you respond to critics who say you underestimate cultural and historical factors , and that therefore charter cities may not be viable on a large scale ?
we know that people want access to these kinds of rule systems .
seven hundred million people around the world have said in response to survey questions that they would like to move permanently to a different country .
so people want this .
if you start with uninhabited land and invite people in to live under a new system of rules those rules can very quickly take hold and thrive .
another criticism of your idea of the charter city is that it is essentially colonialism revisited .
no one is forced to move or live in your charter city , and everyone is free to leave again , but essentially western countries are once again financing , setting up and running places where poor people can only come to sell their labor .
how do you counter that criticism ?
if you think about the question , picture someone from a very poor country , a family , a couple of young children , a father and a mother , and picture them moving to munich or zurich or vancouver .
we do n't think of that as colonial ; we think of that as something that gives them opportunities that they really want .
and this proposal is no more than saying if we ca n't let hundreds of millions of people go to those cities , let 's create some new cities that are run like those cities where large numbers of people could go .
as examples of possible charter cities you mention a canadian charter project in cuba , an australian project with indonesia or a project in india .
but how could a charter city work in the countries that really need help the most , i.e. the poorest countries in the world like eritrea or somalia ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hong kong is a well known historic example of a charter city the example of cuba and canada is not so much a literal proposal as a way to picture how this could work .
there happens to be a piece of land in cuba where by treaty cuba gave someone else the right to administer that land .
guantanamo bay is actually administered by the united states .
so countries like somalia or eritrea and other countries like that could sign treaties where relatively small pieces of land were assigned to other countries or perhaps a consortium of countries to set up new systems of rules there and create new cities in much the same way that the british created hong kong in a place where before they came no one lived .
for your concept to work , you need countries or private corporations to make large-scale investments .
those investors , of course , want to see a return on their investment .
how do you intend to attract investors for such a venture with an all but certain outcome , and on the other hand , how do you make sure that the investors are not merely trying to make a quick profit ?
this is why the rules are so important .
rules matter for families , because they want their children to be safe , they want to have a chance to get a job , they want rules that set up a good educational system .
but the rules also matter for investors .
a firm might come in and build a power system for a new city like this or build the infrastructure .
firms are quite willing to take market risks . what firms do not want to undertake is political risk , the risk that some government will just expropriate their property or suddenly enact policies that destroy the value of their investments .
so what the partner governments can do is make a credible commitment to rules that will remain in place for decades so that not only workers and families are attracted , but also investors and employers .
you 've been promoting the concept of charter cities since last year and have received lots of praise but also criticism for your idea .
has any country so far signed up to your idea ?
are there any concrete plans to develop the first charter city ?
there are preliminary conversations with various governments .
i tried this idea on possible participants in an arrangement like this and the reaction has been very positive .
the most surprising thing i 've learned is that the developing countries are very open to this idea .
they have seen how special zones were very effective development strategies - in china in particular - and they have seen how fast growth can take place when you get policy right .
china is now the new standard that countries are aspiring to and they are willing to try new things to get the kind of growth that they see in china .
-lsb- but -rsb- i think this would be an opportunity for governments that have not been as active on the world stage , including the government of germany , to really establish a whole new way of interacting with the rest of the world as a partner that could be distinctive and very beneficial .
what role could germany play in your concept of a charter city as a country with a comparatively brief colonial history ? one of the things that is interesting is that germany has relatively good ties with some of its former colonies , like namibia for example .
so as opposed to other countries where there is lingering resentment and bad feeling , there 's good feeling about the benefits that some of these countries receive from the german people .
so i think this good will is an asset that you could put to work in the future .
how has the development community reacted to your proposal , since you believe that the charter city could benefit more people across the globe than classical development aid can ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mauritius is considered a role model for the concept of a successful charter city i think the right way to describe it is that the reactions have been somewhat polarized .
on the one hand , there are many people who perceive the magnitude of the problem and the very slow pace of resolving that problem and who say your idea is very unusual and different , but it might be worth a try , because what we are doing right now is n't getting us where we want to go .
there are other people who are much more concerned , who say this is a very different approach , and it 's too risky , and we should n't try this .
but i think this gets the balance of the risks wrong .
i think the biggest risk is that we persist with the conditions that we now have in many parts of the world , where there are hundreds of millions of people who are desperate to go someplace where they can put their energies to work and create a better future for their children .
so i think there is very little risk in trying something different and we should be braver and we should have more imagination in solving this really pressing human problem .

but loud words seemed to rule the day at separate strategy meetings of the fdp and csu . the snow-covered hilltops of the southern german region around wildbad kreuth convey the impression of a place full of bliss and harmony .
but these days , harmony is solely left to mother nature .
everyone who matters in bavaria 's christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- - the sister party of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- - has flocked to the palace-like building at kreuth .
firing broadsides at both friend and foe has become an entertaining tradition at the csu 's three-day strategy meeting .
tax policies under fire the saber-rattling started wednesday morning , when csu head horst seehofer said his party had no reason to feel humble just because it had lost its absolute majority support in bavaria for the first time in its history .
seehofer attacked the free democrats ' -lrb- fdp -rrb- resolve to allow for 24 billion euros -lrb- $ 34.5 billion -rrb- in tax reductions as of 2011 despite the country facing record public debts , to be further increased by astronomic fresh borrowing this year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : csu head horst seehofer sees no reason to feel humble " i 'm sure the fdp will still learn what it means to assume government responsibility , " seehofer quipped in a statement directed at the conservatives ' coalition partner in berlin .
at their own gathering in stuttgart on wednesday , the pro-business fdp did n't wait long before responding to the verbal attack .
fdp floor leader birgit homburger said it was strange that the csu was so forgetful .
she recalled that all sides had agreed on tax reductions during coalition talks last year .
" we looked very hard at where taxes could be lowered and what measures could be financed and justified .
so why 's so much fuss being made about it now ? " , homburger asked in stuttgart .
body scanners not to everyone 's liking but tax policies are not the only bone of contention that berlin 's coalition partners almost seem to choke on these days .
there 's a controversy about whether or not body scanners should be used at german airports to increase security , with the fdp being far more concerned about any potential dignity issues than chancellor merkel 's conservatives .
and at least two foreign policy issues have shown time and again that the coalition partners are far from speaking with one voice .
number one is afghanistan , and with it the debate over whether germany should send in thousands of more troops in line with us president barack obama 's request to nato allies .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erika steinbach remains a controversial figure and then there 's the unresolved question of how to deal with erika steinbach , who heads germany 's federation of expellees -lrb- bdv -rrb- , a group which represents germans expelled from eastern europe after 1945 .
steinbach angered poland by not accepting the bilateral border treaty after german unification in 1990 .
her initial resolve to become a board member of a museum for european expellees has also caused an outcry in warsaw .
the conservatives and the fdp seem divided over how to deal with steinbach 's recent proposal to renounce the post in return for boosting the federation of expellees ' say in the museum work. hg / dpa / reuters / ap editor : trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 06.01.2010 fdp meets to discuss party 's direction as efforts to cut taxes stall großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tax cuts remain on the fdp agenda part of the ruling government for the first time in years , the free-market liberal fdp looked set to put its tax-lowering promises into action .
but as the new coalition stumbles , the fdp must re-evaluate its agenda . germany 's free-market liberal democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- met on wednesday in stuttgart for their party meeting , held annually on january 6 .
the self-reflection session comes just a few months after the fdp joined the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- in a coalition government .
coalition negotiations between the two parties appeared to go smoothly and many of the fdp 's campaign promises made it into the coalition agreement .
the centerpiece of the policy blueprint was a plan to cut income taxes by 24 billion euros -lrb- $ 36 billion -rrb- and the parties agreed to pursue a simplification of the german tax system .
a difficult economy takes its toll but the reality of germany 's ongoing economic troubles have put a damper on the early excitement of the election .
politicians are beginning to voice their doubts , including bartholomaeus kalb , member of the cdu 's bavarian sister party the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- .
" we just wo n't have any money for tax relief or any additional expenditures for the foreseeable future , and by that i mean through the end of the legislative period , " wednesday 's edition of the financial times deutschland quoted kalb as saying .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's debt is set to continue to rise in 2010 the csu also held their annual party meeting on wednesday .
germany faces a ballooning budget deficit , with the 2010 budget approved by chancellor angela merkel 's cabinet calling for a record 85.8 billion euros in borrowed cash .
the european union has pressed germany to get its deficit under control .
as the party meets to discuss plans for 2010 , there 's been some backpedaling from fdp leaders , including economics minister rainer bruederle .
" it would be absolutely wrong to start off by cutting the budget , " he said on german radio .
fdp deputy party leader andreas pinkwart told the handelsblatt business daily this means that reaching the goals laid out in the coalition agreement might not happen for a few years .
" it 's enough if the complete 24 billion euros of relief is achieved in 2013 , " pinkwart said .
thus far only one tax cut of 8.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 123.1 billion -rrb- has been approved .
but he added that the restructuring of the tax system must begin this year .
the fdp had hoped to institute a three-tiered system with tax rates of 10 percent , 25 percent and 35 percent .
a new fdp ?
with the fdp no longer pushing for immediate tax relief , the meeting in stuttgart could give the free-market liberals the opportunity to redefine themselves .
the fdp 's current party platform dates back to 1997 and on the agenda wednesday is a discussion of a new platform .
when the daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung asked fdp secretary general christian lindner whether the fdp image as it now stands did n't fit the current times , lindner said the party 's mission is structurally sound .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even economics minister bruederle is n't calling for the cuts to take place right away " there 's no major need for revision of fdp positions , " he said .
" instead , it 's about evolution .
the new party platform is supposed to be worked on until 2012 .
we should take our time . "
but there are elements of the party that are already making changes .
the state of baden wuerttemberg 's fdp has already passed its own platform .
" when the disciplinary force of competition does not take hold … or is impeded by unfair conduct , the state has the mandate to regulate and intervene if necessary in the economy , " the new platform reads .

but loud words seemed to rule the day at separate strategy meetings of the fdp and csu . the snow-covered hilltops of the southern german region around wildbad kreuth convey the impression of a place full of bliss and harmony .
but these days , harmony is solely left to mother nature .
everyone who matters in bavaria 's christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- - the sister party of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- - has flocked to the palace-like building at kreuth .
firing broadsides at both friend and foe has become an entertaining tradition at the csu 's three-day strategy meeting .
tax policies under fire the saber-rattling started wednesday morning , when csu head horst seehofer said his party had no reason to feel humble just because it had lost its absolute majority support in bavaria for the first time in its history .
seehofer attacked the free democrats ' -lrb- fdp -rrb- resolve to allow for 24 billion euros -lrb- $ 34.5 billion -rrb- in tax reductions as of 2011 despite the country facing record public debts , to be further increased by astronomic fresh borrowing this year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : csu head horst seehofer sees no reason to feel humble " i 'm sure the fdp will still learn what it means to assume government responsibility , " seehofer quipped in a statement directed at the conservatives ' coalition partner in berlin .
at their own gathering in stuttgart on wednesday , the pro-business fdp did n't wait long before responding to the verbal attack .
fdp floor leader birgit homburger said it was strange that the csu was so forgetful .
she recalled that all sides had agreed on tax reductions during coalition talks last year .
" we looked very hard at where taxes could be lowered and what measures could be financed and justified .
so why 's so much fuss being made about it now ? " , homburger asked in stuttgart .
body scanners not to everyone 's liking but tax policies are not the only bone of contention that berlin 's coalition partners almost seem to choke on these days .
there 's a controversy about whether or not body scanners should be used at german airports to increase security , with the fdp being far more concerned about any potential dignity issues than chancellor merkel 's conservatives .
and at least two foreign policy issues have shown time and again that the coalition partners are far from speaking with one voice .
number one is afghanistan , and with it the debate over whether germany should send in thousands of more troops in line with us president barack obama 's request to nato allies .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erika steinbach remains a controversial figure and then there 's the unresolved question of how to deal with erika steinbach , who heads germany 's federation of expellees -lrb- bdv -rrb- , a group which represents germans expelled from eastern europe after 1945 .
steinbach angered poland by not accepting the bilateral border treaty after german unification in 1990 .
her initial resolve to become a board member of a museum for european expellees has also caused an outcry in warsaw .
the conservatives and the fdp seem divided over how to deal with steinbach 's recent proposal to renounce the post in return for boosting the federation of expellees ' say in the museum work. hg / dpa / reuters / ap editor : trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

mackay , writing in an article coauthored by royal navy commander steve tatham and published by the british ministry of defense ’ s -lrb- mod -rrb- defense academy , called for fresh thinking on the battlefield and highlighted a need for more focus on " behaviorist " strategy when dealing with the complex structure of afghan society . he added that the military " consistently failed " to understand the motivations of local afghans which was undermining western efforts while strengthening the resistance , saying that western efforts had to focus on understanding the culture , economy and psychology of the taliban if allied forces were to be truly successful in battle . " many of the choices that are currently presented are too stark : poppy bad / wheat good ; taliban evil / isaf good and so on , " mackay wrote .
" the reality is that we have consistently failed to understand that what seems to us as irrational behavior is entirely rational to the individual facing tough choices . " " we have sought to advance the idea that alongside kinetic power there is potentially a more behaviorist approach which , we believe , can affect the enemy 's will and be as , or arguably more , effective than kinetic power in future conflict , " mackay added . ignoring the mistakes of the past bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mackay believes more local understanding is required samina ahmed , the project director for the south asia department of the international crisis group in islamabad , says that while western knowledge of afghanistan was shaped largely by the anti-soviet jihad and hence unrelated to current day afghan dynamics , other factors have proved more costly . " it is less the lack of knowledge about afghanistan that has contributed to instability and an ineffectual military campaign as a propensity to repeatedly seek short cuts that have backfired , instead of a focus on institution building that would pay long term dividends and the failure , when the ground was ripe , to provide adequate military and economic resources , " she told deutsche welle . ahmed also pointed out that when the taliban were ousted , the afghan people fully supported the intervention in the hope that the western presence would restore and underwrite peace and help to rebuild their war-torn land .
instead , she claimed , the west and its allies failed to understand the need then to buttress institutions , instead of relying on individuals , including warlords , and providing the economic goods . " if the taliban are to be deprived of support , then the west must shun short-cuts that will only undercut political stability , for instance by supporting selected warlords and their militias , instead of building a professional military as well as a police force that is capable of protecting the citizen , " she said .
" in short , a state that is capable of protecting the lives of its citizens and providing basic services is the only way in which violent extremism can be defeated in afghanistan . " west accused of stagnation in face of evolving conflict bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : roadside bombs have proved to be an effective weapon mackay also accused senior military officers of being " institutionally incapable of keeping pace with rapid change and the associated willingness to adapt - and quickly - at the same time . " western efforts in dealing with the counter-insurgency , he said , had a sense of " making it up as we go along " and that there was a serious lack of clear direction from senior officers .
he also suggested that military planners had been educated by a system designed for a previous age and could not adapt to current and future challenges . giles merritt , the director of the security & defence agenda think-tank in brussels , agrees that western forces are suffering from a lack of clear direction . " we are losing but we 're not losing for military reasons not for strategic reasons , " merritt told deutsche welle .
" we do n't have a clear plan , we do n't know how to assess if we 're winning or losing except in terms of body count , and we do n't have a big picture .
you hold a bit of ground here , we reduce the level of instability there but we 're not really working towards a clearly defined goal . " merritt does not believe , however , that military planners are incapable of adapting to the conflict in afghanistan - mainly becaue the tactics and the approach of the taliban has changed little since coalition forces invaded in 2001 . " the taliban have n't actually changed since the 1930 's , " merritt said .
" they 're incredibly patient .
they wait to see what the weaknesses are , what the chinks in the armor are and then they exploit them .
i do n't think there has been an enormous change in the taliban 's tactics at all and the west have certainly not been surprised by them .
so they fight a war of attrition with roadside bombs and ambushes .
this was to be expected . " time to talk to the taliban ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us would be suspicious of any taliban settlement offer the growing concern over the western approach in afghanistan and the alleged failure by allied forces to get a grip on the methods employed by the taliban in its counter-insurgency has given rise to cautious suggestions that direct negotiations may be the only way to end the war . government sources in the us refused to confirm or deny whether washington would deal with the taliban but defense secretary robert gates was quoted as saying that he believed the taliban would only contemplate an agreement if they had first been forced into believing they would lose the war . " the taliban leadership is currently disinclined to negotiate because it believes the west has n't the will to stay on in afghanistan , " samina ahmed said . " until the taliban are willing to negotiate , there is no question of defining terms or demands .
however , should such an opportunity arise , then the minimum demands should include acceptance of the afghan constitution and a willingness to give up arms .

dw-world.de different decade , similar mistakes ?
thirty years ago , the soviet union invaded afghanistan .
after 10 years of fighting , local rebels pushed the soviets out of the country .
many historians see parallels between that conflict and the current one .

more troops and a crackdown on corruption are to do the trick in 2010 , but no one is holding his breath .
-lrb- 25.12.2009 -rrb- after the surge : which way forward for the nato allies ?

but loud words seemed to rule the day at separate strategy meetings of the fdp and csu . the snow-covered hilltops of the southern german region around wildbad kreuth convey the impression of a place full of bliss and harmony .
but these days , harmony is solely left to mother nature .
everyone who matters in bavaria 's christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- - the sister party of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- - has flocked to the palace-like building at kreuth .
firing broadsides at both friend and foe has become an entertaining tradition at the csu 's three-day strategy meeting .
tax policies under fire the saber-rattling started wednesday morning , when csu head horst seehofer said his party had no reason to feel humble just because it had lost its absolute majority support in bavaria for the first time in its history .
seehofer attacked the free democrats ' -lrb- fdp -rrb- resolve to allow for 24 billion euros -lrb- $ 34.5 billion -rrb- in tax reductions as of 2011 despite the country facing record public debts , to be further increased by astronomic fresh borrowing this year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : csu head horst seehofer sees no reason to feel humble " i 'm sure the fdp will still learn what it means to assume government responsibility , " seehofer quipped in a statement directed at the conservatives ' coalition partner in berlin .
at their own gathering in stuttgart on wednesday , the pro-business fdp did n't wait long before responding to the verbal attack .
fdp floor leader birgit homburger said it was strange that the csu was so forgetful .
she recalled that all sides had agreed on tax reductions during coalition talks last year .
" we looked very hard at where taxes could be lowered and what measures could be financed and justified .
so why 's so much fuss being made about it now ? " , homburger asked in stuttgart .
body scanners not to everyone 's liking but tax policies are not the only bone of contention that berlin 's coalition partners almost seem to choke on these days .
there 's a controversy about whether or not body scanners should be used at german airports to increase security , with the fdp being far more concerned about any potential dignity issues than chancellor merkel 's conservatives .
and at least two foreign policy issues have shown time and again that the coalition partners are far from speaking with one voice .
number one is afghanistan , and with it the debate over whether germany should send in thousands of more troops in line with us president barack obama 's request to nato allies .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erika steinbach remains a controversial figure and then there 's the unresolved question of how to deal with erika steinbach , who heads germany 's federation of expellees -lrb- bdv -rrb- , a group which represents germans expelled from eastern europe after 1945 .
steinbach angered poland by not accepting the bilateral border treaty after german unification in 1990 .
her initial resolve to become a board member of a museum for european expellees has also caused an outcry in warsaw .
the conservatives and the fdp seem divided over how to deal with steinbach 's recent proposal to renounce the post in return for boosting the federation of expellees ' say in the museum work. hg / dpa / reuters / ap editor : trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

us president barack obama , in a televised address to the american people on tuesday , said us intelligence had missed " red flags " that could have disrupted the terror plot .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the christmas day attack has sparked wide concern " it is increasingly clear that intelligence was not fully analyzed or fully leveraged .
that 's not acceptable , and i will not tolerate it , " he said .
meanwhile , british prime minister gordon brown held a telephone conference with yemeni president ali abdullah saleh on tuesday to discuss " preparations and mechanisms " for an international conference on the security situation in yemen , according to the state-run saba news agency .
saleh , whose impoverished country faces unrest on several fronts , stressed " the determination of yemen to continue its efforts in the fight against terrorism , " saba reported .
last friday , brown called an international meeting on fighting extremism in yemen in response to the botched christmas day attack and continuing al-qaeda threats .

" i want to hear from the bishop herself how she came to her opinion , " guttenberg told the leipziger volkszeitung newspaper , after kaessmann called for a concrete plan for a withdrawal of troops .
the two are due to meet on january 11 .
in an interview she gave at christmas , kaessmann said , " this war is not justifiable , even by the broadest possible standards of the german protestant church . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guttenberg is keen to hear kaessmann 's views firsthand in a statement released by her office on tuesday , kaessmann welcomed the chance to speak to guttenberg and said she intended to discuss " the ethical position of the protestant church and the government 's afghanistan policy " with the minister .
comments clarified kaessmann also clarified her comments , saying she had never called for an immediate troop withdrawal , but rather for a " clear plan " for withdrawal .
ruprecht polenz , of the ruling christian democratic union , welcomed kaessmann 's revised statement .
" i 'm glad that she is now taking up a position that is much closer to what is , shall we say , the opinion of the majority of the parliament , " polenz told public broadcaster wdr .
" i am very grateful that both churches are helping to support our troops with spiritual guidance , " guttenberg said .
" i am certain that mrs. kaessmann does not want to see that debased . "
protestant bishops also gave kaessmann their support on tuesday .
" a lot of people do n't understand why the mission is necessary and what its purpose is .
and it 's not clear how it can be ended , " said bishop maria jepsen of hamburg .
berlin bishop markus droege said that a continuation of the afghanistan mission was only morally acceptable if the government gave " a long-overdue definition of its aim and an exit strategy . "
catholic military bishop walter mixa also called for " an open and honest debate about the situation our soldiers are in and their mission . "
mixa said that the question of whether the mission was justified " is always relevant . " bk / epd / dpa editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

mackay , writing in an article coauthored by royal navy commander steve tatham and published by the british ministry of defense ’ s -lrb- mod -rrb- defense academy , called for fresh thinking on the battlefield and highlighted a need for more focus on " behaviorist " strategy when dealing with the complex structure of afghan society . he added that the military " consistently failed " to understand the motivations of local afghans which was undermining western efforts while strengthening the resistance , saying that western efforts had to focus on understanding the culture , economy and psychology of the taliban if allied forces were to be truly successful in battle . " many of the choices that are currently presented are too stark : poppy bad / wheat good ; taliban evil / isaf good and so on , " mackay wrote .
" the reality is that we have consistently failed to understand that what seems to us as irrational behavior is entirely rational to the individual facing tough choices . " " we have sought to advance the idea that alongside kinetic power there is potentially a more behaviorist approach which , we believe , can affect the enemy 's will and be as , or arguably more , effective than kinetic power in future conflict , " mackay added . ignoring the mistakes of the past bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mackay believes more local understanding is required samina ahmed , the project director for the south asia department of the international crisis group in islamabad , says that while western knowledge of afghanistan was shaped largely by the anti-soviet jihad and hence unrelated to current day afghan dynamics , other factors have proved more costly . " it is less the lack of knowledge about afghanistan that has contributed to instability and an ineffectual military campaign as a propensity to repeatedly seek short cuts that have backfired , instead of a focus on institution building that would pay long term dividends and the failure , when the ground was ripe , to provide adequate military and economic resources , " she told deutsche welle . ahmed also pointed out that when the taliban were ousted , the afghan people fully supported the intervention in the hope that the western presence would restore and underwrite peace and help to rebuild their war-torn land .
instead , she claimed , the west and its allies failed to understand the need then to buttress institutions , instead of relying on individuals , including warlords , and providing the economic goods . " if the taliban are to be deprived of support , then the west must shun short-cuts that will only undercut political stability , for instance by supporting selected warlords and their militias , instead of building a professional military as well as a police force that is capable of protecting the citizen , " she said .
" in short , a state that is capable of protecting the lives of its citizens and providing basic services is the only way in which violent extremism can be defeated in afghanistan . " west accused of stagnation in face of evolving conflict bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : roadside bombs have proved to be an effective weapon mackay also accused senior military officers of being " institutionally incapable of keeping pace with rapid change and the associated willingness to adapt - and quickly - at the same time . " western efforts in dealing with the counter-insurgency , he said , had a sense of " making it up as we go along " and that there was a serious lack of clear direction from senior officers .
he also suggested that military planners had been educated by a system designed for a previous age and could not adapt to current and future challenges . giles merritt , the director of the security & defence agenda think-tank in brussels , agrees that western forces are suffering from a lack of clear direction . " we are losing but we 're not losing for military reasons not for strategic reasons , " merritt told deutsche welle .
" we do n't have a clear plan , we do n't know how to assess if we 're winning or losing except in terms of body count , and we do n't have a big picture .
you hold a bit of ground here , we reduce the level of instability there but we 're not really working towards a clearly defined goal . " merritt does not believe , however , that military planners are incapable of adapting to the conflict in afghanistan - mainly becaue the tactics and the approach of the taliban has changed little since coalition forces invaded in 2001 . " the taliban have n't actually changed since the 1930 's , " merritt said .
" they 're incredibly patient .
they wait to see what the weaknesses are , what the chinks in the armor are and then they exploit them .
i do n't think there has been an enormous change in the taliban 's tactics at all and the west have certainly not been surprised by them .
so they fight a war of attrition with roadside bombs and ambushes .

" the taliban leadership is currently disinclined to negotiate because it believes the west has n't the will to stay on in afghanistan , " samina ahmed said .

so they fight a war of attrition with roadside bombs and ambushes .
this was to be expected . " time to talk to the taliban ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us would be suspicious of any taliban settlement offer the growing concern over the western approach in afghanistan and the alleged failure by allied forces to get a grip on the methods employed by the taliban in its counter-insurgency has given rise to cautious suggestions that direct negotiations may be the only way to end the war . government sources in the us refused to confirm or deny whether washington would deal with the taliban but defense secretary robert gates was quoted as saying that he believed the taliban would only contemplate an agreement if they had first been forced into believing they would lose the war . " the taliban leadership is currently disinclined to negotiate because it believes the west has n't the will to stay on in afghanistan , " samina ahmed said . " until the taliban are willing to negotiate , there is no question of defining terms or demands .
however , should such an opportunity arise , then the minimum demands should include acceptance of the afghan constitution and a willingness to give up arms .

thirty years ago , the soviet union invaded afghanistan .

many historians see parallels between that conflict and the current one .

he is one of the originators of the new growth theory and has been awarded the horst claus recktenwald prize in economics .
he was named one of the 25 most influential americans by time magazine .
he currently devotes all his time to his new project , " charter cities . "
deutsche welle : you have developed a new concept which you believe can reduce global poverty and empower underprivileged people better than traditional development policies can .
in a nutshell , what is your idea of the charter city ?
paul romer : one thing that we know works extremely well for raising standards of living and wages for people is to let them move from countries that have bad rules to countries that have better rules .
now there are n't that many spaces in countries with good rules to take hundreds of millions of people , so the charter city idea is to create places that have good quality rules where hundreds of millions of people could go .
you argue that a good system of rules as is found in most western societies is the key to economic prosperity and that such a rules-based system is attractive for people everywhere and therefore can basically be transplanted anywhere .
how do you respond to critics who say you underestimate cultural and historical factors , and that therefore charter cities may not be viable on a large scale ?
we know that people want access to these kinds of rule systems .
seven hundred million people around the world have said in response to survey questions that they would like to move permanently to a different country .
so people want this .
if you start with uninhabited land and invite people in to live under a new system of rules those rules can very quickly take hold and thrive .
another criticism of your idea of the charter city is that it is essentially colonialism revisited .
no one is forced to move or live in your charter city , and everyone is free to leave again , but essentially western countries are once again financing , setting up and running places where poor people can only come to sell their labor .
how do you counter that criticism ?
if you think about the question , picture someone from a very poor country , a family , a couple of young children , a father and a mother , and picture them moving to munich or zurich or vancouver .
we do n't think of that as colonial ; we think of that as something that gives them opportunities that they really want .
and this proposal is no more than saying if we ca n't let hundreds of millions of people go to those cities , let 's create some new cities that are run like those cities where large numbers of people could go .
as examples of possible charter cities you mention a canadian charter project in cuba , an australian project with indonesia or a project in india .
but how could a charter city work in the countries that really need help the most , i.e. the poorest countries in the world like eritrea or somalia ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hong kong is a well known historic example of a charter city the example of cuba and canada is not so much a literal proposal as a way to picture how this could work .
there happens to be a piece of land in cuba where by treaty cuba gave someone else the right to administer that land .
guantanamo bay is actually administered by the united states .
so countries like somalia or eritrea and other countries like that could sign treaties where relatively small pieces of land were assigned to other countries or perhaps a consortium of countries to set up new systems of rules there and create new cities in much the same way that the british created hong kong in a place where before they came no one lived .
for your concept to work , you need countries or private corporations to make large-scale investments .
those investors , of course , want to see a return on their investment .
how do you intend to attract investors for such a venture with an all but certain outcome , and on the other hand , how do you make sure that the investors are not merely trying to make a quick profit ?
this is why the rules are so important .
rules matter for families , because they want their children to be safe , they want to have a chance to get a job , they want rules that set up a good educational system .
but the rules also matter for investors .
a firm might come in and build a power system for a new city like this or build the infrastructure .
firms are quite willing to take market risks . what firms do not want to undertake is political risk , the risk that some government will just expropriate their property or suddenly enact policies that destroy the value of their investments .
so what the partner governments can do is make a credible commitment to rules that will remain in place for decades so that not only workers and families are attracted , but also investors and employers .
you 've been promoting the concept of charter cities since last year and have received lots of praise but also criticism for your idea .
has any country so far signed up to your idea ?
are there any concrete plans to develop the first charter city ?
there are preliminary conversations with various governments .
i tried this idea on possible participants in an arrangement like this and the reaction has been very positive .
the most surprising thing i 've learned is that the developing countries are very open to this idea .
they have seen how special zones were very effective development strategies - in china in particular - and they have seen how fast growth can take place when you get policy right .
china is now the new standard that countries are aspiring to and they are willing to try new things to get the kind of growth that they see in china .
-lsb- but -rsb- i think this would be an opportunity for governments that have not been as active on the world stage , including the government of germany , to really establish a whole new way of interacting with the rest of the world as a partner that could be distinctive and very beneficial .
what role could germany play in your concept of a charter city as a country with a comparatively brief colonial history ? one of the things that is interesting is that germany has relatively good ties with some of its former colonies , like namibia for example .
so as opposed to other countries where there is lingering resentment and bad feeling , there 's good feeling about the benefits that some of these countries receive from the german people .
so i think this good will is an asset that you could put to work in the future .
how has the development community reacted to your proposal , since you believe that the charter city could benefit more people across the globe than classical development aid can ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mauritius is considered a role model for the concept of a successful charter city i think the right way to describe it is that the reactions have been somewhat polarized .
on the one hand , there are many people who perceive the magnitude of the problem and the very slow pace of resolving that problem and who say your idea is very unusual and different , but it might be worth a try , because what we are doing right now is n't getting us where we want to go .
there are other people who are much more concerned , who say this is a very different approach , and it 's too risky , and we should n't try this .
but i think this gets the balance of the risks wrong .
i think the biggest risk is that we persist with the conditions that we now have in many parts of the world , where there are hundreds of millions of people who are desperate to go someplace where they can put their energies to work and create a better future for their children .
so i think there is very little risk in trying something different and we should be braver and we should have more imagination in solving this really pressing human problem .

with budget deficits a problem across the bloc , member nations said the 3.7-percent raise was too high . the european commission officially decided to take european union member states to court over their refusal to accept a 3.7-percent pay raise for eu employees , announced commission spokeswoman pia ahrenkilde hansen on wednesday in brussels .
the decision was unanimously made by the 27 commissioners , hansen said .
the court complaint pits the european council , which is the collective entity for the 27 member states , against the commission , the bloc 's executive , in the luxembourg-based european court of justice .
it 's a battle that may prove embarrassing to the eu at a time when the bloc is attempting to rebrand itself after passing the lisbon reform treaty .
formula determines salaries the salaries of eu bureaucrats are calculated with a complex and legally binding formula that incorporates pay levels in brussels and eight of the eu 's wealthiest countries .
but with some national governments cutting their own civil servants ' pay amid ongoing economic difficulties , member countries decided to approve only a 1.85 percent increase .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : now the eu 's court of justice will decide how big a raise the employees get the commission would have none of it .
" we are talking here about the respect for agreed rules , " spokeswoman hansen said .
" it is not an issue where political discretion is at play . "
according to the commission , some 50,000 eu employees and contract staff at the commission , parliament , council and court are due the 3.7-percent raise , including the judges who will hear the case .
the basic gross income of these workers ranges from 2,550 euros -lrb- $ 3,800 -rrb- a month to 17,700 euros -lrb- $ 25,373 -rrb- .
the salaries are paid out from the eu 's central budget , which is ultimately funded by taxpayers in member countries .
the commission has asked the court for a speedy decision , to be made within six months .
however , the case could drag on for more than a year , during which the 1.85-percent raise would take effect. hf / afp / dpa editor : trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the ministry also said it had arrested five " terrorist elements " during the past two days near the capital but gave no details of the identity of the suspects .

last friday , brown called an international meeting on fighting extremism in yemen in response to the botched christmas day attack and continuing al-qaeda threats .
brown 's office said the meeting would take place in london on january 28 , at the same time as the international conference on afghanistan , also in the british capital. glb / afp / dpa editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

“ now that this is behind us i hope that we have put an end to the wave of terror in our country , ” he said .
he was speaking just a month after two suicide attacks on two hotels in the capital city jakarta had killed nine people and injured dozens .
it was immediately blamed on the jemaah islamiyah militant network .
at the time , indonesian political scientist sony tanuwidjaja hinted that it could happen again : “ the fact that this happens , on this scale , in a place where security is very tight shows that there is a hole in that security and i think that the security , the police force still have a lot to learn . ”

he is also certain that others can change their views .
“ i do not think that brotherhood , the friendship among them , the bond , is dangerous .
what is dangerous is when they start thinking that to carry out an attack in a non-conflict area , like indonesia , is justified .
that is the danger , when such an ideology is coupled with the friendship that they have in pakistan , in peshawar … ” “ but one has to understand also that many of the afghan alumni actually go back to society and live normally so we can not label them as terrorists , ” he warns .
ismail adds that it is important to label only those who have participated in terrorist activities and carried out violent acts against civilians as terrorists .
others should not be stigmatised .
he does not appear to be worried about being targeted by terrorists himself .

on dec .
30 , 2009 , up to 150,000 litres of diesel leaked out into the chishui and wei rivers .
the accident was caused by a rupture in a pipeline belonging to the country 's top oil producer , the china national petroleum corporation , which blamed a third party .
on monday , diesel from the spill reached the yellow river . china is currently battling with polluted water and negative attention as well .
the diesel spill reaching the yellow river is a large concern because it is one of china 's longest rivers and the source of drinking water for millions of people .
" oil is detrimental to drinking water - it is not safe for people to drink water contaminated by diesel , ” said ma jun , director of the institute of public and environmental affairs in beijing .
“ efforts are being made in an intensive way to contain the spreading of the diesel spill - at this moment , one of the major reservoirs has been shut down , has stopped generating electricity in order to contain the diesel spill .
local residents along the river have been warned not to use water directly from the river . "
unfit for drinking but ok for agriculture water quality has reached level five in the rivers contaminated by the spill .
this is the lowest level of quality in chinese standards .
according to the government , this means the water is unfit for drinking but can be used for agricultural purposes .
pay drechsel from the international water management institute in sri lanka said he was “ very concerned about the water situation in china . ”
“ this goes far beyond those accidents , ” he explained .
“ the amount of normal domestic and industrial waste water , which is discharged into china 's water bodies daily , is huge .
except for a few big cities , waste water is not properly treated before being discharged , which affects drinking water and agricultural production .
the area under irrigation with polluted water or waste water is estimated today as four million hectares in china .
that is by far the largest area irrigated with waste water in the world . "
water experts agree waste water and contaminated river water contain high amounts of heavy metals and chemicals .
this can cause serious health issues in animals and humans who either drink the water directly or eat crops that have been irrigated with polluted water .
waste water treatment plants not sophisticated enough according to the international water management institute , china has about 200 waste water treatment plants but even then , the majority are not sophisticated enough to deliver good treatment .
pay drechsel points out that most small towns in china , which have been developing rapidly in recent years , do not have any waste water treatment plants at all .
“ china is making efforts to improve its water quality , by i.e. building new sewage plants .
however , there are still too many factories , whose discharge can not meet china 's national standards , ” says ma jun .
the institute of public and environmental affairs in beijing compiles a list of china 's big polluters and makes it public , thus creating awareness .
but it will take more effort .
according to government data , more than 200 million people do not have access to safe drinking water .
if china 's cities continue to grow at the current rate , the infrastructure will have to be significantly adapted to sustain the development .

“ now that this is behind us i hope that we have put an end to the wave of terror in our country , ” he said .
he was speaking just a month after two suicide attacks on two hotels in the capital city jakarta had killed nine people and injured dozens .
it was immediately blamed on the jemaah islamiyah militant network .
at the time , indonesian political scientist sony tanuwidjaja hinted that it could happen again : “ the fact that this happens , on this scale , in a place where security is very tight shows that there is a hole in that security and i think that the security , the police force still have a lot to learn . ”

noor huda ismail attended a jemaah islamiyah school , the al-mukmin pesantren in ngruki that was founded in 1972 .
many of its graduates have been implicated in terrorist attacks , including some of noor huda ismail ’ s classmates .
he explains that many of them went to military training camps in peshawar , pakistan , to fight as mujahedeen in afghanistan and their ideas became more radical .
“ there was ongoing recruitment back then .

he is also certain that others can change their views .
“ i do not think that brotherhood , the friendship among them , the bond , is dangerous .
what is dangerous is when they start thinking that to carry out an attack in a non-conflict area , like indonesia , is justified .
that is the danger , when such an ideology is coupled with the friendship that they have in pakistan , in peshawar … ” “ but one has to understand also that many of the afghan alumni actually go back to society and live normally so we can not label them as terrorists , ” he warns .

on dec .
30 , 2009 , up to 150,000 litres of diesel leaked out into the chishui and wei rivers .
the accident was caused by a rupture in a pipeline belonging to the country 's top oil producer , the china national petroleum corporation , which blamed a third party .
on monday , diesel from the spill reached the yellow river . china is currently battling with polluted water and negative attention as well .
the diesel spill reaching the yellow river is a large concern because it is one of china 's longest rivers and the source of drinking water for millions of people .
" oil is detrimental to drinking water - it is not safe for people to drink water contaminated by diesel , ” said ma jun , director of the institute of public and environmental affairs in beijing .
“ efforts are being made in an intensive way to contain the spreading of the diesel spill - at this moment , one of the major reservoirs has been shut down , has stopped generating electricity in order to contain the diesel spill .
local residents along the river have been warned not to use water directly from the river . "
unfit for drinking but ok for agriculture water quality has reached level five in the rivers contaminated by the spill .
this is the lowest level of quality in chinese standards .
according to the government , this means the water is unfit for drinking but can be used for agricultural purposes .
pay drechsel from the international water management institute in sri lanka said he was “ very concerned about the water situation in china . ”
“ this goes far beyond those accidents , ” he explained .
“ the amount of normal domestic and industrial waste water , which is discharged into china 's water bodies daily , is huge .
except for a few big cities , waste water is not properly treated before being discharged , which affects drinking water and agricultural production .
the area under irrigation with polluted water or waste water is estimated today as four million hectares in china .
that is by far the largest area irrigated with waste water in the world . "
water experts agree waste water and contaminated river water contain high amounts of heavy metals and chemicals .
this can cause serious health issues in animals and humans who either drink the water directly or eat crops that have been irrigated with polluted water .
waste water treatment plants not sophisticated enough according to the international water management institute , china has about 200 waste water treatment plants but even then , the majority are not sophisticated enough to deliver good treatment .
pay drechsel points out that most small towns in china , which have been developing rapidly in recent years , do not have any waste water treatment plants at all .
“ china is making efforts to improve its water quality , by i.e. building new sewage plants .
however , there are still too many factories , whose discharge can not meet china 's national standards , ” says ma jun .
the institute of public and environmental affairs in beijing compiles a list of china 's big polluters and makes it public , thus creating awareness .
but it will take more effort .
according to government data , more than 200 million people do not have access to safe drinking water .
if china 's cities continue to grow at the current rate , the infrastructure will have to be significantly adapted to sustain the development .

mackay , writing in an article coauthored by royal navy commander steve tatham and published by the british ministry of defense ’ s -lrb- mod -rrb- defense academy , called for fresh thinking on the battlefield and highlighted a need for more focus on " behaviorist " strategy when dealing with the complex structure of afghan society . he added that the military " consistently failed " to understand the motivations of local afghans which was undermining western efforts while strengthening the resistance , saying that western efforts had to focus on understanding the culture , economy and psychology of the taliban if allied forces were to be truly successful in battle . " many of the choices that are currently presented are too stark : poppy bad / wheat good ; taliban evil / isaf good and so on , " mackay wrote .
" the reality is that we have consistently failed to understand that what seems to us as irrational behavior is entirely rational to the individual facing tough choices . " " we have sought to advance the idea that alongside kinetic power there is potentially a more behaviorist approach which , we believe , can affect the enemy 's will and be as , or arguably more , effective than kinetic power in future conflict , " mackay added . ignoring the mistakes of the past bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mackay believes more local understanding is required samina ahmed , the project director for the south asia department of the international crisis group in islamabad , says that while western knowledge of afghanistan was shaped largely by the anti-soviet jihad and hence unrelated to current day afghan dynamics , other factors have proved more costly . " it is less the lack of knowledge about afghanistan that has contributed to instability and an ineffectual military campaign as a propensity to repeatedly seek short cuts that have backfired , instead of a focus on institution building that would pay long term dividends and the failure , when the ground was ripe , to provide adequate military and economic resources , " she told deutsche welle . ahmed also pointed out that when the taliban were ousted , the afghan people fully supported the intervention in the hope that the western presence would restore and underwrite peace and help to rebuild their war-torn land .
instead , she claimed , the west and its allies failed to understand the need then to buttress institutions , instead of relying on individuals , including warlords , and providing the economic goods . " if the taliban are to be deprived of support , then the west must shun short-cuts that will only undercut political stability , for instance by supporting selected warlords and their militias , instead of building a professional military as well as a police force that is capable of protecting the citizen , " she said .
" in short , a state that is capable of protecting the lives of its citizens and providing basic services is the only way in which violent extremism can be defeated in afghanistan . " west accused of stagnation in face of evolving conflict bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : roadside bombs have proved to be an effective weapon mackay also accused senior military officers of being " institutionally incapable of keeping pace with rapid change and the associated willingness to adapt - and quickly - at the same time . " western efforts in dealing with the counter-insurgency , he said , had a sense of " making it up as we go along " and that there was a serious lack of clear direction from senior officers .
he also suggested that military planners had been educated by a system designed for a previous age and could not adapt to current and future challenges . giles merritt , the director of the security & defence agenda think-tank in brussels , agrees that western forces are suffering from a lack of clear direction . " we are losing but we 're not losing for military reasons not for strategic reasons , " merritt told deutsche welle .
" we do n't have a clear plan , we do n't know how to assess if we 're winning or losing except in terms of body count , and we do n't have a big picture .
you hold a bit of ground here , we reduce the level of instability there but we 're not really working towards a clearly defined goal . " merritt does not believe , however , that military planners are incapable of adapting to the conflict in afghanistan - mainly becaue the tactics and the approach of the taliban has changed little since coalition forces invaded in 2001 . " the taliban have n't actually changed since the 1930 's , " merritt said .
" they 're incredibly patient .
they wait to see what the weaknesses are , what the chinks in the armor are and then they exploit them .
i do n't think there has been an enormous change in the taliban 's tactics at all and the west have certainly not been surprised by them .
so they fight a war of attrition with roadside bombs and ambushes .
this was to be expected . " time to talk to the taliban ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us would be suspicious of any taliban settlement offer the growing concern over the western approach in afghanistan and the alleged failure by allied forces to get a grip on the methods employed by the taliban in its counter-insurgency has given rise to cautious suggestions that direct negotiations may be the only way to end the war . government sources in the us refused to confirm or deny whether washington would deal with the taliban but defense secretary robert gates was quoted as saying that he believed the taliban would only contemplate an agreement if they had first been forced into believing they would lose the war . " the taliban leadership is currently disinclined to negotiate because it believes the west has n't the will to stay on in afghanistan , " samina ahmed said . " until the taliban are willing to negotiate , there is no question of defining terms or demands .
however , should such an opportunity arise , then the minimum demands should include acceptance of the afghan constitution and a willingness to give up arms .

" we are losing but we 're not losing for military reasons not for strategic reasons , " merritt told deutsche welle .
" we do n't have a clear plan , we do n't know how to assess if we 're winning or losing except in terms of body count , and we do n't have a big picture .
you hold a bit of ground here , we reduce the level of instability there but we 're not really working towards a clearly defined goal . " merritt does not believe , however , that military planners are incapable of adapting to the conflict in afghanistan - mainly becaue the tactics and the approach of the taliban has changed little since coalition forces invaded in 2001 . " the taliban have n't actually changed since the 1930 's , " merritt said .
" they 're incredibly patient .
they wait to see what the weaknesses are , what the chinks in the armor are and then they exploit them .
i do n't think there has been an enormous change in the taliban 's tactics at all and the west have certainly not been surprised by them .

mackay , writing in an article coauthored by royal navy commander steve tatham and published by the british ministry of defense ’ s -lrb- mod -rrb- defense academy , called for fresh thinking on the battlefield and highlighted a need for more focus on " behaviorist " strategy when dealing with the complex structure of afghan society . he added that the military " consistently failed " to understand the motivations of local afghans which was undermining western efforts while strengthening the resistance , saying that western efforts had to focus on understanding the culture , economy and psychology of the taliban if allied forces were to be truly successful in battle . " many of the choices that are currently presented are too stark : poppy bad / wheat good ; taliban evil / isaf good and so on , " mackay wrote .
" the reality is that we have consistently failed to understand that what seems to us as irrational behavior is entirely rational to the individual facing tough choices . " " we have sought to advance the idea that alongside kinetic power there is potentially a more behaviorist approach which , we believe , can affect the enemy 's will and be as , or arguably more , effective than kinetic power in future conflict , " mackay added . ignoring the mistakes of the past bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mackay believes more local understanding is required samina ahmed , the project director for the south asia department of the international crisis group in islamabad , says that while western knowledge of afghanistan was shaped largely by the anti-soviet jihad and hence unrelated to current day afghan dynamics , other factors have proved more costly . " it is less the lack of knowledge about afghanistan that has contributed to instability and an ineffectual military campaign as a propensity to repeatedly seek short cuts that have backfired , instead of a focus on institution building that would pay long term dividends and the failure , when the ground was ripe , to provide adequate military and economic resources , " she told deutsche welle . ahmed also pointed out that when the taliban were ousted , the afghan people fully supported the intervention in the hope that the western presence would restore and underwrite peace and help to rebuild their war-torn land .
instead , she claimed , the west and its allies failed to understand the need then to buttress institutions , instead of relying on individuals , including warlords , and providing the economic goods . " if the taliban are to be deprived of support , then the west must shun short-cuts that will only undercut political stability , for instance by supporting selected warlords and their militias , instead of building a professional military as well as a police force that is capable of protecting the citizen , " she said .
" in short , a state that is capable of protecting the lives of its citizens and providing basic services is the only way in which violent extremism can be defeated in afghanistan . " west accused of stagnation in face of evolving conflict bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : roadside bombs have proved to be an effective weapon mackay also accused senior military officers of being " institutionally incapable of keeping pace with rapid change and the associated willingness to adapt - and quickly - at the same time . " western efforts in dealing with the counter-insurgency , he said , had a sense of " making it up as we go along " and that there was a serious lack of clear direction from senior officers .
he also suggested that military planners had been educated by a system designed for a previous age and could not adapt to current and future challenges . giles merritt , the director of the security & defence agenda think-tank in brussels , agrees that western forces are suffering from a lack of clear direction .

mackay , writing in an article coauthored by royal navy commander steve tatham and published by the british ministry of defense ’ s -lrb- mod -rrb- defense academy , called for fresh thinking on the battlefield and highlighted a need for more focus on " behaviorist " strategy when dealing with the complex structure of afghan society . he added that the military " consistently failed " to understand the motivations of local afghans which was undermining western efforts while strengthening the resistance , saying that western efforts had to focus on understanding the culture , economy and psychology of the taliban if allied forces were to be truly successful in battle . " many of the choices that are currently presented are too stark : poppy bad / wheat good ; taliban evil / isaf good and so on , " mackay wrote .
" the reality is that we have consistently failed to understand that what seems to us as irrational behavior is entirely rational to the individual facing tough choices . " " we have sought to advance the idea that alongside kinetic power there is potentially a more behaviorist approach which , we believe , can affect the enemy 's will and be as , or arguably more , effective than kinetic power in future conflict , " mackay added . ignoring the mistakes of the past bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mackay believes more local understanding is required samina ahmed , the project director for the south asia department of the international crisis group in islamabad , says that while western knowledge of afghanistan was shaped largely by the anti-soviet jihad and hence unrelated to current day afghan dynamics , other factors have proved more costly . " it is less the lack of knowledge about afghanistan that has contributed to instability and an ineffectual military campaign as a propensity to repeatedly seek short cuts that have backfired , instead of a focus on institution building that would pay long term dividends and the failure , when the ground was ripe , to provide adequate military and economic resources , " she told deutsche welle . ahmed also pointed out that when the taliban were ousted , the afghan people fully supported the intervention in the hope that the western presence would restore and underwrite peace and help to rebuild their war-torn land .
instead , she claimed , the west and its allies failed to understand the need then to buttress institutions , instead of relying on individuals , including warlords , and providing the economic goods . " if the taliban are to be deprived of support , then the west must shun short-cuts that will only undercut political stability , for instance by supporting selected warlords and their militias , instead of building a professional military as well as a police force that is capable of protecting the citizen , " she said .
" in short , a state that is capable of protecting the lives of its citizens and providing basic services is the only way in which violent extremism can be defeated in afghanistan . " west accused of stagnation in face of evolving conflict bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : roadside bombs have proved to be an effective weapon mackay also accused senior military officers of being " institutionally incapable of keeping pace with rapid change and the associated willingness to adapt - and quickly - at the same time . " western efforts in dealing with the counter-insurgency , he said , had a sense of " making it up as we go along " and that there was a serious lack of clear direction from senior officers .
he also suggested that military planners had been educated by a system designed for a previous age and could not adapt to current and future challenges . giles merritt , the director of the security & defence agenda think-tank in brussels , agrees that western forces are suffering from a lack of clear direction . " we are losing but we 're not losing for military reasons not for strategic reasons , " merritt told deutsche welle .
" we do n't have a clear plan , we do n't know how to assess if we 're winning or losing except in terms of body count , and we do n't have a big picture .
you hold a bit of ground here , we reduce the level of instability there but we 're not really working towards a clearly defined goal . " merritt does not believe , however , that military planners are incapable of adapting to the conflict in afghanistan - mainly becaue the tactics and the approach of the taliban has changed little since coalition forces invaded in 2001 . " the taliban have n't actually changed since the 1930 's , " merritt said .
" they 're incredibly patient .
they wait to see what the weaknesses are , what the chinks in the armor are and then they exploit them .
i do n't think there has been an enormous change in the taliban 's tactics at all and the west have certainly not been surprised by them .
so they fight a war of attrition with roadside bombs and ambushes .
this was to be expected . " time to talk to the taliban ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us would be suspicious of any taliban settlement offer the growing concern over the western approach in afghanistan and the alleged failure by allied forces to get a grip on the methods employed by the taliban in its counter-insurgency has given rise to cautious suggestions that direct negotiations may be the only way to end the war . government sources in the us refused to confirm or deny whether washington would deal with the taliban but defense secretary robert gates was quoted as saying that he believed the taliban would only contemplate an agreement if they had first been forced into believing they would lose the war . " the taliban leadership is currently disinclined to negotiate because it believes the west has n't the will to stay on in afghanistan , " samina ahmed said . " until the taliban are willing to negotiate , there is no question of defining terms or demands .
however , should such an opportunity arise , then the minimum demands should include acceptance of the afghan constitution and a willingness to give up arms .

he is one of the originators of the new growth theory and has been awarded the horst claus recktenwald prize in economics .
he was named one of the 25 most influential americans by time magazine .
he currently devotes all his time to his new project , " charter cities . "
deutsche welle : you have developed a new concept which you believe can reduce global poverty and empower underprivileged people better than traditional development policies can .
in a nutshell , what is your idea of the charter city ?
paul romer : one thing that we know works extremely well for raising standards of living and wages for people is to let them move from countries that have bad rules to countries that have better rules .
now there are n't that many spaces in countries with good rules to take hundreds of millions of people , so the charter city idea is to create places that have good quality rules where hundreds of millions of people could go .
you argue that a good system of rules as is found in most western societies is the key to economic prosperity and that such a rules-based system is attractive for people everywhere and therefore can basically be transplanted anywhere .
how do you respond to critics who say you underestimate cultural and historical factors , and that therefore charter cities may not be viable on a large scale ?
we know that people want access to these kinds of rule systems .
seven hundred million people around the world have said in response to survey questions that they would like to move permanently to a different country .
so people want this .
if you start with uninhabited land and invite people in to live under a new system of rules those rules can very quickly take hold and thrive .
another criticism of your idea of the charter city is that it is essentially colonialism revisited .
no one is forced to move or live in your charter city , and everyone is free to leave again , but essentially western countries are once again financing , setting up and running places where poor people can only come to sell their labor .
how do you counter that criticism ?
if you think about the question , picture someone from a very poor country , a family , a couple of young children , a father and a mother , and picture them moving to munich or zurich or vancouver .
we do n't think of that as colonial ; we think of that as something that gives them opportunities that they really want .
and this proposal is no more than saying if we ca n't let hundreds of millions of people go to those cities , let 's create some new cities that are run like those cities where large numbers of people could go .
as examples of possible charter cities you mention a canadian charter project in cuba , an australian project with indonesia or a project in india .
but how could a charter city work in the countries that really need help the most , i.e. the poorest countries in the world like eritrea or somalia ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hong kong is a well known historic example of a charter city the example of cuba and canada is not so much a literal proposal as a way to picture how this could work .
there happens to be a piece of land in cuba where by treaty cuba gave someone else the right to administer that land .
guantanamo bay is actually administered by the united states .
so countries like somalia or eritrea and other countries like that could sign treaties where relatively small pieces of land were assigned to other countries or perhaps a consortium of countries to set up new systems of rules there and create new cities in much the same way that the british created hong kong in a place where before they came no one lived .
for your concept to work , you need countries or private corporations to make large-scale investments .
those investors , of course , want to see a return on their investment .
how do you intend to attract investors for such a venture with an all but certain outcome , and on the other hand , how do you make sure that the investors are not merely trying to make a quick profit ?
this is why the rules are so important .
rules matter for families , because they want their children to be safe , they want to have a chance to get a job , they want rules that set up a good educational system .
but the rules also matter for investors .
a firm might come in and build a power system for a new city like this or build the infrastructure .
firms are quite willing to take market risks . what firms do not want to undertake is political risk , the risk that some government will just expropriate their property or suddenly enact policies that destroy the value of their investments .
so what the partner governments can do is make a credible commitment to rules that will remain in place for decades so that not only workers and families are attracted , but also investors and employers .
you 've been promoting the concept of charter cities since last year and have received lots of praise but also criticism for your idea .
has any country so far signed up to your idea ?
are there any concrete plans to develop the first charter city ?
there are preliminary conversations with various governments .
i tried this idea on possible participants in an arrangement like this and the reaction has been very positive .
the most surprising thing i 've learned is that the developing countries are very open to this idea .
they have seen how special zones were very effective development strategies - in china in particular - and they have seen how fast growth can take place when you get policy right .
china is now the new standard that countries are aspiring to and they are willing to try new things to get the kind of growth that they see in china .
-lsb- but -rsb- i think this would be an opportunity for governments that have not been as active on the world stage , including the government of germany , to really establish a whole new way of interacting with the rest of the world as a partner that could be distinctive and very beneficial .
what role could germany play in your concept of a charter city as a country with a comparatively brief colonial history ? one of the things that is interesting is that germany has relatively good ties with some of its former colonies , like namibia for example .
so as opposed to other countries where there is lingering resentment and bad feeling , there 's good feeling about the benefits that some of these countries receive from the german people .
so i think this good will is an asset that you could put to work in the future .
how has the development community reacted to your proposal , since you believe that the charter city could benefit more people across the globe than classical development aid can ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mauritius is considered a role model for the concept of a successful charter city i think the right way to describe it is that the reactions have been somewhat polarized .
on the one hand , there are many people who perceive the magnitude of the problem and the very slow pace of resolving that problem and who say your idea is very unusual and different , but it might be worth a try , because what we are doing right now is n't getting us where we want to go .
there are other people who are much more concerned , who say this is a very different approach , and it 's too risky , and we should n't try this .
but i think this gets the balance of the risks wrong .
i think the biggest risk is that we persist with the conditions that we now have in many parts of the world , where there are hundreds of millions of people who are desperate to go someplace where they can put their energies to work and create a better future for their children .
so i think there is very little risk in trying something different and we should be braver and we should have more imagination in solving this really pressing human problem .

he is one of the originators of the new growth theory and has been awarded the horst claus recktenwald prize in economics .
he was named one of the 25 most influential americans by time magazine .
he currently devotes all his time to his new project , " charter cities . "
deutsche welle : you have developed a new concept which you believe can reduce global poverty and empower underprivileged people better than traditional development policies can .
in a nutshell , what is your idea of the charter city ?
paul romer : one thing that we know works extremely well for raising standards of living and wages for people is to let them move from countries that have bad rules to countries that have better rules .
now there are n't that many spaces in countries with good rules to take hundreds of millions of people , so the charter city idea is to create places that have good quality rules where hundreds of millions of people could go .
you argue that a good system of rules as is found in most western societies is the key to economic prosperity and that such a rules-based system is attractive for people everywhere and therefore can basically be transplanted anywhere .
how do you respond to critics who say you underestimate cultural and historical factors , and that therefore charter cities may not be viable on a large scale ?
we know that people want access to these kinds of rule systems .
seven hundred million people around the world have said in response to survey questions that they would like to move permanently to a different country .
so people want this .
if you start with uninhabited land and invite people in to live under a new system of rules those rules can very quickly take hold and thrive .
another criticism of your idea of the charter city is that it is essentially colonialism revisited .
no one is forced to move or live in your charter city , and everyone is free to leave again , but essentially western countries are once again financing , setting up and running places where poor people can only come to sell their labor .
how do you counter that criticism ?
if you think about the question , picture someone from a very poor country , a family , a couple of young children , a father and a mother , and picture them moving to munich or zurich or vancouver .
we do n't think of that as colonial ; we think of that as something that gives them opportunities that they really want .
and this proposal is no more than saying if we ca n't let hundreds of millions of people go to those cities , let 's create some new cities that are run like those cities where large numbers of people could go .
as examples of possible charter cities you mention a canadian charter project in cuba , an australian project with indonesia or a project in india .
but how could a charter city work in the countries that really need help the most , i.e. the poorest countries in the world like eritrea or somalia ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hong kong is a well known historic example of a charter city the example of cuba and canada is not so much a literal proposal as a way to picture how this could work .
there happens to be a piece of land in cuba where by treaty cuba gave someone else the right to administer that land .
guantanamo bay is actually administered by the united states .
so countries like somalia or eritrea and other countries like that could sign treaties where relatively small pieces of land were assigned to other countries or perhaps a consortium of countries to set up new systems of rules there and create new cities in much the same way that the british created hong kong in a place where before they came no one lived .
for your concept to work , you need countries or private corporations to make large-scale investments .
those investors , of course , want to see a return on their investment .
how do you intend to attract investors for such a venture with an all but certain outcome , and on the other hand , how do you make sure that the investors are not merely trying to make a quick profit ?
this is why the rules are so important .
rules matter for families , because they want their children to be safe , they want to have a chance to get a job , they want rules that set up a good educational system .
but the rules also matter for investors .
a firm might come in and build a power system for a new city like this or build the infrastructure .
firms are quite willing to take market risks . what firms do not want to undertake is political risk , the risk that some government will just expropriate their property or suddenly enact policies that destroy the value of their investments .
so what the partner governments can do is make a credible commitment to rules that will remain in place for decades so that not only workers and families are attracted , but also investors and employers .
you 've been promoting the concept of charter cities since last year and have received lots of praise but also criticism for your idea .
has any country so far signed up to your idea ?
are there any concrete plans to develop the first charter city ?
there are preliminary conversations with various governments .
i tried this idea on possible participants in an arrangement like this and the reaction has been very positive .
the most surprising thing i 've learned is that the developing countries are very open to this idea .
they have seen how special zones were very effective development strategies - in china in particular - and they have seen how fast growth can take place when you get policy right .
china is now the new standard that countries are aspiring to and they are willing to try new things to get the kind of growth that they see in china .
-lsb- but -rsb- i think this would be an opportunity for governments that have not been as active on the world stage , including the government of germany , to really establish a whole new way of interacting with the rest of the world as a partner that could be distinctive and very beneficial .
what role could germany play in your concept of a charter city as a country with a comparatively brief colonial history ? one of the things that is interesting is that germany has relatively good ties with some of its former colonies , like namibia for example .
so as opposed to other countries where there is lingering resentment and bad feeling , there 's good feeling about the benefits that some of these countries receive from the german people .
so i think this good will is an asset that you could put to work in the future .
how has the development community reacted to your proposal , since you believe that the charter city could benefit more people across the globe than classical development aid can ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mauritius is considered a role model for the concept of a successful charter city i think the right way to describe it is that the reactions have been somewhat polarized .
on the one hand , there are many people who perceive the magnitude of the problem and the very slow pace of resolving that problem and who say your idea is very unusual and different , but it might be worth a try , because what we are doing right now is n't getting us where we want to go .
there are other people who are much more concerned , who say this is a very different approach , and it 's too risky , and we should n't try this .
but i think this gets the balance of the risks wrong .
i think the biggest risk is that we persist with the conditions that we now have in many parts of the world , where there are hundreds of millions of people who are desperate to go someplace where they can put their energies to work and create a better future for their children .
so i think there is very little risk in trying something different and we should be braver and we should have more imagination in solving this really pressing human problem .

but as the new coalition stumbles , the fdp must re-evaluate its agenda . germany 's free-market liberal democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- met on wednesday in stuttgart for their party meeting , held annually on january 6 .
the self-reflection session comes just a few months after the fdp joined the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- in a coalition government .
coalition negotiations between the two parties appeared to go smoothly and many of the fdp 's campaign promises made it into the coalition agreement .
the centerpiece of the policy blueprint was a plan to cut income taxes by 24 billion euros -lrb- $ 36 billion -rrb- and the parties agreed to pursue a simplification of the german tax system .
a difficult economy takes its toll but the reality of germany 's ongoing economic troubles have put a damper on the early excitement of the election .
politicians are beginning to voice their doubts , including bartholomaeus kalb , member of the cdu 's bavarian sister party the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- .
" we just wo n't have any money for tax relief or any additional expenditures for the foreseeable future , and by that i mean through the end of the legislative period , " wednesday 's edition of the financial times deutschland quoted kalb as saying .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's debt is set to continue to rise in 2010 the csu also held their annual party meeting on wednesday .
germany faces a ballooning budget deficit , with the 2010 budget approved by chancellor angela merkel 's cabinet calling for a record 85.8 billion euros in borrowed cash .
the european union has pressed germany to get its deficit under control .
as the party meets to discuss plans for 2010 , there 's been some backpedaling from fdp leaders , including economics minister rainer bruederle .
" it would be absolutely wrong to start off by cutting the budget , " he said on german radio .
fdp deputy party leader andreas pinkwart told the handelsblatt business daily this means that reaching the goals laid out in the coalition agreement might not happen for a few years .
" it 's enough if the complete 24 billion euros of relief is achieved in 2013 , " pinkwart said .
thus far only one tax cut of 8.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 123.1 billion -rrb- has been approved .
but he added that the restructuring of the tax system must begin this year .
the fdp had hoped to institute a three-tiered system with tax rates of 10 percent , 25 percent and 35 percent .
a new fdp ?
with the fdp no longer pushing for immediate tax relief , the meeting in stuttgart could give the free-market liberals the opportunity to redefine themselves .
the fdp 's current party platform dates back to 1997 and on the agenda wednesday is a discussion of a new platform .
when the daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung asked fdp secretary general christian lindner whether the fdp image as it now stands did n't fit the current times , lindner said the party 's mission is structurally sound .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even economics minister bruederle is n't calling for the cuts to take place right away " there 's no major need for revision of fdp positions , " he said .
" instead , it 's about evolution .
the new party platform is supposed to be worked on until 2012 .
we should take our time . "
but there are elements of the party that are already making changes .
the state of baden wuerttemberg 's fdp has already passed its own platform .
" when the disciplinary force of competition does not take hold … or is impeded by unfair conduct , the state has the mandate to regulate and intervene if necessary in the economy , " the new platform reads .

the fdp had hoped to institute a three-tiered system with tax rates of 10 percent , 25 percent and 35 percent .
a new fdp ?
with the fdp no longer pushing for immediate tax relief , the meeting in stuttgart could give the free-market liberals the opportunity to redefine themselves .
the fdp 's current party platform dates back to 1997 and on the agenda wednesday is a discussion of a new platform .
when the daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung asked fdp secretary general christian lindner whether the fdp image as it now stands did n't fit the current times , lindner said the party 's mission is structurally sound .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even economics minister bruederle is n't calling for the cuts to take place right away " there 's no major need for revision of fdp positions , " he said .
" instead , it 's about evolution .
the new party platform is supposed to be worked on until 2012 .
we should take our time . "
but there are elements of the party that are already making changes .
the state of baden wuerttemberg 's fdp has already passed its own platform .
" when the disciplinary force of competition does not take hold … or is impeded by unfair conduct , the state has the mandate to regulate and intervene if necessary in the economy , " the new platform reads .

but as the new coalition stumbles , the fdp must re-evaluate its agenda . germany 's free-market liberal democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- met on wednesday in stuttgart for their party meeting , held annually on january 6 .
the self-reflection session comes just a few months after the fdp joined the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- in a coalition government .
coalition negotiations between the two parties appeared to go smoothly and many of the fdp 's campaign promises made it into the coalition agreement .
the centerpiece of the policy blueprint was a plan to cut income taxes by 24 billion euros -lrb- $ 36 billion -rrb- and the parties agreed to pursue a simplification of the german tax system .
a difficult economy takes its toll but the reality of germany 's ongoing economic troubles have put a damper on the early excitement of the election .
politicians are beginning to voice their doubts , including bartholomaeus kalb , member of the cdu 's bavarian sister party the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- .
" we just wo n't have any money for tax relief or any additional expenditures for the foreseeable future , and by that i mean through the end of the legislative period , " wednesday 's edition of the financial times deutschland quoted kalb as saying .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's debt is set to continue to rise in 2010 the csu also held their annual party meeting on wednesday .
germany faces a ballooning budget deficit , with the 2010 budget approved by chancellor angela merkel 's cabinet calling for a record 85.8 billion euros in borrowed cash .
the european union has pressed germany to get its deficit under control .
as the party meets to discuss plans for 2010 , there 's been some backpedaling from fdp leaders , including economics minister rainer bruederle .
" it would be absolutely wrong to start off by cutting the budget , " he said on german radio .
fdp deputy party leader andreas pinkwart told the handelsblatt business daily this means that reaching the goals laid out in the coalition agreement might not happen for a few years .
" it 's enough if the complete 24 billion euros of relief is achieved in 2013 , " pinkwart said .
thus far only one tax cut of 8.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 123.1 billion -rrb- has been approved .
but he added that the restructuring of the tax system must begin this year .
the fdp had hoped to institute a three-tiered system with tax rates of 10 percent , 25 percent and 35 percent .

but loud words seemed to rule the day at separate strategy meetings of the fdp and csu . the snow-covered hilltops of the southern german region around wildbad kreuth convey the impression of a place full of bliss and harmony .
but these days , harmony is solely left to mother nature .
everyone who matters in bavaria 's christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- - the sister party of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- - has flocked to the palace-like building at kreuth .
firing broadsides at both friend and foe has become an entertaining tradition at the csu 's three-day strategy meeting .
tax policies under fire the saber-rattling started wednesday morning , when csu head horst seehofer said his party had no reason to feel humble just because it had lost its absolute majority support in bavaria for the first time in its history .
seehofer attacked the free democrats ' -lrb- fdp -rrb- resolve to allow for 24 billion euros -lrb- $ 34.5 billion -rrb- in tax reductions as of 2011 despite the country facing record public debts , to be further increased by astronomic fresh borrowing this year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : csu head horst seehofer sees no reason to feel humble " i 'm sure the fdp will still learn what it means to assume government responsibility , " seehofer quipped in a statement directed at the conservatives ' coalition partner in berlin .
at their own gathering in stuttgart on wednesday , the pro-business fdp did n't wait long before responding to the verbal attack .
fdp floor leader birgit homburger said it was strange that the csu was so forgetful .
she recalled that all sides had agreed on tax reductions during coalition talks last year .
" we looked very hard at where taxes could be lowered and what measures could be financed and justified .
so why 's so much fuss being made about it now ? " , homburger asked in stuttgart .
body scanners not to everyone 's liking but tax policies are not the only bone of contention that berlin 's coalition partners almost seem to choke on these days .
there 's a controversy about whether or not body scanners should be used at german airports to increase security , with the fdp being far more concerned about any potential dignity issues than chancellor merkel 's conservatives .
and at least two foreign policy issues have shown time and again that the coalition partners are far from speaking with one voice .
number one is afghanistan , and with it the debate over whether germany should send in thousands of more troops in line with us president barack obama 's request to nato allies .

steinbach angered poland by not accepting the bilateral border treaty after german unification in 1990 .
her initial resolve to become a board member of a museum for european expellees has also caused an outcry in warsaw .

but loud words seemed to rule the day at separate strategy meetings of the fdp and csu . the snow-covered hilltops of the southern german region around wildbad kreuth convey the impression of a place full of bliss and harmony .
but these days , harmony is solely left to mother nature .
everyone who matters in bavaria 's christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- - the sister party of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- - has flocked to the palace-like building at kreuth .
firing broadsides at both friend and foe has become an entertaining tradition at the csu 's three-day strategy meeting .
tax policies under fire the saber-rattling started wednesday morning , when csu head horst seehofer said his party had no reason to feel humble just because it had lost its absolute majority support in bavaria for the first time in its history .
seehofer attacked the free democrats ' -lrb- fdp -rrb- resolve to allow for 24 billion euros -lrb- $ 34.5 billion -rrb- in tax reductions as of 2011 despite the country facing record public debts , to be further increased by astronomic fresh borrowing this year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : csu head horst seehofer sees no reason to feel humble " i 'm sure the fdp will still learn what it means to assume government responsibility , " seehofer quipped in a statement directed at the conservatives ' coalition partner in berlin .
at their own gathering in stuttgart on wednesday , the pro-business fdp did n't wait long before responding to the verbal attack .
fdp floor leader birgit homburger said it was strange that the csu was so forgetful .
she recalled that all sides had agreed on tax reductions during coalition talks last year .
" we looked very hard at where taxes could be lowered and what measures could be financed and justified .
so why 's so much fuss being made about it now ? " , homburger asked in stuttgart .
body scanners not to everyone 's liking but tax policies are not the only bone of contention that berlin 's coalition partners almost seem to choke on these days .
there 's a controversy about whether or not body scanners should be used at german airports to increase security , with the fdp being far more concerned about any potential dignity issues than chancellor merkel 's conservatives .
and at least two foreign policy issues have shown time and again that the coalition partners are far from speaking with one voice .
number one is afghanistan , and with it the debate over whether germany should send in thousands of more troops in line with us president barack obama 's request to nato allies .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erika steinbach remains a controversial figure and then there 's the unresolved question of how to deal with erika steinbach , who heads germany 's federation of expellees -lrb- bdv -rrb- , a group which represents germans expelled from eastern europe after 1945 .
steinbach angered poland by not accepting the bilateral border treaty after german unification in 1990 .
her initial resolve to become a board member of a museum for european expellees has also caused an outcry in warsaw .

with budget deficits a problem across the bloc , member nations said the 3.7-percent raise was too high . the european commission officially decided to take european union member states to court over their refusal to accept a 3.7-percent pay raise for eu employees , announced commission spokeswoman pia ahrenkilde hansen on wednesday in brussels .
the decision was unanimously made by the 27 commissioners , hansen said .
the court complaint pits the european council , which is the collective entity for the 27 member states , against the commission , the bloc 's executive , in the luxembourg-based european court of justice .
it 's a battle that may prove embarrassing to the eu at a time when the bloc is attempting to rebrand itself after passing the lisbon reform treaty .
formula determines salaries the salaries of eu bureaucrats are calculated with a complex and legally binding formula that incorporates pay levels in brussels and eight of the eu 's wealthiest countries .

with budget deficits a problem across the bloc , member nations said the 3.7-percent raise was too high . the european commission officially decided to take european union member states to court over their refusal to accept a 3.7-percent pay raise for eu employees , announced commission spokeswoman pia ahrenkilde hansen on wednesday in brussels .
the decision was unanimously made by the 27 commissioners , hansen said .
the court complaint pits the european council , which is the collective entity for the 27 member states , against the commission , the bloc 's executive , in the luxembourg-based european court of justice .
it 's a battle that may prove embarrassing to the eu at a time when the bloc is attempting to rebrand itself after passing the lisbon reform treaty .
formula determines salaries the salaries of eu bureaucrats are calculated with a complex and legally binding formula that incorporates pay levels in brussels and eight of the eu 's wealthiest countries .

" the commission hopes that an acceptable solution for all the parties concerned will be found , " a spokesman in brussels said .
but he added that it is mainly an issue between iceland , the uk and the netherlands as it concerns compensation for uk and dutch depositors in icesave accounts .
on tuesday , iceland 's president olafur ragnar grimsson blocked an unpopular but previously approved bank compensation plan for foreign investors in his country 's failed banks .

the north caucasus has seen a rise in violence in the past year . a suicide bomb attack in dagestan , in the north caucasus , killed six police officers and injured at least 10 others on wednesday , with dagestan 's emergency medical center saying those numbers were likely to rise .
the attacker , reportedly driving a car packed with explosives , blew himself up outside traffic police headquarters in makhachkala , the capital of the russian republic .
makhachkala 's police chief said the bomber detonated the explosives at the gates to the station after a squad car had prevented him from driving through .
" the officers gave their lives to prevent a terrorist attack with an even greater number of victims , " a police official told the russian interfax news agency .
russia 's predominantly muslim republics in the north caucasus have seen a sharp rise in violence in the past year , with many of the attacks targeting pro-kremlin police and russian security forces .
wednesday 's bombing was similar to an august bombing in a neighboring republic that killed 24 people and injured more than 200. glb / afp / ap editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but loud words seemed to rule the day at separate strategy meetings of the fdp and csu . the snow-covered hilltops of the southern german region around wildbad kreuth convey the impression of a place full of bliss and harmony .
but these days , harmony is solely left to mother nature .
everyone who matters in bavaria 's christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- - the sister party of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- - has flocked to the palace-like building at kreuth .
firing broadsides at both friend and foe has become an entertaining tradition at the csu 's three-day strategy meeting .
tax policies under fire the saber-rattling started wednesday morning , when csu head horst seehofer said his party had no reason to feel humble just because it had lost its absolute majority support in bavaria for the first time in its history .
seehofer attacked the free democrats ' -lrb- fdp -rrb- resolve to allow for 24 billion euros -lrb- $ 34.5 billion -rrb- in tax reductions as of 2011 despite the country facing record public debts , to be further increased by astronomic fresh borrowing this year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : csu head horst seehofer sees no reason to feel humble " i 'm sure the fdp will still learn what it means to assume government responsibility , " seehofer quipped in a statement directed at the conservatives ' coalition partner in berlin .
at their own gathering in stuttgart on wednesday , the pro-business fdp did n't wait long before responding to the verbal attack .
fdp floor leader birgit homburger said it was strange that the csu was so forgetful .
she recalled that all sides had agreed on tax reductions during coalition talks last year .
" we looked very hard at where taxes could be lowered and what measures could be financed and justified .
so why 's so much fuss being made about it now ? " , homburger asked in stuttgart .
body scanners not to everyone 's liking but tax policies are not the only bone of contention that berlin 's coalition partners almost seem to choke on these days .
there 's a controversy about whether or not body scanners should be used at german airports to increase security , with the fdp being far more concerned about any potential dignity issues than chancellor merkel 's conservatives .
and at least two foreign policy issues have shown time and again that the coalition partners are far from speaking with one voice .
number one is afghanistan , and with it the debate over whether germany should send in thousands of more troops in line with us president barack obama 's request to nato allies .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erika steinbach remains a controversial figure and then there 's the unresolved question of how to deal with erika steinbach , who heads germany 's federation of expellees -lrb- bdv -rrb- , a group which represents germans expelled from eastern europe after 1945 .
steinbach angered poland by not accepting the bilateral border treaty after german unification in 1990 .
her initial resolve to become a board member of a museum for european expellees has also caused an outcry in warsaw .
the conservatives and the fdp seem divided over how to deal with steinbach 's recent proposal to renounce the post in return for boosting the federation of expellees ' say in the museum work. hg / dpa / reuters / ap editor : trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but loud words seemed to rule the day at separate strategy meetings of the fdp and csu . the snow-covered hilltops of the southern german region around wildbad kreuth convey the impression of a place full of bliss and harmony .
but these days , harmony is solely left to mother nature .
everyone who matters in bavaria 's christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- - the sister party of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- - has flocked to the palace-like building at kreuth .
firing broadsides at both friend and foe has become an entertaining tradition at the csu 's three-day strategy meeting .
tax policies under fire the saber-rattling started wednesday morning , when csu head horst seehofer said his party had no reason to feel humble just because it had lost its absolute majority support in bavaria for the first time in its history .
seehofer attacked the free democrats ' -lrb- fdp -rrb- resolve to allow for 24 billion euros -lrb- $ 34.5 billion -rrb- in tax reductions as of 2011 despite the country facing record public debts , to be further increased by astronomic fresh borrowing this year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : csu head horst seehofer sees no reason to feel humble " i 'm sure the fdp will still learn what it means to assume government responsibility , " seehofer quipped in a statement directed at the conservatives ' coalition partner in berlin .
at their own gathering in stuttgart on wednesday , the pro-business fdp did n't wait long before responding to the verbal attack .
fdp floor leader birgit homburger said it was strange that the csu was so forgetful .
she recalled that all sides had agreed on tax reductions during coalition talks last year .
" we looked very hard at where taxes could be lowered and what measures could be financed and justified .
so why 's so much fuss being made about it now ? " , homburger asked in stuttgart .
body scanners not to everyone 's liking but tax policies are not the only bone of contention that berlin 's coalition partners almost seem to choke on these days .
there 's a controversy about whether or not body scanners should be used at german airports to increase security , with the fdp being far more concerned about any potential dignity issues than chancellor merkel 's conservatives .

the self-reflection session comes just a few months after the fdp joined the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- in a coalition government .
coalition negotiations between the two parties appeared to go smoothly and many of the fdp 's campaign promises made it into the coalition agreement .
the centerpiece of the policy blueprint was a plan to cut income taxes by 24 billion euros -lrb- $ 36 billion -rrb- and the parties agreed to pursue a simplification of the german tax system .
a difficult economy takes its toll but the reality of germany 's ongoing economic troubles have put a damper on the early excitement of the election .
politicians are beginning to voice their doubts , including bartholomaeus kalb , member of the cdu 's bavarian sister party the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- .
" we just wo n't have any money for tax relief or any additional expenditures for the foreseeable future , and by that i mean through the end of the legislative period , " wednesday 's edition of the financial times deutschland quoted kalb as saying .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's debt is set to continue to rise in 2010 the csu also held their annual party meeting on wednesday .
germany faces a ballooning budget deficit , with the 2010 budget approved by chancellor angela merkel 's cabinet calling for a record 85.8 billion euros in borrowed cash .
the european union has pressed germany to get its deficit under control .
as the party meets to discuss plans for 2010 , there 's been some backpedaling from fdp leaders , including economics minister rainer bruederle .
" it would be absolutely wrong to start off by cutting the budget , " he said on german radio .
fdp deputy party leader andreas pinkwart told the handelsblatt business daily this means that reaching the goals laid out in the coalition agreement might not happen for a few years .
" it 's enough if the complete 24 billion euros of relief is achieved in 2013 , " pinkwart said .
thus far only one tax cut of 8.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 123.1 billion -rrb- has been approved .
but he added that the restructuring of the tax system must begin this year .
the fdp had hoped to institute a three-tiered system with tax rates of 10 percent , 25 percent and 35 percent .
a new fdp ?
with the fdp no longer pushing for immediate tax relief , the meeting in stuttgart could give the free-market liberals the opportunity to redefine themselves .
the fdp 's current party platform dates back to 1997 and on the agenda wednesday is a discussion of a new platform .
when the daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung asked fdp secretary general christian lindner whether the fdp image as it now stands did n't fit the current times , lindner said the party 's mission is structurally sound .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even economics minister bruederle is n't calling for the cuts to take place right away " there 's no major need for revision of fdp positions , " he said .
" instead , it 's about evolution .
the new party platform is supposed to be worked on until 2012 .
we should take our time . "
but there are elements of the party that are already making changes .
the state of baden wuerttemberg 's fdp has already passed its own platform .
" when the disciplinary force of competition does not take hold … or is impeded by unfair conduct , the state has the mandate to regulate and intervene if necessary in the economy , " the new platform reads .

" the commission hopes that an acceptable solution for all the parties concerned will be found , " a spokesman in brussels said .
but he added that it is mainly an issue between iceland , the uk and the netherlands as it concerns compensation for uk and dutch depositors in icesave accounts .
on tuesday , iceland 's president olafur ragnar grimsson blocked an unpopular but previously approved bank compensation plan for foreign investors in his country 's failed banks .
iceland was to pay $ 5.4 billion -lrb- 3.8 billion euros -rrb- in compensation to britain and the netherlands , the nations that had stepped in to compensate their own citizens who lost money when the icesave bank collapsed .
icesave was operated by landesbanki , which collapsed in the fall of 2008 .
but over the weekend , grimsson received a petition signed by nearly a quarter of the icelandic voters protesting against the icesave compensation bill .
on tuesday , the president announced he would not sign the bill , but instead , in accordance with the constitution , submit the plan for a referendum .
britain threatens to withdraw its backing while a poll on wednesday showed that more than half of icelanders supported the president 's decision , his announcement sparked anger in london and the hague , where government officials urged reykjavik to meet its international obligations .
britain 's financial services minister paul myners said controversy over the compensation deal could impact on britain 's support for iceland 's eu bid .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iceland was hard-hit by the international financial crisis hoping to stabilize the economy following the collapse of its financial sector , iceland 's parliament voted last year to begin a process that could eventually lead to its membership in the eu .
meanwhile , the us rating agency standard and poor 's said wednesday it has put icelandic debt under negative credit watch .
the agency said that the icelandic president 's refusal to sign the bill could undermine support from the international monetary fund .
on tuesday , another credit rating agency , fitch , downgraded iceland 's long-term debt rating due to what it termed a renewed wave of domestic political , economic and financial uncertainty .
iceland 's parliament will meet friday to discuss the referendum. db / ap / afp / reuters / dpa editor : trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but as the new coalition stumbles , the fdp must re-evaluate its agenda . germany 's free-market liberal democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- met on wednesday in stuttgart for their party meeting , held annually on january 6 .
the self-reflection session comes just a few months after the fdp joined the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- in a coalition government .
coalition negotiations between the two parties appeared to go smoothly and many of the fdp 's campaign promises made it into the coalition agreement .
the centerpiece of the policy blueprint was a plan to cut income taxes by 24 billion euros -lrb- $ 36 billion -rrb- and the parties agreed to pursue a simplification of the german tax system .
a difficult economy takes its toll but the reality of germany 's ongoing economic troubles have put a damper on the early excitement of the election .
politicians are beginning to voice their doubts , including bartholomaeus kalb , member of the cdu 's bavarian sister party the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- .
" we just wo n't have any money for tax relief or any additional expenditures for the foreseeable future , and by that i mean through the end of the legislative period , " wednesday 's edition of the financial times deutschland quoted kalb as saying .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's debt is set to continue to rise in 2010 the csu also held their annual party meeting on wednesday .
germany faces a ballooning budget deficit , with the 2010 budget approved by chancellor angela merkel 's cabinet calling for a record 85.8 billion euros in borrowed cash .
the european union has pressed germany to get its deficit under control .
as the party meets to discuss plans for 2010 , there 's been some backpedaling from fdp leaders , including economics minister rainer bruederle .
" it would be absolutely wrong to start off by cutting the budget , " he said on german radio .
fdp deputy party leader andreas pinkwart told the handelsblatt business daily this means that reaching the goals laid out in the coalition agreement might not happen for a few years .
" it 's enough if the complete 24 billion euros of relief is achieved in 2013 , " pinkwart said .
thus far only one tax cut of 8.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 123.1 billion -rrb- has been approved .
but he added that the restructuring of the tax system must begin this year .
the fdp had hoped to institute a three-tiered system with tax rates of 10 percent , 25 percent and 35 percent .
a new fdp ?
with the fdp no longer pushing for immediate tax relief , the meeting in stuttgart could give the free-market liberals the opportunity to redefine themselves .
the fdp 's current party platform dates back to 1997 and on the agenda wednesday is a discussion of a new platform .
when the daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung asked fdp secretary general christian lindner whether the fdp image as it now stands did n't fit the current times , lindner said the party 's mission is structurally sound .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even economics minister bruederle is n't calling for the cuts to take place right away " there 's no major need for revision of fdp positions , " he said .
" instead , it 's about evolution .
the new party platform is supposed to be worked on until 2012 .
we should take our time . "
but there are elements of the party that are already making changes .
the state of baden wuerttemberg 's fdp has already passed its own platform .
" when the disciplinary force of competition does not take hold … or is impeded by unfair conduct , the state has the mandate to regulate and intervene if necessary in the economy , " the new platform reads .

the fdp had hoped to institute a three-tiered system with tax rates of 10 percent , 25 percent and 35 percent .
a new fdp ?
with the fdp no longer pushing for immediate tax relief , the meeting in stuttgart could give the free-market liberals the opportunity to redefine themselves .
the fdp 's current party platform dates back to 1997 and on the agenda wednesday is a discussion of a new platform .
when the daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung asked fdp secretary general christian lindner whether the fdp image as it now stands did n't fit the current times , lindner said the party 's mission is structurally sound .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even economics minister bruederle is n't calling for the cuts to take place right away " there 's no major need for revision of fdp positions , " he said .
" instead , it 's about evolution .
the new party platform is supposed to be worked on until 2012 .
we should take our time . "
but there are elements of the party that are already making changes .
the state of baden wuerttemberg 's fdp has already passed its own platform .
" when the disciplinary force of competition does not take hold … or is impeded by unfair conduct , the state has the mandate to regulate and intervene if necessary in the economy , " the new platform reads .

" today the leadership of the ulster defence association can confirm that all weaponry under its control has been put verifiably beyond use , " said uda political representative frankie gallagher .
the disarmament was verified by two independent witnesses , the former church of ireland primate , robin eames , and the former chairman of the ulster bank , george quigley .
irish prime minister brian cowen welcomed the uda 's announcement as " a further significant milestone in the peace process . "
the loyalist protestant uda was responsible for about 400 murders between 1971 and 2001 in its fight with the catholic irish republican army , who wanted northern ireland to merge with the republic of ireland in the south. mk / dpa / afp editor : trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the north caucasus has seen a rise in violence in the past year . a suicide bomb attack in dagestan , in the north caucasus , killed six police officers and injured at least 10 others on wednesday , with dagestan 's emergency medical center saying those numbers were likely to rise .
the attacker , reportedly driving a car packed with explosives , blew himself up outside traffic police headquarters in makhachkala , the capital of the russian republic .
makhachkala 's police chief said the bomber detonated the explosives at the gates to the station after a squad car had prevented him from driving through .
" the officers gave their lives to prevent a terrorist attack with an even greater number of victims , " a police official told the russian interfax news agency .
russia 's predominantly muslim republics in the north caucasus have seen a sharp rise in violence in the past year , with many of the attacks targeting pro-kremlin police and russian security forces .
wednesday 's bombing was similar to an august bombing in a neighboring republic that killed 24 people and injured more than 200. glb / afp / ap editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he is one of the originators of the new growth theory and has been awarded the horst claus recktenwald prize in economics .
he was named one of the 25 most influential americans by time magazine .
he currently devotes all his time to his new project , " charter cities . "
deutsche welle : you have developed a new concept which you believe can reduce global poverty and empower underprivileged people better than traditional development policies can .
in a nutshell , what is your idea of the charter city ?
paul romer : one thing that we know works extremely well for raising standards of living and wages for people is to let them move from countries that have bad rules to countries that have better rules .
now there are n't that many spaces in countries with good rules to take hundreds of millions of people , so the charter city idea is to create places that have good quality rules where hundreds of millions of people could go .
you argue that a good system of rules as is found in most western societies is the key to economic prosperity and that such a rules-based system is attractive for people everywhere and therefore can basically be transplanted anywhere .
how do you respond to critics who say you underestimate cultural and historical factors , and that therefore charter cities may not be viable on a large scale ?
we know that people want access to these kinds of rule systems .
seven hundred million people around the world have said in response to survey questions that they would like to move permanently to a different country .
so people want this .
if you start with uninhabited land and invite people in to live under a new system of rules those rules can very quickly take hold and thrive .
another criticism of your idea of the charter city is that it is essentially colonialism revisited .
no one is forced to move or live in your charter city , and everyone is free to leave again , but essentially western countries are once again financing , setting up and running places where poor people can only come to sell their labor .
how do you counter that criticism ?
if you think about the question , picture someone from a very poor country , a family , a couple of young children , a father and a mother , and picture them moving to munich or zurich or vancouver .
we do n't think of that as colonial ; we think of that as something that gives them opportunities that they really want .
and this proposal is no more than saying if we ca n't let hundreds of millions of people go to those cities , let 's create some new cities that are run like those cities where large numbers of people could go .
as examples of possible charter cities you mention a canadian charter project in cuba , an australian project with indonesia or a project in india .
but how could a charter city work in the countries that really need help the most , i.e. the poorest countries in the world like eritrea or somalia ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hong kong is a well known historic example of a charter city the example of cuba and canada is not so much a literal proposal as a way to picture how this could work .
there happens to be a piece of land in cuba where by treaty cuba gave someone else the right to administer that land .
guantanamo bay is actually administered by the united states .
so countries like somalia or eritrea and other countries like that could sign treaties where relatively small pieces of land were assigned to other countries or perhaps a consortium of countries to set up new systems of rules there and create new cities in much the same way that the british created hong kong in a place where before they came no one lived .
for your concept to work , you need countries or private corporations to make large-scale investments .
those investors , of course , want to see a return on their investment .
how do you intend to attract investors for such a venture with an all but certain outcome , and on the other hand , how do you make sure that the investors are not merely trying to make a quick profit ?
this is why the rules are so important .
rules matter for families , because they want their children to be safe , they want to have a chance to get a job , they want rules that set up a good educational system .
but the rules also matter for investors .
a firm might come in and build a power system for a new city like this or build the infrastructure .
firms are quite willing to take market risks . what firms do not want to undertake is political risk , the risk that some government will just expropriate their property or suddenly enact policies that destroy the value of their investments .
so what the partner governments can do is make a credible commitment to rules that will remain in place for decades so that not only workers and families are attracted , but also investors and employers .
you 've been promoting the concept of charter cities since last year and have received lots of praise but also criticism for your idea .
has any country so far signed up to your idea ?
are there any concrete plans to develop the first charter city ?
there are preliminary conversations with various governments .
i tried this idea on possible participants in an arrangement like this and the reaction has been very positive .
the most surprising thing i 've learned is that the developing countries are very open to this idea .
they have seen how special zones were very effective development strategies - in china in particular - and they have seen how fast growth can take place when you get policy right .
china is now the new standard that countries are aspiring to and they are willing to try new things to get the kind of growth that they see in china .
-lsb- but -rsb- i think this would be an opportunity for governments that have not been as active on the world stage , including the government of germany , to really establish a whole new way of interacting with the rest of the world as a partner that could be distinctive and very beneficial .
what role could germany play in your concept of a charter city as a country with a comparatively brief colonial history ? one of the things that is interesting is that germany has relatively good ties with some of its former colonies , like namibia for example .
so as opposed to other countries where there is lingering resentment and bad feeling , there 's good feeling about the benefits that some of these countries receive from the german people .
so i think this good will is an asset that you could put to work in the future .
how has the development community reacted to your proposal , since you believe that the charter city could benefit more people across the globe than classical development aid can ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mauritius is considered a role model for the concept of a successful charter city i think the right way to describe it is that the reactions have been somewhat polarized .
on the one hand , there are many people who perceive the magnitude of the problem and the very slow pace of resolving that problem and who say your idea is very unusual and different , but it might be worth a try , because what we are doing right now is n't getting us where we want to go .
there are other people who are much more concerned , who say this is a very different approach , and it 's too risky , and we should n't try this .
but i think this gets the balance of the risks wrong .
i think the biggest risk is that we persist with the conditions that we now have in many parts of the world , where there are hundreds of millions of people who are desperate to go someplace where they can put their energies to work and create a better future for their children .
so i think there is very little risk in trying something different and we should be braver and we should have more imagination in solving this really pressing human problem .

he is one of the originators of the new growth theory and has been awarded the horst claus recktenwald prize in economics .
he was named one of the 25 most influential americans by time magazine .
he currently devotes all his time to his new project , " charter cities . "
deutsche welle : you have developed a new concept which you believe can reduce global poverty and empower underprivileged people better than traditional development policies can .
in a nutshell , what is your idea of the charter city ?
paul romer : one thing that we know works extremely well for raising standards of living and wages for people is to let them move from countries that have bad rules to countries that have better rules .
now there are n't that many spaces in countries with good rules to take hundreds of millions of people , so the charter city idea is to create places that have good quality rules where hundreds of millions of people could go .
you argue that a good system of rules as is found in most western societies is the key to economic prosperity and that such a rules-based system is attractive for people everywhere and therefore can basically be transplanted anywhere .
how do you respond to critics who say you underestimate cultural and historical factors , and that therefore charter cities may not be viable on a large scale ?
we know that people want access to these kinds of rule systems .
seven hundred million people around the world have said in response to survey questions that they would like to move permanently to a different country .
so people want this .
if you start with uninhabited land and invite people in to live under a new system of rules those rules can very quickly take hold and thrive .
another criticism of your idea of the charter city is that it is essentially colonialism revisited .
no one is forced to move or live in your charter city , and everyone is free to leave again , but essentially western countries are once again financing , setting up and running places where poor people can only come to sell their labor .
how do you counter that criticism ?
if you think about the question , picture someone from a very poor country , a family , a couple of young children , a father and a mother , and picture them moving to munich or zurich or vancouver .
we do n't think of that as colonial ; we think of that as something that gives them opportunities that they really want .
and this proposal is no more than saying if we ca n't let hundreds of millions of people go to those cities , let 's create some new cities that are run like those cities where large numbers of people could go .
as examples of possible charter cities you mention a canadian charter project in cuba , an australian project with indonesia or a project in india .
but how could a charter city work in the countries that really need help the most , i.e. the poorest countries in the world like eritrea or somalia ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hong kong is a well known historic example of a charter city the example of cuba and canada is not so much a literal proposal as a way to picture how this could work .
there happens to be a piece of land in cuba where by treaty cuba gave someone else the right to administer that land .
guantanamo bay is actually administered by the united states .
so countries like somalia or eritrea and other countries like that could sign treaties where relatively small pieces of land were assigned to other countries or perhaps a consortium of countries to set up new systems of rules there and create new cities in much the same way that the british created hong kong in a place where before they came no one lived .

china is now the new standard that countries are aspiring to and they are willing to try new things to get the kind of growth that they see in china .
-lsb- but -rsb- i think this would be an opportunity for governments that have not been as active on the world stage , including the government of germany , to really establish a whole new way of interacting with the rest of the world as a partner that could be distinctive and very beneficial .
what role could germany play in your concept of a charter city as a country with a comparatively brief colonial history ? one of the things that is interesting is that germany has relatively good ties with some of its former colonies , like namibia for example .
so as opposed to other countries where there is lingering resentment and bad feeling , there 's good feeling about the benefits that some of these countries receive from the german people .
so i think this good will is an asset that you could put to work in the future .
how has the development community reacted to your proposal , since you believe that the charter city could benefit more people across the globe than classical development aid can ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mauritius is considered a role model for the concept of a successful charter city i think the right way to describe it is that the reactions have been somewhat polarized .
on the one hand , there are many people who perceive the magnitude of the problem and the very slow pace of resolving that problem and who say your idea is very unusual and different , but it might be worth a try , because what we are doing right now is n't getting us where we want to go .
there are other people who are much more concerned , who say this is a very different approach , and it 's too risky , and we should n't try this .
but i think this gets the balance of the risks wrong .
i think the biggest risk is that we persist with the conditions that we now have in many parts of the world , where there are hundreds of millions of people who are desperate to go someplace where they can put their energies to work and create a better future for their children .
so i think there is very little risk in trying something different and we should be braver and we should have more imagination in solving this really pressing human problem .

he is one of the originators of the new growth theory and has been awarded the horst claus recktenwald prize in economics .
he was named one of the 25 most influential americans by time magazine .
he currently devotes all his time to his new project , " charter cities . "
deutsche welle : you have developed a new concept which you believe can reduce global poverty and empower underprivileged people better than traditional development policies can .
in a nutshell , what is your idea of the charter city ?
paul romer : one thing that we know works extremely well for raising standards of living and wages for people is to let them move from countries that have bad rules to countries that have better rules .
now there are n't that many spaces in countries with good rules to take hundreds of millions of people , so the charter city idea is to create places that have good quality rules where hundreds of millions of people could go .
you argue that a good system of rules as is found in most western societies is the key to economic prosperity and that such a rules-based system is attractive for people everywhere and therefore can basically be transplanted anywhere .
how do you respond to critics who say you underestimate cultural and historical factors , and that therefore charter cities may not be viable on a large scale ?
we know that people want access to these kinds of rule systems .
seven hundred million people around the world have said in response to survey questions that they would like to move permanently to a different country .
so people want this .
if you start with uninhabited land and invite people in to live under a new system of rules those rules can very quickly take hold and thrive .
another criticism of your idea of the charter city is that it is essentially colonialism revisited .
no one is forced to move or live in your charter city , and everyone is free to leave again , but essentially western countries are once again financing , setting up and running places where poor people can only come to sell their labor .
how do you counter that criticism ?
if you think about the question , picture someone from a very poor country , a family , a couple of young children , a father and a mother , and picture them moving to munich or zurich or vancouver .
we do n't think of that as colonial ; we think of that as something that gives them opportunities that they really want .
and this proposal is no more than saying if we ca n't let hundreds of millions of people go to those cities , let 's create some new cities that are run like those cities where large numbers of people could go .
as examples of possible charter cities you mention a canadian charter project in cuba , an australian project with indonesia or a project in india .
but how could a charter city work in the countries that really need help the most , i.e. the poorest countries in the world like eritrea or somalia ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hong kong is a well known historic example of a charter city the example of cuba and canada is not so much a literal proposal as a way to picture how this could work .
there happens to be a piece of land in cuba where by treaty cuba gave someone else the right to administer that land .
guantanamo bay is actually administered by the united states .
so countries like somalia or eritrea and other countries like that could sign treaties where relatively small pieces of land were assigned to other countries or perhaps a consortium of countries to set up new systems of rules there and create new cities in much the same way that the british created hong kong in a place where before they came no one lived .
for your concept to work , you need countries or private corporations to make large-scale investments .
those investors , of course , want to see a return on their investment .
how do you intend to attract investors for such a venture with an all but certain outcome , and on the other hand , how do you make sure that the investors are not merely trying to make a quick profit ?
this is why the rules are so important .
rules matter for families , because they want their children to be safe , they want to have a chance to get a job , they want rules that set up a good educational system .
but the rules also matter for investors .
a firm might come in and build a power system for a new city like this or build the infrastructure .
firms are quite willing to take market risks . what firms do not want to undertake is political risk , the risk that some government will just expropriate their property or suddenly enact policies that destroy the value of their investments .
so what the partner governments can do is make a credible commitment to rules that will remain in place for decades so that not only workers and families are attracted , but also investors and employers .
you 've been promoting the concept of charter cities since last year and have received lots of praise but also criticism for your idea .
has any country so far signed up to your idea ?
are there any concrete plans to develop the first charter city ?
there are preliminary conversations with various governments .
i tried this idea on possible participants in an arrangement like this and the reaction has been very positive .
the most surprising thing i 've learned is that the developing countries are very open to this idea .
they have seen how special zones were very effective development strategies - in china in particular - and they have seen how fast growth can take place when you get policy right .
china is now the new standard that countries are aspiring to and they are willing to try new things to get the kind of growth that they see in china .

" i want to hear from the bishop herself how she came to her opinion , " guttenberg told the leipziger volkszeitung newspaper , after kaessmann called for a concrete plan for a withdrawal of troops .
the two are due to meet on january 11 .
in an interview she gave at christmas , kaessmann said , " this war is not justifiable , even by the broadest possible standards of the german protestant church . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guttenberg is keen to hear kaessmann 's views firsthand in a statement released by her office on tuesday , kaessmann welcomed the chance to speak to guttenberg and said she intended to discuss " the ethical position of the protestant church and the government 's afghanistan policy " with the minister .
comments clarified kaessmann also clarified her comments , saying she had never called for an immediate troop withdrawal , but rather for a " clear plan " for withdrawal .
ruprecht polenz , of the ruling christian democratic union , welcomed kaessmann 's revised statement .
" i 'm glad that she is now taking up a position that is much closer to what is , shall we say , the opinion of the majority of the parliament , " polenz told public broadcaster wdr .
" i am very grateful that both churches are helping to support our troops with spiritual guidance , " guttenberg said .
" i am certain that mrs. kaessmann does not want to see that debased . "
protestant bishops also gave kaessmann their support on tuesday .
" a lot of people do n't understand why the mission is necessary and what its purpose is .
and it 's not clear how it can be ended , " said bishop maria jepsen of hamburg .
berlin bishop markus droege said that a continuation of the afghanistan mission was only morally acceptable if the government gave " a long-overdue definition of its aim and an exit strategy . "
catholic military bishop walter mixa also called for " an open and honest debate about the situation our soldiers are in and their mission . "
mixa said that the question of whether the mission was justified " is always relevant . " bk / epd / dpa editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

british prime minister gordon brown , however , says concerns of extremism in yemen persist . britain and france reopened their embassies in yemen on wednesday .
the diplomatic outposts had been closed due to threats of a terrorist attack .
both embassies remain closed to the public , but officials said diplomats and staff had reported for duty .
yemen 's interior ministry said on tuesday that all foreign missions and interests in the country were " safe , " pointing out that it had reinforced security measures around embassies , foreign residences , and the airport in sanaa .
the ministry also said it had arrested five " terrorist elements " during the past two days near the capital but gave no details of the identity of the suspects .
warnings of a possible al-qaeda attack on embassies in yemen had led the us and britain to close their diplomatic missions on sunday , with france following suit a day later .
the us reopened its embassy on tuesday .
brown gearing up for yemen meeting long-standing concerns that yemen had become a haven for islamist militant groups were bolstered on christmas day when a nigerian man - allegedly trained by a branch of al qaeda in yemen - was arrested on charges of trying to blow up a jet bound for detroit .
us president barack obama , in a televised address to the american people on tuesday , said us intelligence had missed " red flags " that could have disrupted the terror plot .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the christmas day attack has sparked wide concern " it is increasingly clear that intelligence was not fully analyzed or fully leveraged .
that 's not acceptable , and i will not tolerate it , " he said .
meanwhile , british prime minister gordon brown held a telephone conference with yemeni president ali abdullah saleh on tuesday to discuss " preparations and mechanisms " for an international conference on the security situation in yemen , according to the state-run saba news agency .
saleh , whose impoverished country faces unrest on several fronts , stressed " the determination of yemen to continue its efforts in the fight against terrorism , " saba reported .

mackay , writing in an article coauthored by royal navy commander steve tatham and published by the british ministry of defense ’ s -lrb- mod -rrb- defense academy , called for fresh thinking on the battlefield and highlighted a need for more focus on " behaviorist " strategy when dealing with the complex structure of afghan society . he added that the military " consistently failed " to understand the motivations of local afghans which was undermining western efforts while strengthening the resistance , saying that western efforts had to focus on understanding the culture , economy and psychology of the taliban if allied forces were to be truly successful in battle .

mackay , writing in an article coauthored by royal navy commander steve tatham and published by the british ministry of defense ’ s -lrb- mod -rrb- defense academy , called for fresh thinking on the battlefield and highlighted a need for more focus on " behaviorist " strategy when dealing with the complex structure of afghan society . he added that the military " consistently failed " to understand the motivations of local afghans which was undermining western efforts while strengthening the resistance , saying that western efforts had to focus on understanding the culture , economy and psychology of the taliban if allied forces were to be truly successful in battle .

mackay , writing in an article coauthored by royal navy commander steve tatham and published by the british ministry of defense ’ s -lrb- mod -rrb- defense academy , called for fresh thinking on the battlefield and highlighted a need for more focus on " behaviorist " strategy when dealing with the complex structure of afghan society . he added that the military " consistently failed " to understand the motivations of local afghans which was undermining western efforts while strengthening the resistance , saying that western efforts had to focus on understanding the culture , economy and psychology of the taliban if allied forces were to be truly successful in battle . " many of the choices that are currently presented are too stark : poppy bad / wheat good ; taliban evil / isaf good and so on , " mackay wrote .
" the reality is that we have consistently failed to understand that what seems to us as irrational behavior is entirely rational to the individual facing tough choices . " " we have sought to advance the idea that alongside kinetic power there is potentially a more behaviorist approach which , we believe , can affect the enemy 's will and be as , or arguably more , effective than kinetic power in future conflict , " mackay added . ignoring the mistakes of the past bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mackay believes more local understanding is required samina ahmed , the project director for the south asia department of the international crisis group in islamabad , says that while western knowledge of afghanistan was shaped largely by the anti-soviet jihad and hence unrelated to current day afghan dynamics , other factors have proved more costly . " it is less the lack of knowledge about afghanistan that has contributed to instability and an ineffectual military campaign as a propensity to repeatedly seek short cuts that have backfired , instead of a focus on institution building that would pay long term dividends and the failure , when the ground was ripe , to provide adequate military and economic resources , " she told deutsche welle . ahmed also pointed out that when the taliban were ousted , the afghan people fully supported the intervention in the hope that the western presence would restore and underwrite peace and help to rebuild their war-torn land .
instead , she claimed , the west and its allies failed to understand the need then to buttress institutions , instead of relying on individuals , including warlords , and providing the economic goods . " if the taliban are to be deprived of support , then the west must shun short-cuts that will only undercut political stability , for instance by supporting selected warlords and their militias , instead of building a professional military as well as a police force that is capable of protecting the citizen , " she said .
" in short , a state that is capable of protecting the lives of its citizens and providing basic services is the only way in which violent extremism can be defeated in afghanistan . " west accused of stagnation in face of evolving conflict bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : roadside bombs have proved to be an effective weapon mackay also accused senior military officers of being " institutionally incapable of keeping pace with rapid change and the associated willingness to adapt - and quickly - at the same time . " western efforts in dealing with the counter-insurgency , he said , had a sense of " making it up as we go along " and that there was a serious lack of clear direction from senior officers .
he also suggested that military planners had been educated by a system designed for a previous age and could not adapt to current and future challenges . giles merritt , the director of the security & defence agenda think-tank in brussels , agrees that western forces are suffering from a lack of clear direction . " we are losing but we 're not losing for military reasons not for strategic reasons , " merritt told deutsche welle .
" we do n't have a clear plan , we do n't know how to assess if we 're winning or losing except in terms of body count , and we do n't have a big picture .
you hold a bit of ground here , we reduce the level of instability there but we 're not really working towards a clearly defined goal . " merritt does not believe , however , that military planners are incapable of adapting to the conflict in afghanistan - mainly becaue the tactics and the approach of the taliban has changed little since coalition forces invaded in 2001 . " the taliban have n't actually changed since the 1930 's , " merritt said .
" they 're incredibly patient .
they wait to see what the weaknesses are , what the chinks in the armor are and then they exploit them .
i do n't think there has been an enormous change in the taliban 's tactics at all and the west have certainly not been surprised by them .
so they fight a war of attrition with roadside bombs and ambushes .
this was to be expected . " time to talk to the taliban ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us would be suspicious of any taliban settlement offer the growing concern over the western approach in afghanistan and the alleged failure by allied forces to get a grip on the methods employed by the taliban in its counter-insurgency has given rise to cautious suggestions that direct negotiations may be the only way to end the war . government sources in the us refused to confirm or deny whether washington would deal with the taliban but defense secretary robert gates was quoted as saying that he believed the taliban would only contemplate an agreement if they had first been forced into believing they would lose the war . " the taliban leadership is currently disinclined to negotiate because it believes the west has n't the will to stay on in afghanistan , " samina ahmed said . " until the taliban are willing to negotiate , there is no question of defining terms or demands .
however , should such an opportunity arise , then the minimum demands should include acceptance of the afghan constitution and a willingness to give up arms .

he is one of the originators of the new growth theory and has been awarded the horst claus recktenwald prize in economics .
he was named one of the 25 most influential americans by time magazine .
he currently devotes all his time to his new project , " charter cities . "
deutsche welle : you have developed a new concept which you believe can reduce global poverty and empower underprivileged people better than traditional development policies can .
in a nutshell , what is your idea of the charter city ?
paul romer : one thing that we know works extremely well for raising standards of living and wages for people is to let them move from countries that have bad rules to countries that have better rules .
now there are n't that many spaces in countries with good rules to take hundreds of millions of people , so the charter city idea is to create places that have good quality rules where hundreds of millions of people could go .
you argue that a good system of rules as is found in most western societies is the key to economic prosperity and that such a rules-based system is attractive for people everywhere and therefore can basically be transplanted anywhere .
how do you respond to critics who say you underestimate cultural and historical factors , and that therefore charter cities may not be viable on a large scale ?
we know that people want access to these kinds of rule systems .
seven hundred million people around the world have said in response to survey questions that they would like to move permanently to a different country .
so people want this .
if you start with uninhabited land and invite people in to live under a new system of rules those rules can very quickly take hold and thrive .
another criticism of your idea of the charter city is that it is essentially colonialism revisited .
no one is forced to move or live in your charter city , and everyone is free to leave again , but essentially western countries are once again financing , setting up and running places where poor people can only come to sell their labor .
how do you counter that criticism ?
if you think about the question , picture someone from a very poor country , a family , a couple of young children , a father and a mother , and picture them moving to munich or zurich or vancouver .
we do n't think of that as colonial ; we think of that as something that gives them opportunities that they really want .
and this proposal is no more than saying if we ca n't let hundreds of millions of people go to those cities , let 's create some new cities that are run like those cities where large numbers of people could go .
as examples of possible charter cities you mention a canadian charter project in cuba , an australian project with indonesia or a project in india .
but how could a charter city work in the countries that really need help the most , i.e. the poorest countries in the world like eritrea or somalia ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hong kong is a well known historic example of a charter city the example of cuba and canada is not so much a literal proposal as a way to picture how this could work .
there happens to be a piece of land in cuba where by treaty cuba gave someone else the right to administer that land .
guantanamo bay is actually administered by the united states .
so countries like somalia or eritrea and other countries like that could sign treaties where relatively small pieces of land were assigned to other countries or perhaps a consortium of countries to set up new systems of rules there and create new cities in much the same way that the british created hong kong in a place where before they came no one lived .
for your concept to work , you need countries or private corporations to make large-scale investments .
those investors , of course , want to see a return on their investment .
how do you intend to attract investors for such a venture with an all but certain outcome , and on the other hand , how do you make sure that the investors are not merely trying to make a quick profit ?
this is why the rules are so important .
rules matter for families , because they want their children to be safe , they want to have a chance to get a job , they want rules that set up a good educational system .
but the rules also matter for investors .
a firm might come in and build a power system for a new city like this or build the infrastructure .
firms are quite willing to take market risks . what firms do not want to undertake is political risk , the risk that some government will just expropriate their property or suddenly enact policies that destroy the value of their investments .
so what the partner governments can do is make a credible commitment to rules that will remain in place for decades so that not only workers and families are attracted , but also investors and employers .
you 've been promoting the concept of charter cities since last year and have received lots of praise but also criticism for your idea .
has any country so far signed up to your idea ?
are there any concrete plans to develop the first charter city ?
there are preliminary conversations with various governments .
i tried this idea on possible participants in an arrangement like this and the reaction has been very positive .
the most surprising thing i 've learned is that the developing countries are very open to this idea .
they have seen how special zones were very effective development strategies - in china in particular - and they have seen how fast growth can take place when you get policy right .
china is now the new standard that countries are aspiring to and they are willing to try new things to get the kind of growth that they see in china .
-lsb- but -rsb- i think this would be an opportunity for governments that have not been as active on the world stage , including the government of germany , to really establish a whole new way of interacting with the rest of the world as a partner that could be distinctive and very beneficial .
what role could germany play in your concept of a charter city as a country with a comparatively brief colonial history ? one of the things that is interesting is that germany has relatively good ties with some of its former colonies , like namibia for example .
so as opposed to other countries where there is lingering resentment and bad feeling , there 's good feeling about the benefits that some of these countries receive from the german people .
so i think this good will is an asset that you could put to work in the future .
how has the development community reacted to your proposal , since you believe that the charter city could benefit more people across the globe than classical development aid can ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mauritius is considered a role model for the concept of a successful charter city i think the right way to describe it is that the reactions have been somewhat polarized .
on the one hand , there are many people who perceive the magnitude of the problem and the very slow pace of resolving that problem and who say your idea is very unusual and different , but it might be worth a try , because what we are doing right now is n't getting us where we want to go .
there are other people who are much more concerned , who say this is a very different approach , and it 's too risky , and we should n't try this .
but i think this gets the balance of the risks wrong .
i think the biggest risk is that we persist with the conditions that we now have in many parts of the world , where there are hundreds of millions of people who are desperate to go someplace where they can put their energies to work and create a better future for their children .
so i think there is very little risk in trying something different and we should be braver and we should have more imagination in solving this really pressing human problem .

he is one of the originators of the new growth theory and has been awarded the horst claus recktenwald prize in economics .
he was named one of the 25 most influential americans by time magazine .
he currently devotes all his time to his new project , " charter cities . "
deutsche welle : you have developed a new concept which you believe can reduce global poverty and empower underprivileged people better than traditional development policies can .
in a nutshell , what is your idea of the charter city ?
paul romer : one thing that we know works extremely well for raising standards of living and wages for people is to let them move from countries that have bad rules to countries that have better rules .
now there are n't that many spaces in countries with good rules to take hundreds of millions of people , so the charter city idea is to create places that have good quality rules where hundreds of millions of people could go .
you argue that a good system of rules as is found in most western societies is the key to economic prosperity and that such a rules-based system is attractive for people everywhere and therefore can basically be transplanted anywhere .
how do you respond to critics who say you underestimate cultural and historical factors , and that therefore charter cities may not be viable on a large scale ?
we know that people want access to these kinds of rule systems .
seven hundred million people around the world have said in response to survey questions that they would like to move permanently to a different country .
so people want this .
if you start with uninhabited land and invite people in to live under a new system of rules those rules can very quickly take hold and thrive .
another criticism of your idea of the charter city is that it is essentially colonialism revisited .
no one is forced to move or live in your charter city , and everyone is free to leave again , but essentially western countries are once again financing , setting up and running places where poor people can only come to sell their labor .
how do you counter that criticism ?
if you think about the question , picture someone from a very poor country , a family , a couple of young children , a father and a mother , and picture them moving to munich or zurich or vancouver .
we do n't think of that as colonial ; we think of that as something that gives them opportunities that they really want .
and this proposal is no more than saying if we ca n't let hundreds of millions of people go to those cities , let 's create some new cities that are run like those cities where large numbers of people could go .
as examples of possible charter cities you mention a canadian charter project in cuba , an australian project with indonesia or a project in india .
but how could a charter city work in the countries that really need help the most , i.e. the poorest countries in the world like eritrea or somalia ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hong kong is a well known historic example of a charter city the example of cuba and canada is not so much a literal proposal as a way to picture how this could work .
there happens to be a piece of land in cuba where by treaty cuba gave someone else the right to administer that land .
guantanamo bay is actually administered by the united states .
so countries like somalia or eritrea and other countries like that could sign treaties where relatively small pieces of land were assigned to other countries or perhaps a consortium of countries to set up new systems of rules there and create new cities in much the same way that the british created hong kong in a place where before they came no one lived .
for your concept to work , you need countries or private corporations to make large-scale investments .
those investors , of course , want to see a return on their investment .
how do you intend to attract investors for such a venture with an all but certain outcome , and on the other hand , how do you make sure that the investors are not merely trying to make a quick profit ?
this is why the rules are so important .
rules matter for families , because they want their children to be safe , they want to have a chance to get a job , they want rules that set up a good educational system .
but the rules also matter for investors .
a firm might come in and build a power system for a new city like this or build the infrastructure .
firms are quite willing to take market risks . what firms do not want to undertake is political risk , the risk that some government will just expropriate their property or suddenly enact policies that destroy the value of their investments .
so what the partner governments can do is make a credible commitment to rules that will remain in place for decades so that not only workers and families are attracted , but also investors and employers .
you 've been promoting the concept of charter cities since last year and have received lots of praise but also criticism for your idea .
has any country so far signed up to your idea ?
are there any concrete plans to develop the first charter city ?
there are preliminary conversations with various governments .
i tried this idea on possible participants in an arrangement like this and the reaction has been very positive .
the most surprising thing i 've learned is that the developing countries are very open to this idea .
they have seen how special zones were very effective development strategies - in china in particular - and they have seen how fast growth can take place when you get policy right .

but i think this gets the balance of the risks wrong .
i think the biggest risk is that we persist with the conditions that we now have in many parts of the world , where there are hundreds of millions of people who are desperate to go someplace where they can put their energies to work and create a better future for their children .
so i think there is very little risk in trying something different and we should be braver and we should have more imagination in solving this really pressing human problem .

he is one of the originators of the new growth theory and has been awarded the horst claus recktenwald prize in economics .
he was named one of the 25 most influential americans by time magazine .
he currently devotes all his time to his new project , " charter cities . "
deutsche welle : you have developed a new concept which you believe can reduce global poverty and empower underprivileged people better than traditional development policies can .
in a nutshell , what is your idea of the charter city ?
paul romer : one thing that we know works extremely well for raising standards of living and wages for people is to let them move from countries that have bad rules to countries that have better rules .
now there are n't that many spaces in countries with good rules to take hundreds of millions of people , so the charter city idea is to create places that have good quality rules where hundreds of millions of people could go .
you argue that a good system of rules as is found in most western societies is the key to economic prosperity and that such a rules-based system is attractive for people everywhere and therefore can basically be transplanted anywhere .
how do you respond to critics who say you underestimate cultural and historical factors , and that therefore charter cities may not be viable on a large scale ?
we know that people want access to these kinds of rule systems .
seven hundred million people around the world have said in response to survey questions that they would like to move permanently to a different country .
so people want this .
if you start with uninhabited land and invite people in to live under a new system of rules those rules can very quickly take hold and thrive .
another criticism of your idea of the charter city is that it is essentially colonialism revisited .
no one is forced to move or live in your charter city , and everyone is free to leave again , but essentially western countries are once again financing , setting up and running places where poor people can only come to sell their labor .
how do you counter that criticism ?
if you think about the question , picture someone from a very poor country , a family , a couple of young children , a father and a mother , and picture them moving to munich or zurich or vancouver .
we do n't think of that as colonial ; we think of that as something that gives them opportunities that they really want .
and this proposal is no more than saying if we ca n't let hundreds of millions of people go to those cities , let 's create some new cities that are run like those cities where large numbers of people could go .
as examples of possible charter cities you mention a canadian charter project in cuba , an australian project with indonesia or a project in india .
but how could a charter city work in the countries that really need help the most , i.e. the poorest countries in the world like eritrea or somalia ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hong kong is a well known historic example of a charter city the example of cuba and canada is not so much a literal proposal as a way to picture how this could work .
there happens to be a piece of land in cuba where by treaty cuba gave someone else the right to administer that land .
guantanamo bay is actually administered by the united states .
so countries like somalia or eritrea and other countries like that could sign treaties where relatively small pieces of land were assigned to other countries or perhaps a consortium of countries to set up new systems of rules there and create new cities in much the same way that the british created hong kong in a place where before they came no one lived .
for your concept to work , you need countries or private corporations to make large-scale investments .
those investors , of course , want to see a return on their investment .
how do you intend to attract investors for such a venture with an all but certain outcome , and on the other hand , how do you make sure that the investors are not merely trying to make a quick profit ?
this is why the rules are so important .
rules matter for families , because they want their children to be safe , they want to have a chance to get a job , they want rules that set up a good educational system .
but the rules also matter for investors .
a firm might come in and build a power system for a new city like this or build the infrastructure .
firms are quite willing to take market risks . what firms do not want to undertake is political risk , the risk that some government will just expropriate their property or suddenly enact policies that destroy the value of their investments .
so what the partner governments can do is make a credible commitment to rules that will remain in place for decades so that not only workers and families are attracted , but also investors and employers .
you 've been promoting the concept of charter cities since last year and have received lots of praise but also criticism for your idea .
has any country so far signed up to your idea ?
are there any concrete plans to develop the first charter city ?
there are preliminary conversations with various governments .
i tried this idea on possible participants in an arrangement like this and the reaction has been very positive .
the most surprising thing i 've learned is that the developing countries are very open to this idea .
they have seen how special zones were very effective development strategies - in china in particular - and they have seen how fast growth can take place when you get policy right .
china is now the new standard that countries are aspiring to and they are willing to try new things to get the kind of growth that they see in china .
-lsb- but -rsb- i think this would be an opportunity for governments that have not been as active on the world stage , including the government of germany , to really establish a whole new way of interacting with the rest of the world as a partner that could be distinctive and very beneficial .
what role could germany play in your concept of a charter city as a country with a comparatively brief colonial history ? one of the things that is interesting is that germany has relatively good ties with some of its former colonies , like namibia for example .
so as opposed to other countries where there is lingering resentment and bad feeling , there 's good feeling about the benefits that some of these countries receive from the german people .
so i think this good will is an asset that you could put to work in the future .
how has the development community reacted to your proposal , since you believe that the charter city could benefit more people across the globe than classical development aid can ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mauritius is considered a role model for the concept of a successful charter city i think the right way to describe it is that the reactions have been somewhat polarized .
on the one hand , there are many people who perceive the magnitude of the problem and the very slow pace of resolving that problem and who say your idea is very unusual and different , but it might be worth a try , because what we are doing right now is n't getting us where we want to go .

but as the new coalition stumbles , the fdp must re-evaluate its agenda . germany 's free-market liberal democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- met on wednesday in stuttgart for their party meeting , held annually on january 6 .
the self-reflection session comes just a few months after the fdp joined the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- in a coalition government .
coalition negotiations between the two parties appeared to go smoothly and many of the fdp 's campaign promises made it into the coalition agreement .
the centerpiece of the policy blueprint was a plan to cut income taxes by 24 billion euros -lrb- $ 36 billion -rrb- and the parties agreed to pursue a simplification of the german tax system .
a difficult economy takes its toll but the reality of germany 's ongoing economic troubles have put a damper on the early excitement of the election .
politicians are beginning to voice their doubts , including bartholomaeus kalb , member of the cdu 's bavarian sister party the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- .
" we just wo n't have any money for tax relief or any additional expenditures for the foreseeable future , and by that i mean through the end of the legislative period , " wednesday 's edition of the financial times deutschland quoted kalb as saying .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's debt is set to continue to rise in 2010 the csu also held their annual party meeting on wednesday .
germany faces a ballooning budget deficit , with the 2010 budget approved by chancellor angela merkel 's cabinet calling for a record 85.8 billion euros in borrowed cash .
the european union has pressed germany to get its deficit under control .
as the party meets to discuss plans for 2010 , there 's been some backpedaling from fdp leaders , including economics minister rainer bruederle .
" it would be absolutely wrong to start off by cutting the budget , " he said on german radio .
fdp deputy party leader andreas pinkwart told the handelsblatt business daily this means that reaching the goals laid out in the coalition agreement might not happen for a few years .
" it 's enough if the complete 24 billion euros of relief is achieved in 2013 , " pinkwart said .
thus far only one tax cut of 8.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 123.1 billion -rrb- has been approved .
but he added that the restructuring of the tax system must begin this year .
the fdp had hoped to institute a three-tiered system with tax rates of 10 percent , 25 percent and 35 percent .
a new fdp ?
with the fdp no longer pushing for immediate tax relief , the meeting in stuttgart could give the free-market liberals the opportunity to redefine themselves .
the fdp 's current party platform dates back to 1997 and on the agenda wednesday is a discussion of a new platform .
when the daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung asked fdp secretary general christian lindner whether the fdp image as it now stands did n't fit the current times , lindner said the party 's mission is structurally sound .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even economics minister bruederle is n't calling for the cuts to take place right away " there 's no major need for revision of fdp positions , " he said .
" instead , it 's about evolution .
the new party platform is supposed to be worked on until 2012 .
we should take our time . "
but there are elements of the party that are already making changes .
the state of baden wuerttemberg 's fdp has already passed its own platform .
" when the disciplinary force of competition does not take hold … or is impeded by unfair conduct , the state has the mandate to regulate and intervene if necessary in the economy , " the new platform reads .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's debt is set to continue to rise in 2010 the csu also held their annual party meeting on wednesday .
germany faces a ballooning budget deficit , with the 2010 budget approved by chancellor angela merkel 's cabinet calling for a record 85.8 billion euros in borrowed cash .
the european union has pressed germany to get its deficit under control .
as the party meets to discuss plans for 2010 , there 's been some backpedaling from fdp leaders , including economics minister rainer bruederle .
" it would be absolutely wrong to start off by cutting the budget , " he said on german radio .
fdp deputy party leader andreas pinkwart told the handelsblatt business daily this means that reaching the goals laid out in the coalition agreement might not happen for a few years .
" it 's enough if the complete 24 billion euros of relief is achieved in 2013 , " pinkwart said .
thus far only one tax cut of 8.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 123.1 billion -rrb- has been approved .
but he added that the restructuring of the tax system must begin this year .
the fdp had hoped to institute a three-tiered system with tax rates of 10 percent , 25 percent and 35 percent .
a new fdp ?
with the fdp no longer pushing for immediate tax relief , the meeting in stuttgart could give the free-market liberals the opportunity to redefine themselves .
the fdp 's current party platform dates back to 1997 and on the agenda wednesday is a discussion of a new platform .
when the daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung asked fdp secretary general christian lindner whether the fdp image as it now stands did n't fit the current times , lindner said the party 's mission is structurally sound .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even economics minister bruederle is n't calling for the cuts to take place right away " there 's no major need for revision of fdp positions , " he said .
" instead , it 's about evolution .
the new party platform is supposed to be worked on until 2012 .
we should take our time . "
but there are elements of the party that are already making changes .
the state of baden wuerttemberg 's fdp has already passed its own platform .
" when the disciplinary force of competition does not take hold … or is impeded by unfair conduct , the state has the mandate to regulate and intervene if necessary in the economy , " the new platform reads .

with budget deficits a problem across the bloc , member nations said the 3.7-percent raise was too high . the european commission officially decided to take european union member states to court over their refusal to accept a 3.7-percent pay raise for eu employees , announced commission spokeswoman pia ahrenkilde hansen on wednesday in brussels .
the decision was unanimously made by the 27 commissioners , hansen said .
the court complaint pits the european council , which is the collective entity for the 27 member states , against the commission , the bloc 's executive , in the luxembourg-based european court of justice .
it 's a battle that may prove embarrassing to the eu at a time when the bloc is attempting to rebrand itself after passing the lisbon reform treaty .
formula determines salaries the salaries of eu bureaucrats are calculated with a complex and legally binding formula that incorporates pay levels in brussels and eight of the eu 's wealthiest countries .
but with some national governments cutting their own civil servants ' pay amid ongoing economic difficulties , member countries decided to approve only a 1.85 percent increase .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : now the eu 's court of justice will decide how big a raise the employees get the commission would have none of it .
" we are talking here about the respect for agreed rules , " spokeswoman hansen said .
" it is not an issue where political discretion is at play . "
according to the commission , some 50,000 eu employees and contract staff at the commission , parliament , council and court are due the 3.7-percent raise , including the judges who will hear the case .
the basic gross income of these workers ranges from 2,550 euros -lrb- $ 3,800 -rrb- a month to 17,700 euros -lrb- $ 25,373 -rrb- .
the salaries are paid out from the eu 's central budget , which is ultimately funded by taxpayers in member countries .
the commission has asked the court for a speedy decision , to be made within six months .
however , the case could drag on for more than a year , during which the 1.85-percent raise would take effect. hf / afp / dpa editor : trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

with budget deficits a problem across the bloc , member nations said the 3.7-percent raise was too high . the european commission officially decided to take european union member states to court over their refusal to accept a 3.7-percent pay raise for eu employees , announced commission spokeswoman pia ahrenkilde hansen on wednesday in brussels .
the decision was unanimously made by the 27 commissioners , hansen said .
the court complaint pits the european council , which is the collective entity for the 27 member states , against the commission , the bloc 's executive , in the luxembourg-based european court of justice .
it 's a battle that may prove embarrassing to the eu at a time when the bloc is attempting to rebrand itself after passing the lisbon reform treaty .
formula determines salaries the salaries of eu bureaucrats are calculated with a complex and legally binding formula that incorporates pay levels in brussels and eight of the eu 's wealthiest countries .
but with some national governments cutting their own civil servants ' pay amid ongoing economic difficulties , member countries decided to approve only a 1.85 percent increase .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : now the eu 's court of justice will decide how big a raise the employees get the commission would have none of it .
" we are talking here about the respect for agreed rules , " spokeswoman hansen said .
" it is not an issue where political discretion is at play . "
according to the commission , some 50,000 eu employees and contract staff at the commission , parliament , council and court are due the 3.7-percent raise , including the judges who will hear the case .
the basic gross income of these workers ranges from 2,550 euros -lrb- $ 3,800 -rrb- a month to 17,700 euros -lrb- $ 25,373 -rrb- .
the salaries are paid out from the eu 's central budget , which is ultimately funded by taxpayers in member countries .
the commission has asked the court for a speedy decision , to be made within six months .
however , the case could drag on for more than a year , during which the 1.85-percent raise would take effect. hf / afp / dpa editor : trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but loud words seemed to rule the day at separate strategy meetings of the fdp and csu . the snow-covered hilltops of the southern german region around wildbad kreuth convey the impression of a place full of bliss and harmony .
but these days , harmony is solely left to mother nature .
everyone who matters in bavaria 's christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- - the sister party of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- - has flocked to the palace-like building at kreuth .
firing broadsides at both friend and foe has become an entertaining tradition at the csu 's three-day strategy meeting .
tax policies under fire the saber-rattling started wednesday morning , when csu head horst seehofer said his party had no reason to feel humble just because it had lost its absolute majority support in bavaria for the first time in its history .
seehofer attacked the free democrats ' -lrb- fdp -rrb- resolve to allow for 24 billion euros -lrb- $ 34.5 billion -rrb- in tax reductions as of 2011 despite the country facing record public debts , to be further increased by astronomic fresh borrowing this year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : csu head horst seehofer sees no reason to feel humble " i 'm sure the fdp will still learn what it means to assume government responsibility , " seehofer quipped in a statement directed at the conservatives ' coalition partner in berlin .
at their own gathering in stuttgart on wednesday , the pro-business fdp did n't wait long before responding to the verbal attack .
fdp floor leader birgit homburger said it was strange that the csu was so forgetful .
she recalled that all sides had agreed on tax reductions during coalition talks last year .
" we looked very hard at where taxes could be lowered and what measures could be financed and justified .
so why 's so much fuss being made about it now ? " , homburger asked in stuttgart .
body scanners not to everyone 's liking but tax policies are not the only bone of contention that berlin 's coalition partners almost seem to choke on these days .
there 's a controversy about whether or not body scanners should be used at german airports to increase security , with the fdp being far more concerned about any potential dignity issues than chancellor merkel 's conservatives .
and at least two foreign policy issues have shown time and again that the coalition partners are far from speaking with one voice .
number one is afghanistan , and with it the debate over whether germany should send in thousands of more troops in line with us president barack obama 's request to nato allies .

steinbach angered poland by not accepting the bilateral border treaty after german unification in 1990 .
her initial resolve to become a board member of a museum for european expellees has also caused an outcry in warsaw .

but loud words seemed to rule the day at separate strategy meetings of the fdp and csu . the snow-covered hilltops of the southern german region around wildbad kreuth convey the impression of a place full of bliss and harmony .
but these days , harmony is solely left to mother nature .
everyone who matters in bavaria 's christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- - the sister party of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- - has flocked to the palace-like building at kreuth .
firing broadsides at both friend and foe has become an entertaining tradition at the csu 's three-day strategy meeting .
tax policies under fire the saber-rattling started wednesday morning , when csu head horst seehofer said his party had no reason to feel humble just because it had lost its absolute majority support in bavaria for the first time in its history .
seehofer attacked the free democrats ' -lrb- fdp -rrb- resolve to allow for 24 billion euros -lrb- $ 34.5 billion -rrb- in tax reductions as of 2011 despite the country facing record public debts , to be further increased by astronomic fresh borrowing this year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : csu head horst seehofer sees no reason to feel humble " i 'm sure the fdp will still learn what it means to assume government responsibility , " seehofer quipped in a statement directed at the conservatives ' coalition partner in berlin .
at their own gathering in stuttgart on wednesday , the pro-business fdp did n't wait long before responding to the verbal attack .
fdp floor leader birgit homburger said it was strange that the csu was so forgetful .
she recalled that all sides had agreed on tax reductions during coalition talks last year .
" we looked very hard at where taxes could be lowered and what measures could be financed and justified .
so why 's so much fuss being made about it now ? " , homburger asked in stuttgart .
body scanners not to everyone 's liking but tax policies are not the only bone of contention that berlin 's coalition partners almost seem to choke on these days .
there 's a controversy about whether or not body scanners should be used at german airports to increase security , with the fdp being far more concerned about any potential dignity issues than chancellor merkel 's conservatives .
and at least two foreign policy issues have shown time and again that the coalition partners are far from speaking with one voice .
number one is afghanistan , and with it the debate over whether germany should send in thousands of more troops in line with us president barack obama 's request to nato allies .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erika steinbach remains a controversial figure and then there 's the unresolved question of how to deal with erika steinbach , who heads germany 's federation of expellees -lrb- bdv -rrb- , a group which represents germans expelled from eastern europe after 1945 .
steinbach angered poland by not accepting the bilateral border treaty after german unification in 1990 .
her initial resolve to become a board member of a museum for european expellees has also caused an outcry in warsaw .
the conservatives and the fdp seem divided over how to deal with steinbach 's recent proposal to renounce the post in return for boosting the federation of expellees ' say in the museum work. hg / dpa / reuters / ap editor : trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

plugged intersections , massive traffic jams and total parking chaos are daily nightmares for drivers in the country 's larger cities .
but that does n't appear to be holding anyone back from buying their own car .
with more than a billion people , india offers huge potential for carmakers , including germany 's bmw , daimler and volkswagen , which are exhibiting at the indian auto show auto expo 2010 through january 11 .
the country 's car market is growing at a rate or more than 10 percent a year , and there 's plenty of room for further expansion . analysts estimate that only 11 in 1,000 indian citizens currently owns a car .
in germany , by comparison , that proportion is more than 500 to 1,000 , according to the german association of the automotive industry -lrb- vda -rrb- .

with budget deficits a problem across the bloc , member nations said the 3.7-percent raise was too high . the european commission officially decided to take european union member states to court over their refusal to accept a 3.7-percent pay raise for eu employees , announced commission spokeswoman pia ahrenkilde hansen on wednesday in brussels .

it 's a battle that may prove embarrassing to the eu at a time when the bloc is attempting to rebrand itself after passing the lisbon reform treaty .

the salaries are paid out from the eu 's central budget , which is ultimately funded by taxpayers in member countries .

with budget deficits a problem across the bloc , member nations said the 3.7-percent raise was too high . the european commission officially decided to take european union member states to court over their refusal to accept a 3.7-percent pay raise for eu employees , announced commission spokeswoman pia ahrenkilde hansen on wednesday in brussels .
the decision was unanimously made by the 27 commissioners , hansen said .
the court complaint pits the european council , which is the collective entity for the 27 member states , against the commission , the bloc 's executive , in the luxembourg-based european court of justice .
it 's a battle that may prove embarrassing to the eu at a time when the bloc is attempting to rebrand itself after passing the lisbon reform treaty .
formula determines salaries the salaries of eu bureaucrats are calculated with a complex and legally binding formula that incorporates pay levels in brussels and eight of the eu 's wealthiest countries .
but with some national governments cutting their own civil servants ' pay amid ongoing economic difficulties , member countries decided to approve only a 1.85 percent increase .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : now the eu 's court of justice will decide how big a raise the employees get the commission would have none of it .
" we are talking here about the respect for agreed rules , " spokeswoman hansen said .
" it is not an issue where political discretion is at play . "
according to the commission , some 50,000 eu employees and contract staff at the commission , parliament , council and court are due the 3.7-percent raise , including the judges who will hear the case .
the basic gross income of these workers ranges from 2,550 euros -lrb- $ 3,800 -rrb- a month to 17,700 euros -lrb- $ 25,373 -rrb- .
the salaries are paid out from the eu 's central budget , which is ultimately funded by taxpayers in member countries .
the commission has asked the court for a speedy decision , to be made within six months .
however , the case could drag on for more than a year , during which the 1.85-percent raise would take effect. hf / afp / dpa editor : trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he is one of the originators of the new growth theory and has been awarded the horst claus recktenwald prize in economics .
he was named one of the 25 most influential americans by time magazine .
he currently devotes all his time to his new project , " charter cities . "
deutsche welle : you have developed a new concept which you believe can reduce global poverty and empower underprivileged people better than traditional development policies can .
in a nutshell , what is your idea of the charter city ?
paul romer : one thing that we know works extremely well for raising standards of living and wages for people is to let them move from countries that have bad rules to countries that have better rules .
now there are n't that many spaces in countries with good rules to take hundreds of millions of people , so the charter city idea is to create places that have good quality rules where hundreds of millions of people could go .
you argue that a good system of rules as is found in most western societies is the key to economic prosperity and that such a rules-based system is attractive for people everywhere and therefore can basically be transplanted anywhere .
how do you respond to critics who say you underestimate cultural and historical factors , and that therefore charter cities may not be viable on a large scale ?
we know that people want access to these kinds of rule systems .
seven hundred million people around the world have said in response to survey questions that they would like to move permanently to a different country .
so people want this .
if you start with uninhabited land and invite people in to live under a new system of rules those rules can very quickly take hold and thrive .
another criticism of your idea of the charter city is that it is essentially colonialism revisited .
no one is forced to move or live in your charter city , and everyone is free to leave again , but essentially western countries are once again financing , setting up and running places where poor people can only come to sell their labor .
how do you counter that criticism ?
if you think about the question , picture someone from a very poor country , a family , a couple of young children , a father and a mother , and picture them moving to munich or zurich or vancouver .
we do n't think of that as colonial ; we think of that as something that gives them opportunities that they really want .
and this proposal is no more than saying if we ca n't let hundreds of millions of people go to those cities , let 's create some new cities that are run like those cities where large numbers of people could go .
as examples of possible charter cities you mention a canadian charter project in cuba , an australian project with indonesia or a project in india .
but how could a charter city work in the countries that really need help the most , i.e. the poorest countries in the world like eritrea or somalia ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hong kong is a well known historic example of a charter city the example of cuba and canada is not so much a literal proposal as a way to picture how this could work .
there happens to be a piece of land in cuba where by treaty cuba gave someone else the right to administer that land .
guantanamo bay is actually administered by the united states .
so countries like somalia or eritrea and other countries like that could sign treaties where relatively small pieces of land were assigned to other countries or perhaps a consortium of countries to set up new systems of rules there and create new cities in much the same way that the british created hong kong in a place where before they came no one lived .
for your concept to work , you need countries or private corporations to make large-scale investments .
those investors , of course , want to see a return on their investment .
how do you intend to attract investors for such a venture with an all but certain outcome , and on the other hand , how do you make sure that the investors are not merely trying to make a quick profit ?
this is why the rules are so important .
rules matter for families , because they want their children to be safe , they want to have a chance to get a job , they want rules that set up a good educational system .
but the rules also matter for investors .
a firm might come in and build a power system for a new city like this or build the infrastructure .
firms are quite willing to take market risks . what firms do not want to undertake is political risk , the risk that some government will just expropriate their property or suddenly enact policies that destroy the value of their investments .
so what the partner governments can do is make a credible commitment to rules that will remain in place for decades so that not only workers and families are attracted , but also investors and employers .
you 've been promoting the concept of charter cities since last year and have received lots of praise but also criticism for your idea .
has any country so far signed up to your idea ?
are there any concrete plans to develop the first charter city ?
there are preliminary conversations with various governments .
i tried this idea on possible participants in an arrangement like this and the reaction has been very positive .
the most surprising thing i 've learned is that the developing countries are very open to this idea .
they have seen how special zones were very effective development strategies - in china in particular - and they have seen how fast growth can take place when you get policy right .
china is now the new standard that countries are aspiring to and they are willing to try new things to get the kind of growth that they see in china .
-lsb- but -rsb- i think this would be an opportunity for governments that have not been as active on the world stage , including the government of germany , to really establish a whole new way of interacting with the rest of the world as a partner that could be distinctive and very beneficial .
what role could germany play in your concept of a charter city as a country with a comparatively brief colonial history ? one of the things that is interesting is that germany has relatively good ties with some of its former colonies , like namibia for example .
so as opposed to other countries where there is lingering resentment and bad feeling , there 's good feeling about the benefits that some of these countries receive from the german people .
so i think this good will is an asset that you could put to work in the future .
how has the development community reacted to your proposal , since you believe that the charter city could benefit more people across the globe than classical development aid can ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mauritius is considered a role model for the concept of a successful charter city i think the right way to describe it is that the reactions have been somewhat polarized .
on the one hand , there are many people who perceive the magnitude of the problem and the very slow pace of resolving that problem and who say your idea is very unusual and different , but it might be worth a try , because what we are doing right now is n't getting us where we want to go .
there are other people who are much more concerned , who say this is a very different approach , and it 's too risky , and we should n't try this .
but i think this gets the balance of the risks wrong .
i think the biggest risk is that we persist with the conditions that we now have in many parts of the world , where there are hundreds of millions of people who are desperate to go someplace where they can put their energies to work and create a better future for their children .
so i think there is very little risk in trying something different and we should be braver and we should have more imagination in solving this really pressing human problem .

firms are quite willing to take market risks . what firms do not want to undertake is political risk , the risk that some government will just expropriate their property or suddenly enact policies that destroy the value of their investments .
so what the partner governments can do is make a credible commitment to rules that will remain in place for decades so that not only workers and families are attracted , but also investors and employers .
you 've been promoting the concept of charter cities since last year and have received lots of praise but also criticism for your idea .
has any country so far signed up to your idea ?
are there any concrete plans to develop the first charter city ?
there are preliminary conversations with various governments .
i tried this idea on possible participants in an arrangement like this and the reaction has been very positive .
the most surprising thing i 've learned is that the developing countries are very open to this idea .
they have seen how special zones were very effective development strategies - in china in particular - and they have seen how fast growth can take place when you get policy right .
china is now the new standard that countries are aspiring to and they are willing to try new things to get the kind of growth that they see in china .
-lsb- but -rsb- i think this would be an opportunity for governments that have not been as active on the world stage , including the government of germany , to really establish a whole new way of interacting with the rest of the world as a partner that could be distinctive and very beneficial .
what role could germany play in your concept of a charter city as a country with a comparatively brief colonial history ? one of the things that is interesting is that germany has relatively good ties with some of its former colonies , like namibia for example .
so as opposed to other countries where there is lingering resentment and bad feeling , there 's good feeling about the benefits that some of these countries receive from the german people .
so i think this good will is an asset that you could put to work in the future .
how has the development community reacted to your proposal , since you believe that the charter city could benefit more people across the globe than classical development aid can ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mauritius is considered a role model for the concept of a successful charter city i think the right way to describe it is that the reactions have been somewhat polarized .
on the one hand , there are many people who perceive the magnitude of the problem and the very slow pace of resolving that problem and who say your idea is very unusual and different , but it might be worth a try , because what we are doing right now is n't getting us where we want to go .
there are other people who are much more concerned , who say this is a very different approach , and it 's too risky , and we should n't try this .
but i think this gets the balance of the risks wrong .
i think the biggest risk is that we persist with the conditions that we now have in many parts of the world , where there are hundreds of millions of people who are desperate to go someplace where they can put their energies to work and create a better future for their children .
so i think there is very little risk in trying something different and we should be braver and we should have more imagination in solving this really pressing human problem .

he is one of the originators of the new growth theory and has been awarded the horst claus recktenwald prize in economics .
he was named one of the 25 most influential americans by time magazine .
he currently devotes all his time to his new project , " charter cities . "
deutsche welle : you have developed a new concept which you believe can reduce global poverty and empower underprivileged people better than traditional development policies can .
in a nutshell , what is your idea of the charter city ?
paul romer : one thing that we know works extremely well for raising standards of living and wages for people is to let them move from countries that have bad rules to countries that have better rules .
now there are n't that many spaces in countries with good rules to take hundreds of millions of people , so the charter city idea is to create places that have good quality rules where hundreds of millions of people could go .
you argue that a good system of rules as is found in most western societies is the key to economic prosperity and that such a rules-based system is attractive for people everywhere and therefore can basically be transplanted anywhere .
how do you respond to critics who say you underestimate cultural and historical factors , and that therefore charter cities may not be viable on a large scale ?
we know that people want access to these kinds of rule systems .
seven hundred million people around the world have said in response to survey questions that they would like to move permanently to a different country .
so people want this .
if you start with uninhabited land and invite people in to live under a new system of rules those rules can very quickly take hold and thrive .
another criticism of your idea of the charter city is that it is essentially colonialism revisited .
no one is forced to move or live in your charter city , and everyone is free to leave again , but essentially western countries are once again financing , setting up and running places where poor people can only come to sell their labor .
how do you counter that criticism ?
if you think about the question , picture someone from a very poor country , a family , a couple of young children , a father and a mother , and picture them moving to munich or zurich or vancouver .
we do n't think of that as colonial ; we think of that as something that gives them opportunities that they really want .
and this proposal is no more than saying if we ca n't let hundreds of millions of people go to those cities , let 's create some new cities that are run like those cities where large numbers of people could go .
as examples of possible charter cities you mention a canadian charter project in cuba , an australian project with indonesia or a project in india .
but how could a charter city work in the countries that really need help the most , i.e. the poorest countries in the world like eritrea or somalia ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hong kong is a well known historic example of a charter city the example of cuba and canada is not so much a literal proposal as a way to picture how this could work .
there happens to be a piece of land in cuba where by treaty cuba gave someone else the right to administer that land .
guantanamo bay is actually administered by the united states .
so countries like somalia or eritrea and other countries like that could sign treaties where relatively small pieces of land were assigned to other countries or perhaps a consortium of countries to set up new systems of rules there and create new cities in much the same way that the british created hong kong in a place where before they came no one lived .
for your concept to work , you need countries or private corporations to make large-scale investments .
those investors , of course , want to see a return on their investment .
how do you intend to attract investors for such a venture with an all but certain outcome , and on the other hand , how do you make sure that the investors are not merely trying to make a quick profit ?
this is why the rules are so important .
rules matter for families , because they want their children to be safe , they want to have a chance to get a job , they want rules that set up a good educational system .
but the rules also matter for investors .
a firm might come in and build a power system for a new city like this or build the infrastructure .
firms are quite willing to take market risks . what firms do not want to undertake is political risk , the risk that some government will just expropriate their property or suddenly enact policies that destroy the value of their investments .

" rising threats and attacks on humanitarian operations , as well as the imposition of a string of unacceptable demands from armed groups , have made it virtually impossible for the world food programme -lrb- wfp -rrb- to continue reaching up to one million people in need in southern somalia , " the agency said in a statement .

despite being forced out of the south , the wfp , which has played a major role in international efforts to contain a humanitarian crisis in the war and drought-ravaged country , says it will continue activities in northern and central regions .
the militants , who have pledged allegiance to al qaeda , have the south tightly under their control .
they want to rid the region of foreign aid workers altogether and have imposed strict operating conditions in a bid to do so . rule-book for aid workers towards the end of last year , al shabab drew up a list of rules for international humanitarian groups to comply with .
these included a twice annual registration fee of 13,000 euros -lrb- $ 20,000 -rrb- .
the rules , obtained by the afp news agency , state that aid organizations " should distance -lsb- themselves -rsb- from anything that will affect proper islamic culture … like prompting adultery and establishing women 's groups . "

but as the new coalition stumbles , the fdp must re-evaluate its agenda . germany 's free-market liberal democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- met on wednesday in stuttgart for their party meeting , held annually on january 6 .
the self-reflection session comes just a few months after the fdp joined the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- in a coalition government .
coalition negotiations between the two parties appeared to go smoothly and many of the fdp 's campaign promises made it into the coalition agreement .
the centerpiece of the policy blueprint was a plan to cut income taxes by 24 billion euros -lrb- $ 36 billion -rrb- and the parties agreed to pursue a simplification of the german tax system .
a difficult economy takes its toll but the reality of germany 's ongoing economic troubles have put a damper on the early excitement of the election .
politicians are beginning to voice their doubts , including bartholomaeus kalb , member of the cdu 's bavarian sister party the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- .
" we just wo n't have any money for tax relief or any additional expenditures for the foreseeable future , and by that i mean through the end of the legislative period , " wednesday 's edition of the financial times deutschland quoted kalb as saying .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's debt is set to continue to rise in 2010 the csu also held their annual party meeting on wednesday .
germany faces a ballooning budget deficit , with the 2010 budget approved by chancellor angela merkel 's cabinet calling for a record 85.8 billion euros in borrowed cash .
the european union has pressed germany to get its deficit under control .
as the party meets to discuss plans for 2010 , there 's been some backpedaling from fdp leaders , including economics minister rainer bruederle .
" it would be absolutely wrong to start off by cutting the budget , " he said on german radio .
fdp deputy party leader andreas pinkwart told the handelsblatt business daily this means that reaching the goals laid out in the coalition agreement might not happen for a few years .
" it 's enough if the complete 24 billion euros of relief is achieved in 2013 , " pinkwart said .
thus far only one tax cut of 8.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 123.1 billion -rrb- has been approved .
but he added that the restructuring of the tax system must begin this year .
the fdp had hoped to institute a three-tiered system with tax rates of 10 percent , 25 percent and 35 percent .
a new fdp ?
with the fdp no longer pushing for immediate tax relief , the meeting in stuttgart could give the free-market liberals the opportunity to redefine themselves .
the fdp 's current party platform dates back to 1997 and on the agenda wednesday is a discussion of a new platform .
when the daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung asked fdp secretary general christian lindner whether the fdp image as it now stands did n't fit the current times , lindner said the party 's mission is structurally sound .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even economics minister bruederle is n't calling for the cuts to take place right away " there 's no major need for revision of fdp positions , " he said .
" instead , it 's about evolution .
the new party platform is supposed to be worked on until 2012 .
we should take our time . "
but there are elements of the party that are already making changes .
the state of baden wuerttemberg 's fdp has already passed its own platform .
" when the disciplinary force of competition does not take hold … or is impeded by unfair conduct , the state has the mandate to regulate and intervene if necessary in the economy , " the new platform reads .

makhachkala 's police chief said the bomber detonated the explosives at the gates to the station after a squad car had prevented him from driving through .

" rising threats and attacks on humanitarian operations , as well as the imposition of a string of unacceptable demands from armed groups , have made it virtually impossible for the world food programme -lrb- wfp -rrb- to continue reaching up to one million people in need in southern somalia , " the agency said in a statement .
it further said the agency was " deeply concerned about rising hunger and suffering among the most vulnerable due to these unprecedented and inhumane attacks on purely humanitarian operations . "

despite being forced out of the south , the wfp , which has played a major role in international efforts to contain a humanitarian crisis in the war and drought-ravaged country , says it will continue activities in northern and central regions .
the militants , who have pledged allegiance to al qaeda , have the south tightly under their control .
they want to rid the region of foreign aid workers altogether and have imposed strict operating conditions in a bid to do so . rule-book for aid workers towards the end of last year , al shabab drew up a list of rules for international humanitarian groups to comply with .
these included a twice annual registration fee of 13,000 euros -lrb- $ 20,000 -rrb- .
the rules , obtained by the afp news agency , state that aid organizations " should distance -lsb- themselves -rsb- from anything that will affect proper islamic culture … like prompting adultery and establishing women 's groups . "

he is one of the originators of the new growth theory and has been awarded the horst claus recktenwald prize in economics .
he was named one of the 25 most influential americans by time magazine .
he currently devotes all his time to his new project , " charter cities . "
deutsche welle : you have developed a new concept which you believe can reduce global poverty and empower underprivileged people better than traditional development policies can .
in a nutshell , what is your idea of the charter city ?
paul romer : one thing that we know works extremely well for raising standards of living and wages for people is to let them move from countries that have bad rules to countries that have better rules .
now there are n't that many spaces in countries with good rules to take hundreds of millions of people , so the charter city idea is to create places that have good quality rules where hundreds of millions of people could go .
you argue that a good system of rules as is found in most western societies is the key to economic prosperity and that such a rules-based system is attractive for people everywhere and therefore can basically be transplanted anywhere .
how do you respond to critics who say you underestimate cultural and historical factors , and that therefore charter cities may not be viable on a large scale ?
we know that people want access to these kinds of rule systems .
seven hundred million people around the world have said in response to survey questions that they would like to move permanently to a different country .
so people want this .
if you start with uninhabited land and invite people in to live under a new system of rules those rules can very quickly take hold and thrive .
another criticism of your idea of the charter city is that it is essentially colonialism revisited .
no one is forced to move or live in your charter city , and everyone is free to leave again , but essentially western countries are once again financing , setting up and running places where poor people can only come to sell their labor .
how do you counter that criticism ?
if you think about the question , picture someone from a very poor country , a family , a couple of young children , a father and a mother , and picture them moving to munich or zurich or vancouver .
we do n't think of that as colonial ; we think of that as something that gives them opportunities that they really want .
and this proposal is no more than saying if we ca n't let hundreds of millions of people go to those cities , let 's create some new cities that are run like those cities where large numbers of people could go .
as examples of possible charter cities you mention a canadian charter project in cuba , an australian project with indonesia or a project in india .
but how could a charter city work in the countries that really need help the most , i.e. the poorest countries in the world like eritrea or somalia ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hong kong is a well known historic example of a charter city the example of cuba and canada is not so much a literal proposal as a way to picture how this could work .
there happens to be a piece of land in cuba where by treaty cuba gave someone else the right to administer that land .
guantanamo bay is actually administered by the united states .
so countries like somalia or eritrea and other countries like that could sign treaties where relatively small pieces of land were assigned to other countries or perhaps a consortium of countries to set up new systems of rules there and create new cities in much the same way that the british created hong kong in a place where before they came no one lived .
for your concept to work , you need countries or private corporations to make large-scale investments .
those investors , of course , want to see a return on their investment .
how do you intend to attract investors for such a venture with an all but certain outcome , and on the other hand , how do you make sure that the investors are not merely trying to make a quick profit ?
this is why the rules are so important .
rules matter for families , because they want their children to be safe , they want to have a chance to get a job , they want rules that set up a good educational system .
but the rules also matter for investors .
a firm might come in and build a power system for a new city like this or build the infrastructure .
firms are quite willing to take market risks . what firms do not want to undertake is political risk , the risk that some government will just expropriate their property or suddenly enact policies that destroy the value of their investments .
so what the partner governments can do is make a credible commitment to rules that will remain in place for decades so that not only workers and families are attracted , but also investors and employers .
you 've been promoting the concept of charter cities since last year and have received lots of praise but also criticism for your idea .
has any country so far signed up to your idea ?
are there any concrete plans to develop the first charter city ?
there are preliminary conversations with various governments .
i tried this idea on possible participants in an arrangement like this and the reaction has been very positive .
the most surprising thing i 've learned is that the developing countries are very open to this idea .
they have seen how special zones were very effective development strategies - in china in particular - and they have seen how fast growth can take place when you get policy right .
china is now the new standard that countries are aspiring to and they are willing to try new things to get the kind of growth that they see in china .
-lsb- but -rsb- i think this would be an opportunity for governments that have not been as active on the world stage , including the government of germany , to really establish a whole new way of interacting with the rest of the world as a partner that could be distinctive and very beneficial .
what role could germany play in your concept of a charter city as a country with a comparatively brief colonial history ? one of the things that is interesting is that germany has relatively good ties with some of its former colonies , like namibia for example .
so as opposed to other countries where there is lingering resentment and bad feeling , there 's good feeling about the benefits that some of these countries receive from the german people .
so i think this good will is an asset that you could put to work in the future .
how has the development community reacted to your proposal , since you believe that the charter city could benefit more people across the globe than classical development aid can ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mauritius is considered a role model for the concept of a successful charter city i think the right way to describe it is that the reactions have been somewhat polarized .
on the one hand , there are many people who perceive the magnitude of the problem and the very slow pace of resolving that problem and who say your idea is very unusual and different , but it might be worth a try , because what we are doing right now is n't getting us where we want to go .
there are other people who are much more concerned , who say this is a very different approach , and it 's too risky , and we should n't try this .
but i think this gets the balance of the risks wrong .
i think the biggest risk is that we persist with the conditions that we now have in many parts of the world , where there are hundreds of millions of people who are desperate to go someplace where they can put their energies to work and create a better future for their children .
so i think there is very little risk in trying something different and we should be braver and we should have more imagination in solving this really pressing human problem .

plugged intersections , massive traffic jams and total parking chaos are daily nightmares for drivers in the country 's larger cities .
but that does n't appear to be holding anyone back from buying their own car .
with more than a billion people , india offers huge potential for carmakers , including germany 's bmw , daimler and volkswagen , which are exhibiting at the indian auto show auto expo 2010 through january 11 .
the country 's car market is growing at a rate or more than 10 percent a year , and there 's plenty of room for further expansion . analysts estimate that only 11 in 1,000 indian citizens currently owns a car .
in germany , by comparison , that proportion is more than 500 to 1,000 , according to the german association of the automotive industry -lrb- vda -rrb- .
" it is a rising market , " said rajiv kaul , chief organizer of auto expo .
" although the number of people who can afford -lrb- a car -rrb- as a percentage is small , in absolute numbers it 's increasing quite rapidly .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tata models like the nanoo are tailor-made to the indian market compact models in demand today , two indian auto manufacturers dominate indian streets : maruti suzuki and tata .
combined , they sell more than a million cars a year , with maruti suzuki the market leader .
the big sellers are compact models equipped with special features , such as modified suspension for rough roads , and engines customized for city driving .
but german carmakers , particularly vw , hope to carve out a sizable chunk of the budding indian car market .
after years of delay , vw opened up a new plant in pune in early 2009 .
the first vehicle to roll of the assembly line in the new plant will be new affordable version of its polo , tailored for the indian market .
the compact model on display at the auto show in new delhi is scheduled to hit indian roads in march .
vw is also rumored to be in talks with maruti suzuki about the joint development of a new , low-cost car .
the rumors , which began in late december , came on the heels of the german carmaker 's acquisition of a 19.9 percent stake in japan 's suzuki .
bildunterschrift : indian dancers perform at the launch of the new volkswagen polo " a sense of commitment " " volkswagen has done extremely well in china , being the first there , " said jayant davar , president of india 's automotive component manufacturers association .
" here , i think , they lost the advantage of being a first mover but they are coming into india with large investments and there is definitely a sense of commitment . "
luxury carmakers bmw and daimler also aim to expand their business in india .
the bavarian manufacturer unveiled two new models targeted at indians with deep pockets .
although daimler has been a player in the indian market since the early 1990s , the company has been more successful selling trucks than cars .

he is one of the originators of the new growth theory and has been awarded the horst claus recktenwald prize in economics .
he was named one of the 25 most influential americans by time magazine .
he currently devotes all his time to his new project , " charter cities . "
deutsche welle : you have developed a new concept which you believe can reduce global poverty and empower underprivileged people better than traditional development policies can .
in a nutshell , what is your idea of the charter city ?
paul romer : one thing that we know works extremely well for raising standards of living and wages for people is to let them move from countries that have bad rules to countries that have better rules .
now there are n't that many spaces in countries with good rules to take hundreds of millions of people , so the charter city idea is to create places that have good quality rules where hundreds of millions of people could go .
you argue that a good system of rules as is found in most western societies is the key to economic prosperity and that such a rules-based system is attractive for people everywhere and therefore can basically be transplanted anywhere .
how do you respond to critics who say you underestimate cultural and historical factors , and that therefore charter cities may not be viable on a large scale ?
we know that people want access to these kinds of rule systems .
seven hundred million people around the world have said in response to survey questions that they would like to move permanently to a different country .
so people want this .
if you start with uninhabited land and invite people in to live under a new system of rules those rules can very quickly take hold and thrive .
another criticism of your idea of the charter city is that it is essentially colonialism revisited .
no one is forced to move or live in your charter city , and everyone is free to leave again , but essentially western countries are once again financing , setting up and running places where poor people can only come to sell their labor .
how do you counter that criticism ?
if you think about the question , picture someone from a very poor country , a family , a couple of young children , a father and a mother , and picture them moving to munich or zurich or vancouver .
we do n't think of that as colonial ; we think of that as something that gives them opportunities that they really want .
and this proposal is no more than saying if we ca n't let hundreds of millions of people go to those cities , let 's create some new cities that are run like those cities where large numbers of people could go .
as examples of possible charter cities you mention a canadian charter project in cuba , an australian project with indonesia or a project in india .
but how could a charter city work in the countries that really need help the most , i.e. the poorest countries in the world like eritrea or somalia ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hong kong is a well known historic example of a charter city the example of cuba and canada is not so much a literal proposal as a way to picture how this could work .
there happens to be a piece of land in cuba where by treaty cuba gave someone else the right to administer that land .
guantanamo bay is actually administered by the united states .
so countries like somalia or eritrea and other countries like that could sign treaties where relatively small pieces of land were assigned to other countries or perhaps a consortium of countries to set up new systems of rules there and create new cities in much the same way that the british created hong kong in a place where before they came no one lived .
for your concept to work , you need countries or private corporations to make large-scale investments .
those investors , of course , want to see a return on their investment .
how do you intend to attract investors for such a venture with an all but certain outcome , and on the other hand , how do you make sure that the investors are not merely trying to make a quick profit ?
this is why the rules are so important .
rules matter for families , because they want their children to be safe , they want to have a chance to get a job , they want rules that set up a good educational system .
but the rules also matter for investors .
a firm might come in and build a power system for a new city like this or build the infrastructure .
firms are quite willing to take market risks . what firms do not want to undertake is political risk , the risk that some government will just expropriate their property or suddenly enact policies that destroy the value of their investments .
so what the partner governments can do is make a credible commitment to rules that will remain in place for decades so that not only workers and families are attracted , but also investors and employers .
you 've been promoting the concept of charter cities since last year and have received lots of praise but also criticism for your idea .
has any country so far signed up to your idea ?
are there any concrete plans to develop the first charter city ?
there are preliminary conversations with various governments .
i tried this idea on possible participants in an arrangement like this and the reaction has been very positive .
the most surprising thing i 've learned is that the developing countries are very open to this idea .
they have seen how special zones were very effective development strategies - in china in particular - and they have seen how fast growth can take place when you get policy right .
china is now the new standard that countries are aspiring to and they are willing to try new things to get the kind of growth that they see in china .
-lsb- but -rsb- i think this would be an opportunity for governments that have not been as active on the world stage , including the government of germany , to really establish a whole new way of interacting with the rest of the world as a partner that could be distinctive and very beneficial .
what role could germany play in your concept of a charter city as a country with a comparatively brief colonial history ? one of the things that is interesting is that germany has relatively good ties with some of its former colonies , like namibia for example .
so as opposed to other countries where there is lingering resentment and bad feeling , there 's good feeling about the benefits that some of these countries receive from the german people .
so i think this good will is an asset that you could put to work in the future .
how has the development community reacted to your proposal , since you believe that the charter city could benefit more people across the globe than classical development aid can ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mauritius is considered a role model for the concept of a successful charter city i think the right way to describe it is that the reactions have been somewhat polarized .
on the one hand , there are many people who perceive the magnitude of the problem and the very slow pace of resolving that problem and who say your idea is very unusual and different , but it might be worth a try , because what we are doing right now is n't getting us where we want to go .
there are other people who are much more concerned , who say this is a very different approach , and it 's too risky , and we should n't try this .
but i think this gets the balance of the risks wrong .
i think the biggest risk is that we persist with the conditions that we now have in many parts of the world , where there are hundreds of millions of people who are desperate to go someplace where they can put their energies to work and create a better future for their children .
so i think there is very little risk in trying something different and we should be braver and we should have more imagination in solving this really pressing human problem .

with more than a billion people , india offers huge potential for carmakers , including germany 's bmw , daimler and volkswagen , which are exhibiting at the indian auto show auto expo 2010 through january 11 .
the country 's car market is growing at a rate or more than 10 percent a year , and there 's plenty of room for further expansion . analysts estimate that only 11 in 1,000 indian citizens currently owns a car .
in germany , by comparison , that proportion is more than 500 to 1,000 , according to the german association of the automotive industry -lrb- vda -rrb- .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 06.01.2010 berlin coalition partners lock horns at strategy meetings großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they 're coalition partners , whether they like it or not after a bumpy start in 2009 , germany 's new government would be well-advised to display more harmony .
but loud words seemed to rule the day at separate strategy meetings of the fdp and csu . the snow-covered hilltops of the southern german region around wildbad kreuth convey the impression of a place full of bliss and harmony .
but these days , harmony is solely left to mother nature .
everyone who matters in bavaria 's christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- - the sister party of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- - has flocked to the palace-like building at kreuth .
firing broadsides at both friend and foe has become an entertaining tradition at the csu 's three-day strategy meeting .
tax policies under fire the saber-rattling started wednesday morning , when csu head horst seehofer said his party had no reason to feel humble just because it had lost its absolute majority support in bavaria for the first time in its history .
seehofer attacked the free democrats ' -lrb- fdp -rrb- resolve to allow for 24 billion euros -lrb- $ 34.5 billion -rrb- in tax reductions as of 2011 despite the country facing record public debts , to be further increased by astronomic fresh borrowing this year .

at their own gathering in stuttgart on wednesday , the pro-business fdp did n't wait long before responding to the verbal attack .
fdp floor leader birgit homburger said it was strange that the csu was so forgetful .

body scanners not to everyone 's liking but tax policies are not the only bone of contention that berlin 's coalition partners almost seem to choke on these days .
there 's a controversy about whether or not body scanners should be used at german airports to increase security , with the fdp being far more concerned about any potential dignity issues than chancellor merkel 's conservatives .
and at least two foreign policy issues have shown time and again that the coalition partners are far from speaking with one voice .
number one is afghanistan , and with it the debate over whether germany should send in thousands of more troops in line with us president barack obama 's request to nato allies .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 06.01.2010 berlin coalition partners lock horns at strategy meetings großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they 're coalition partners , whether they like it or not after a bumpy start in 2009 , germany 's new government would be well-advised to display more harmony .
but loud words seemed to rule the day at separate strategy meetings of the fdp and csu . the snow-covered hilltops of the southern german region around wildbad kreuth convey the impression of a place full of bliss and harmony .
but these days , harmony is solely left to mother nature .
everyone who matters in bavaria 's christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- - the sister party of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- - has flocked to the palace-like building at kreuth .
firing broadsides at both friend and foe has become an entertaining tradition at the csu 's three-day strategy meeting .
tax policies under fire the saber-rattling started wednesday morning , when csu head horst seehofer said his party had no reason to feel humble just because it had lost its absolute majority support in bavaria for the first time in its history .
seehofer attacked the free democrats ' -lrb- fdp -rrb- resolve to allow for 24 billion euros -lrb- $ 34.5 billion -rrb- in tax reductions as of 2011 despite the country facing record public debts , to be further increased by astronomic fresh borrowing this year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : csu head horst seehofer sees no reason to feel humble " i 'm sure the fdp will still learn what it means to assume government responsibility , " seehofer quipped in a statement directed at the conservatives ' coalition partner in berlin .
at their own gathering in stuttgart on wednesday , the pro-business fdp did n't wait long before responding to the verbal attack .
fdp floor leader birgit homburger said it was strange that the csu was so forgetful .
she recalled that all sides had agreed on tax reductions during coalition talks last year .
" we looked very hard at where taxes could be lowered and what measures could be financed and justified .
so why 's so much fuss being made about it now ? " , homburger asked in stuttgart .
body scanners not to everyone 's liking but tax policies are not the only bone of contention that berlin 's coalition partners almost seem to choke on these days .
there 's a controversy about whether or not body scanners should be used at german airports to increase security , with the fdp being far more concerned about any potential dignity issues than chancellor merkel 's conservatives .
and at least two foreign policy issues have shown time and again that the coalition partners are far from speaking with one voice .
number one is afghanistan , and with it the debate over whether germany should send in thousands of more troops in line with us president barack obama 's request to nato allies .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erika steinbach remains a controversial figure and then there 's the unresolved question of how to deal with erika steinbach , who heads germany 's federation of expellees -lrb- bdv -rrb- , a group which represents germans expelled from eastern europe after 1945 .
steinbach angered poland by not accepting the bilateral border treaty after german unification in 1990 .
her initial resolve to become a board member of a museum for european expellees has also caused an outcry in warsaw .
the conservatives and the fdp seem divided over how to deal with steinbach 's recent proposal to renounce the post in return for boosting the federation of expellees ' say in the museum work. hg / dpa / reuters / ap editor : trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de fdp meets to discuss party 's direction as efforts to cut taxes stall part of the ruling government for the first time in years , the free-market liberal fdp looked set to put its tax-lowering promises into action .
but as the new coalition stumbles , the fdp must re-evaluate its agenda .
-lrb- 06.01.2010 -rrb- steinbach offers to give up candidacy in compromise deal a vocal advocate for germans expelled from eastern europe after 1945 , erika steinbach has offered to withdraw her candidacy for a key post in a controversial museum that has strained ties between germany and poland .
-lrb- 05.01.2010 -rrb- cracks widening in german coalition government only two months after being sworn in , chancellor angela merkel 's coalition government is finding it increasingly difficult to paint over differences on issues ranging from tax cuts to anti-terror measures .
-lrb- 03.01.2010 -rrb- audios and videos on the topic it 's been a rocky start for germany 's coalition of conservatives and liberals -lrb- 30.12.2009 -rrb- feedback should coalition partners air their differences in public ?

with budget deficits a problem across the bloc , member nations said the 3.7-percent raise was too high . the european commission officially decided to take european union member states to court over their refusal to accept a 3.7-percent pay raise for eu employees , announced commission spokeswoman pia ahrenkilde hansen on wednesday in brussels .
the decision was unanimously made by the 27 commissioners , hansen said .
the court complaint pits the european council , which is the collective entity for the 27 member states , against the commission , the bloc 's executive , in the luxembourg-based european court of justice .
it 's a battle that may prove embarrassing to the eu at a time when the bloc is attempting to rebrand itself after passing the lisbon reform treaty .
formula determines salaries the salaries of eu bureaucrats are calculated with a complex and legally binding formula that incorporates pay levels in brussels and eight of the eu 's wealthiest countries .
but with some national governments cutting their own civil servants ' pay amid ongoing economic difficulties , member countries decided to approve only a 1.85 percent increase .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : now the eu 's court of justice will decide how big a raise the employees get the commission would have none of it .
" we are talking here about the respect for agreed rules , " spokeswoman hansen said .
" it is not an issue where political discretion is at play . "
according to the commission , some 50,000 eu employees and contract staff at the commission , parliament , council and court are due the 3.7-percent raise , including the judges who will hear the case .
the basic gross income of these workers ranges from 2,550 euros -lrb- $ 3,800 -rrb- a month to 17,700 euros -lrb- $ 25,373 -rrb- .
the salaries are paid out from the eu 's central budget , which is ultimately funded by taxpayers in member countries .
the commission has asked the court for a speedy decision , to be made within six months .
however , the case could drag on for more than a year , during which the 1.85-percent raise would take effect. hf / afp / dpa editor : trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

mackay , writing in an article coauthored by royal navy commander steve tatham and published by the british ministry of defense ’ s -lrb- mod -rrb- defense academy , called for fresh thinking on the battlefield and highlighted a need for more focus on " behaviorist " strategy when dealing with the complex structure of afghan society . he added that the military " consistently failed " to understand the motivations of local afghans which was undermining western efforts while strengthening the resistance , saying that western efforts had to focus on understanding the culture , economy and psychology of the taliban if allied forces were to be truly successful in battle . " many of the choices that are currently presented are too stark : poppy bad / wheat good ; taliban evil / isaf good and so on , " mackay wrote .
" the reality is that we have consistently failed to understand that what seems to us as irrational behavior is entirely rational to the individual facing tough choices . " " we have sought to advance the idea that alongside kinetic power there is potentially a more behaviorist approach which , we believe , can affect the enemy 's will and be as , or arguably more , effective than kinetic power in future conflict , " mackay added . ignoring the mistakes of the past bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mackay believes more local understanding is required samina ahmed , the project director for the south asia department of the international crisis group in islamabad , says that while western knowledge of afghanistan was shaped largely by the anti-soviet jihad and hence unrelated to current day afghan dynamics , other factors have proved more costly . " it is less the lack of knowledge about afghanistan that has contributed to instability and an ineffectual military campaign as a propensity to repeatedly seek short cuts that have backfired , instead of a focus on institution building that would pay long term dividends and the failure , when the ground was ripe , to provide adequate military and economic resources , " she told deutsche welle . ahmed also pointed out that when the taliban were ousted , the afghan people fully supported the intervention in the hope that the western presence would restore and underwrite peace and help to rebuild their war-torn land .
instead , she claimed , the west and its allies failed to understand the need then to buttress institutions , instead of relying on individuals , including warlords , and providing the economic goods . " if the taliban are to be deprived of support , then the west must shun short-cuts that will only undercut political stability , for instance by supporting selected warlords and their militias , instead of building a professional military as well as a police force that is capable of protecting the citizen , " she said .
" in short , a state that is capable of protecting the lives of its citizens and providing basic services is the only way in which violent extremism can be defeated in afghanistan . " west accused of stagnation in face of evolving conflict bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : roadside bombs have proved to be an effective weapon mackay also accused senior military officers of being " institutionally incapable of keeping pace with rapid change and the associated willingness to adapt - and quickly - at the same time . " western efforts in dealing with the counter-insurgency , he said , had a sense of " making it up as we go along " and that there was a serious lack of clear direction from senior officers .

mackay , writing in an article coauthored by royal navy commander steve tatham and published by the british ministry of defense ’ s -lrb- mod -rrb- defense academy , called for fresh thinking on the battlefield and highlighted a need for more focus on " behaviorist " strategy when dealing with the complex structure of afghan society . he added that the military " consistently failed " to understand the motivations of local afghans which was undermining western efforts while strengthening the resistance , saying that western efforts had to focus on understanding the culture , economy and psychology of the taliban if allied forces were to be truly successful in battle . " many of the choices that are currently presented are too stark : poppy bad / wheat good ; taliban evil / isaf good and so on , " mackay wrote .
" the reality is that we have consistently failed to understand that what seems to us as irrational behavior is entirely rational to the individual facing tough choices . " " we have sought to advance the idea that alongside kinetic power there is potentially a more behaviorist approach which , we believe , can affect the enemy 's will and be as , or arguably more , effective than kinetic power in future conflict , " mackay added . ignoring the mistakes of the past bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mackay believes more local understanding is required samina ahmed , the project director for the south asia department of the international crisis group in islamabad , says that while western knowledge of afghanistan was shaped largely by the anti-soviet jihad and hence unrelated to current day afghan dynamics , other factors have proved more costly . " it is less the lack of knowledge about afghanistan that has contributed to instability and an ineffectual military campaign as a propensity to repeatedly seek short cuts that have backfired , instead of a focus on institution building that would pay long term dividends and the failure , when the ground was ripe , to provide adequate military and economic resources , " she told deutsche welle . ahmed also pointed out that when the taliban were ousted , the afghan people fully supported the intervention in the hope that the western presence would restore and underwrite peace and help to rebuild their war-torn land .
instead , she claimed , the west and its allies failed to understand the need then to buttress institutions , instead of relying on individuals , including warlords , and providing the economic goods . " if the taliban are to be deprived of support , then the west must shun short-cuts that will only undercut political stability , for instance by supporting selected warlords and their militias , instead of building a professional military as well as a police force that is capable of protecting the citizen , " she said .
" in short , a state that is capable of protecting the lives of its citizens and providing basic services is the only way in which violent extremism can be defeated in afghanistan . " west accused of stagnation in face of evolving conflict bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : roadside bombs have proved to be an effective weapon mackay also accused senior military officers of being " institutionally incapable of keeping pace with rapid change and the associated willingness to adapt - and quickly - at the same time . " western efforts in dealing with the counter-insurgency , he said , had a sense of " making it up as we go along " and that there was a serious lack of clear direction from senior officers .
he also suggested that military planners had been educated by a system designed for a previous age and could not adapt to current and future challenges . giles merritt , the director of the security & defence agenda think-tank in brussels , agrees that western forces are suffering from a lack of clear direction . " we are losing but we 're not losing for military reasons not for strategic reasons , " merritt told deutsche welle .

mackay , writing in an article coauthored by royal navy commander steve tatham and published by the british ministry of defense ’ s -lrb- mod -rrb- defense academy , called for fresh thinking on the battlefield and highlighted a need for more focus on " behaviorist " strategy when dealing with the complex structure of afghan society . he added that the military " consistently failed " to understand the motivations of local afghans which was undermining western efforts while strengthening the resistance , saying that western efforts had to focus on understanding the culture , economy and psychology of the taliban if allied forces were to be truly successful in battle . " many of the choices that are currently presented are too stark : poppy bad / wheat good ; taliban evil / isaf good and so on , " mackay wrote .
" the reality is that we have consistently failed to understand that what seems to us as irrational behavior is entirely rational to the individual facing tough choices . " " we have sought to advance the idea that alongside kinetic power there is potentially a more behaviorist approach which , we believe , can affect the enemy 's will and be as , or arguably more , effective than kinetic power in future conflict , " mackay added . ignoring the mistakes of the past bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mackay believes more local understanding is required samina ahmed , the project director for the south asia department of the international crisis group in islamabad , says that while western knowledge of afghanistan was shaped largely by the anti-soviet jihad and hence unrelated to current day afghan dynamics , other factors have proved more costly . " it is less the lack of knowledge about afghanistan that has contributed to instability and an ineffectual military campaign as a propensity to repeatedly seek short cuts that have backfired , instead of a focus on institution building that would pay long term dividends and the failure , when the ground was ripe , to provide adequate military and economic resources , " she told deutsche welle . ahmed also pointed out that when the taliban were ousted , the afghan people fully supported the intervention in the hope that the western presence would restore and underwrite peace and help to rebuild their war-torn land .
instead , she claimed , the west and its allies failed to understand the need then to buttress institutions , instead of relying on individuals , including warlords , and providing the economic goods . " if the taliban are to be deprived of support , then the west must shun short-cuts that will only undercut political stability , for instance by supporting selected warlords and their militias , instead of building a professional military as well as a police force that is capable of protecting the citizen , " she said .
" in short , a state that is capable of protecting the lives of its citizens and providing basic services is the only way in which violent extremism can be defeated in afghanistan . " west accused of stagnation in face of evolving conflict bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : roadside bombs have proved to be an effective weapon mackay also accused senior military officers of being " institutionally incapable of keeping pace with rapid change and the associated willingness to adapt - and quickly - at the same time . " western efforts in dealing with the counter-insurgency , he said , had a sense of " making it up as we go along " and that there was a serious lack of clear direction from senior officers .
he also suggested that military planners had been educated by a system designed for a previous age and could not adapt to current and future challenges . giles merritt , the director of the security & defence agenda think-tank in brussels , agrees that western forces are suffering from a lack of clear direction . " we are losing but we 're not losing for military reasons not for strategic reasons , " merritt told deutsche welle .
" we do n't have a clear plan , we do n't know how to assess if we 're winning or losing except in terms of body count , and we do n't have a big picture .
you hold a bit of ground here , we reduce the level of instability there but we 're not really working towards a clearly defined goal . " merritt does not believe , however , that military planners are incapable of adapting to the conflict in afghanistan - mainly becaue the tactics and the approach of the taliban has changed little since coalition forces invaded in 2001 . " the taliban have n't actually changed since the 1930 's , " merritt said .
" they 're incredibly patient .
they wait to see what the weaknesses are , what the chinks in the armor are and then they exploit them .
i do n't think there has been an enormous change in the taliban 's tactics at all and the west have certainly not been surprised by them .
so they fight a war of attrition with roadside bombs and ambushes .
this was to be expected . " time to talk to the taliban ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us would be suspicious of any taliban settlement offer the growing concern over the western approach in afghanistan and the alleged failure by allied forces to get a grip on the methods employed by the taliban in its counter-insurgency has given rise to cautious suggestions that direct negotiations may be the only way to end the war . government sources in the us refused to confirm or deny whether washington would deal with the taliban but defense secretary robert gates was quoted as saying that he believed the taliban would only contemplate an agreement if they had first been forced into believing they would lose the war . " the taliban leadership is currently disinclined to negotiate because it believes the west has n't the will to stay on in afghanistan , " samina ahmed said . " until the taliban are willing to negotiate , there is no question of defining terms or demands .
however , should such an opportunity arise , then the minimum demands should include acceptance of the afghan constitution and a willingness to give up arms .

" if the taliban are to be deprived of support , then the west must shun short-cuts that will only undercut political stability , for instance by supporting selected warlords and their militias , instead of building a professional military as well as a police force that is capable of protecting the citizen , " she said .
" in short , a state that is capable of protecting the lives of its citizens and providing basic services is the only way in which violent extremism can be defeated in afghanistan . " west accused of stagnation in face of evolving conflict bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : roadside bombs have proved to be an effective weapon mackay also accused senior military officers of being " institutionally incapable of keeping pace with rapid change and the associated willingness to adapt - and quickly - at the same time . " western efforts in dealing with the counter-insurgency , he said , had a sense of " making it up as we go along " and that there was a serious lack of clear direction from senior officers .
he also suggested that military planners had been educated by a system designed for a previous age and could not adapt to current and future challenges . giles merritt , the director of the security & defence agenda think-tank in brussels , agrees that western forces are suffering from a lack of clear direction . " we are losing but we 're not losing for military reasons not for strategic reasons , " merritt told deutsche welle .
" we do n't have a clear plan , we do n't know how to assess if we 're winning or losing except in terms of body count , and we do n't have a big picture .
you hold a bit of ground here , we reduce the level of instability there but we 're not really working towards a clearly defined goal . " merritt does not believe , however , that military planners are incapable of adapting to the conflict in afghanistan - mainly becaue the tactics and the approach of the taliban has changed little since coalition forces invaded in 2001 . " the taliban have n't actually changed since the 1930 's , " merritt said .
" they 're incredibly patient .
they wait to see what the weaknesses are , what the chinks in the armor are and then they exploit them .
i do n't think there has been an enormous change in the taliban 's tactics at all and the west have certainly not been surprised by them .
so they fight a war of attrition with roadside bombs and ambushes .
this was to be expected . " time to talk to the taliban ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us would be suspicious of any taliban settlement offer the growing concern over the western approach in afghanistan and the alleged failure by allied forces to get a grip on the methods employed by the taliban in its counter-insurgency has given rise to cautious suggestions that direct negotiations may be the only way to end the war . government sources in the us refused to confirm or deny whether washington would deal with the taliban but defense secretary robert gates was quoted as saying that he believed the taliban would only contemplate an agreement if they had first been forced into believing they would lose the war . " the taliban leadership is currently disinclined to negotiate because it believes the west has n't the will to stay on in afghanistan , " samina ahmed said . " until the taliban are willing to negotiate , there is no question of defining terms or demands .
however , should such an opportunity arise , then the minimum demands should include acceptance of the afghan constitution and a willingness to give up arms .

mackay , writing in an article coauthored by royal navy commander steve tatham and published by the british ministry of defense ’ s -lrb- mod -rrb- defense academy , called for fresh thinking on the battlefield and highlighted a need for more focus on " behaviorist " strategy when dealing with the complex structure of afghan society . he added that the military " consistently failed " to understand the motivations of local afghans which was undermining western efforts while strengthening the resistance , saying that western efforts had to focus on understanding the culture , economy and psychology of the taliban if allied forces were to be truly successful in battle . " many of the choices that are currently presented are too stark : poppy bad / wheat good ; taliban evil / isaf good and so on , " mackay wrote .
" the reality is that we have consistently failed to understand that what seems to us as irrational behavior is entirely rational to the individual facing tough choices . " " we have sought to advance the idea that alongside kinetic power there is potentially a more behaviorist approach which , we believe , can affect the enemy 's will and be as , or arguably more , effective than kinetic power in future conflict , " mackay added . ignoring the mistakes of the past bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mackay believes more local understanding is required samina ahmed , the project director for the south asia department of the international crisis group in islamabad , says that while western knowledge of afghanistan was shaped largely by the anti-soviet jihad and hence unrelated to current day afghan dynamics , other factors have proved more costly . " it is less the lack of knowledge about afghanistan that has contributed to instability and an ineffectual military campaign as a propensity to repeatedly seek short cuts that have backfired , instead of a focus on institution building that would pay long term dividends and the failure , when the ground was ripe , to provide adequate military and economic resources , " she told deutsche welle . ahmed also pointed out that when the taliban were ousted , the afghan people fully supported the intervention in the hope that the western presence would restore and underwrite peace and help to rebuild their war-torn land .

mackay , writing in an article coauthored by royal navy commander steve tatham and published by the british ministry of defense ’ s -lrb- mod -rrb- defense academy , called for fresh thinking on the battlefield and highlighted a need for more focus on " behaviorist " strategy when dealing with the complex structure of afghan society . he added that the military " consistently failed " to understand the motivations of local afghans which was undermining western efforts while strengthening the resistance , saying that western efforts had to focus on understanding the culture , economy and psychology of the taliban if allied forces were to be truly successful in battle . " many of the choices that are currently presented are too stark : poppy bad / wheat good ; taliban evil / isaf good and so on , " mackay wrote .
" the reality is that we have consistently failed to understand that what seems to us as irrational behavior is entirely rational to the individual facing tough choices . " " we have sought to advance the idea that alongside kinetic power there is potentially a more behaviorist approach which , we believe , can affect the enemy 's will and be as , or arguably more , effective than kinetic power in future conflict , " mackay added . ignoring the mistakes of the past bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mackay believes more local understanding is required samina ahmed , the project director for the south asia department of the international crisis group in islamabad , says that while western knowledge of afghanistan was shaped largely by the anti-soviet jihad and hence unrelated to current day afghan dynamics , other factors have proved more costly . " it is less the lack of knowledge about afghanistan that has contributed to instability and an ineffectual military campaign as a propensity to repeatedly seek short cuts that have backfired , instead of a focus on institution building that would pay long term dividends and the failure , when the ground was ripe , to provide adequate military and economic resources , " she told deutsche welle . ahmed also pointed out that when the taliban were ousted , the afghan people fully supported the intervention in the hope that the western presence would restore and underwrite peace and help to rebuild their war-torn land .
instead , she claimed , the west and its allies failed to understand the need then to buttress institutions , instead of relying on individuals , including warlords , and providing the economic goods . " if the taliban are to be deprived of support , then the west must shun short-cuts that will only undercut political stability , for instance by supporting selected warlords and their militias , instead of building a professional military as well as a police force that is capable of protecting the citizen , " she said .
" in short , a state that is capable of protecting the lives of its citizens and providing basic services is the only way in which violent extremism can be defeated in afghanistan . " west accused of stagnation in face of evolving conflict bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : roadside bombs have proved to be an effective weapon mackay also accused senior military officers of being " institutionally incapable of keeping pace with rapid change and the associated willingness to adapt - and quickly - at the same time .

mackay , writing in an article coauthored by royal navy commander steve tatham and published by the british ministry of defense ’ s -lrb- mod -rrb- defense academy , called for fresh thinking on the battlefield and highlighted a need for more focus on " behaviorist " strategy when dealing with the complex structure of afghan society . he added that the military " consistently failed " to understand the motivations of local afghans which was undermining western efforts while strengthening the resistance , saying that western efforts had to focus on understanding the culture , economy and psychology of the taliban if allied forces were to be truly successful in battle . " many of the choices that are currently presented are too stark : poppy bad / wheat good ; taliban evil / isaf good and so on , " mackay wrote .
" the reality is that we have consistently failed to understand that what seems to us as irrational behavior is entirely rational to the individual facing tough choices . " " we have sought to advance the idea that alongside kinetic power there is potentially a more behaviorist approach which , we believe , can affect the enemy 's will and be as , or arguably more , effective than kinetic power in future conflict , " mackay added . ignoring the mistakes of the past bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mackay believes more local understanding is required samina ahmed , the project director for the south asia department of the international crisis group in islamabad , says that while western knowledge of afghanistan was shaped largely by the anti-soviet jihad and hence unrelated to current day afghan dynamics , other factors have proved more costly . " it is less the lack of knowledge about afghanistan that has contributed to instability and an ineffectual military campaign as a propensity to repeatedly seek short cuts that have backfired , instead of a focus on institution building that would pay long term dividends and the failure , when the ground was ripe , to provide adequate military and economic resources , " she told deutsche welle . ahmed also pointed out that when the taliban were ousted , the afghan people fully supported the intervention in the hope that the western presence would restore and underwrite peace and help to rebuild their war-torn land .
instead , she claimed , the west and its allies failed to understand the need then to buttress institutions , instead of relying on individuals , including warlords , and providing the economic goods . " if the taliban are to be deprived of support , then the west must shun short-cuts that will only undercut political stability , for instance by supporting selected warlords and their militias , instead of building a professional military as well as a police force that is capable of protecting the citizen , " she said .
" in short , a state that is capable of protecting the lives of its citizens and providing basic services is the only way in which violent extremism can be defeated in afghanistan . " west accused of stagnation in face of evolving conflict bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : roadside bombs have proved to be an effective weapon mackay also accused senior military officers of being " institutionally incapable of keeping pace with rapid change and the associated willingness to adapt - and quickly - at the same time . " western efforts in dealing with the counter-insurgency , he said , had a sense of " making it up as we go along " and that there was a serious lack of clear direction from senior officers .
he also suggested that military planners had been educated by a system designed for a previous age and could not adapt to current and future challenges . giles merritt , the director of the security & defence agenda think-tank in brussels , agrees that western forces are suffering from a lack of clear direction . " we are losing but we 're not losing for military reasons not for strategic reasons , " merritt told deutsche welle .
" we do n't have a clear plan , we do n't know how to assess if we 're winning or losing except in terms of body count , and we do n't have a big picture .
you hold a bit of ground here , we reduce the level of instability there but we 're not really working towards a clearly defined goal . " merritt does not believe , however , that military planners are incapable of adapting to the conflict in afghanistan - mainly becaue the tactics and the approach of the taliban has changed little since coalition forces invaded in 2001 . " the taliban have n't actually changed since the 1930 's , " merritt said .
" they 're incredibly patient .
they wait to see what the weaknesses are , what the chinks in the armor are and then they exploit them .
i do n't think there has been an enormous change in the taliban 's tactics at all and the west have certainly not been surprised by them .
so they fight a war of attrition with roadside bombs and ambushes .
this was to be expected . " time to talk to the taliban ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us would be suspicious of any taliban settlement offer the growing concern over the western approach in afghanistan and the alleged failure by allied forces to get a grip on the methods employed by the taliban in its counter-insurgency has given rise to cautious suggestions that direct negotiations may be the only way to end the war . government sources in the us refused to confirm or deny whether washington would deal with the taliban but defense secretary robert gates was quoted as saying that he believed the taliban would only contemplate an agreement if they had first been forced into believing they would lose the war . " the taliban leadership is currently disinclined to negotiate because it believes the west has n't the will to stay on in afghanistan , " samina ahmed said . " until the taliban are willing to negotiate , there is no question of defining terms or demands .
however , should such an opportunity arise , then the minimum demands should include acceptance of the afghan constitution and a willingness to give up arms .

everyone who matters in bavaria 's christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- - the sister party of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- - has flocked to the palace-like building at kreuth .

tax policies under fire the saber-rattling started wednesday morning , when csu head horst seehofer said his party had no reason to feel humble just because it had lost its absolute majority support in bavaria for the first time in its history .
seehofer attacked the free democrats ' -lrb- fdp -rrb- resolve to allow for 24 billion euros -lrb- $ 34.5 billion -rrb- in tax reductions as of 2011 despite the country facing record public debts , to be further increased by astronomic fresh borrowing this year .

with budget deficits a problem across the bloc , member nations said the 3.7-percent raise was too high . the european commission officially decided to take european union member states to court over their refusal to accept a 3.7-percent pay raise for eu employees , announced commission spokeswoman pia ahrenkilde hansen on wednesday in brussels .
the decision was unanimously made by the 27 commissioners , hansen said .
the court complaint pits the european council , which is the collective entity for the 27 member states , against the commission , the bloc 's executive , in the luxembourg-based european court of justice .
it 's a battle that may prove embarrassing to the eu at a time when the bloc is attempting to rebrand itself after passing the lisbon reform treaty .
formula determines salaries the salaries of eu bureaucrats are calculated with a complex and legally binding formula that incorporates pay levels in brussels and eight of the eu 's wealthiest countries .

he is one of the originators of the new growth theory and has been awarded the horst claus recktenwald prize in economics .
he was named one of the 25 most influential americans by time magazine .
he currently devotes all his time to his new project , " charter cities . "
deutsche welle : you have developed a new concept which you believe can reduce global poverty and empower underprivileged people better than traditional development policies can .
in a nutshell , what is your idea of the charter city ?
paul romer : one thing that we know works extremely well for raising standards of living and wages for people is to let them move from countries that have bad rules to countries that have better rules .
now there are n't that many spaces in countries with good rules to take hundreds of millions of people , so the charter city idea is to create places that have good quality rules where hundreds of millions of people could go .
you argue that a good system of rules as is found in most western societies is the key to economic prosperity and that such a rules-based system is attractive for people everywhere and therefore can basically be transplanted anywhere .
how do you respond to critics who say you underestimate cultural and historical factors , and that therefore charter cities may not be viable on a large scale ?
we know that people want access to these kinds of rule systems .
seven hundred million people around the world have said in response to survey questions that they would like to move permanently to a different country .
so people want this .
if you start with uninhabited land and invite people in to live under a new system of rules those rules can very quickly take hold and thrive .
another criticism of your idea of the charter city is that it is essentially colonialism revisited .
no one is forced to move or live in your charter city , and everyone is free to leave again , but essentially western countries are once again financing , setting up and running places where poor people can only come to sell their labor .
how do you counter that criticism ?
if you think about the question , picture someone from a very poor country , a family , a couple of young children , a father and a mother , and picture them moving to munich or zurich or vancouver .
we do n't think of that as colonial ; we think of that as something that gives them opportunities that they really want .
and this proposal is no more than saying if we ca n't let hundreds of millions of people go to those cities , let 's create some new cities that are run like those cities where large numbers of people could go .
as examples of possible charter cities you mention a canadian charter project in cuba , an australian project with indonesia or a project in india .
but how could a charter city work in the countries that really need help the most , i.e. the poorest countries in the world like eritrea or somalia ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hong kong is a well known historic example of a charter city the example of cuba and canada is not so much a literal proposal as a way to picture how this could work .
there happens to be a piece of land in cuba where by treaty cuba gave someone else the right to administer that land .
guantanamo bay is actually administered by the united states .
so countries like somalia or eritrea and other countries like that could sign treaties where relatively small pieces of land were assigned to other countries or perhaps a consortium of countries to set up new systems of rules there and create new cities in much the same way that the british created hong kong in a place where before they came no one lived .
for your concept to work , you need countries or private corporations to make large-scale investments .
those investors , of course , want to see a return on their investment .
how do you intend to attract investors for such a venture with an all but certain outcome , and on the other hand , how do you make sure that the investors are not merely trying to make a quick profit ?
this is why the rules are so important .
rules matter for families , because they want their children to be safe , they want to have a chance to get a job , they want rules that set up a good educational system .
but the rules also matter for investors .
a firm might come in and build a power system for a new city like this or build the infrastructure .
firms are quite willing to take market risks . what firms do not want to undertake is political risk , the risk that some government will just expropriate their property or suddenly enact policies that destroy the value of their investments .
so what the partner governments can do is make a credible commitment to rules that will remain in place for decades so that not only workers and families are attracted , but also investors and employers .
you 've been promoting the concept of charter cities since last year and have received lots of praise but also criticism for your idea .
has any country so far signed up to your idea ?
are there any concrete plans to develop the first charter city ?
there are preliminary conversations with various governments .
i tried this idea on possible participants in an arrangement like this and the reaction has been very positive .
the most surprising thing i 've learned is that the developing countries are very open to this idea .
they have seen how special zones were very effective development strategies - in china in particular - and they have seen how fast growth can take place when you get policy right .
china is now the new standard that countries are aspiring to and they are willing to try new things to get the kind of growth that they see in china .
-lsb- but -rsb- i think this would be an opportunity for governments that have not been as active on the world stage , including the government of germany , to really establish a whole new way of interacting with the rest of the world as a partner that could be distinctive and very beneficial .
what role could germany play in your concept of a charter city as a country with a comparatively brief colonial history ? one of the things that is interesting is that germany has relatively good ties with some of its former colonies , like namibia for example .
so as opposed to other countries where there is lingering resentment and bad feeling , there 's good feeling about the benefits that some of these countries receive from the german people .
so i think this good will is an asset that you could put to work in the future .
how has the development community reacted to your proposal , since you believe that the charter city could benefit more people across the globe than classical development aid can ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mauritius is considered a role model for the concept of a successful charter city i think the right way to describe it is that the reactions have been somewhat polarized .
on the one hand , there are many people who perceive the magnitude of the problem and the very slow pace of resolving that problem and who say your idea is very unusual and different , but it might be worth a try , because what we are doing right now is n't getting us where we want to go .
there are other people who are much more concerned , who say this is a very different approach , and it 's too risky , and we should n't try this .
but i think this gets the balance of the risks wrong .
i think the biggest risk is that we persist with the conditions that we now have in many parts of the world , where there are hundreds of millions of people who are desperate to go someplace where they can put their energies to work and create a better future for their children .
so i think there is very little risk in trying something different and we should be braver and we should have more imagination in solving this really pressing human problem .

-lsb- but -rsb- i think this would be an opportunity for governments that have not been as active on the world stage , including the government of germany , to really establish a whole new way of interacting with the rest of the world as a partner that could be distinctive and very beneficial .
what role could germany play in your concept of a charter city as a country with a comparatively brief colonial history ? one of the things that is interesting is that germany has relatively good ties with some of its former colonies , like namibia for example .
so as opposed to other countries where there is lingering resentment and bad feeling , there 's good feeling about the benefits that some of these countries receive from the german people .
so i think this good will is an asset that you could put to work in the future .
how has the development community reacted to your proposal , since you believe that the charter city could benefit more people across the globe than classical development aid can ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mauritius is considered a role model for the concept of a successful charter city i think the right way to describe it is that the reactions have been somewhat polarized .
on the one hand , there are many people who perceive the magnitude of the problem and the very slow pace of resolving that problem and who say your idea is very unusual and different , but it might be worth a try , because what we are doing right now is n't getting us where we want to go .
there are other people who are much more concerned , who say this is a very different approach , and it 's too risky , and we should n't try this .
but i think this gets the balance of the risks wrong .
i think the biggest risk is that we persist with the conditions that we now have in many parts of the world , where there are hundreds of millions of people who are desperate to go someplace where they can put their energies to work and create a better future for their children .
so i think there is very little risk in trying something different and we should be braver and we should have more imagination in solving this really pressing human problem .

he is one of the originators of the new growth theory and has been awarded the horst claus recktenwald prize in economics .
he was named one of the 25 most influential americans by time magazine .
he currently devotes all his time to his new project , " charter cities . "
deutsche welle : you have developed a new concept which you believe can reduce global poverty and empower underprivileged people better than traditional development policies can .
in a nutshell , what is your idea of the charter city ?
paul romer : one thing that we know works extremely well for raising standards of living and wages for people is to let them move from countries that have bad rules to countries that have better rules .
now there are n't that many spaces in countries with good rules to take hundreds of millions of people , so the charter city idea is to create places that have good quality rules where hundreds of millions of people could go .
you argue that a good system of rules as is found in most western societies is the key to economic prosperity and that such a rules-based system is attractive for people everywhere and therefore can basically be transplanted anywhere .
how do you respond to critics who say you underestimate cultural and historical factors , and that therefore charter cities may not be viable on a large scale ?
we know that people want access to these kinds of rule systems .
seven hundred million people around the world have said in response to survey questions that they would like to move permanently to a different country .
so people want this .
if you start with uninhabited land and invite people in to live under a new system of rules those rules can very quickly take hold and thrive .
another criticism of your idea of the charter city is that it is essentially colonialism revisited .
no one is forced to move or live in your charter city , and everyone is free to leave again , but essentially western countries are once again financing , setting up and running places where poor people can only come to sell their labor .
how do you counter that criticism ?
if you think about the question , picture someone from a very poor country , a family , a couple of young children , a father and a mother , and picture them moving to munich or zurich or vancouver .
we do n't think of that as colonial ; we think of that as something that gives them opportunities that they really want .
and this proposal is no more than saying if we ca n't let hundreds of millions of people go to those cities , let 's create some new cities that are run like those cities where large numbers of people could go .
as examples of possible charter cities you mention a canadian charter project in cuba , an australian project with indonesia or a project in india .
but how could a charter city work in the countries that really need help the most , i.e. the poorest countries in the world like eritrea or somalia ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hong kong is a well known historic example of a charter city the example of cuba and canada is not so much a literal proposal as a way to picture how this could work .
there happens to be a piece of land in cuba where by treaty cuba gave someone else the right to administer that land .
guantanamo bay is actually administered by the united states .
so countries like somalia or eritrea and other countries like that could sign treaties where relatively small pieces of land were assigned to other countries or perhaps a consortium of countries to set up new systems of rules there and create new cities in much the same way that the british created hong kong in a place where before they came no one lived .
for your concept to work , you need countries or private corporations to make large-scale investments .
those investors , of course , want to see a return on their investment .
how do you intend to attract investors for such a venture with an all but certain outcome , and on the other hand , how do you make sure that the investors are not merely trying to make a quick profit ?
this is why the rules are so important .
rules matter for families , because they want their children to be safe , they want to have a chance to get a job , they want rules that set up a good educational system .
but the rules also matter for investors .
a firm might come in and build a power system for a new city like this or build the infrastructure .
firms are quite willing to take market risks . what firms do not want to undertake is political risk , the risk that some government will just expropriate their property or suddenly enact policies that destroy the value of their investments .
so what the partner governments can do is make a credible commitment to rules that will remain in place for decades so that not only workers and families are attracted , but also investors and employers .
you 've been promoting the concept of charter cities since last year and have received lots of praise but also criticism for your idea .
has any country so far signed up to your idea ?
are there any concrete plans to develop the first charter city ?
there are preliminary conversations with various governments .
i tried this idea on possible participants in an arrangement like this and the reaction has been very positive .
the most surprising thing i 've learned is that the developing countries are very open to this idea .
they have seen how special zones were very effective development strategies - in china in particular - and they have seen how fast growth can take place when you get policy right .
china is now the new standard that countries are aspiring to and they are willing to try new things to get the kind of growth that they see in china .

he is one of the originators of the new growth theory and has been awarded the horst claus recktenwald prize in economics .
he was named one of the 25 most influential americans by time magazine .
he currently devotes all his time to his new project , " charter cities . "
deutsche welle : you have developed a new concept which you believe can reduce global poverty and empower underprivileged people better than traditional development policies can .
in a nutshell , what is your idea of the charter city ?
paul romer : one thing that we know works extremely well for raising standards of living and wages for people is to let them move from countries that have bad rules to countries that have better rules .
now there are n't that many spaces in countries with good rules to take hundreds of millions of people , so the charter city idea is to create places that have good quality rules where hundreds of millions of people could go .
you argue that a good system of rules as is found in most western societies is the key to economic prosperity and that such a rules-based system is attractive for people everywhere and therefore can basically be transplanted anywhere .
how do you respond to critics who say you underestimate cultural and historical factors , and that therefore charter cities may not be viable on a large scale ?
we know that people want access to these kinds of rule systems .
seven hundred million people around the world have said in response to survey questions that they would like to move permanently to a different country .
so people want this .
if you start with uninhabited land and invite people in to live under a new system of rules those rules can very quickly take hold and thrive .
another criticism of your idea of the charter city is that it is essentially colonialism revisited .
no one is forced to move or live in your charter city , and everyone is free to leave again , but essentially western countries are once again financing , setting up and running places where poor people can only come to sell their labor .
how do you counter that criticism ?
if you think about the question , picture someone from a very poor country , a family , a couple of young children , a father and a mother , and picture them moving to munich or zurich or vancouver .
we do n't think of that as colonial ; we think of that as something that gives them opportunities that they really want .
and this proposal is no more than saying if we ca n't let hundreds of millions of people go to those cities , let 's create some new cities that are run like those cities where large numbers of people could go .
as examples of possible charter cities you mention a canadian charter project in cuba , an australian project with indonesia or a project in india .
but how could a charter city work in the countries that really need help the most , i.e. the poorest countries in the world like eritrea or somalia ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hong kong is a well known historic example of a charter city the example of cuba and canada is not so much a literal proposal as a way to picture how this could work .
there happens to be a piece of land in cuba where by treaty cuba gave someone else the right to administer that land .
guantanamo bay is actually administered by the united states .
so countries like somalia or eritrea and other countries like that could sign treaties where relatively small pieces of land were assigned to other countries or perhaps a consortium of countries to set up new systems of rules there and create new cities in much the same way that the british created hong kong in a place where before they came no one lived .
for your concept to work , you need countries or private corporations to make large-scale investments .
those investors , of course , want to see a return on their investment .
how do you intend to attract investors for such a venture with an all but certain outcome , and on the other hand , how do you make sure that the investors are not merely trying to make a quick profit ?
this is why the rules are so important .
rules matter for families , because they want their children to be safe , they want to have a chance to get a job , they want rules that set up a good educational system .
but the rules also matter for investors .
a firm might come in and build a power system for a new city like this or build the infrastructure .
firms are quite willing to take market risks . what firms do not want to undertake is political risk , the risk that some government will just expropriate their property or suddenly enact policies that destroy the value of their investments .
so what the partner governments can do is make a credible commitment to rules that will remain in place for decades so that not only workers and families are attracted , but also investors and employers .
you 've been promoting the concept of charter cities since last year and have received lots of praise but also criticism for your idea .
has any country so far signed up to your idea ?
are there any concrete plans to develop the first charter city ?
there are preliminary conversations with various governments .
i tried this idea on possible participants in an arrangement like this and the reaction has been very positive .
the most surprising thing i 've learned is that the developing countries are very open to this idea .
they have seen how special zones were very effective development strategies - in china in particular - and they have seen how fast growth can take place when you get policy right .
china is now the new standard that countries are aspiring to and they are willing to try new things to get the kind of growth that they see in china .
-lsb- but -rsb- i think this would be an opportunity for governments that have not been as active on the world stage , including the government of germany , to really establish a whole new way of interacting with the rest of the world as a partner that could be distinctive and very beneficial .
what role could germany play in your concept of a charter city as a country with a comparatively brief colonial history ? one of the things that is interesting is that germany has relatively good ties with some of its former colonies , like namibia for example .
so as opposed to other countries where there is lingering resentment and bad feeling , there 's good feeling about the benefits that some of these countries receive from the german people .
so i think this good will is an asset that you could put to work in the future .
how has the development community reacted to your proposal , since you believe that the charter city could benefit more people across the globe than classical development aid can ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mauritius is considered a role model for the concept of a successful charter city i think the right way to describe it is that the reactions have been somewhat polarized .
on the one hand , there are many people who perceive the magnitude of the problem and the very slow pace of resolving that problem and who say your idea is very unusual and different , but it might be worth a try , because what we are doing right now is n't getting us where we want to go .
there are other people who are much more concerned , who say this is a very different approach , and it 's too risky , and we should n't try this .
but i think this gets the balance of the risks wrong .
i think the biggest risk is that we persist with the conditions that we now have in many parts of the world , where there are hundreds of millions of people who are desperate to go someplace where they can put their energies to work and create a better future for their children .
so i think there is very little risk in trying something different and we should be braver and we should have more imagination in solving this really pressing human problem .

but as the new coalition stumbles , the fdp must re-evaluate its agenda . germany 's free-market liberal democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- met on wednesday in stuttgart for their party meeting , held annually on january 6 .
the self-reflection session comes just a few months after the fdp joined the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- in a coalition government .
coalition negotiations between the two parties appeared to go smoothly and many of the fdp 's campaign promises made it into the coalition agreement .
the centerpiece of the policy blueprint was a plan to cut income taxes by 24 billion euros -lrb- $ 36 billion -rrb- and the parties agreed to pursue a simplification of the german tax system .
a difficult economy takes its toll but the reality of germany 's ongoing economic troubles have put a damper on the early excitement of the election .
politicians are beginning to voice their doubts , including bartholomaeus kalb , member of the cdu 's bavarian sister party the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- .
" we just wo n't have any money for tax relief or any additional expenditures for the foreseeable future , and by that i mean through the end of the legislative period , " wednesday 's edition of the financial times deutschland quoted kalb as saying .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's debt is set to continue to rise in 2010 the csu also held their annual party meeting on wednesday .
germany faces a ballooning budget deficit , with the 2010 budget approved by chancellor angela merkel 's cabinet calling for a record 85.8 billion euros in borrowed cash .
the european union has pressed germany to get its deficit under control .
as the party meets to discuss plans for 2010 , there 's been some backpedaling from fdp leaders , including economics minister rainer bruederle .
" it would be absolutely wrong to start off by cutting the budget , " he said on german radio .
fdp deputy party leader andreas pinkwart told the handelsblatt business daily this means that reaching the goals laid out in the coalition agreement might not happen for a few years .
" it 's enough if the complete 24 billion euros of relief is achieved in 2013 , " pinkwart said .
thus far only one tax cut of 8.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 123.1 billion -rrb- has been approved .
but he added that the restructuring of the tax system must begin this year .
the fdp had hoped to institute a three-tiered system with tax rates of 10 percent , 25 percent and 35 percent .
a new fdp ?
with the fdp no longer pushing for immediate tax relief , the meeting in stuttgart could give the free-market liberals the opportunity to redefine themselves .
the fdp 's current party platform dates back to 1997 and on the agenda wednesday is a discussion of a new platform .
when the daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung asked fdp secretary general christian lindner whether the fdp image as it now stands did n't fit the current times , lindner said the party 's mission is structurally sound .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even economics minister bruederle is n't calling for the cuts to take place right away " there 's no major need for revision of fdp positions , " he said .
" instead , it 's about evolution .
the new party platform is supposed to be worked on until 2012 .
we should take our time . "
but there are elements of the party that are already making changes .
the state of baden wuerttemberg 's fdp has already passed its own platform .
" when the disciplinary force of competition does not take hold … or is impeded by unfair conduct , the state has the mandate to regulate and intervene if necessary in the economy , " the new platform reads .

politicians are beginning to voice their doubts , including bartholomaeus kalb , member of the cdu 's bavarian sister party the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- .
" we just wo n't have any money for tax relief or any additional expenditures for the foreseeable future , and by that i mean through the end of the legislative period , " wednesday 's edition of the financial times deutschland quoted kalb as saying .

germany faces a ballooning budget deficit , with the 2010 budget approved by chancellor angela merkel 's cabinet calling for a record 85.8 billion euros in borrowed cash .
the european union has pressed germany to get its deficit under control .
as the party meets to discuss plans for 2010 , there 's been some backpedaling from fdp leaders , including economics minister rainer bruederle .
" it would be absolutely wrong to start off by cutting the budget , " he said on german radio .
fdp deputy party leader andreas pinkwart told the handelsblatt business daily this means that reaching the goals laid out in the coalition agreement might not happen for a few years .
" it 's enough if the complete 24 billion euros of relief is achieved in 2013 , " pinkwart said .
thus far only one tax cut of 8.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 123.1 billion -rrb- has been approved .

a new fdp ?
with the fdp no longer pushing for immediate tax relief , the meeting in stuttgart could give the free-market liberals the opportunity to redefine themselves .
the fdp 's current party platform dates back to 1997 and on the agenda wednesday is a discussion of a new platform .
when the daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung asked fdp secretary general christian lindner whether the fdp image as it now stands did n't fit the current times , lindner said the party 's mission is structurally sound .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even economics minister bruederle is n't calling for the cuts to take place right away " there 's no major need for revision of fdp positions , " he said .
" instead , it 's about evolution .
the new party platform is supposed to be worked on until 2012 .
we should take our time . "
but there are elements of the party that are already making changes .
the state of baden wuerttemberg 's fdp has already passed its own platform .
" when the disciplinary force of competition does not take hold … or is impeded by unfair conduct , the state has the mandate to regulate and intervene if necessary in the economy , " the new platform reads .

although daimler has been a player in the indian market since the early 1990s , the company has been more successful selling trucks than cars .
but with new models on display at the indian auto show , the stuttgart-based firm appears determined to establish a stronger foothold in the car sector , albeit at the higher end of the market .
how big a market the high-end is remains to be seen , however . an increasing number of indians have become wealthy , thanks to numerous european , japanese and us companies building factories in the country and outsourcing services .
but chronic poverty remains a widespread problem . the world bank estimates that just over one quarter of the indian population was living on less than one us dollar a day in 2005 . author : juergen webermann / john blau editor : sam edmonds send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but loud words seemed to rule the day at separate strategy meetings of the fdp and csu . the snow-covered hilltops of the southern german region around wildbad kreuth convey the impression of a place full of bliss and harmony .
but these days , harmony is solely left to mother nature .
everyone who matters in bavaria 's christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- - the sister party of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- - has flocked to the palace-like building at kreuth .
firing broadsides at both friend and foe has become an entertaining tradition at the csu 's three-day strategy meeting .
tax policies under fire the saber-rattling started wednesday morning , when csu head horst seehofer said his party had no reason to feel humble just because it had lost its absolute majority support in bavaria for the first time in its history .
seehofer attacked the free democrats ' -lrb- fdp -rrb- resolve to allow for 24 billion euros -lrb- $ 34.5 billion -rrb- in tax reductions as of 2011 despite the country facing record public debts , to be further increased by astronomic fresh borrowing this year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : csu head horst seehofer sees no reason to feel humble " i 'm sure the fdp will still learn what it means to assume government responsibility , " seehofer quipped in a statement directed at the conservatives ' coalition partner in berlin .
at their own gathering in stuttgart on wednesday , the pro-business fdp did n't wait long before responding to the verbal attack .
fdp floor leader birgit homburger said it was strange that the csu was so forgetful .
she recalled that all sides had agreed on tax reductions during coalition talks last year .
" we looked very hard at where taxes could be lowered and what measures could be financed and justified .
so why 's so much fuss being made about it now ? " , homburger asked in stuttgart .
body scanners not to everyone 's liking but tax policies are not the only bone of contention that berlin 's coalition partners almost seem to choke on these days .
there 's a controversy about whether or not body scanners should be used at german airports to increase security , with the fdp being far more concerned about any potential dignity issues than chancellor merkel 's conservatives .
and at least two foreign policy issues have shown time and again that the coalition partners are far from speaking with one voice .
number one is afghanistan , and with it the debate over whether germany should send in thousands of more troops in line with us president barack obama 's request to nato allies .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erika steinbach remains a controversial figure and then there 's the unresolved question of how to deal with erika steinbach , who heads germany 's federation of expellees -lrb- bdv -rrb- , a group which represents germans expelled from eastern europe after 1945 .
steinbach angered poland by not accepting the bilateral border treaty after german unification in 1990 .
her initial resolve to become a board member of a museum for european expellees has also caused an outcry in warsaw .
the conservatives and the fdp seem divided over how to deal with steinbach 's recent proposal to renounce the post in return for boosting the federation of expellees ' say in the museum work. hg / dpa / reuters / ap editor : trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but loud words seemed to rule the day at separate strategy meetings of the fdp and csu . the snow-covered hilltops of the southern german region around wildbad kreuth convey the impression of a place full of bliss and harmony .
but these days , harmony is solely left to mother nature .
everyone who matters in bavaria 's christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- - the sister party of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- - has flocked to the palace-like building at kreuth .
firing broadsides at both friend and foe has become an entertaining tradition at the csu 's three-day strategy meeting .
tax policies under fire the saber-rattling started wednesday morning , when csu head horst seehofer said his party had no reason to feel humble just because it had lost its absolute majority support in bavaria for the first time in its history .
seehofer attacked the free democrats ' -lrb- fdp -rrb- resolve to allow for 24 billion euros -lrb- $ 34.5 billion -rrb- in tax reductions as of 2011 despite the country facing record public debts , to be further increased by astronomic fresh borrowing this year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : csu head horst seehofer sees no reason to feel humble " i 'm sure the fdp will still learn what it means to assume government responsibility , " seehofer quipped in a statement directed at the conservatives ' coalition partner in berlin .
at their own gathering in stuttgart on wednesday , the pro-business fdp did n't wait long before responding to the verbal attack .
fdp floor leader birgit homburger said it was strange that the csu was so forgetful .
she recalled that all sides had agreed on tax reductions during coalition talks last year .
" we looked very hard at where taxes could be lowered and what measures could be financed and justified .
so why 's so much fuss being made about it now ? " , homburger asked in stuttgart .
body scanners not to everyone 's liking but tax policies are not the only bone of contention that berlin 's coalition partners almost seem to choke on these days .
there 's a controversy about whether or not body scanners should be used at german airports to increase security , with the fdp being far more concerned about any potential dignity issues than chancellor merkel 's conservatives .
and at least two foreign policy issues have shown time and again that the coalition partners are far from speaking with one voice .
number one is afghanistan , and with it the debate over whether germany should send in thousands of more troops in line with us president barack obama 's request to nato allies .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erika steinbach remains a controversial figure and then there 's the unresolved question of how to deal with erika steinbach , who heads germany 's federation of expellees -lrb- bdv -rrb- , a group which represents germans expelled from eastern europe after 1945 .
steinbach angered poland by not accepting the bilateral border treaty after german unification in 1990 .
her initial resolve to become a board member of a museum for european expellees has also caused an outcry in warsaw .

" the commission hopes that an acceptable solution for all the parties concerned will be found , " a spokesman in brussels said .
but he added that it is mainly an issue between iceland , the uk and the netherlands as it concerns compensation for uk and dutch depositors in icesave accounts .
on tuesday , iceland 's president olafur ragnar grimsson blocked an unpopular but previously approved bank compensation plan for foreign investors in his country 's failed banks .
iceland was to pay $ 5.4 billion -lrb- 3.8 billion euros -rrb- in compensation to britain and the netherlands , the nations that had stepped in to compensate their own citizens who lost money when the icesave bank collapsed .
icesave was operated by landesbanki , which collapsed in the fall of 2008 .
but over the weekend , grimsson received a petition signed by nearly a quarter of the icelandic voters protesting against the icesave compensation bill .
on tuesday , the president announced he would not sign the bill , but instead , in accordance with the constitution , submit the plan for a referendum .
britain threatens to withdraw its backing while a poll on wednesday showed that more than half of icelanders supported the president 's decision , his announcement sparked anger in london and the hague , where government officials urged reykjavik to meet its international obligations .
britain 's financial services minister paul myners said controversy over the compensation deal could impact on britain 's support for iceland 's eu bid .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iceland was hard-hit by the international financial crisis hoping to stabilize the economy following the collapse of its financial sector , iceland 's parliament voted last year to begin a process that could eventually lead to its membership in the eu .
meanwhile , the us rating agency standard and poor 's said wednesday it has put icelandic debt under negative credit watch .
the agency said that the icelandic president 's refusal to sign the bill could undermine support from the international monetary fund .
on tuesday , another credit rating agency , fitch , downgraded iceland 's long-term debt rating due to what it termed a renewed wave of domestic political , economic and financial uncertainty .

icesave was operated by landesbanki , which collapsed in the fall of 2008 .
but over the weekend , grimsson received a petition signed by nearly a quarter of the icelandic voters protesting against the icesave compensation bill .
on tuesday , the president announced he would not sign the bill , but instead , in accordance with the constitution , submit the plan for a referendum .
britain threatens to withdraw its backing while a poll on wednesday showed that more than half of icelanders supported the president 's decision , his announcement sparked anger in london and the hague , where government officials urged reykjavik to meet its international obligations .
britain 's financial services minister paul myners said controversy over the compensation deal could impact on britain 's support for iceland 's eu bid .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iceland was hard-hit by the international financial crisis hoping to stabilize the economy following the collapse of its financial sector , iceland 's parliament voted last year to begin a process that could eventually lead to its membership in the eu .
meanwhile , the us rating agency standard and poor 's said wednesday it has put icelandic debt under negative credit watch .
the agency said that the icelandic president 's refusal to sign the bill could undermine support from the international monetary fund .
on tuesday , another credit rating agency , fitch , downgraded iceland 's long-term debt rating due to what it termed a renewed wave of domestic political , economic and financial uncertainty .
iceland 's parliament will meet friday to discuss the referendum. db / ap / afp / reuters / dpa editor : trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

on dec .
30 , 2009 , up to 150,000 litres of diesel leaked out into the chishui and wei rivers .
the accident was caused by a rupture in a pipeline belonging to the country 's top oil producer , the china national petroleum corporation , which blamed a third party .
on monday , diesel from the spill reached the yellow river . china is currently battling with polluted water and negative attention as well .
the diesel spill reaching the yellow river is a large concern because it is one of china 's longest rivers and the source of drinking water for millions of people .
" oil is detrimental to drinking water - it is not safe for people to drink water contaminated by diesel , ” said ma jun , director of the institute of public and environmental affairs in beijing .
“ efforts are being made in an intensive way to contain the spreading of the diesel spill - at this moment , one of the major reservoirs has been shut down , has stopped generating electricity in order to contain the diesel spill .
local residents along the river have been warned not to use water directly from the river . "
unfit for drinking but ok for agriculture water quality has reached level five in the rivers contaminated by the spill .
this is the lowest level of quality in chinese standards .
according to the government , this means the water is unfit for drinking but can be used for agricultural purposes .
pay drechsel from the international water management institute in sri lanka said he was “ very concerned about the water situation in china . ”
“ this goes far beyond those accidents , ” he explained .
“ the amount of normal domestic and industrial waste water , which is discharged into china 's water bodies daily , is huge .
except for a few big cities , waste water is not properly treated before being discharged , which affects drinking water and agricultural production .
the area under irrigation with polluted water or waste water is estimated today as four million hectares in china .
that is by far the largest area irrigated with waste water in the world . "
water experts agree waste water and contaminated river water contain high amounts of heavy metals and chemicals .
this can cause serious health issues in animals and humans who either drink the water directly or eat crops that have been irrigated with polluted water .
waste water treatment plants not sophisticated enough according to the international water management institute , china has about 200 waste water treatment plants but even then , the majority are not sophisticated enough to deliver good treatment .
pay drechsel points out that most small towns in china , which have been developing rapidly in recent years , do not have any waste water treatment plants at all .
“ china is making efforts to improve its water quality , by i.e. building new sewage plants .
however , there are still too many factories , whose discharge can not meet china 's national standards , ” says ma jun .
the institute of public and environmental affairs in beijing compiles a list of china 's big polluters and makes it public , thus creating awareness .
but it will take more effort .
according to government data , more than 200 million people do not have access to safe drinking water .
if china 's cities continue to grow at the current rate , the infrastructure will have to be significantly adapted to sustain the development .

" i want to hear from the bishop herself how she came to her opinion , " guttenberg told the leipziger volkszeitung newspaper , after kaessmann called for a concrete plan for a withdrawal of troops .
the two are due to meet on january 11 .
in an interview she gave at christmas , kaessmann said , " this war is not justifiable , even by the broadest possible standards of the german protestant church . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guttenberg is keen to hear kaessmann 's views firsthand in a statement released by her office on tuesday , kaessmann welcomed the chance to speak to guttenberg and said she intended to discuss " the ethical position of the protestant church and the government 's afghanistan policy " with the minister .
comments clarified kaessmann also clarified her comments , saying she had never called for an immediate troop withdrawal , but rather for a " clear plan " for withdrawal .
ruprecht polenz , of the ruling christian democratic union , welcomed kaessmann 's revised statement .
" i 'm glad that she is now taking up a position that is much closer to what is , shall we say , the opinion of the majority of the parliament , " polenz told public broadcaster wdr .
" i am very grateful that both churches are helping to support our troops with spiritual guidance , " guttenberg said .
" i am certain that mrs. kaessmann does not want to see that debased . "
protestant bishops also gave kaessmann their support on tuesday .
" a lot of people do n't understand why the mission is necessary and what its purpose is .
and it 's not clear how it can be ended , " said bishop maria jepsen of hamburg .
berlin bishop markus droege said that a continuation of the afghanistan mission was only morally acceptable if the government gave " a long-overdue definition of its aim and an exit strategy . "
catholic military bishop walter mixa also called for " an open and honest debate about the situation our soldiers are in and their mission . "
mixa said that the question of whether the mission was justified " is always relevant . " bk / epd / dpa editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

noordin top was accused of being behind a series of terrorist attacks , including the 2002 bali bombings .
400 suspected terrorists have been arrested as part of the indonesian government ’ s counter-terrorism measures in the past 10 years . with the killing of noordin mohammed top , president susilo bambang yudhoyono expressed his relief .
“ now that this is behind us i hope that we have put an end to the wave of terror in our country , ” he said .
he was speaking just a month after two suicide attacks on two hotels in the capital city jakarta had killed nine people and injured dozens .
it was immediately blamed on the jemaah islamiyah militant network .
at the time , indonesian political scientist sony tanuwidjaja hinted that it could happen again : “ the fact that this happens , on this scale , in a place where security is very tight shows that there is a hole in that security and i think that the security , the police force still have a lot to learn . ”
alternative ways of combating terrorism but some see alternative ways of combating terrorism to tightening security measures .
noor huda ismail attended a jemaah islamiyah school , the al-mukmin pesantren in ngruki that was founded in 1972 .
many of its graduates have been implicated in terrorist attacks , including some of noor huda ismail ’ s classmates .
he explains that many of them went to military training camps in peshawar , pakistan , to fight as mujahedeen in afghanistan and their ideas became more radical .
“ there was ongoing recruitment back then .
they travelled normally , using normal passports and normal accommodation , ” he recalls .
“ back then , there was a huge movement all over the muslim world , which was backed by the west .
they got the funding from the arab world , as well as the us .
that ’ s very clear , very well-documented . ”
why do some choose the path of terrorism ?
to find out more why some of them had chosen the path of terrorism , ismail set up a think tank that he named the institute for international peacebuilding yayasan prasasti perdamaian .
the institute interviews terrorists in and out of jail and also talks to people in training camps .
it also runs conflict-management programmes in eight prisons in indonesia to mediate between imprisoned terrorists or suspected terrorists and guards .
ismail has set up rehabilitation programmes as well so that former militants and prisoners can re-adapt to “ normal ” life , find jobs , get married … important not to stigmatise suspected terrorists ismail thinks that he himself did not turn into a terrorist because he was exposed to other ideas .
he is also certain that others can change their views .
“ i do not think that brotherhood , the friendship among them , the bond , is dangerous .
what is dangerous is when they start thinking that to carry out an attack in a non-conflict area , like indonesia , is justified .
that is the danger , when such an ideology is coupled with the friendship that they have in pakistan , in peshawar … ” “ but one has to understand also that many of the afghan alumni actually go back to society and live normally so we can not label them as terrorists , ” he warns .
ismail adds that it is important to label only those who have participated in terrorist activities and carried out violent acts against civilians as terrorists .
others should not be stigmatised .
he does not appear to be worried about being targeted by terrorists himself .
he says he wants to make a difference .

on dec .
30 , 2009 , up to 150,000 litres of diesel leaked out into the chishui and wei rivers .
the accident was caused by a rupture in a pipeline belonging to the country 's top oil producer , the china national petroleum corporation , which blamed a third party .
on monday , diesel from the spill reached the yellow river . china is currently battling with polluted water and negative attention as well .
the diesel spill reaching the yellow river is a large concern because it is one of china 's longest rivers and the source of drinking water for millions of people .
" oil is detrimental to drinking water - it is not safe for people to drink water contaminated by diesel , ” said ma jun , director of the institute of public and environmental affairs in beijing .
“ efforts are being made in an intensive way to contain the spreading of the diesel spill - at this moment , one of the major reservoirs has been shut down , has stopped generating electricity in order to contain the diesel spill .
local residents along the river have been warned not to use water directly from the river . "
unfit for drinking but ok for agriculture water quality has reached level five in the rivers contaminated by the spill .
this is the lowest level of quality in chinese standards .
according to the government , this means the water is unfit for drinking but can be used for agricultural purposes .
pay drechsel from the international water management institute in sri lanka said he was “ very concerned about the water situation in china . ”
“ this goes far beyond those accidents , ” he explained .
“ the amount of normal domestic and industrial waste water , which is discharged into china 's water bodies daily , is huge .
except for a few big cities , waste water is not properly treated before being discharged , which affects drinking water and agricultural production .
the area under irrigation with polluted water or waste water is estimated today as four million hectares in china .
that is by far the largest area irrigated with waste water in the world . "
water experts agree waste water and contaminated river water contain high amounts of heavy metals and chemicals .
this can cause serious health issues in animals and humans who either drink the water directly or eat crops that have been irrigated with polluted water .
waste water treatment plants not sophisticated enough according to the international water management institute , china has about 200 waste water treatment plants but even then , the majority are not sophisticated enough to deliver good treatment .
pay drechsel points out that most small towns in china , which have been developing rapidly in recent years , do not have any waste water treatment plants at all .
“ china is making efforts to improve its water quality , by i.e. building new sewage plants .
however , there are still too many factories , whose discharge can not meet china 's national standards , ” says ma jun .
the institute of public and environmental affairs in beijing compiles a list of china 's big polluters and makes it public , thus creating awareness .
but it will take more effort .
according to government data , more than 200 million people do not have access to safe drinking water .
if china 's cities continue to grow at the current rate , the infrastructure will have to be significantly adapted to sustain the development .

400 suspected terrorists have been arrested as part of the indonesian government ’ s counter-terrorism measures in the past 10 years . with the killing of noordin mohammed top , president susilo bambang yudhoyono expressed his relief .
“ now that this is behind us i hope that we have put an end to the wave of terror in our country , ” he said .
he was speaking just a month after two suicide attacks on two hotels in the capital city jakarta had killed nine people and injured dozens .
it was immediately blamed on the jemaah islamiyah militant network .
at the time , indonesian political scientist sony tanuwidjaja hinted that it could happen again : “ the fact that this happens , on this scale , in a place where security is very tight shows that there is a hole in that security and i think that the security , the police force still have a lot to learn . ”

they got the funding from the arab world , as well as the us .
that ’ s very clear , very well-documented . ”
why do some choose the path of terrorism ?
to find out more why some of them had chosen the path of terrorism , ismail set up a think tank that he named the institute for international peacebuilding yayasan prasasti perdamaian .
the institute interviews terrorists in and out of jail and also talks to people in training camps .
it also runs conflict-management programmes in eight prisons in indonesia to mediate between imprisoned terrorists or suspected terrorists and guards .
ismail has set up rehabilitation programmes as well so that former militants and prisoners can re-adapt to “ normal ” life , find jobs , get married … important not to stigmatise suspected terrorists ismail thinks that he himself did not turn into a terrorist because he was exposed to other ideas .
he is also certain that others can change their views .
“ i do not think that brotherhood , the friendship among them , the bond , is dangerous .
what is dangerous is when they start thinking that to carry out an attack in a non-conflict area , like indonesia , is justified .
that is the danger , when such an ideology is coupled with the friendship that they have in pakistan , in peshawar … ” “ but one has to understand also that many of the afghan alumni actually go back to society and live normally so we can not label them as terrorists , ” he warns .
ismail adds that it is important to label only those who have participated in terrorist activities and carried out violent acts against civilians as terrorists .
others should not be stigmatised .
he does not appear to be worried about being targeted by terrorists himself .
he says he wants to make a difference .

on dec .
30 , 2009 , up to 150,000 litres of diesel leaked out into the chishui and wei rivers .
the accident was caused by a rupture in a pipeline belonging to the country 's top oil producer , the china national petroleum corporation , which blamed a third party .
on monday , diesel from the spill reached the yellow river . china is currently battling with polluted water and negative attention as well .
the diesel spill reaching the yellow river is a large concern because it is one of china 's longest rivers and the source of drinking water for millions of people .
" oil is detrimental to drinking water - it is not safe for people to drink water contaminated by diesel , ” said ma jun , director of the institute of public and environmental affairs in beijing .
“ efforts are being made in an intensive way to contain the spreading of the diesel spill - at this moment , one of the major reservoirs has been shut down , has stopped generating electricity in order to contain the diesel spill .
local residents along the river have been warned not to use water directly from the river . "
unfit for drinking but ok for agriculture water quality has reached level five in the rivers contaminated by the spill .
this is the lowest level of quality in chinese standards .
according to the government , this means the water is unfit for drinking but can be used for agricultural purposes .
pay drechsel from the international water management institute in sri lanka said he was “ very concerned about the water situation in china . ”
“ this goes far beyond those accidents , ” he explained .
“ the amount of normal domestic and industrial waste water , which is discharged into china 's water bodies daily , is huge .
except for a few big cities , waste water is not properly treated before being discharged , which affects drinking water and agricultural production .
the area under irrigation with polluted water or waste water is estimated today as four million hectares in china .
that is by far the largest area irrigated with waste water in the world . "
water experts agree waste water and contaminated river water contain high amounts of heavy metals and chemicals .
this can cause serious health issues in animals and humans who either drink the water directly or eat crops that have been irrigated with polluted water .
waste water treatment plants not sophisticated enough according to the international water management institute , china has about 200 waste water treatment plants but even then , the majority are not sophisticated enough to deliver good treatment .
pay drechsel points out that most small towns in china , which have been developing rapidly in recent years , do not have any waste water treatment plants at all .
“ china is making efforts to improve its water quality , by i.e. building new sewage plants .
however , there are still too many factories , whose discharge can not meet china 's national standards , ” says ma jun .
the institute of public and environmental affairs in beijing compiles a list of china 's big polluters and makes it public , thus creating awareness .
but it will take more effort .
according to government data , more than 200 million people do not have access to safe drinking water .
if china 's cities continue to grow at the current rate , the infrastructure will have to be significantly adapted to sustain the development .

on dec .
30 , 2009 , up to 150,000 litres of diesel leaked out into the chishui and wei rivers .
the accident was caused by a rupture in a pipeline belonging to the country 's top oil producer , the china national petroleum corporation , which blamed a third party .
on monday , diesel from the spill reached the yellow river . china is currently battling with polluted water and negative attention as well .
the diesel spill reaching the yellow river is a large concern because it is one of china 's longest rivers and the source of drinking water for millions of people .
" oil is detrimental to drinking water - it is not safe for people to drink water contaminated by diesel , ” said ma jun , director of the institute of public and environmental affairs in beijing .
“ efforts are being made in an intensive way to contain the spreading of the diesel spill - at this moment , one of the major reservoirs has been shut down , has stopped generating electricity in order to contain the diesel spill .
local residents along the river have been warned not to use water directly from the river . "
unfit for drinking but ok for agriculture water quality has reached level five in the rivers contaminated by the spill .
this is the lowest level of quality in chinese standards .
according to the government , this means the water is unfit for drinking but can be used for agricultural purposes .
pay drechsel from the international water management institute in sri lanka said he was “ very concerned about the water situation in china . ”
“ this goes far beyond those accidents , ” he explained .
“ the amount of normal domestic and industrial waste water , which is discharged into china 's water bodies daily , is huge .
except for a few big cities , waste water is not properly treated before being discharged , which affects drinking water and agricultural production .
the area under irrigation with polluted water or waste water is estimated today as four million hectares in china .
that is by far the largest area irrigated with waste water in the world . "
water experts agree waste water and contaminated river water contain high amounts of heavy metals and chemicals .
this can cause serious health issues in animals and humans who either drink the water directly or eat crops that have been irrigated with polluted water .
waste water treatment plants not sophisticated enough according to the international water management institute , china has about 200 waste water treatment plants but even then , the majority are not sophisticated enough to deliver good treatment .
pay drechsel points out that most small towns in china , which have been developing rapidly in recent years , do not have any waste water treatment plants at all .
“ china is making efforts to improve its water quality , by i.e. building new sewage plants .
however , there are still too many factories , whose discharge can not meet china 's national standards , ” says ma jun .
the institute of public and environmental affairs in beijing compiles a list of china 's big polluters and makes it public , thus creating awareness .
but it will take more effort .
according to government data , more than 200 million people do not have access to safe drinking water .
if china 's cities continue to grow at the current rate , the infrastructure will have to be significantly adapted to sustain the development .

noordin top was accused of being behind a series of terrorist attacks , including the 2002 bali bombings .
400 suspected terrorists have been arrested as part of the indonesian government ’ s counter-terrorism measures in the past 10 years . with the killing of noordin mohammed top , president susilo bambang yudhoyono expressed his relief .
“ now that this is behind us i hope that we have put an end to the wave of terror in our country , ” he said .
he was speaking just a month after two suicide attacks on two hotels in the capital city jakarta had killed nine people and injured dozens .
it was immediately blamed on the jemaah islamiyah militant network .
at the time , indonesian political scientist sony tanuwidjaja hinted that it could happen again : “ the fact that this happens , on this scale , in a place where security is very tight shows that there is a hole in that security and i think that the security , the police force still have a lot to learn . ”
alternative ways of combating terrorism but some see alternative ways of combating terrorism to tightening security measures .
noor huda ismail attended a jemaah islamiyah school , the al-mukmin pesantren in ngruki that was founded in 1972 .
many of its graduates have been implicated in terrorist attacks , including some of noor huda ismail ’ s classmates .
he explains that many of them went to military training camps in peshawar , pakistan , to fight as mujahedeen in afghanistan and their ideas became more radical .
“ there was ongoing recruitment back then .
they travelled normally , using normal passports and normal accommodation , ” he recalls .
“ back then , there was a huge movement all over the muslim world , which was backed by the west .
they got the funding from the arab world , as well as the us .
that ’ s very clear , very well-documented . ”
why do some choose the path of terrorism ?
to find out more why some of them had chosen the path of terrorism , ismail set up a think tank that he named the institute for international peacebuilding yayasan prasasti perdamaian .
the institute interviews terrorists in and out of jail and also talks to people in training camps .
it also runs conflict-management programmes in eight prisons in indonesia to mediate between imprisoned terrorists or suspected terrorists and guards .
ismail has set up rehabilitation programmes as well so that former militants and prisoners can re-adapt to “ normal ” life , find jobs , get married … important not to stigmatise suspected terrorists ismail thinks that he himself did not turn into a terrorist because he was exposed to other ideas .
he is also certain that others can change their views .
“ i do not think that brotherhood , the friendship among them , the bond , is dangerous .
what is dangerous is when they start thinking that to carry out an attack in a non-conflict area , like indonesia , is justified .
that is the danger , when such an ideology is coupled with the friendship that they have in pakistan , in peshawar … ” “ but one has to understand also that many of the afghan alumni actually go back to society and live normally so we can not label them as terrorists , ” he warns .
ismail adds that it is important to label only those who have participated in terrorist activities and carried out violent acts against civilians as terrorists .
others should not be stigmatised .
he does not appear to be worried about being targeted by terrorists himself .
he says he wants to make a difference .

noor huda ismail attended a jemaah islamiyah school , the al-mukmin pesantren in ngruki that was founded in 1972 .
many of its graduates have been implicated in terrorist attacks , including some of noor huda ismail ’ s classmates .
he explains that many of them went to military training camps in peshawar , pakistan , to fight as mujahedeen in afghanistan and their ideas became more radical .
“ there was ongoing recruitment back then .
they travelled normally , using normal passports and normal accommodation , ” he recalls .
“ back then , there was a huge movement all over the muslim world , which was backed by the west .
they got the funding from the arab world , as well as the us .
that ’ s very clear , very well-documented . ”
why do some choose the path of terrorism ?
to find out more why some of them had chosen the path of terrorism , ismail set up a think tank that he named the institute for international peacebuilding yayasan prasasti perdamaian .
the institute interviews terrorists in and out of jail and also talks to people in training camps .
it also runs conflict-management programmes in eight prisons in indonesia to mediate between imprisoned terrorists or suspected terrorists and guards .
ismail has set up rehabilitation programmes as well so that former militants and prisoners can re-adapt to “ normal ” life , find jobs , get married … important not to stigmatise suspected terrorists ismail thinks that he himself did not turn into a terrorist because he was exposed to other ideas .
he is also certain that others can change their views .
“ i do not think that brotherhood , the friendship among them , the bond , is dangerous .
what is dangerous is when they start thinking that to carry out an attack in a non-conflict area , like indonesia , is justified .
that is the danger , when such an ideology is coupled with the friendship that they have in pakistan , in peshawar … ” “ but one has to understand also that many of the afghan alumni actually go back to society and live normally so we can not label them as terrorists , ” he warns .
ismail adds that it is important to label only those who have participated in terrorist activities and carried out violent acts against civilians as terrorists .
others should not be stigmatised .
he does not appear to be worried about being targeted by terrorists himself .
he says he wants to make a difference .

on dec .
30 , 2009 , up to 150,000 litres of diesel leaked out into the chishui and wei rivers .
the accident was caused by a rupture in a pipeline belonging to the country 's top oil producer , the china national petroleum corporation , which blamed a third party .
on monday , diesel from the spill reached the yellow river . china is currently battling with polluted water and negative attention as well .
the diesel spill reaching the yellow river is a large concern because it is one of china 's longest rivers and the source of drinking water for millions of people .
" oil is detrimental to drinking water - it is not safe for people to drink water contaminated by diesel , ” said ma jun , director of the institute of public and environmental affairs in beijing .
“ efforts are being made in an intensive way to contain the spreading of the diesel spill - at this moment , one of the major reservoirs has been shut down , has stopped generating electricity in order to contain the diesel spill .
local residents along the river have been warned not to use water directly from the river . "
unfit for drinking but ok for agriculture water quality has reached level five in the rivers contaminated by the spill .
this is the lowest level of quality in chinese standards .
according to the government , this means the water is unfit for drinking but can be used for agricultural purposes .
pay drechsel from the international water management institute in sri lanka said he was “ very concerned about the water situation in china . ”
“ this goes far beyond those accidents , ” he explained .
“ the amount of normal domestic and industrial waste water , which is discharged into china 's water bodies daily , is huge .
except for a few big cities , waste water is not properly treated before being discharged , which affects drinking water and agricultural production .
the area under irrigation with polluted water or waste water is estimated today as four million hectares in china .
that is by far the largest area irrigated with waste water in the world . "
water experts agree waste water and contaminated river water contain high amounts of heavy metals and chemicals .
this can cause serious health issues in animals and humans who either drink the water directly or eat crops that have been irrigated with polluted water .
waste water treatment plants not sophisticated enough according to the international water management institute , china has about 200 waste water treatment plants but even then , the majority are not sophisticated enough to deliver good treatment .
pay drechsel points out that most small towns in china , which have been developing rapidly in recent years , do not have any waste water treatment plants at all .
“ china is making efforts to improve its water quality , by i.e. building new sewage plants .
however , there are still too many factories , whose discharge can not meet china 's national standards , ” says ma jun .
the institute of public and environmental affairs in beijing compiles a list of china 's big polluters and makes it public , thus creating awareness .
but it will take more effort .
according to government data , more than 200 million people do not have access to safe drinking water .
if china 's cities continue to grow at the current rate , the infrastructure will have to be significantly adapted to sustain the development .

noordin top was accused of being behind a series of terrorist attacks , including the 2002 bali bombings .
400 suspected terrorists have been arrested as part of the indonesian government ’ s counter-terrorism measures in the past 10 years . with the killing of noordin mohammed top , president susilo bambang yudhoyono expressed his relief .
“ now that this is behind us i hope that we have put an end to the wave of terror in our country , ” he said .
he was speaking just a month after two suicide attacks on two hotels in the capital city jakarta had killed nine people and injured dozens .
it was immediately blamed on the jemaah islamiyah militant network .
at the time , indonesian political scientist sony tanuwidjaja hinted that it could happen again : “ the fact that this happens , on this scale , in a place where security is very tight shows that there is a hole in that security and i think that the security , the police force still have a lot to learn . ”
alternative ways of combating terrorism but some see alternative ways of combating terrorism to tightening security measures .
noor huda ismail attended a jemaah islamiyah school , the al-mukmin pesantren in ngruki that was founded in 1972 .
many of its graduates have been implicated in terrorist attacks , including some of noor huda ismail ’ s classmates .
he explains that many of them went to military training camps in peshawar , pakistan , to fight as mujahedeen in afghanistan and their ideas became more radical .
“ there was ongoing recruitment back then .

“ back then , there was a huge movement all over the muslim world , which was backed by the west .
they got the funding from the arab world , as well as the us .
that ’ s very clear , very well-documented . ”
why do some choose the path of terrorism ?
to find out more why some of them had chosen the path of terrorism , ismail set up a think tank that he named the institute for international peacebuilding yayasan prasasti perdamaian .
the institute interviews terrorists in and out of jail and also talks to people in training camps .
it also runs conflict-management programmes in eight prisons in indonesia to mediate between imprisoned terrorists or suspected terrorists and guards .

ismail adds that it is important to label only those who have participated in terrorist activities and carried out violent acts against civilians as terrorists .
others should not be stigmatised .
he does not appear to be worried about being targeted by terrorists himself .
he says he wants to make a difference .

“ now that this is behind us i hope that we have put an end to the wave of terror in our country , ” he said .
he was speaking just a month after two suicide attacks on two hotels in the capital city jakarta had killed nine people and injured dozens .
it was immediately blamed on the jemaah islamiyah militant network .
at the time , indonesian political scientist sony tanuwidjaja hinted that it could happen again : “ the fact that this happens , on this scale , in a place where security is very tight shows that there is a hole in that security and i think that the security , the police force still have a lot to learn . ”

noor huda ismail attended a jemaah islamiyah school , the al-mukmin pesantren in ngruki that was founded in 1972 .
many of its graduates have been implicated in terrorist attacks , including some of noor huda ismail ’ s classmates .
he explains that many of them went to military training camps in peshawar , pakistan , to fight as mujahedeen in afghanistan and their ideas became more radical .

“ i do not think that brotherhood , the friendship among them , the bond , is dangerous .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de asia -pipe- 06.01.2010 polluted water threatens millions of chinese großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many of china 's rivers are polluted by industrial waste a huge oil spill has drawn the world 's attention to the problem of china 's water pollution yet again .
on dec .
30 , 2009 , up to 150,000 litres of diesel leaked out into the chishui and wei rivers .
the accident was caused by a rupture in a pipeline belonging to the country 's top oil producer , the china national petroleum corporation , which blamed a third party .
on monday , diesel from the spill reached the yellow river . china is currently battling with polluted water and negative attention as well .
the diesel spill reaching the yellow river is a large concern because it is one of china 's longest rivers and the source of drinking water for millions of people .
" oil is detrimental to drinking water - it is not safe for people to drink water contaminated by diesel , ” said ma jun , director of the institute of public and environmental affairs in beijing .
“ efforts are being made in an intensive way to contain the spreading of the diesel spill - at this moment , one of the major reservoirs has been shut down , has stopped generating electricity in order to contain the diesel spill .
local residents along the river have been warned not to use water directly from the river . "
unfit for drinking but ok for agriculture water quality has reached level five in the rivers contaminated by the spill .
this is the lowest level of quality in chinese standards .
according to the government , this means the water is unfit for drinking but can be used for agricultural purposes .
pay drechsel from the international water management institute in sri lanka said he was “ very concerned about the water situation in china . ”
“ this goes far beyond those accidents , ” he explained .
“ the amount of normal domestic and industrial waste water , which is discharged into china 's water bodies daily , is huge .
except for a few big cities , waste water is not properly treated before being discharged , which affects drinking water and agricultural production .
the area under irrigation with polluted water or waste water is estimated today as four million hectares in china .
that is by far the largest area irrigated with waste water in the world . "
water experts agree waste water and contaminated river water contain high amounts of heavy metals and chemicals .
this can cause serious health issues in animals and humans who either drink the water directly or eat crops that have been irrigated with polluted water .
waste water treatment plants not sophisticated enough according to the international water management institute , china has about 200 waste water treatment plants but even then , the majority are not sophisticated enough to deliver good treatment .
pay drechsel points out that most small towns in china , which have been developing rapidly in recent years , do not have any waste water treatment plants at all .
“ china is making efforts to improve its water quality , by i.e. building new sewage plants .
however , there are still too many factories , whose discharge can not meet china 's national standards , ” says ma jun .
the institute of public and environmental affairs in beijing compiles a list of china 's big polluters and makes it public , thus creating awareness .
but it will take more effort .
according to government data , more than 200 million people do not have access to safe drinking water .
if china 's cities continue to grow at the current rate , the infrastructure will have to be significantly adapted to sustain the development .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de asia -pipe- 06.01.2010 polluted water threatens millions of chinese großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many of china 's rivers are polluted by industrial waste a huge oil spill has drawn the world 's attention to the problem of china 's water pollution yet again .
on dec .
30 , 2009 , up to 150,000 litres of diesel leaked out into the chishui and wei rivers .
the accident was caused by a rupture in a pipeline belonging to the country 's top oil producer , the china national petroleum corporation , which blamed a third party .
on monday , diesel from the spill reached the yellow river . china is currently battling with polluted water and negative attention as well .
the diesel spill reaching the yellow river is a large concern because it is one of china 's longest rivers and the source of drinking water for millions of people .
" oil is detrimental to drinking water - it is not safe for people to drink water contaminated by diesel , ” said ma jun , director of the institute of public and environmental affairs in beijing .
“ efforts are being made in an intensive way to contain the spreading of the diesel spill - at this moment , one of the major reservoirs has been shut down , has stopped generating electricity in order to contain the diesel spill .
local residents along the river have been warned not to use water directly from the river . "
unfit for drinking but ok for agriculture water quality has reached level five in the rivers contaminated by the spill .
this is the lowest level of quality in chinese standards .
according to the government , this means the water is unfit for drinking but can be used for agricultural purposes .
pay drechsel from the international water management institute in sri lanka said he was “ very concerned about the water situation in china . ”
“ this goes far beyond those accidents , ” he explained .
“ the amount of normal domestic and industrial waste water , which is discharged into china 's water bodies daily , is huge .
except for a few big cities , waste water is not properly treated before being discharged , which affects drinking water and agricultural production .
the area under irrigation with polluted water or waste water is estimated today as four million hectares in china .
that is by far the largest area irrigated with waste water in the world . "
water experts agree waste water and contaminated river water contain high amounts of heavy metals and chemicals .
this can cause serious health issues in animals and humans who either drink the water directly or eat crops that have been irrigated with polluted water .
waste water treatment plants not sophisticated enough according to the international water management institute , china has about 200 waste water treatment plants but even then , the majority are not sophisticated enough to deliver good treatment .
pay drechsel points out that most small towns in china , which have been developing rapidly in recent years , do not have any waste water treatment plants at all .
“ china is making efforts to improve its water quality , by i.e. building new sewage plants .
however , there are still too many factories , whose discharge can not meet china 's national standards , ” says ma jun .
the institute of public and environmental affairs in beijing compiles a list of china 's big polluters and makes it public , thus creating awareness .
but it will take more effort .
according to government data , more than 200 million people do not have access to safe drinking water .
if china 's cities continue to grow at the current rate , the infrastructure will have to be significantly adapted to sustain the development .

noordin top was accused of being behind a series of terrorist attacks , including the 2002 bali bombings .
400 suspected terrorists have been arrested as part of the indonesian government ’ s counter-terrorism measures in the past 10 years . with the killing of noordin mohammed top , president susilo bambang yudhoyono expressed his relief .
“ now that this is behind us i hope that we have put an end to the wave of terror in our country , ” he said .
he was speaking just a month after two suicide attacks on two hotels in the capital city jakarta had killed nine people and injured dozens .
it was immediately blamed on the jemaah islamiyah militant network .
at the time , indonesian political scientist sony tanuwidjaja hinted that it could happen again : “ the fact that this happens , on this scale , in a place where security is very tight shows that there is a hole in that security and i think that the security , the police force still have a lot to learn . ”
alternative ways of combating terrorism but some see alternative ways of combating terrorism to tightening security measures .
noor huda ismail attended a jemaah islamiyah school , the al-mukmin pesantren in ngruki that was founded in 1972 .
many of its graduates have been implicated in terrorist attacks , including some of noor huda ismail ’ s classmates .
he explains that many of them went to military training camps in peshawar , pakistan , to fight as mujahedeen in afghanistan and their ideas became more radical .
“ there was ongoing recruitment back then .
they travelled normally , using normal passports and normal accommodation , ” he recalls .
“ back then , there was a huge movement all over the muslim world , which was backed by the west .
they got the funding from the arab world , as well as the us .
that ’ s very clear , very well-documented . ”
why do some choose the path of terrorism ?
to find out more why some of them had chosen the path of terrorism , ismail set up a think tank that he named the institute for international peacebuilding yayasan prasasti perdamaian .
the institute interviews terrorists in and out of jail and also talks to people in training camps .
it also runs conflict-management programmes in eight prisons in indonesia to mediate between imprisoned terrorists or suspected terrorists and guards .
ismail has set up rehabilitation programmes as well so that former militants and prisoners can re-adapt to “ normal ” life , find jobs , get married … important not to stigmatise suspected terrorists ismail thinks that he himself did not turn into a terrorist because he was exposed to other ideas .
he is also certain that others can change their views .
“ i do not think that brotherhood , the friendship among them , the bond , is dangerous .
what is dangerous is when they start thinking that to carry out an attack in a non-conflict area , like indonesia , is justified .
that is the danger , when such an ideology is coupled with the friendship that they have in pakistan , in peshawar … ” “ but one has to understand also that many of the afghan alumni actually go back to society and live normally so we can not label them as terrorists , ” he warns .
ismail adds that it is important to label only those who have participated in terrorist activities and carried out violent acts against civilians as terrorists .
others should not be stigmatised .
he does not appear to be worried about being targeted by terrorists himself .
he says he wants to make a difference .

on dec .
30 , 2009 , up to 150,000 litres of diesel leaked out into the chishui and wei rivers .
the accident was caused by a rupture in a pipeline belonging to the country 's top oil producer , the china national petroleum corporation , which blamed a third party .
on monday , diesel from the spill reached the yellow river . china is currently battling with polluted water and negative attention as well .
the diesel spill reaching the yellow river is a large concern because it is one of china 's longest rivers and the source of drinking water for millions of people .
" oil is detrimental to drinking water - it is not safe for people to drink water contaminated by diesel , ” said ma jun , director of the institute of public and environmental affairs in beijing .
“ efforts are being made in an intensive way to contain the spreading of the diesel spill - at this moment , one of the major reservoirs has been shut down , has stopped generating electricity in order to contain the diesel spill .
local residents along the river have been warned not to use water directly from the river . "
unfit for drinking but ok for agriculture water quality has reached level five in the rivers contaminated by the spill .
this is the lowest level of quality in chinese standards .
according to the government , this means the water is unfit for drinking but can be used for agricultural purposes .
pay drechsel from the international water management institute in sri lanka said he was “ very concerned about the water situation in china . ”
“ this goes far beyond those accidents , ” he explained .
“ the amount of normal domestic and industrial waste water , which is discharged into china 's water bodies daily , is huge .
except for a few big cities , waste water is not properly treated before being discharged , which affects drinking water and agricultural production .
the area under irrigation with polluted water or waste water is estimated today as four million hectares in china .
that is by far the largest area irrigated with waste water in the world . "
water experts agree waste water and contaminated river water contain high amounts of heavy metals and chemicals .
this can cause serious health issues in animals and humans who either drink the water directly or eat crops that have been irrigated with polluted water .
waste water treatment plants not sophisticated enough according to the international water management institute , china has about 200 waste water treatment plants but even then , the majority are not sophisticated enough to deliver good treatment .
pay drechsel points out that most small towns in china , which have been developing rapidly in recent years , do not have any waste water treatment plants at all .
“ china is making efforts to improve its water quality , by i.e. building new sewage plants .
however , there are still too many factories , whose discharge can not meet china 's national standards , ” says ma jun .
the institute of public and environmental affairs in beijing compiles a list of china 's big polluters and makes it public , thus creating awareness .
but it will take more effort .
according to government data , more than 200 million people do not have access to safe drinking water .
if china 's cities continue to grow at the current rate , the infrastructure will have to be significantly adapted to sustain the development .
