now trade unions want employers to start hiring temp workers for long-term employment . the number of unemployed in germany fell to below 3 million for the first time in 18 years , labor minister ursula von der leyen said this week . michael sommer , head of the german trade union federation -lrb- dgb -rrb- , said he now wants to see germany 's recovery from the global economic crisis translate into improved conditions for german workers . " people have to be able to live from their work , " he said .
" they also have to have a say in their work .
economic bosses ca n't say they want to do things one way then change their tune and start doing things another way .
employers ' and workers ' interests need to be considered . " while german workers grew accustomed to spending their working lives with a single company , current statistics show the situation on the job market has undergone serious changes . temp work on the rise bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : temp workers are regarded as flexible employees the number of people with permanent contracts accompanied by unemployment and other social benefits has fallen while the number of people in recent years while the number of people requiring state aid to round out their pay has increased , according to the dgb . the unions reported that 2.2 million people in germany work for an hourly wage of less than 6 euros and that 1.3 million people receive state subsidies since their pay alone does not keep them above the poverty line .
temp work , which usually comes without benefits , has also increased from 704,000 in june to 1 million in october . " temp workers are a very flexible reserve of workers and , as we saw during the crisis , are the first be fired and are paid much worse than staff doing the same job , " sommer said , adding that the pay gap amounted to 7 euros per hour . german companies were able to avoid widespread layoffs by implementing government subsidies for shortened working hours .
this allowed businesses respond to an upturn in orders without delays associated with having to rehire workers . companies re-evaluate staffing options bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : employers want to make sure everyone is busy but the jobs that were lost may not come back in their pre-recession form as companies re-evaluate their employment policies and may rehire temp workers as needed rather than creating new positions , according to hans-peter kloes of the cologne institute for economic research . " there is a need for flexibility on the part of employers and a need for stability from the employed , " he said .
" the idea has to be to create a form of ' modern employment ' by balancing the sets of interests . " kloes added that germany 's relatively quick recovery from the global crisis relied on temp workers . " we are not dealing with cheap workers or undercutting wages , but with the creation of new alternatives , " he said . trial run bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : metal workers and employers agreed to equal pay for equal work temporary positions , kloes said , represent an opportunity for employers to test the new employees ' skills before hiring them in more permanent positions . " it has to be clear that people coming from unemployment are not going to walk into full-time positions , " he said . about half of the people who took on temp work in 2003 had received permanent positions within five years , according to a study done by the cologne institute . but trade unions do n't see the same benefits for temp workers , saying that many of those who do not receive permanent contracts are in positions for long periods of time without the benefits of long-term employment .
sommer has called on the government to change the laws making this possible . unions and employers agreed in september to pay temporary workers in the steel industry at the same rate as permanent employees , a move sommer said should serve as a model for other sectors as well . " we have to give in to european law and institute equal pay for equal work , " he said . author : sabine kinkartz / sms editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

arresting mladic is a crucial condition for serbia 's bid to join the european union . serbia increased the reward for information leading to the arrest of ratko mladic tenfold to 10 million euros -lrb- $ 13.7 million -rrb- , apparently to prove belgrade 's political will to capture the indicted war criminal .
the decision , announced on thursday , " represents serbia 's clear political will to remove the last remaining obstacle on its path towards the european union , " deputy war crimes prosecutor bruno vekaric told beta news agency .
the reward for wartime croation serb rebel leader goran hadzic was also raised to 500,000 euros .
both mladic and hadzic are believed to be hiding in serbia .
" these two men have kept the whole nation hostage , -lrb- but -rrb- also their families and future generations , " vekaric said experts are skeptical bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the srebrenica massacre was europe 's worst since world war ii ratko mladic was the bosnian serb army commander and is accused by the un of being responsible for the srebrenica massacre of 8,000 muslim men and boys , the worst single atrocity on european soil since world war ii .
he is also charged for masterminding the 1992-1995 siege of sarajevo , which killed 10,000 people .
mladic has been on the run for 15 years .
in may , his family tried to declare him dead , claiming that he had been in poor health and that they had had no contact with him for more than five years .
despite serbia 's intentions , raising the reward will likely have no affect mladic 's arrest , serbian security expert ljubodrag stojadinovic told deutsche welle .
it is not a question of gratification , but rather the government 's lack of control of the secret service who would be in charge of arresting mladic , he said .
according to dragan popovic , director of the center of applied politics in belgrade , serbia simply tries to send out a positive message to the international community in order to make them believe the government is actively going after mladic .
good news from brussels mladic 's arrest , along with cooperation with the international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia , is serbia 's greatest obstacle to its goal of joining the european union .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tadic follows a pro-european union course in june , un chief prosecutor serge brammertz accused serbia of putting little effort into arresting mladic and has demanded several times that serbia 's eu membership should depend on whether they can catch him .
eu foreign ministers meeting in luxembourg this week said they wanted to support the pro-european position of serbian president boris tadic , instructing the european commission to comment on serbia 's membership application .
an official statement from the commission is not expected before the second half of 2011 .

" the target may have been an aircraft and had it detonated , the aircraft could have been brought down , " she told reporters after a meeting with the uk government 's emergency committee cobra . one of the packages was found in the uk , the other in dubai .
both were addressed to chicago-area synagogues . yemeni threat police in dubai confirmed that one of the parcels contained " a computer printer whose ink contained explosive material " and that the manner in which the device was prepared bore " the hallmarks of those used by terrorist organizations like al qaeda .

the 67-year-old musician founded the west-eastern divan orchestra , made up of young jewish and arab musicians , in 1999 .
he shares the prize , worth 50,000 euros -lrb- $ 70,000 -rrb- with the members of the orchestra .
at the ceremony in the western german town of muenster on saturday , barenboim said the conflict between israelis and palestinians was no ordinary one .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barenboim founded the arab-israeli west-eastern divan orchestra " it 's not a military or a political conflict , but a human conflict , a conflict between two peoples , " he said .
building bridges and moving on german foreign minister guido westerwelle on saturday honored barenboim as a " peace activist in the best sense of the word . "
" often , it 's ordinary people like barenboim , whose activism builds bridges and sets the foundations for peace , " he said .
barenboim is also known in germany for promoting german composer richard wagner 's work , saying wagner ’ s work had nothing to do with the holocaust .
two weeks ago , at a symposium held by the berlin state opera ahead of the premiere of german composer richard wagner 's work , " das rheingold " , which barenboim will conduct , the musician said it was time to move on from the long-standing taboo of boycotting wagner 's work in countries like israel .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : westerwelle honored barenboim as an " activist in the best sense " " i do not believe that one can connect wagner with the final solution , " he said .
wagner , who created the opera cycle " the ring of the niebelungen " and other central works of the german canon , has long been stigmatized because of anti-semitic attitudes , and the fact that he was hitler 's favorite composer .
barenboim was born in buenos aires , argentina , on november 15 , 1942 to russian-born jewish parents .
he and his family moved to israel in 1952 .
the westphalia peace prize was last awarded in 2008 to former un secretary general kofi annan , and in earlier years to conductor kurt masur .
the prize is named after the peace of westphalia treaty from 1648 , which ended the thirty years ' war in the holy roman empire .

yet despite the passage of three similar agreements since then , men still hold most of the influence . following the passage of the groundbreaking resolution 1325 on oct .
31 , 2000 , the united nations women 's fund unifem appointed two women – elisabeth rehn , the former finnish minister of defence , and ellen johnson-sirleaf , who is now president of liberia – to conduct an independent , expert assessment on " women , war and peace . "
their findings confirmed the central idea at the heart of the resolution : " without women 's representation – without half the population – no country can truly claim to be engaged in democratic development and participatory governance . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hillary clinton pushed through new resolutions - to little avail resolution 1325 was the first to address war 's consequences for women , as well as the female role in preventing conflict and securing and building peace .
the security council unanimously adopted the resolution a decade ago , marking a turning point in the history of international rights for women .
the document called on all un member states to develop national action plans to help incorporate women into strategies for security and peace-building .
a female voice in peace talks the resolution ensures that women around the world are entitled to a role in peace negotiations .
but in many cases , their voices have yet to be heard by parties engaged in conflict .
according to un statistics , only 7.5 percent of negotiators participating in 22 peace processes since 1992 were female .
in 14 talks , only three percent of the signatories to peace deals were women .
despite those figures , the un security council has continued to stand up for women in conflict zones .
on june 19 , 2008 , resolution 1820 stated that rape and other forms of sexual violence could constitute war crimes and crimes against humanity , as well as a constitutive act with respect to genocide .
the resolution was coupled with calls for a " zero-tolerance policy " on sexual abuse by un staff engaged in peacekeeping and peace-building missions .
sexual violence on the rise but just a year later , a number of non-governmental organizations noted an increase in sex-related violence in countries like the democratic republic of congo , sudan , chad and the central african republic .
only rarely were the perpetrators held accountable for their crimes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the number of women civilians - if not troops - has risen in peacekeeping ranks the fact that 30 percent of civilian personnel for un peacekeeping missions are women can be seen as a breakthrough – and a by-product of both resolutions .
out of 27 peacekeeping operations , five are led by women – a huge success over previous years .
yet women today make up less than three percent of the military .
backed by us secretary of state hillary clinton , in the fall of 2009 , the un security council once again passed two resolutions , 1888 and 1889 .
they did n't strike off in any new directions , but they were more concrete than their predecessors .
as a result of the resolutions , ex-eu commissioner margot wallstroem , from sweden , was named special representative on sexual violence in conflict , a post that aims to fight violence against girls and women .
but it seems that overall the key strategy has been a disaster .
only 19 states have developed and passed a national action plan to enact resolution 1325 .
most countries do n't have the money push it through .
more analysis , more money , legal action speaking about the strategy recently , un secretary general ban ki-moon said , " we have made too little progress . "
looking at the horrible violence against women in congo , where more than 250,000 women have been raped in the past decade , ban said it was clear the international community was still failing to protect the people who are the most vulnerable .
according to the un security council , more steps are needed to make progress at last when it comes to women , peace and security .
these include more financial support for national action plans , systematic information delivery , an analysis of the topic of women in conflicts , and prosecution of those who breach the human rights of women - or who order their rights to be breached in war .

the 67-year-old musician founded the west-eastern divan orchestra , made up of young jewish and arab musicians , in 1999 .
he shares the prize , worth 50,000 euros -lrb- $ 70,000 -rrb- with the members of the orchestra .
at the ceremony in the western german town of muenster on saturday , barenboim said the conflict between israelis and palestinians was no ordinary one .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barenboim founded the arab-israeli west-eastern divan orchestra " it 's not a military or a political conflict , but a human conflict , a conflict between two peoples , " he said .
building bridges and moving on german foreign minister guido westerwelle on saturday honored barenboim as a " peace activist in the best sense of the word . "
" often , it 's ordinary people like barenboim , whose activism builds bridges and sets the foundations for peace , " he said .
barenboim is also known in germany for promoting german composer richard wagner 's work , saying wagner ’ s work had nothing to do with the holocaust .
two weeks ago , at a symposium held by the berlin state opera ahead of the premiere of german composer richard wagner 's work , " das rheingold " , which barenboim will conduct , the musician said it was time to move on from the long-standing taboo of boycotting wagner 's work in countries like israel .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : westerwelle honored barenboim as an " activist in the best sense " " i do not believe that one can connect wagner with the final solution , " he said .
wagner , who created the opera cycle " the ring of the niebelungen " and other central works of the german canon , has long been stigmatized because of anti-semitic attitudes , and the fact that he was hitler 's favorite composer .
barenboim was born in buenos aires , argentina , on november 15 , 1942 to russian-born jewish parents .
he and his family moved to israel in 1952 .
the westphalia peace prize was last awarded in 2008 to former un secretary general kofi annan , and in earlier years to conductor kurt masur .
the prize is named after the peace of westphalia treaty from 1648 , which ended the thirty years ' war in the holy roman empire .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de afghanistan -pipe- 30.10.2010 women seek a role in afghanistan peace process großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the afghanistan peace council includes only nine women un resolution 1325 calls on women to be given an equal role in peace negotiations in areas of conflict .
but this is far from the case in afghanistan , where many women are pushing for more participation . marzia is a police officer in uniform , still a rare sight in afghan society , even though the female component of the afghan security forces is important in a muslim society .
if apartments need to be searched , then marzia 's job is to check the women 's bedrooms and closets .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women in afghanistan are still struggling to make their voices heard marzia says there should be more afghan women with jobs , and believes that the political climate is auspicious .
" the freedom of movement has improved for women , " she said .
" women are now allowed to work alongside men .
it does n't matter where or what it is , women should get jobs . "
women as negotiators although afghan society may be changing , women are still a minority in positions of responsibility when it comes to peace negotiations - as they are throughout the world .
it was for this reason that the united nations agreed resolution 1325 10 years ago , a document that demanded that women be given an equal role in conflict resolution in all regional , national and international institutions .
the prominent afghan women 's rights campaigner soraya parlika believes that her country is still a long way from this aim .
she points to president hamid karzai 's newly-founded peace council , of whose 69 members only nine are women .
seven of those nine have been appointed by karzai , which parlika believes limits their independence .
" these women are sitting together with men who only know war , " she said .
" they are not heard and they have no chance to influence the negotiations in any way . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : afghan women live in fear of losing family members golzum seddiqi , director of an initiative for women lawyers in the western town of herat , does not see the women on the peace council in a particularly positive light .
" up until now , they do n't have any plans or strategies for positions in which they have political or social responsibility , " she said .
" they need to get rid of other problems first .
some women with no qualifications have used the opportunity to get important positions through bribes and connections . "
peace starts in the family but herat provincial councillor djamila karimi believes that the lack of qualifications is a minor concern for the women on the peace council .
she thinks women are not taken seriously as peace negotiators simply because afghan women have been locked into a passive role in society that wo n't be changed overnight .
" these are women who constantly live with the fear of losing family members to the war .
i think women can teach their children not to take up weapons in the future , " karimi said .
" a bearded warlord in afghanistan wo n't listen to women 's demands at the end of the war .
but a child listens to its mother . "
according to karimi , many afghan women want nothing more than to see their children go to school to learn how to build a new afghan society , while very few want a political career .
instead , they still concentrate on their responsibilities within the family .

" while german workers grew accustomed to spending their working lives with a single company , current statistics show the situation on the job market has undergone serious changes . temp work on the rise bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : temp workers are regarded as flexible employees the number of people with permanent contracts accompanied by unemployment and other social benefits has fallen while the number of people in recent years while the number of people requiring state aid to round out their pay has increased , according to the dgb . the unions reported that 2.2 million people in germany work for an hourly wage of less than 6 euros and that 1.3 million people receive state subsidies since their pay alone does not keep them above the poverty line .
temp work , which usually comes without benefits , has also increased from 704,000 in june to 1 million in october . " temp workers are a very flexible reserve of workers and , as we saw during the crisis , are the first be fired and are paid much worse than staff doing the same job , " sommer said , adding that the pay gap amounted to 7 euros per hour . german companies were able to avoid widespread layoffs by implementing government subsidies for shortened working hours .
this allowed businesses respond to an upturn in orders without delays associated with having to rehire workers . companies re-evaluate staffing options bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : employers want to make sure everyone is busy but the jobs that were lost may not come back in their pre-recession form as companies re-evaluate their employment policies and may rehire temp workers as needed rather than creating new positions , according to hans-peter kloes of the cologne institute for economic research . " there is a need for flexibility on the part of employers and a need for stability from the employed , " he said .
" the idea has to be to create a form of ' modern employment ' by balancing the sets of interests . " kloes added that germany 's relatively quick recovery from the global crisis relied on temp workers . " we are not dealing with cheap workers or undercutting wages , but with the creation of new alternatives , " he said . trial run bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : metal workers and employers agreed to equal pay for equal work temporary positions , kloes said , represent an opportunity for employers to test the new employees ' skills before hiring them in more permanent positions . " it has to be clear that people coming from unemployment are not going to walk into full-time positions , " he said . about half of the people who took on temp work in 2003 had received permanent positions within five years , according to a study done by the cologne institute . but trade unions do n't see the same benefits for temp workers , saying that many of those who do not receive permanent contracts are in positions for long periods of time without the benefits of long-term employment .
sommer has called on the government to change the laws making this possible . unions and employers agreed in september to pay temporary workers in the steel industry at the same rate as permanent employees , a move sommer said should serve as a model for other sectors as well . " we have to give in to european law and institute equal pay for equal work , " he said . author : sabine kinkartz / sms editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de afghanistan -pipe- 30.10.2010 women seek a role in afghanistan peace process großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the afghanistan peace council includes only nine women un resolution 1325 calls on women to be given an equal role in peace negotiations in areas of conflict .
but this is far from the case in afghanistan , where many women are pushing for more participation . marzia is a police officer in uniform , still a rare sight in afghan society , even though the female component of the afghan security forces is important in a muslim society .
if apartments need to be searched , then marzia 's job is to check the women 's bedrooms and closets .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women in afghanistan are still struggling to make their voices heard marzia says there should be more afghan women with jobs , and believes that the political climate is auspicious .
" the freedom of movement has improved for women , " she said .
" women are now allowed to work alongside men .
it does n't matter where or what it is , women should get jobs . "
women as negotiators although afghan society may be changing , women are still a minority in positions of responsibility when it comes to peace negotiations - as they are throughout the world .
it was for this reason that the united nations agreed resolution 1325 10 years ago , a document that demanded that women be given an equal role in conflict resolution in all regional , national and international institutions .
the prominent afghan women 's rights campaigner soraya parlika believes that her country is still a long way from this aim .
she points to president hamid karzai 's newly-founded peace council , of whose 69 members only nine are women .
seven of those nine have been appointed by karzai , which parlika believes limits their independence .
" these women are sitting together with men who only know war , " she said .
" they are not heard and they have no chance to influence the negotiations in any way . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : afghan women live in fear of losing family members golzum seddiqi , director of an initiative for women lawyers in the western town of herat , does not see the women on the peace council in a particularly positive light .
" up until now , they do n't have any plans or strategies for positions in which they have political or social responsibility , " she said .
" they need to get rid of other problems first .
some women with no qualifications have used the opportunity to get important positions through bribes and connections . "
peace starts in the family but herat provincial councillor djamila karimi believes that the lack of qualifications is a minor concern for the women on the peace council .
she thinks women are not taken seriously as peace negotiators simply because afghan women have been locked into a passive role in society that wo n't be changed overnight .
" these are women who constantly live with the fear of losing family members to the war .
i think women can teach their children not to take up weapons in the future , " karimi said .
" a bearded warlord in afghanistan wo n't listen to women 's demands at the end of the war .
but a child listens to its mother . "
according to karimi , many afghan women want nothing more than to see their children go to school to learn how to build a new afghan society , while very few want a political career .
instead , they still concentrate on their responsibilities within the family .

the 67-year-old musician founded the west-eastern divan orchestra , made up of young jewish and arab musicians , in 1999 .
he shares the prize , worth 50,000 euros -lrb- $ 70,000 -rrb- with the members of the orchestra .
at the ceremony in the western german town of muenster on saturday , barenboim said the conflict between israelis and palestinians was no ordinary one .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barenboim founded the arab-israeli west-eastern divan orchestra " it 's not a military or a political conflict , but a human conflict , a conflict between two peoples , " he said .
building bridges and moving on german foreign minister guido westerwelle on saturday honored barenboim as a " peace activist in the best sense of the word . "
" often , it 's ordinary people like barenboim , whose activism builds bridges and sets the foundations for peace , " he said .
barenboim is also known in germany for promoting german composer richard wagner 's work , saying wagner ’ s work had nothing to do with the holocaust .
two weeks ago , at a symposium held by the berlin state opera ahead of the premiere of german composer richard wagner 's work , " das rheingold " , which barenboim will conduct , the musician said it was time to move on from the long-standing taboo of boycotting wagner 's work in countries like israel .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : westerwelle honored barenboim as an " activist in the best sense " " i do not believe that one can connect wagner with the final solution , " he said .
wagner , who created the opera cycle " the ring of the niebelungen " and other central works of the german canon , has long been stigmatized because of anti-semitic attitudes , and the fact that he was hitler 's favorite composer .
barenboim was born in buenos aires , argentina , on november 15 , 1942 to russian-born jewish parents .
he and his family moved to israel in 1952 .
the westphalia peace prize was last awarded in 2008 to former un secretary general kofi annan , and in earlier years to conductor kurt masur .
the prize is named after the peace of westphalia treaty from 1648 , which ended the thirty years ' war in the holy roman empire .

" while german workers grew accustomed to spending their working lives with a single company , current statistics show the situation on the job market has undergone serious changes . temp work on the rise bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : temp workers are regarded as flexible employees the number of people with permanent contracts accompanied by unemployment and other social benefits has fallen while the number of people in recent years while the number of people requiring state aid to round out their pay has increased , according to the dgb . the unions reported that 2.2 million people in germany work for an hourly wage of less than 6 euros and that 1.3 million people receive state subsidies since their pay alone does not keep them above the poverty line .
temp work , which usually comes without benefits , has also increased from 704,000 in june to 1 million in october . " temp workers are a very flexible reserve of workers and , as we saw during the crisis , are the first be fired and are paid much worse than staff doing the same job , " sommer said , adding that the pay gap amounted to 7 euros per hour . german companies were able to avoid widespread layoffs by implementing government subsidies for shortened working hours .
this allowed businesses respond to an upturn in orders without delays associated with having to rehire workers . companies re-evaluate staffing options bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : employers want to make sure everyone is busy but the jobs that were lost may not come back in their pre-recession form as companies re-evaluate their employment policies and may rehire temp workers as needed rather than creating new positions , according to hans-peter kloes of the cologne institute for economic research . " there is a need for flexibility on the part of employers and a need for stability from the employed , " he said .
" the idea has to be to create a form of ' modern employment ' by balancing the sets of interests . " kloes added that germany 's relatively quick recovery from the global crisis relied on temp workers . " we are not dealing with cheap workers or undercutting wages , but with the creation of new alternatives , " he said . trial run bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : metal workers and employers agreed to equal pay for equal work temporary positions , kloes said , represent an opportunity for employers to test the new employees ' skills before hiring them in more permanent positions . " it has to be clear that people coming from unemployment are not going to walk into full-time positions , " he said . about half of the people who took on temp work in 2003 had received permanent positions within five years , according to a study done by the cologne institute . but trade unions do n't see the same benefits for temp workers , saying that many of those who do not receive permanent contracts are in positions for long periods of time without the benefits of long-term employment .
sommer has called on the government to change the laws making this possible . unions and employers agreed in september to pay temporary workers in the steel industry at the same rate as permanent employees , a move sommer said should serve as a model for other sectors as well . " we have to give in to european law and institute equal pay for equal work , " he said . author : sabine kinkartz / sms editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

more than a dent in trafficking , the raid represents growing cooperation between russia and the west . russian and american forces conducted their first joint anti-narcotics raid in afghanistan early on thursday , signaling closer cooperation between the two countries in the battle to control drug cultivation in the war-torn country , the world 's largest producer of opium .
russian anti-drug chief viktor ivanov told a news conference on friday that the raid took place near the pakistani border , and that russian and us forces were supported by helicopters and afghan police .
" four laboratories were found and destroyed - three for heroin and one for morphine , " ivanov said .
" as a result , 932 kilograms -lrb- 2,055 pounds -rrb- of very highly concentrated heroin and 156 kilograms of opium were destroyed . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : afghanistan is the world 's biggest source of opium he added that the street value of the drugs could be up to $ 250 million -lrb- 180 million euros -rrb- .
the us drug enforcement administration released a statement noting the same amount of drugs seized , but said the heroin was worth $ 55.9 million .
eric rubin , deputy chief of mission at the american embassy in moscow , said the operation was a " very big " seizure .
" just in terms of disruption , this was a very important operation , but it was also part of a larger strategy to attack the drug flows , " rubin said at the news conference with ivanov .
shadows of soviet war trafficking from afghanistan has stoked a major heroin problem in russia , and ivanov has criticized the us strategy in its war on afghan drugs , urging more aggressive eradication of poppy crops .
the amount seized in thursday 's raid is unlikely to have a significant effect on the afghan drug trade .
the country produces about 90 percent of the world 's opium , which is used to make heroin .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us funded afghan militias to fight the soviet union but the raid did represent an increase in cooperation between the us and russia , two decades after the us funded afghan militias to chase out soviet occupying forces .
thousands of soviet soldiers were killed in the 10-year war , and going back to afghanistan remains a sensitive issue in russia .
several politicians , including prime minister vladimir putin , have said sending russian troops to join the nato-led mission afghanistan is out of the question .
but the joint us-russian drug raid - along with russia 's willingness to let nato forces fly in and out of afghanistan through russian territory and its offer to sell helicopters to the afghan army - suggests russia 's cooperation with the west on afghanistan is improving .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 30.10.2010 bundesliga 's top two go head-to-head after embarrassing cup defeats großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : both teams have pushed on from last year 's performances it 's a top-of-the-table clash which few would have predicted at this stage of an already surprising season .
bundesliga leaders mainz take on nearest rivals dortmund sunday after both were beaten in mid-week cup matches . with the bundesliga ’ s designated 800-pound gorilla bayern munich sputtering in mid-table , and other top teams from recent years like wolfsburg , stuttgart , bremen and schalke doing likewise , two teams coached by ambitious young coaches have risen to the challenge and claimed the top spots for themselves .
just two points separate the teams in first and second place , so sunday 's match will determine who will be top dog at the end of match day ten .
both teams come into the game on the back of embarrassing german cup defeats in midweek and nothing will be allowed to cloud the focus as mainz and dortmund look to bounce back and keep their exciting , entertaining and surprising rivalry at the top of the bundesliga on track .
both mainz and dortmund have earned their positions through attacking soccer .
their coaches , both combustible and passionate characters , have fashioned their teams in their own images and are reaping the benefits of molding their players into systems and tactics full of their own belief and confidence .
thomas tuchel at mainz and juergen klopp at dortmund have hugely competitive personalities and their desire to win can be seen in the way that their teams hound and harass the opposition and attack with purpose .
but while points and league position are important in the pursuit of the title , both coaches have also impressed on their players the need to win with style .
dortmund coach adds youth to solid base bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klopp looks to improve on last season 's fifth-place finish klopp , the former mainz boss who coached the team who won the club ’ s first-ever promotion to the top flight in 2004 , has built on his impressive first season in dortmund by spending wisely and investing in the club 's already rich vein of youth .
since klopp has taken over at bvb , shinji kagawa , kevin grosskreutz , sven bender , marcel schmelzer , mario goetze and mats hummels - none older then 22 - have come into the bvb first team and excelled , adding fluidity and danger to the side .
meanwhile nuri sahin , whose career was once thought to have entered a holding pattern after an up-and-down loan spell in holland at feyenoord , has become the rock of dortmund ’ s midfield .
he too is still just 22 .
up front , lucas barrios has been a revelation since joining last season and has cemented his reputation as one of the bundesliga 's most feared marksmen .
after hitting 19 goals in his debut campaign , he ’ s netted four thus far in the new season , and the attention he draws from opposing defenders often opens up ample space for his teammates .
tuchel adds flair and verve to turn mainz into contenders bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tuchel has instilled belief and camaraderie in his team tuchel , meanwhile , has transformed mainz from a mid-table entity into a title-chasing force since taking the reins in 2009 .
he led the team to ninth last season , its best ever bundesliga finish , and has built on that performance by finding his own set of precocious talents .
he snared schalke ’ s lewis holtby on loan and seen him shine , and he ’ s turned the andre schuerrle and adam szalai , once cosseted talents , into linchpins of the side .
both dortmund and mainz have seen the benefits of giving youngsters their chance , a reflection of the current philosophy being promoted at international level in germany .
adhering to the old standard of " if you 're old enough , you 're good enough , " klopp and tuchel have tapped into the desire young players have to succeed and challenge for places and silverware .
the results are there to see in the bundesliga table .
sunday 's clash will always be an emotional one for klopp , the former fan favorite and hero of mainz 's promotion campaign six years ago .
but forced to choose between taking it easy on his old club and going top himself , there will be no room for sentimentality .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women in afghanistan are still struggling to make their voices heard marzia says there should be more afghan women with jobs , and believes that the political climate is auspicious .
" the freedom of movement has improved for women , " she said .
" women are now allowed to work alongside men .
it does n't matter where or what it is , women should get jobs . "
women as negotiators although afghan society may be changing , women are still a minority in positions of responsibility when it comes to peace negotiations - as they are throughout the world .
it was for this reason that the united nations agreed resolution 1325 10 years ago , a document that demanded that women be given an equal role in conflict resolution in all regional , national and international institutions .
the prominent afghan women 's rights campaigner soraya parlika believes that her country is still a long way from this aim .
she points to president hamid karzai 's newly-founded peace council , of whose 69 members only nine are women .
seven of those nine have been appointed by karzai , which parlika believes limits their independence .

" they need to get rid of other problems first .
some women with no qualifications have used the opportunity to get important positions through bribes and connections . "
peace starts in the family but herat provincial councillor djamila karimi believes that the lack of qualifications is a minor concern for the women on the peace council .
she thinks women are not taken seriously as peace negotiators simply because afghan women have been locked into a passive role in society that wo n't be changed overnight .
" these are women who constantly live with the fear of losing family members to the war .
i think women can teach their children not to take up weapons in the future , " karimi said .
" a bearded warlord in afghanistan wo n't listen to women 's demands at the end of the war .
but a child listens to its mother . "
according to karimi , many afghan women want nothing more than to see their children go to school to learn how to build a new afghan society , while very few want a political career .
instead , they still concentrate on their responsibilities within the family .

yet despite the passage of three similar agreements since then , men still hold most of the influence . following the passage of the groundbreaking resolution 1325 on oct .
31 , 2000 , the united nations women 's fund unifem appointed two women – elisabeth rehn , the former finnish minister of defence , and ellen johnson-sirleaf , who is now president of liberia – to conduct an independent , expert assessment on " women , war and peace . "
their findings confirmed the central idea at the heart of the resolution : " without women 's representation – without half the population – no country can truly claim to be engaged in democratic development and participatory governance . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hillary clinton pushed through new resolutions - to little avail resolution 1325 was the first to address war 's consequences for women , as well as the female role in preventing conflict and securing and building peace .
the security council unanimously adopted the resolution a decade ago , marking a turning point in the history of international rights for women .
the document called on all un member states to develop national action plans to help incorporate women into strategies for security and peace-building .
a female voice in peace talks the resolution ensures that women around the world are entitled to a role in peace negotiations .
but in many cases , their voices have yet to be heard by parties engaged in conflict .
according to un statistics , only 7.5 percent of negotiators participating in 22 peace processes since 1992 were female .
in 14 talks , only three percent of the signatories to peace deals were women .
despite those figures , the un security council has continued to stand up for women in conflict zones .
on june 19 , 2008 , resolution 1820 stated that rape and other forms of sexual violence could constitute war crimes and crimes against humanity , as well as a constitutive act with respect to genocide .
the resolution was coupled with calls for a " zero-tolerance policy " on sexual abuse by un staff engaged in peacekeeping and peace-building missions .
sexual violence on the rise but just a year later , a number of non-governmental organizations noted an increase in sex-related violence in countries like the democratic republic of congo , sudan , chad and the central african republic .
only rarely were the perpetrators held accountable for their crimes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the number of women civilians - if not troops - has risen in peacekeeping ranks the fact that 30 percent of civilian personnel for un peacekeeping missions are women can be seen as a breakthrough – and a by-product of both resolutions .
out of 27 peacekeeping operations , five are led by women – a huge success over previous years .
yet women today make up less than three percent of the military .
backed by us secretary of state hillary clinton , in the fall of 2009 , the un security council once again passed two resolutions , 1888 and 1889 .
they did n't strike off in any new directions , but they were more concrete than their predecessors .
as a result of the resolutions , ex-eu commissioner margot wallstroem , from sweden , was named special representative on sexual violence in conflict , a post that aims to fight violence against girls and women .
but it seems that overall the key strategy has been a disaster .
only 19 states have developed and passed a national action plan to enact resolution 1325 .
most countries do n't have the money push it through .
more analysis , more money , legal action speaking about the strategy recently , un secretary general ban ki-moon said , " we have made too little progress . "
looking at the horrible violence against women in congo , where more than 250,000 women have been raped in the past decade , ban said it was clear the international community was still failing to protect the people who are the most vulnerable .
according to the un security council , more steps are needed to make progress at last when it comes to women , peace and security .
these include more financial support for national action plans , systematic information delivery , an analysis of the topic of women in conflicts , and prosecution of those who breach the human rights of women - or who order their rights to be breached in war .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de drugs -pipe- 30.10.2010 russians join american troops in afghanistan drug raid großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia has criticized us anti-drug efforts in afghanistan russian and us forces raided four drug laboratories in afghanistan in their first joint anti-drug operation .
more than a dent in trafficking , the raid represents growing cooperation between russia and the west . russian and american forces conducted their first joint anti-narcotics raid in afghanistan early on thursday , signaling closer cooperation between the two countries in the battle to control drug cultivation in the war-torn country , the world 's largest producer of opium .
russian anti-drug chief viktor ivanov told a news conference on friday that the raid took place near the pakistani border , and that russian and us forces were supported by helicopters and afghan police .
" four laboratories were found and destroyed - three for heroin and one for morphine , " ivanov said .
" as a result , 932 kilograms -lrb- 2,055 pounds -rrb- of very highly concentrated heroin and 156 kilograms of opium were destroyed . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : afghanistan is the world 's biggest source of opium he added that the street value of the drugs could be up to $ 250 million -lrb- 180 million euros -rrb- .
the us drug enforcement administration released a statement noting the same amount of drugs seized , but said the heroin was worth $ 55.9 million .
eric rubin , deputy chief of mission at the american embassy in moscow , said the operation was a " very big " seizure .
" just in terms of disruption , this was a very important operation , but it was also part of a larger strategy to attack the drug flows , " rubin said at the news conference with ivanov .
shadows of soviet war trafficking from afghanistan has stoked a major heroin problem in russia , and ivanov has criticized the us strategy in its war on afghan drugs , urging more aggressive eradication of poppy crops .
the amount seized in thursday 's raid is unlikely to have a significant effect on the afghan drug trade .
the country produces about 90 percent of the world 's opium , which is used to make heroin .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us funded afghan militias to fight the soviet union but the raid did represent an increase in cooperation between the us and russia , two decades after the us funded afghan militias to chase out soviet occupying forces .
thousands of soviet soldiers were killed in the 10-year war , and going back to afghanistan remains a sensitive issue in russia .
several politicians , including prime minister vladimir putin , have said sending russian troops to join the nato-led mission afghanistan is out of the question .
but the joint us-russian drug raid - along with russia 's willingness to let nato forces fly in and out of afghanistan through russian territory and its offer to sell helicopters to the afghan army - suggests russia 's cooperation with the west on afghanistan is improving .

yet despite the passage of three similar agreements since then , men still hold most of the influence . following the passage of the groundbreaking resolution 1325 on oct .
31 , 2000 , the united nations women 's fund unifem appointed two women – elisabeth rehn , the former finnish minister of defence , and ellen johnson-sirleaf , who is now president of liberia – to conduct an independent , expert assessment on " women , war and peace . "
their findings confirmed the central idea at the heart of the resolution : " without women 's representation – without half the population – no country can truly claim to be engaged in democratic development and participatory governance . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hillary clinton pushed through new resolutions - to little avail resolution 1325 was the first to address war 's consequences for women , as well as the female role in preventing conflict and securing and building peace .
the security council unanimously adopted the resolution a decade ago , marking a turning point in the history of international rights for women .
the document called on all un member states to develop national action plans to help incorporate women into strategies for security and peace-building .
a female voice in peace talks the resolution ensures that women around the world are entitled to a role in peace negotiations .
but in many cases , their voices have yet to be heard by parties engaged in conflict .
according to un statistics , only 7.5 percent of negotiators participating in 22 peace processes since 1992 were female .
in 14 talks , only three percent of the signatories to peace deals were women .
despite those figures , the un security council has continued to stand up for women in conflict zones .
on june 19 , 2008 , resolution 1820 stated that rape and other forms of sexual violence could constitute war crimes and crimes against humanity , as well as a constitutive act with respect to genocide .
the resolution was coupled with calls for a " zero-tolerance policy " on sexual abuse by un staff engaged in peacekeeping and peace-building missions .
sexual violence on the rise but just a year later , a number of non-governmental organizations noted an increase in sex-related violence in countries like the democratic republic of congo , sudan , chad and the central african republic .
only rarely were the perpetrators held accountable for their crimes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the number of women civilians - if not troops - has risen in peacekeeping ranks the fact that 30 percent of civilian personnel for un peacekeeping missions are women can be seen as a breakthrough – and a by-product of both resolutions .
out of 27 peacekeeping operations , five are led by women – a huge success over previous years .
yet women today make up less than three percent of the military .
backed by us secretary of state hillary clinton , in the fall of 2009 , the un security council once again passed two resolutions , 1888 and 1889 .
they did n't strike off in any new directions , but they were more concrete than their predecessors .
as a result of the resolutions , ex-eu commissioner margot wallstroem , from sweden , was named special representative on sexual violence in conflict , a post that aims to fight violence against girls and women .
but it seems that overall the key strategy has been a disaster .
only 19 states have developed and passed a national action plan to enact resolution 1325 .
most countries do n't have the money push it through .
more analysis , more money , legal action speaking about the strategy recently , un secretary general ban ki-moon said , " we have made too little progress . "
looking at the horrible violence against women in congo , where more than 250,000 women have been raped in the past decade , ban said it was clear the international community was still failing to protect the people who are the most vulnerable .
according to the un security council , more steps are needed to make progress at last when it comes to women , peace and security .
these include more financial support for national action plans , systematic information delivery , an analysis of the topic of women in conflicts , and prosecution of those who breach the human rights of women - or who order their rights to be breached in war .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de drugs -pipe- 30.10.2010 russians join american troops in afghanistan drug raid großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia has criticized us anti-drug efforts in afghanistan russian and us forces raided four drug laboratories in afghanistan in their first joint anti-drug operation .
more than a dent in trafficking , the raid represents growing cooperation between russia and the west . russian and american forces conducted their first joint anti-narcotics raid in afghanistan early on thursday , signaling closer cooperation between the two countries in the battle to control drug cultivation in the war-torn country , the world 's largest producer of opium .
russian anti-drug chief viktor ivanov told a news conference on friday that the raid took place near the pakistani border , and that russian and us forces were supported by helicopters and afghan police .
" four laboratories were found and destroyed - three for heroin and one for morphine , " ivanov said .
" as a result , 932 kilograms -lrb- 2,055 pounds -rrb- of very highly concentrated heroin and 156 kilograms of opium were destroyed . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : afghanistan is the world 's biggest source of opium he added that the street value of the drugs could be up to $ 250 million -lrb- 180 million euros -rrb- .
the us drug enforcement administration released a statement noting the same amount of drugs seized , but said the heroin was worth $ 55.9 million .
eric rubin , deputy chief of mission at the american embassy in moscow , said the operation was a " very big " seizure .
" just in terms of disruption , this was a very important operation , but it was also part of a larger strategy to attack the drug flows , " rubin said at the news conference with ivanov .
shadows of soviet war trafficking from afghanistan has stoked a major heroin problem in russia , and ivanov has criticized the us strategy in its war on afghan drugs , urging more aggressive eradication of poppy crops .
the amount seized in thursday 's raid is unlikely to have a significant effect on the afghan drug trade .
the country produces about 90 percent of the world 's opium , which is used to make heroin .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us funded afghan militias to fight the soviet union but the raid did represent an increase in cooperation between the us and russia , two decades after the us funded afghan militias to chase out soviet occupying forces .
thousands of soviet soldiers were killed in the 10-year war , and going back to afghanistan remains a sensitive issue in russia .
several politicians , including prime minister vladimir putin , have said sending russian troops to join the nato-led mission afghanistan is out of the question .
but the joint us-russian drug raid - along with russia 's willingness to let nato forces fly in and out of afghanistan through russian territory and its offer to sell helicopters to the afghan army - suggests russia 's cooperation with the west on afghanistan is improving .

bundesliga leaders mainz take on nearest rivals dortmund sunday after both were beaten in mid-week cup matches . with the bundesliga ’ s designated 800-pound gorilla bayern munich sputtering in mid-table , and other top teams from recent years like wolfsburg , stuttgart , bremen and schalke doing likewise , two teams coached by ambitious young coaches have risen to the challenge and claimed the top spots for themselves .
just two points separate the teams in first and second place , so sunday 's match will determine who will be top dog at the end of match day ten .
both teams come into the game on the back of embarrassing german cup defeats in midweek and nothing will be allowed to cloud the focus as mainz and dortmund look to bounce back and keep their exciting , entertaining and surprising rivalry at the top of the bundesliga on track .
both mainz and dortmund have earned their positions through attacking soccer .
their coaches , both combustible and passionate characters , have fashioned their teams in their own images and are reaping the benefits of molding their players into systems and tactics full of their own belief and confidence .
thomas tuchel at mainz and juergen klopp at dortmund have hugely competitive personalities and their desire to win can be seen in the way that their teams hound and harass the opposition and attack with purpose .
but while points and league position are important in the pursuit of the title , both coaches have also impressed on their players the need to win with style .
dortmund coach adds youth to solid base bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klopp looks to improve on last season 's fifth-place finish klopp , the former mainz boss who coached the team who won the club ’ s first-ever promotion to the top flight in 2004 , has built on his impressive first season in dortmund by spending wisely and investing in the club 's already rich vein of youth .
since klopp has taken over at bvb , shinji kagawa , kevin grosskreutz , sven bender , marcel schmelzer , mario goetze and mats hummels - none older then 22 - have come into the bvb first team and excelled , adding fluidity and danger to the side .
meanwhile nuri sahin , whose career was once thought to have entered a holding pattern after an up-and-down loan spell in holland at feyenoord , has become the rock of dortmund ’ s midfield .
he too is still just 22 .
up front , lucas barrios has been a revelation since joining last season and has cemented his reputation as one of the bundesliga 's most feared marksmen .
after hitting 19 goals in his debut campaign , he ’ s netted four thus far in the new season , and the attention he draws from opposing defenders often opens up ample space for his teammates .
tuchel adds flair and verve to turn mainz into contenders bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tuchel has instilled belief and camaraderie in his team tuchel , meanwhile , has transformed mainz from a mid-table entity into a title-chasing force since taking the reins in 2009 .
he led the team to ninth last season , its best ever bundesliga finish , and has built on that performance by finding his own set of precocious talents .
he snared schalke ’ s lewis holtby on loan and seen him shine , and he ’ s turned the andre schuerrle and adam szalai , once cosseted talents , into linchpins of the side .
both dortmund and mainz have seen the benefits of giving youngsters their chance , a reflection of the current philosophy being promoted at international level in germany .
adhering to the old standard of " if you 're old enough , you 're good enough , " klopp and tuchel have tapped into the desire young players have to succeed and challenge for places and silverware .
the results are there to see in the bundesliga table .
sunday 's clash will always be an emotional one for klopp , the former fan favorite and hero of mainz 's promotion campaign six years ago .
but forced to choose between taking it easy on his old club and going top himself , there will be no room for sentimentality .

now trade unions want employers to start hiring temp workers for long-term employment . the number of unemployed in germany fell to below 3 million for the first time in 18 years , labor minister ursula von der leyen said this week . michael sommer , head of the german trade union federation -lrb- dgb -rrb- , said he now wants to see germany 's recovery from the global economic crisis translate into improved conditions for german workers . " people have to be able to live from their work , " he said .
" they also have to have a say in their work .
economic bosses ca n't say they want to do things one way then change their tune and start doing things another way .
employers ' and workers ' interests need to be considered . " while german workers grew accustomed to spending their working lives with a single company , current statistics show the situation on the job market has undergone serious changes . temp work on the rise bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : temp workers are regarded as flexible employees the number of people with permanent contracts accompanied by unemployment and other social benefits has fallen while the number of people in recent years while the number of people requiring state aid to round out their pay has increased , according to the dgb . the unions reported that 2.2 million people in germany work for an hourly wage of less than 6 euros and that 1.3 million people receive state subsidies since their pay alone does not keep them above the poverty line .
temp work , which usually comes without benefits , has also increased from 704,000 in june to 1 million in october . " temp workers are a very flexible reserve of workers and , as we saw during the crisis , are the first be fired and are paid much worse than staff doing the same job , " sommer said , adding that the pay gap amounted to 7 euros per hour . german companies were able to avoid widespread layoffs by implementing government subsidies for shortened working hours .
this allowed businesses respond to an upturn in orders without delays associated with having to rehire workers . companies re-evaluate staffing options bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : employers want to make sure everyone is busy but the jobs that were lost may not come back in their pre-recession form as companies re-evaluate their employment policies and may rehire temp workers as needed rather than creating new positions , according to hans-peter kloes of the cologne institute for economic research . " there is a need for flexibility on the part of employers and a need for stability from the employed , " he said .
" the idea has to be to create a form of ' modern employment ' by balancing the sets of interests . " kloes added that germany 's relatively quick recovery from the global crisis relied on temp workers . " we are not dealing with cheap workers or undercutting wages , but with the creation of new alternatives , " he said . trial run bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : metal workers and employers agreed to equal pay for equal work temporary positions , kloes said , represent an opportunity for employers to test the new employees ' skills before hiring them in more permanent positions . " it has to be clear that people coming from unemployment are not going to walk into full-time positions , " he said . about half of the people who took on temp work in 2003 had received permanent positions within five years , according to a study done by the cologne institute . but trade unions do n't see the same benefits for temp workers , saying that many of those who do not receive permanent contracts are in positions for long periods of time without the benefits of long-term employment .
sommer has called on the government to change the laws making this possible . unions and employers agreed in september to pay temporary workers in the steel industry at the same rate as permanent employees , a move sommer said should serve as a model for other sectors as well . " we have to give in to european law and institute equal pay for equal work , " he said . author : sabine kinkartz / sms editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de classical music -pipe- 30.10.2010 jewish conductor barenboim awarded german peace prize großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barenboim says music can bring people in the middle east together the argentine-israeli conductor daniel barenboim has been awarded germany 's westphalia peace prize for his efforts to promote reconciliation in the middle east with his israeli-arab west-eastern divan orchestra . daniel barenboim , the israeli-argentine conductor , pianist and general music director at berlin 's state opera , has been awarded germany 's westphalia peace prize for promoting understanding and reconciliation through music .
the 67-year-old musician founded the west-eastern divan orchestra , made up of young jewish and arab musicians , in 1999 .
he shares the prize , worth 50,000 euros -lrb- $ 70,000 -rrb- with the members of the orchestra .
at the ceremony in the western german town of muenster on saturday , barenboim said the conflict between israelis and palestinians was no ordinary one .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barenboim founded the arab-israeli west-eastern divan orchestra " it 's not a military or a political conflict , but a human conflict , a conflict between two peoples , " he said .
building bridges and moving on german foreign minister guido westerwelle on saturday honored barenboim as a " peace activist in the best sense of the word . "
" often , it 's ordinary people like barenboim , whose activism builds bridges and sets the foundations for peace , " he said .
barenboim is also known in germany for promoting german composer richard wagner 's work , saying wagner ’ s work had nothing to do with the holocaust .
two weeks ago , at a symposium held by the berlin state opera ahead of the premiere of german composer richard wagner 's work , " das rheingold " , which barenboim will conduct , the musician said it was time to move on from the long-standing taboo of boycotting wagner 's work in countries like israel .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : westerwelle honored barenboim as an " activist in the best sense " " i do not believe that one can connect wagner with the final solution , " he said .
wagner , who created the opera cycle " the ring of the niebelungen " and other central works of the german canon , has long been stigmatized because of anti-semitic attitudes , and the fact that he was hitler 's favorite composer .
barenboim was born in buenos aires , argentina , on november 15 , 1942 to russian-born jewish parents .
he and his family moved to israel in 1952 .
the westphalia peace prize was last awarded in 2008 to former un secretary general kofi annan , and in earlier years to conductor kurt masur .
the prize is named after the peace of westphalia treaty from 1648 , which ended the thirty years ' war in the holy roman empire .

the 67-year-old musician founded the west-eastern divan orchestra , made up of young jewish and arab musicians , in 1999 .
he shares the prize , worth 50,000 euros -lrb- $ 70,000 -rrb- with the members of the orchestra .
at the ceremony in the western german town of muenster on saturday , barenboim said the conflict between israelis and palestinians was no ordinary one .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barenboim founded the arab-israeli west-eastern divan orchestra " it 's not a military or a political conflict , but a human conflict , a conflict between two peoples , " he said .
building bridges and moving on german foreign minister guido westerwelle on saturday honored barenboim as a " peace activist in the best sense of the word . "
" often , it 's ordinary people like barenboim , whose activism builds bridges and sets the foundations for peace , " he said .
barenboim is also known in germany for promoting german composer richard wagner 's work , saying wagner ’ s work had nothing to do with the holocaust .
two weeks ago , at a symposium held by the berlin state opera ahead of the premiere of german composer richard wagner 's work , " das rheingold " , which barenboim will conduct , the musician said it was time to move on from the long-standing taboo of boycotting wagner 's work in countries like israel .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : westerwelle honored barenboim as an " activist in the best sense " " i do not believe that one can connect wagner with the final solution , " he said .
wagner , who created the opera cycle " the ring of the niebelungen " and other central works of the german canon , has long been stigmatized because of anti-semitic attitudes , and the fact that he was hitler 's favorite composer .
barenboim was born in buenos aires , argentina , on november 15 , 1942 to russian-born jewish parents .
he and his family moved to israel in 1952 .
the westphalia peace prize was last awarded in 2008 to former un secretary general kofi annan , and in earlier years to conductor kurt masur .
the prize is named after the peace of westphalia treaty from 1648 , which ended the thirty years ' war in the holy roman empire .

now trade unions want employers to start hiring temp workers for long-term employment . the number of unemployed in germany fell to below 3 million for the first time in 18 years , labor minister ursula von der leyen said this week . michael sommer , head of the german trade union federation -lrb- dgb -rrb- , said he now wants to see germany 's recovery from the global economic crisis translate into improved conditions for german workers . " people have to be able to live from their work , " he said .
" they also have to have a say in their work .
economic bosses ca n't say they want to do things one way then change their tune and start doing things another way .
employers ' and workers ' interests need to be considered . " while german workers grew accustomed to spending their working lives with a single company , current statistics show the situation on the job market has undergone serious changes . temp work on the rise bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : temp workers are regarded as flexible employees the number of people with permanent contracts accompanied by unemployment and other social benefits has fallen while the number of people in recent years while the number of people requiring state aid to round out their pay has increased , according to the dgb . the unions reported that 2.2 million people in germany work for an hourly wage of less than 6 euros and that 1.3 million people receive state subsidies since their pay alone does not keep them above the poverty line .
temp work , which usually comes without benefits , has also increased from 704,000 in june to 1 million in october . " temp workers are a very flexible reserve of workers and , as we saw during the crisis , are the first be fired and are paid much worse than staff doing the same job , " sommer said , adding that the pay gap amounted to 7 euros per hour . german companies were able to avoid widespread layoffs by implementing government subsidies for shortened working hours .
this allowed businesses respond to an upturn in orders without delays associated with having to rehire workers . companies re-evaluate staffing options bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : employers want to make sure everyone is busy but the jobs that were lost may not come back in their pre-recession form as companies re-evaluate their employment policies and may rehire temp workers as needed rather than creating new positions , according to hans-peter kloes of the cologne institute for economic research . " there is a need for flexibility on the part of employers and a need for stability from the employed , " he said .
" the idea has to be to create a form of ' modern employment ' by balancing the sets of interests . " kloes added that germany 's relatively quick recovery from the global crisis relied on temp workers . " we are not dealing with cheap workers or undercutting wages , but with the creation of new alternatives , " he said . trial run bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : metal workers and employers agreed to equal pay for equal work temporary positions , kloes said , represent an opportunity for employers to test the new employees ' skills before hiring them in more permanent positions . " it has to be clear that people coming from unemployment are not going to walk into full-time positions , " he said . about half of the people who took on temp work in 2003 had received permanent positions within five years , according to a study done by the cologne institute . but trade unions do n't see the same benefits for temp workers , saying that many of those who do not receive permanent contracts are in positions for long periods of time without the benefits of long-term employment .
sommer has called on the government to change the laws making this possible . unions and employers agreed in september to pay temporary workers in the steel industry at the same rate as permanent employees , a move sommer said should serve as a model for other sectors as well . " we have to give in to european law and institute equal pay for equal work , " he said . author : sabine kinkartz / sms editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

bundesliga leaders mainz take on nearest rivals dortmund sunday after both were beaten in mid-week cup matches . with the bundesliga ’ s designated 800-pound gorilla bayern munich sputtering in mid-table , and other top teams from recent years like wolfsburg , stuttgart , bremen and schalke doing likewise , two teams coached by ambitious young coaches have risen to the challenge and claimed the top spots for themselves .
just two points separate the teams in first and second place , so sunday 's match will determine who will be top dog at the end of match day ten .
both teams come into the game on the back of embarrassing german cup defeats in midweek and nothing will be allowed to cloud the focus as mainz and dortmund look to bounce back and keep their exciting , entertaining and surprising rivalry at the top of the bundesliga on track .
both mainz and dortmund have earned their positions through attacking soccer .
their coaches , both combustible and passionate characters , have fashioned their teams in their own images and are reaping the benefits of molding their players into systems and tactics full of their own belief and confidence .
thomas tuchel at mainz and juergen klopp at dortmund have hugely competitive personalities and their desire to win can be seen in the way that their teams hound and harass the opposition and attack with purpose .
but while points and league position are important in the pursuit of the title , both coaches have also impressed on their players the need to win with style .
dortmund coach adds youth to solid base bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klopp looks to improve on last season 's fifth-place finish klopp , the former mainz boss who coached the team who won the club ’ s first-ever promotion to the top flight in 2004 , has built on his impressive first season in dortmund by spending wisely and investing in the club 's already rich vein of youth .
since klopp has taken over at bvb , shinji kagawa , kevin grosskreutz , sven bender , marcel schmelzer , mario goetze and mats hummels - none older then 22 - have come into the bvb first team and excelled , adding fluidity and danger to the side .
meanwhile nuri sahin , whose career was once thought to have entered a holding pattern after an up-and-down loan spell in holland at feyenoord , has become the rock of dortmund ’ s midfield .
he too is still just 22 .
up front , lucas barrios has been a revelation since joining last season and has cemented his reputation as one of the bundesliga 's most feared marksmen .
after hitting 19 goals in his debut campaign , he ’ s netted four thus far in the new season , and the attention he draws from opposing defenders often opens up ample space for his teammates .
tuchel adds flair and verve to turn mainz into contenders bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tuchel has instilled belief and camaraderie in his team tuchel , meanwhile , has transformed mainz from a mid-table entity into a title-chasing force since taking the reins in 2009 .
he led the team to ninth last season , its best ever bundesliga finish , and has built on that performance by finding his own set of precocious talents .
he snared schalke ’ s lewis holtby on loan and seen him shine , and he ’ s turned the andre schuerrle and adam szalai , once cosseted talents , into linchpins of the side .
both dortmund and mainz have seen the benefits of giving youngsters their chance , a reflection of the current philosophy being promoted at international level in germany .
adhering to the old standard of " if you 're old enough , you 're good enough , " klopp and tuchel have tapped into the desire young players have to succeed and challenge for places and silverware .
the results are there to see in the bundesliga table .
sunday 's clash will always be an emotional one for klopp , the former fan favorite and hero of mainz 's promotion campaign six years ago .
but forced to choose between taking it easy on his old club and going top himself , there will be no room for sentimentality .

accusations are already flying about fraud and possible election rigging . just a few days before regional and local elections in ukraine , president viktor yanukovych addressed governors in a tv show in order to make sure they will work to ensure a fair election .
" i will prosecute any attempts to tamper with election results with the utmost severity , " yanukovych said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yanukovych has said he will react swiftly to any election irregularities but yanukovych already had to react to accusations when members of the opposition fatherland party discovered 130,000 allegedly forged ballot papers in a printing house in kharkiv , a city in ukraine 's east .
yanukovych told federal prosecutors to investigate the case .
the ballot papers were a " special reserve " which had to be printed as required by law , said prosecutor yevhen popovych later .
according to the director of the printing house , however , the ballot papers were simply part of a test print .
accusations fly yulia tymoshenko , the head of fatherland , said no one could rule out that fraudulent ballot papers like the ones in kharkiv might turn up in other areas of ukraine as well .
" there is no limit to what these people will do .
they will falsify the vote , you can depend on it , " she said .
several opposition parties have announced that they found tens of thousand of forged ballot papers in two other towns in western ukraine .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tymoshenko says she fears election fraud they also warn about the use of " administrative resources " by yanukovych 's party , called party of the regions , including using state-owned vehicles to increase voter turnout or mobilizing voters , who work in government institutions and businesses .
the communists are also raising concerns over yanukovych , although they are technically in a coalition with his party and a bloc headed by parliamentary leader volodymyr lytvyn .
members of yanukovych 's party could interfere with communist party candidates in the eastern regions of donezk and luhansk , according to communist leader petro simonenko .
he said he suspects that on orders from kiev , " devised reasons " are found to block communist candidates , thus ensuring that yanukovych 's party gets at least 60 percent of the votes .
yanukovych has said his party is so far ahead in the polls and its record so solid that there would be no reason to tamper with the election results .
opposition votes but opinion polls show that yanukovych 's party has lost support since the presidential election at the beginning of this year .
experts at the open society institute put the blame on campaign pledges that have not been fulfilled .
yanukovych had promised to improve transparency and give tax benefits to small company owners .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : petro simonenko is critical of his coalition partner ukrainian voters are also resentful of a drastic increase in the price of gas , which in turn has led to higher prices for staple foods and public transportation .
therefore , opposition parties like tymoshenko 's bloc are expected to gain votes .
according to the open society institute , other parties , such as strong ukraine and front for change , will also benefit from voter dissatisfaction .
voters expect manipulation according to a poll by the democratic initiatives foundation , a ukrainian ngo , almost 50 percent of those interviewed do not think the elections will change anything .
positive change is expected by one third of the interviewees , while four percent expect a drastic change for the worse .
only two percent believe that the candidates are going to fulfil their campaign promises .
still most of the interviewees - three quarters - will go and cast their vote .
but only 8.5 percent believe the election results will not be manipulated .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de labor market -pipe- 30.10.2010 unions , employers debate benefits of temp workers großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : finding a permanent job is getting harder in germany the economic crisis seems to have run its course in germany as unemployment falls and businesses predict growth for 2010 and 2011 .
now trade unions want employers to start hiring temp workers for long-term employment . the number of unemployed in germany fell to below 3 million for the first time in 18 years , labor minister ursula von der leyen said this week . michael sommer , head of the german trade union federation -lrb- dgb -rrb- , said he now wants to see germany 's recovery from the global economic crisis translate into improved conditions for german workers . " people have to be able to live from their work , " he said .
" they also have to have a say in their work .
economic bosses ca n't say they want to do things one way then change their tune and start doing things another way .
employers ' and workers ' interests need to be considered . " while german workers grew accustomed to spending their working lives with a single company , current statistics show the situation on the job market has undergone serious changes . temp work on the rise bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : temp workers are regarded as flexible employees the number of people with permanent contracts accompanied by unemployment and other social benefits has fallen while the number of people in recent years while the number of people requiring state aid to round out their pay has increased , according to the dgb . the unions reported that 2.2 million people in germany work for an hourly wage of less than 6 euros and that 1.3 million people receive state subsidies since their pay alone does not keep them above the poverty line .
temp work , which usually comes without benefits , has also increased from 704,000 in june to 1 million in october . " temp workers are a very flexible reserve of workers and , as we saw during the crisis , are the first be fired and are paid much worse than staff doing the same job , " sommer said , adding that the pay gap amounted to 7 euros per hour . german companies were able to avoid widespread layoffs by implementing government subsidies for shortened working hours .
this allowed businesses respond to an upturn in orders without delays associated with having to rehire workers . companies re-evaluate staffing options bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : employers want to make sure everyone is busy but the jobs that were lost may not come back in their pre-recession form as companies re-evaluate their employment policies and may rehire temp workers as needed rather than creating new positions , according to hans-peter kloes of the cologne institute for economic research . " there is a need for flexibility on the part of employers and a need for stability from the employed , " he said .
" the idea has to be to create a form of ' modern employment ' by balancing the sets of interests . " kloes added that germany 's relatively quick recovery from the global crisis relied on temp workers . " we are not dealing with cheap workers or undercutting wages , but with the creation of new alternatives , " he said . trial run bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : metal workers and employers agreed to equal pay for equal work temporary positions , kloes said , represent an opportunity for employers to test the new employees ' skills before hiring them in more permanent positions . " it has to be clear that people coming from unemployment are not going to walk into full-time positions , " he said . about half of the people who took on temp work in 2003 had received permanent positions within five years , according to a study done by the cologne institute . but trade unions do n't see the same benefits for temp workers , saying that many of those who do not receive permanent contracts are in positions for long periods of time without the benefits of long-term employment .
sommer has called on the government to change the laws making this possible . unions and employers agreed in september to pay temporary workers in the steel industry at the same rate as permanent employees , a move sommer said should serve as a model for other sectors as well . " we have to give in to european law and institute equal pay for equal work , " he said . author : sabine kinkartz / sms editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de human rights -pipe- 30.10.2010 un resolutions support women , but fail to change winds of war großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in places like congo , women coninue to be victimized by war - despite resolutions ten years ago , the un passed a resolution underscoring the role of women in promoting peace and security .
yet despite the passage of three similar agreements since then , men still hold most of the influence . following the passage of the groundbreaking resolution 1325 on oct .
31 , 2000 , the united nations women 's fund unifem appointed two women – elisabeth rehn , the former finnish minister of defence , and ellen johnson-sirleaf , who is now president of liberia – to conduct an independent , expert assessment on " women , war and peace . "
their findings confirmed the central idea at the heart of the resolution : " without women 's representation – without half the population – no country can truly claim to be engaged in democratic development and participatory governance . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hillary clinton pushed through new resolutions - to little avail resolution 1325 was the first to address war 's consequences for women , as well as the female role in preventing conflict and securing and building peace .
the security council unanimously adopted the resolution a decade ago , marking a turning point in the history of international rights for women .
the document called on all un member states to develop national action plans to help incorporate women into strategies for security and peace-building .
a female voice in peace talks the resolution ensures that women around the world are entitled to a role in peace negotiations .
but in many cases , their voices have yet to be heard by parties engaged in conflict .
according to un statistics , only 7.5 percent of negotiators participating in 22 peace processes since 1992 were female .
in 14 talks , only three percent of the signatories to peace deals were women .
despite those figures , the un security council has continued to stand up for women in conflict zones .
on june 19 , 2008 , resolution 1820 stated that rape and other forms of sexual violence could constitute war crimes and crimes against humanity , as well as a constitutive act with respect to genocide .
the resolution was coupled with calls for a " zero-tolerance policy " on sexual abuse by un staff engaged in peacekeeping and peace-building missions .
sexual violence on the rise but just a year later , a number of non-governmental organizations noted an increase in sex-related violence in countries like the democratic republic of congo , sudan , chad and the central african republic .
only rarely were the perpetrators held accountable for their crimes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the number of women civilians - if not troops - has risen in peacekeeping ranks the fact that 30 percent of civilian personnel for un peacekeeping missions are women can be seen as a breakthrough – and a by-product of both resolutions .
out of 27 peacekeeping operations , five are led by women – a huge success over previous years .
yet women today make up less than three percent of the military .
backed by us secretary of state hillary clinton , in the fall of 2009 , the un security council once again passed two resolutions , 1888 and 1889 .
they did n't strike off in any new directions , but they were more concrete than their predecessors .
as a result of the resolutions , ex-eu commissioner margot wallstroem , from sweden , was named special representative on sexual violence in conflict , a post that aims to fight violence against girls and women .
but it seems that overall the key strategy has been a disaster .
only 19 states have developed and passed a national action plan to enact resolution 1325 .
most countries do n't have the money push it through .
more analysis , more money , legal action speaking about the strategy recently , un secretary general ban ki-moon said , " we have made too little progress . "
looking at the horrible violence against women in congo , where more than 250,000 women have been raped in the past decade , ban said it was clear the international community was still failing to protect the people who are the most vulnerable .
according to the un security council , more steps are needed to make progress at last when it comes to women , peace and security .
these include more financial support for national action plans , systematic information delivery , an analysis of the topic of women in conflicts , and prosecution of those who breach the human rights of women - or who order their rights to be breached in war .

the 67-year-old musician founded the west-eastern divan orchestra , made up of young jewish and arab musicians , in 1999 .
he shares the prize , worth 50,000 euros -lrb- $ 70,000 -rrb- with the members of the orchestra .
at the ceremony in the western german town of muenster on saturday , barenboim said the conflict between israelis and palestinians was no ordinary one .

wagner , who created the opera cycle " the ring of the niebelungen " and other central works of the german canon , has long been stigmatized because of anti-semitic attitudes , and the fact that he was hitler 's favorite composer .
barenboim was born in buenos aires , argentina , on november 15 , 1942 to russian-born jewish parents .
he and his family moved to israel in 1952 .
the westphalia peace prize was last awarded in 2008 to former un secretary general kofi annan , and in earlier years to conductor kurt masur .
the prize is named after the peace of westphalia treaty from 1648 , which ended the thirty years ' war in the holy roman empire .

the 67-year-old musician founded the west-eastern divan orchestra , made up of young jewish and arab musicians , in 1999 .
he shares the prize , worth 50,000 euros -lrb- $ 70,000 -rrb- with the members of the orchestra .
at the ceremony in the western german town of muenster on saturday , barenboim said the conflict between israelis and palestinians was no ordinary one .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barenboim founded the arab-israeli west-eastern divan orchestra " it 's not a military or a political conflict , but a human conflict , a conflict between two peoples , " he said .
building bridges and moving on german foreign minister guido westerwelle on saturday honored barenboim as a " peace activist in the best sense of the word . "
" often , it 's ordinary people like barenboim , whose activism builds bridges and sets the foundations for peace , " he said .
barenboim is also known in germany for promoting german composer richard wagner 's work , saying wagner ’ s work had nothing to do with the holocaust .
two weeks ago , at a symposium held by the berlin state opera ahead of the premiere of german composer richard wagner 's work , " das rheingold " , which barenboim will conduct , the musician said it was time to move on from the long-standing taboo of boycotting wagner 's work in countries like israel .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : westerwelle honored barenboim as an " activist in the best sense " " i do not believe that one can connect wagner with the final solution , " he said .
wagner , who created the opera cycle " the ring of the niebelungen " and other central works of the german canon , has long been stigmatized because of anti-semitic attitudes , and the fact that he was hitler 's favorite composer .
barenboim was born in buenos aires , argentina , on november 15 , 1942 to russian-born jewish parents .
he and his family moved to israel in 1952 .
the westphalia peace prize was last awarded in 2008 to former un secretary general kofi annan , and in earlier years to conductor kurt masur .
the prize is named after the peace of westphalia treaty from 1648 , which ended the thirty years ' war in the holy roman empire .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de drugs -pipe- 30.10.2010 russians join american troops in afghanistan drug raid großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia has criticized us anti-drug efforts in afghanistan russian and us forces raided four drug laboratories in afghanistan in their first joint anti-drug operation .
more than a dent in trafficking , the raid represents growing cooperation between russia and the west . russian and american forces conducted their first joint anti-narcotics raid in afghanistan early on thursday , signaling closer cooperation between the two countries in the battle to control drug cultivation in the war-torn country , the world 's largest producer of opium .
russian anti-drug chief viktor ivanov told a news conference on friday that the raid took place near the pakistani border , and that russian and us forces were supported by helicopters and afghan police .
" four laboratories were found and destroyed - three for heroin and one for morphine , " ivanov said .
" as a result , 932 kilograms -lrb- 2,055 pounds -rrb- of very highly concentrated heroin and 156 kilograms of opium were destroyed . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : afghanistan is the world 's biggest source of opium he added that the street value of the drugs could be up to $ 250 million -lrb- 180 million euros -rrb- .
the us drug enforcement administration released a statement noting the same amount of drugs seized , but said the heroin was worth $ 55.9 million .
eric rubin , deputy chief of mission at the american embassy in moscow , said the operation was a " very big " seizure .
" just in terms of disruption , this was a very important operation , but it was also part of a larger strategy to attack the drug flows , " rubin said at the news conference with ivanov .
shadows of soviet war trafficking from afghanistan has stoked a major heroin problem in russia , and ivanov has criticized the us strategy in its war on afghan drugs , urging more aggressive eradication of poppy crops .
the amount seized in thursday 's raid is unlikely to have a significant effect on the afghan drug trade .
the country produces about 90 percent of the world 's opium , which is used to make heroin .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us funded afghan militias to fight the soviet union but the raid did represent an increase in cooperation between the us and russia , two decades after the us funded afghan militias to chase out soviet occupying forces .
thousands of soviet soldiers were killed in the 10-year war , and going back to afghanistan remains a sensitive issue in russia .
several politicians , including prime minister vladimir putin , have said sending russian troops to join the nato-led mission afghanistan is out of the question .
but the joint us-russian drug raid - along with russia 's willingness to let nato forces fly in and out of afghanistan through russian territory and its offer to sell helicopters to the afghan army - suggests russia 's cooperation with the west on afghanistan is improving .

more than a dent in trafficking , the raid represents growing cooperation between russia and the west . russian and american forces conducted their first joint anti-narcotics raid in afghanistan early on thursday , signaling closer cooperation between the two countries in the battle to control drug cultivation in the war-torn country , the world 's largest producer of opium .
russian anti-drug chief viktor ivanov told a news conference on friday that the raid took place near the pakistani border , and that russian and us forces were supported by helicopters and afghan police .
" four laboratories were found and destroyed - three for heroin and one for morphine , " ivanov said .
" as a result , 932 kilograms -lrb- 2,055 pounds -rrb- of very highly concentrated heroin and 156 kilograms of opium were destroyed . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : afghanistan is the world 's biggest source of opium he added that the street value of the drugs could be up to $ 250 million -lrb- 180 million euros -rrb- .
the us drug enforcement administration released a statement noting the same amount of drugs seized , but said the heroin was worth $ 55.9 million .
eric rubin , deputy chief of mission at the american embassy in moscow , said the operation was a " very big " seizure .
" just in terms of disruption , this was a very important operation , but it was also part of a larger strategy to attack the drug flows , " rubin said at the news conference with ivanov .
shadows of soviet war trafficking from afghanistan has stoked a major heroin problem in russia , and ivanov has criticized the us strategy in its war on afghan drugs , urging more aggressive eradication of poppy crops .
the amount seized in thursday 's raid is unlikely to have a significant effect on the afghan drug trade .
the country produces about 90 percent of the world 's opium , which is used to make heroin .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us funded afghan militias to fight the soviet union but the raid did represent an increase in cooperation between the us and russia , two decades after the us funded afghan militias to chase out soviet occupying forces .
thousands of soviet soldiers were killed in the 10-year war , and going back to afghanistan remains a sensitive issue in russia .
several politicians , including prime minister vladimir putin , have said sending russian troops to join the nato-led mission afghanistan is out of the question .
but the joint us-russian drug raid - along with russia 's willingness to let nato forces fly in and out of afghanistan through russian territory and its offer to sell helicopters to the afghan army - suggests russia 's cooperation with the west on afghanistan is improving .

now trade unions want employers to start hiring temp workers for long-term employment . the number of unemployed in germany fell to below 3 million for the first time in 18 years , labor minister ursula von der leyen said this week . michael sommer , head of the german trade union federation -lrb- dgb -rrb- , said he now wants to see germany 's recovery from the global economic crisis translate into improved conditions for german workers . " people have to be able to live from their work , " he said .
" they also have to have a say in their work .
economic bosses ca n't say they want to do things one way then change their tune and start doing things another way .
employers ' and workers ' interests need to be considered . " while german workers grew accustomed to spending their working lives with a single company , current statistics show the situation on the job market has undergone serious changes . temp work on the rise bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : temp workers are regarded as flexible employees the number of people with permanent contracts accompanied by unemployment and other social benefits has fallen while the number of people in recent years while the number of people requiring state aid to round out their pay has increased , according to the dgb . the unions reported that 2.2 million people in germany work for an hourly wage of less than 6 euros and that 1.3 million people receive state subsidies since their pay alone does not keep them above the poverty line .
temp work , which usually comes without benefits , has also increased from 704,000 in june to 1 million in october . " temp workers are a very flexible reserve of workers and , as we saw during the crisis , are the first be fired and are paid much worse than staff doing the same job , " sommer said , adding that the pay gap amounted to 7 euros per hour . german companies were able to avoid widespread layoffs by implementing government subsidies for shortened working hours .
this allowed businesses respond to an upturn in orders without delays associated with having to rehire workers . companies re-evaluate staffing options bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : employers want to make sure everyone is busy but the jobs that were lost may not come back in their pre-recession form as companies re-evaluate their employment policies and may rehire temp workers as needed rather than creating new positions , according to hans-peter kloes of the cologne institute for economic research . " there is a need for flexibility on the part of employers and a need for stability from the employed , " he said .
" the idea has to be to create a form of ' modern employment ' by balancing the sets of interests . " kloes added that germany 's relatively quick recovery from the global crisis relied on temp workers . " we are not dealing with cheap workers or undercutting wages , but with the creation of new alternatives , " he said . trial run bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : metal workers and employers agreed to equal pay for equal work temporary positions , kloes said , represent an opportunity for employers to test the new employees ' skills before hiring them in more permanent positions . " it has to be clear that people coming from unemployment are not going to walk into full-time positions , " he said . about half of the people who took on temp work in 2003 had received permanent positions within five years , according to a study done by the cologne institute . but trade unions do n't see the same benefits for temp workers , saying that many of those who do not receive permanent contracts are in positions for long periods of time without the benefits of long-term employment .
sommer has called on the government to change the laws making this possible . unions and employers agreed in september to pay temporary workers in the steel industry at the same rate as permanent employees , a move sommer said should serve as a model for other sectors as well .

according to un statistics , only 7.5 percent of negotiators participating in 22 peace processes since 1992 were female .
in 14 talks , only three percent of the signatories to peace deals were women .
despite those figures , the un security council has continued to stand up for women in conflict zones .
on june 19 , 2008 , resolution 1820 stated that rape and other forms of sexual violence could constitute war crimes and crimes against humanity , as well as a constitutive act with respect to genocide .
the resolution was coupled with calls for a " zero-tolerance policy " on sexual abuse by un staff engaged in peacekeeping and peace-building missions .
sexual violence on the rise but just a year later , a number of non-governmental organizations noted an increase in sex-related violence in countries like the democratic republic of congo , sudan , chad and the central african republic .

most countries do n't have the money push it through .
more analysis , more money , legal action speaking about the strategy recently , un secretary general ban ki-moon said , " we have made too little progress . "
looking at the horrible violence against women in congo , where more than 250,000 women have been raped in the past decade , ban said it was clear the international community was still failing to protect the people who are the most vulnerable .
according to the un security council , more steps are needed to make progress at last when it comes to women , peace and security .
these include more financial support for national action plans , systematic information delivery , an analysis of the topic of women in conflicts , and prosecution of those who breach the human rights of women - or who order their rights to be breached in war .

temp work , which usually comes without benefits , has also increased from 704,000 in june to 1 million in october . " temp workers are a very flexible reserve of workers and , as we saw during the crisis , are the first be fired and are paid much worse than staff doing the same job , " sommer said , adding that the pay gap amounted to 7 euros per hour . german companies were able to avoid widespread layoffs by implementing government subsidies for shortened working hours .

" there is a need for flexibility on the part of employers and a need for stability from the employed , " he said .
" the idea has to be to create a form of ' modern employment ' by balancing the sets of interests .

sommer has called on the government to change the laws making this possible . unions and employers agreed in september to pay temporary workers in the steel industry at the same rate as permanent employees , a move sommer said should serve as a model for other sectors as well .

bundesliga leaders mainz take on nearest rivals dortmund sunday after both were beaten in mid-week cup matches . with the bundesliga ’ s designated 800-pound gorilla bayern munich sputtering in mid-table , and other top teams from recent years like wolfsburg , stuttgart , bremen and schalke doing likewise , two teams coached by ambitious young coaches have risen to the challenge and claimed the top spots for themselves .
just two points separate the teams in first and second place , so sunday 's match will determine who will be top dog at the end of match day ten .
both teams come into the game on the back of embarrassing german cup defeats in midweek and nothing will be allowed to cloud the focus as mainz and dortmund look to bounce back and keep their exciting , entertaining and surprising rivalry at the top of the bundesliga on track .
both mainz and dortmund have earned their positions through attacking soccer .
their coaches , both combustible and passionate characters , have fashioned their teams in their own images and are reaping the benefits of molding their players into systems and tactics full of their own belief and confidence .
thomas tuchel at mainz and juergen klopp at dortmund have hugely competitive personalities and their desire to win can be seen in the way that their teams hound and harass the opposition and attack with purpose .
but while points and league position are important in the pursuit of the title , both coaches have also impressed on their players the need to win with style .
dortmund coach adds youth to solid base bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klopp looks to improve on last season 's fifth-place finish klopp , the former mainz boss who coached the team who won the club ’ s first-ever promotion to the top flight in 2004 , has built on his impressive first season in dortmund by spending wisely and investing in the club 's already rich vein of youth .
since klopp has taken over at bvb , shinji kagawa , kevin grosskreutz , sven bender , marcel schmelzer , mario goetze and mats hummels - none older then 22 - have come into the bvb first team and excelled , adding fluidity and danger to the side .
meanwhile nuri sahin , whose career was once thought to have entered a holding pattern after an up-and-down loan spell in holland at feyenoord , has become the rock of dortmund ’ s midfield .
he too is still just 22 .
up front , lucas barrios has been a revelation since joining last season and has cemented his reputation as one of the bundesliga 's most feared marksmen .
after hitting 19 goals in his debut campaign , he ’ s netted four thus far in the new season , and the attention he draws from opposing defenders often opens up ample space for his teammates .
tuchel adds flair and verve to turn mainz into contenders bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tuchel has instilled belief and camaraderie in his team tuchel , meanwhile , has transformed mainz from a mid-table entity into a title-chasing force since taking the reins in 2009 .
he led the team to ninth last season , its best ever bundesliga finish , and has built on that performance by finding his own set of precocious talents .
he snared schalke ’ s lewis holtby on loan and seen him shine , and he ’ s turned the andre schuerrle and adam szalai , once cosseted talents , into linchpins of the side .
both dortmund and mainz have seen the benefits of giving youngsters their chance , a reflection of the current philosophy being promoted at international level in germany .
adhering to the old standard of " if you 're old enough , you 're good enough , " klopp and tuchel have tapped into the desire young players have to succeed and challenge for places and silverware .
the results are there to see in the bundesliga table .
sunday 's clash will always be an emotional one for klopp , the former fan favorite and hero of mainz 's promotion campaign six years ago .
but forced to choose between taking it easy on his old club and going top himself , there will be no room for sentimentality .

both teams come into the game on the back of embarrassing german cup defeats in midweek and nothing will be allowed to cloud the focus as mainz and dortmund look to bounce back and keep their exciting , entertaining and surprising rivalry at the top of the bundesliga on track .
both mainz and dortmund have earned their positions through attacking soccer .
their coaches , both combustible and passionate characters , have fashioned their teams in their own images and are reaping the benefits of molding their players into systems and tactics full of their own belief and confidence .
thomas tuchel at mainz and juergen klopp at dortmund have hugely competitive personalities and their desire to win can be seen in the way that their teams hound and harass the opposition and attack with purpose .
but while points and league position are important in the pursuit of the title , both coaches have also impressed on their players the need to win with style .
dortmund coach adds youth to solid base bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klopp looks to improve on last season 's fifth-place finish klopp , the former mainz boss who coached the team who won the club ’ s first-ever promotion to the top flight in 2004 , has built on his impressive first season in dortmund by spending wisely and investing in the club 's already rich vein of youth .
since klopp has taken over at bvb , shinji kagawa , kevin grosskreutz , sven bender , marcel schmelzer , mario goetze and mats hummels - none older then 22 - have come into the bvb first team and excelled , adding fluidity and danger to the side .
meanwhile nuri sahin , whose career was once thought to have entered a holding pattern after an up-and-down loan spell in holland at feyenoord , has become the rock of dortmund ’ s midfield .
he too is still just 22 .
up front , lucas barrios has been a revelation since joining last season and has cemented his reputation as one of the bundesliga 's most feared marksmen .
after hitting 19 goals in his debut campaign , he ’ s netted four thus far in the new season , and the attention he draws from opposing defenders often opens up ample space for his teammates .
tuchel adds flair and verve to turn mainz into contenders bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tuchel has instilled belief and camaraderie in his team tuchel , meanwhile , has transformed mainz from a mid-table entity into a title-chasing force since taking the reins in 2009 .
he led the team to ninth last season , its best ever bundesliga finish , and has built on that performance by finding his own set of precocious talents .
he snared schalke ’ s lewis holtby on loan and seen him shine , and he ’ s turned the andre schuerrle and adam szalai , once cosseted talents , into linchpins of the side .
both dortmund and mainz have seen the benefits of giving youngsters their chance , a reflection of the current philosophy being promoted at international level in germany .
adhering to the old standard of " if you 're old enough , you 're good enough , " klopp and tuchel have tapped into the desire young players have to succeed and challenge for places and silverware .
the results are there to see in the bundesliga table .
sunday 's clash will always be an emotional one for klopp , the former fan favorite and hero of mainz 's promotion campaign six years ago .
but forced to choose between taking it easy on his old club and going top himself , there will be no room for sentimentality .

but this is far from the case in afghanistan , where many women are pushing for more participation . marzia is a police officer in uniform , still a rare sight in afghan society , even though the female component of the afghan security forces is important in a muslim society .
if apartments need to be searched , then marzia 's job is to check the women 's bedrooms and closets .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women in afghanistan are still struggling to make their voices heard marzia says there should be more afghan women with jobs , and believes that the political climate is auspicious .
" the freedom of movement has improved for women , " she said .
" women are now allowed to work alongside men .
it does n't matter where or what it is , women should get jobs . "
women as negotiators although afghan society may be changing , women are still a minority in positions of responsibility when it comes to peace negotiations - as they are throughout the world .
it was for this reason that the united nations agreed resolution 1325 10 years ago , a document that demanded that women be given an equal role in conflict resolution in all regional , national and international institutions .
the prominent afghan women 's rights campaigner soraya parlika believes that her country is still a long way from this aim .
she points to president hamid karzai 's newly-founded peace council , of whose 69 members only nine are women .
seven of those nine have been appointed by karzai , which parlika believes limits their independence .
" these women are sitting together with men who only know war , " she said .
" they are not heard and they have no chance to influence the negotiations in any way . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : afghan women live in fear of losing family members golzum seddiqi , director of an initiative for women lawyers in the western town of herat , does not see the women on the peace council in a particularly positive light .
" up until now , they do n't have any plans or strategies for positions in which they have political or social responsibility , " she said .
" they need to get rid of other problems first .
some women with no qualifications have used the opportunity to get important positions through bribes and connections . "
peace starts in the family but herat provincial councillor djamila karimi believes that the lack of qualifications is a minor concern for the women on the peace council .
she thinks women are not taken seriously as peace negotiators simply because afghan women have been locked into a passive role in society that wo n't be changed overnight .
" these are women who constantly live with the fear of losing family members to the war .
i think women can teach their children not to take up weapons in the future , " karimi said .
" a bearded warlord in afghanistan wo n't listen to women 's demands at the end of the war .
but a child listens to its mother . "
according to karimi , many afghan women want nothing more than to see their children go to school to learn how to build a new afghan society , while very few want a political career .
instead , they still concentrate on their responsibilities within the family .

bundesliga leaders mainz take on nearest rivals dortmund sunday after both were beaten in mid-week cup matches . with the bundesliga ’ s designated 800-pound gorilla bayern munich sputtering in mid-table , and other top teams from recent years like wolfsburg , stuttgart , bremen and schalke doing likewise , two teams coached by ambitious young coaches have risen to the challenge and claimed the top spots for themselves .
just two points separate the teams in first and second place , so sunday 's match will determine who will be top dog at the end of match day ten .
both teams come into the game on the back of embarrassing german cup defeats in midweek and nothing will be allowed to cloud the focus as mainz and dortmund look to bounce back and keep their exciting , entertaining and surprising rivalry at the top of the bundesliga on track .
both mainz and dortmund have earned their positions through attacking soccer .
their coaches , both combustible and passionate characters , have fashioned their teams in their own images and are reaping the benefits of molding their players into systems and tactics full of their own belief and confidence .
thomas tuchel at mainz and juergen klopp at dortmund have hugely competitive personalities and their desire to win can be seen in the way that their teams hound and harass the opposition and attack with purpose .
but while points and league position are important in the pursuit of the title , both coaches have also impressed on their players the need to win with style .

since klopp has taken over at bvb , shinji kagawa , kevin grosskreutz , sven bender , marcel schmelzer , mario goetze and mats hummels - none older then 22 - have come into the bvb first team and excelled , adding fluidity and danger to the side .

he too is still just 22 .
up front , lucas barrios has been a revelation since joining last season and has cemented his reputation as one of the bundesliga 's most feared marksmen .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de elections -pipe- 30.10.2010 election in ukraine seen as test for democracy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : almost 50 percent of ukrainian voters do not rule out manipulation local elections in ukraine on sunday will be a test for viktor yanukovych and his understanding of democracy .
accusations are already flying about fraud and possible election rigging . just a few days before regional and local elections in ukraine , president viktor yanukovych addressed governors in a tv show in order to make sure they will work to ensure a fair election .
" i will prosecute any attempts to tamper with election results with the utmost severity , " yanukovych said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yanukovych has said he will react swiftly to any election irregularities but yanukovych already had to react to accusations when members of the opposition fatherland party discovered 130,000 allegedly forged ballot papers in a printing house in kharkiv , a city in ukraine 's east .
yanukovych told federal prosecutors to investigate the case .
the ballot papers were a " special reserve " which had to be printed as required by law , said prosecutor yevhen popovych later .
according to the director of the printing house , however , the ballot papers were simply part of a test print .
accusations fly yulia tymoshenko , the head of fatherland , said no one could rule out that fraudulent ballot papers like the ones in kharkiv might turn up in other areas of ukraine as well .
" there is no limit to what these people will do .
they will falsify the vote , you can depend on it , " she said .
several opposition parties have announced that they found tens of thousand of forged ballot papers in two other towns in western ukraine .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tymoshenko says she fears election fraud they also warn about the use of " administrative resources " by yanukovych 's party , called party of the regions , including using state-owned vehicles to increase voter turnout or mobilizing voters , who work in government institutions and businesses .
the communists are also raising concerns over yanukovych , although they are technically in a coalition with his party and a bloc headed by parliamentary leader volodymyr lytvyn .
members of yanukovych 's party could interfere with communist party candidates in the eastern regions of donezk and luhansk , according to communist leader petro simonenko .
he said he suspects that on orders from kiev , " devised reasons " are found to block communist candidates , thus ensuring that yanukovych 's party gets at least 60 percent of the votes .
yanukovych has said his party is so far ahead in the polls and its record so solid that there would be no reason to tamper with the election results .
opposition votes but opinion polls show that yanukovych 's party has lost support since the presidential election at the beginning of this year .
experts at the open society institute put the blame on campaign pledges that have not been fulfilled .
yanukovych had promised to improve transparency and give tax benefits to small company owners .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : petro simonenko is critical of his coalition partner ukrainian voters are also resentful of a drastic increase in the price of gas , which in turn has led to higher prices for staple foods and public transportation .
therefore , opposition parties like tymoshenko 's bloc are expected to gain votes .
according to the open society institute , other parties , such as strong ukraine and front for change , will also benefit from voter dissatisfaction .
voters expect manipulation according to a poll by the democratic initiatives foundation , a ukrainian ngo , almost 50 percent of those interviewed do not think the elections will change anything .
positive change is expected by one third of the interviewees , while four percent expect a drastic change for the worse .
only two percent believe that the candidates are going to fulfil their campaign promises .
still most of the interviewees - three quarters - will go and cast their vote .
but only 8.5 percent believe the election results will not be manipulated .

accusations are already flying about fraud and possible election rigging . just a few days before regional and local elections in ukraine , president viktor yanukovych addressed governors in a tv show in order to make sure they will work to ensure a fair election .
" i will prosecute any attempts to tamper with election results with the utmost severity , " yanukovych said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yanukovych has said he will react swiftly to any election irregularities but yanukovych already had to react to accusations when members of the opposition fatherland party discovered 130,000 allegedly forged ballot papers in a printing house in kharkiv , a city in ukraine 's east .
yanukovych told federal prosecutors to investigate the case .
the ballot papers were a " special reserve " which had to be printed as required by law , said prosecutor yevhen popovych later .
according to the director of the printing house , however , the ballot papers were simply part of a test print .
accusations fly yulia tymoshenko , the head of fatherland , said no one could rule out that fraudulent ballot papers like the ones in kharkiv might turn up in other areas of ukraine as well .
" there is no limit to what these people will do .
they will falsify the vote , you can depend on it , " she said .
several opposition parties have announced that they found tens of thousand of forged ballot papers in two other towns in western ukraine .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tymoshenko says she fears election fraud they also warn about the use of " administrative resources " by yanukovych 's party , called party of the regions , including using state-owned vehicles to increase voter turnout or mobilizing voters , who work in government institutions and businesses .
the communists are also raising concerns over yanukovych , although they are technically in a coalition with his party and a bloc headed by parliamentary leader volodymyr lytvyn .
members of yanukovych 's party could interfere with communist party candidates in the eastern regions of donezk and luhansk , according to communist leader petro simonenko .
he said he suspects that on orders from kiev , " devised reasons " are found to block communist candidates , thus ensuring that yanukovych 's party gets at least 60 percent of the votes .
yanukovych has said his party is so far ahead in the polls and its record so solid that there would be no reason to tamper with the election results .
opposition votes but opinion polls show that yanukovych 's party has lost support since the presidential election at the beginning of this year .
experts at the open society institute put the blame on campaign pledges that have not been fulfilled .
yanukovych had promised to improve transparency and give tax benefits to small company owners .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : petro simonenko is critical of his coalition partner ukrainian voters are also resentful of a drastic increase in the price of gas , which in turn has led to higher prices for staple foods and public transportation .
therefore , opposition parties like tymoshenko 's bloc are expected to gain votes .
according to the open society institute , other parties , such as strong ukraine and front for change , will also benefit from voter dissatisfaction .
voters expect manipulation according to a poll by the democratic initiatives foundation , a ukrainian ngo , almost 50 percent of those interviewed do not think the elections will change anything .
positive change is expected by one third of the interviewees , while four percent expect a drastic change for the worse .
only two percent believe that the candidates are going to fulfil their campaign promises .
still most of the interviewees - three quarters - will go and cast their vote .
but only 8.5 percent believe the election results will not be manipulated .

yet despite the passage of three similar agreements since then , men still hold most of the influence . following the passage of the groundbreaking resolution 1325 on oct .
31 , 2000 , the united nations women 's fund unifem appointed two women – elisabeth rehn , the former finnish minister of defence , and ellen johnson-sirleaf , who is now president of liberia – to conduct an independent , expert assessment on " women , war and peace . "
their findings confirmed the central idea at the heart of the resolution : " without women 's representation – without half the population – no country can truly claim to be engaged in democratic development and participatory governance . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hillary clinton pushed through new resolutions - to little avail resolution 1325 was the first to address war 's consequences for women , as well as the female role in preventing conflict and securing and building peace .
the security council unanimously adopted the resolution a decade ago , marking a turning point in the history of international rights for women .
the document called on all un member states to develop national action plans to help incorporate women into strategies for security and peace-building .
a female voice in peace talks the resolution ensures that women around the world are entitled to a role in peace negotiations .
but in many cases , their voices have yet to be heard by parties engaged in conflict .
according to un statistics , only 7.5 percent of negotiators participating in 22 peace processes since 1992 were female .
in 14 talks , only three percent of the signatories to peace deals were women .
despite those figures , the un security council has continued to stand up for women in conflict zones .
on june 19 , 2008 , resolution 1820 stated that rape and other forms of sexual violence could constitute war crimes and crimes against humanity , as well as a constitutive act with respect to genocide .
the resolution was coupled with calls for a " zero-tolerance policy " on sexual abuse by un staff engaged in peacekeeping and peace-building missions .
sexual violence on the rise but just a year later , a number of non-governmental organizations noted an increase in sex-related violence in countries like the democratic republic of congo , sudan , chad and the central african republic .
only rarely were the perpetrators held accountable for their crimes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the number of women civilians - if not troops - has risen in peacekeeping ranks the fact that 30 percent of civilian personnel for un peacekeeping missions are women can be seen as a breakthrough – and a by-product of both resolutions .
out of 27 peacekeeping operations , five are led by women – a huge success over previous years .
yet women today make up less than three percent of the military .
backed by us secretary of state hillary clinton , in the fall of 2009 , the un security council once again passed two resolutions , 1888 and 1889 .
they did n't strike off in any new directions , but they were more concrete than their predecessors .
as a result of the resolutions , ex-eu commissioner margot wallstroem , from sweden , was named special representative on sexual violence in conflict , a post that aims to fight violence against girls and women .
but it seems that overall the key strategy has been a disaster .
only 19 states have developed and passed a national action plan to enact resolution 1325 .
most countries do n't have the money push it through .
more analysis , more money , legal action speaking about the strategy recently , un secretary general ban ki-moon said , " we have made too little progress . "
looking at the horrible violence against women in congo , where more than 250,000 women have been raped in the past decade , ban said it was clear the international community was still failing to protect the people who are the most vulnerable .
according to the un security council , more steps are needed to make progress at last when it comes to women , peace and security .
these include more financial support for national action plans , systematic information delivery , an analysis of the topic of women in conflicts , and prosecution of those who breach the human rights of women - or who order their rights to be breached in war .

the 67-year-old musician founded the west-eastern divan orchestra , made up of young jewish and arab musicians , in 1999 .
he shares the prize , worth 50,000 euros -lrb- $ 70,000 -rrb- with the members of the orchestra .
at the ceremony in the western german town of muenster on saturday , barenboim said the conflict between israelis and palestinians was no ordinary one .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barenboim founded the arab-israeli west-eastern divan orchestra " it 's not a military or a political conflict , but a human conflict , a conflict between two peoples , " he said .

" often , it 's ordinary people like barenboim , whose activism builds bridges and sets the foundations for peace , " he said .
barenboim is also known in germany for promoting german composer richard wagner 's work , saying wagner ’ s work had nothing to do with the holocaust .
two weeks ago , at a symposium held by the berlin state opera ahead of the premiere of german composer richard wagner 's work , " das rheingold " , which barenboim will conduct , the musician said it was time to move on from the long-standing taboo of boycotting wagner 's work in countries like israel .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : westerwelle honored barenboim as an " activist in the best sense " " i do not believe that one can connect wagner with the final solution , " he said .
wagner , who created the opera cycle " the ring of the niebelungen " and other central works of the german canon , has long been stigmatized because of anti-semitic attitudes , and the fact that he was hitler 's favorite composer .
barenboim was born in buenos aires , argentina , on november 15 , 1942 to russian-born jewish parents .
he and his family moved to israel in 1952 .
the westphalia peace prize was last awarded in 2008 to former un secretary general kofi annan , and in earlier years to conductor kurt masur .
the prize is named after the peace of westphalia treaty from 1648 , which ended the thirty years ' war in the holy roman empire .

the 67-year-old musician founded the west-eastern divan orchestra , made up of young jewish and arab musicians , in 1999 .
he shares the prize , worth 50,000 euros -lrb- $ 70,000 -rrb- with the members of the orchestra .
at the ceremony in the western german town of muenster on saturday , barenboim said the conflict between israelis and palestinians was no ordinary one .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barenboim founded the arab-israeli west-eastern divan orchestra " it 's not a military or a political conflict , but a human conflict , a conflict between two peoples , " he said .
building bridges and moving on german foreign minister guido westerwelle on saturday honored barenboim as a " peace activist in the best sense of the word . "
" often , it 's ordinary people like barenboim , whose activism builds bridges and sets the foundations for peace , " he said .
barenboim is also known in germany for promoting german composer richard wagner 's work , saying wagner ’ s work had nothing to do with the holocaust .
two weeks ago , at a symposium held by the berlin state opera ahead of the premiere of german composer richard wagner 's work , " das rheingold " , which barenboim will conduct , the musician said it was time to move on from the long-standing taboo of boycotting wagner 's work in countries like israel .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : westerwelle honored barenboim as an " activist in the best sense " " i do not believe that one can connect wagner with the final solution , " he said .
wagner , who created the opera cycle " the ring of the niebelungen " and other central works of the german canon , has long been stigmatized because of anti-semitic attitudes , and the fact that he was hitler 's favorite composer .
barenboim was born in buenos aires , argentina , on november 15 , 1942 to russian-born jewish parents .
he and his family moved to israel in 1952 .
the westphalia peace prize was last awarded in 2008 to former un secretary general kofi annan , and in earlier years to conductor kurt masur .
the prize is named after the peace of westphalia treaty from 1648 , which ended the thirty years ' war in the holy roman empire .

more than a dent in trafficking , the raid represents growing cooperation between russia and the west . russian and american forces conducted their first joint anti-narcotics raid in afghanistan early on thursday , signaling closer cooperation between the two countries in the battle to control drug cultivation in the war-torn country , the world 's largest producer of opium .
russian anti-drug chief viktor ivanov told a news conference on friday that the raid took place near the pakistani border , and that russian and us forces were supported by helicopters and afghan police .
" four laboratories were found and destroyed - three for heroin and one for morphine , " ivanov said .
" as a result , 932 kilograms -lrb- 2,055 pounds -rrb- of very highly concentrated heroin and 156 kilograms of opium were destroyed . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : afghanistan is the world 's biggest source of opium he added that the street value of the drugs could be up to $ 250 million -lrb- 180 million euros -rrb- .
the us drug enforcement administration released a statement noting the same amount of drugs seized , but said the heroin was worth $ 55.9 million .
eric rubin , deputy chief of mission at the american embassy in moscow , said the operation was a " very big " seizure .
" just in terms of disruption , this was a very important operation , but it was also part of a larger strategy to attack the drug flows , " rubin said at the news conference with ivanov .
shadows of soviet war trafficking from afghanistan has stoked a major heroin problem in russia , and ivanov has criticized the us strategy in its war on afghan drugs , urging more aggressive eradication of poppy crops .
the amount seized in thursday 's raid is unlikely to have a significant effect on the afghan drug trade .
the country produces about 90 percent of the world 's opium , which is used to make heroin .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us funded afghan militias to fight the soviet union but the raid did represent an increase in cooperation between the us and russia , two decades after the us funded afghan militias to chase out soviet occupying forces .
thousands of soviet soldiers were killed in the 10-year war , and going back to afghanistan remains a sensitive issue in russia .
several politicians , including prime minister vladimir putin , have said sending russian troops to join the nato-led mission afghanistan is out of the question .
but the joint us-russian drug raid - along with russia 's willingness to let nato forces fly in and out of afghanistan through russian territory and its offer to sell helicopters to the afghan army - suggests russia 's cooperation with the west on afghanistan is improving .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de war crimes -pipe- 30.10.2010 serbia multiplies reward for indicted war criminal mladic großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ratko mladic has been hiding since 1995 serbia has greatly increased the reward for information leading to the arrest of indicted war criminal ratko mladic .
arresting mladic is a crucial condition for serbia 's bid to join the european union . serbia increased the reward for information leading to the arrest of ratko mladic tenfold to 10 million euros -lrb- $ 13.7 million -rrb- , apparently to prove belgrade 's political will to capture the indicted war criminal .
the decision , announced on thursday , " represents serbia 's clear political will to remove the last remaining obstacle on its path towards the european union , " deputy war crimes prosecutor bruno vekaric told beta news agency .
the reward for wartime croation serb rebel leader goran hadzic was also raised to 500,000 euros .
both mladic and hadzic are believed to be hiding in serbia .
" these two men have kept the whole nation hostage , -lrb- but -rrb- also their families and future generations , " vekaric said experts are skeptical bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the srebrenica massacre was europe 's worst since world war ii ratko mladic was the bosnian serb army commander and is accused by the un of being responsible for the srebrenica massacre of 8,000 muslim men and boys , the worst single atrocity on european soil since world war ii .
he is also charged for masterminding the 1992-1995 siege of sarajevo , which killed 10,000 people .
mladic has been on the run for 15 years .
in may , his family tried to declare him dead , claiming that he had been in poor health and that they had had no contact with him for more than five years .
despite serbia 's intentions , raising the reward will likely have no affect mladic 's arrest , serbian security expert ljubodrag stojadinovic told deutsche welle .
it is not a question of gratification , but rather the government 's lack of control of the secret service who would be in charge of arresting mladic , he said .
according to dragan popovic , director of the center of applied politics in belgrade , serbia simply tries to send out a positive message to the international community in order to make them believe the government is actively going after mladic .
good news from brussels mladic 's arrest , along with cooperation with the international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia , is serbia 's greatest obstacle to its goal of joining the european union .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tadic follows a pro-european union course in june , un chief prosecutor serge brammertz accused serbia of putting little effort into arresting mladic and has demanded several times that serbia 's eu membership should depend on whether they can catch him .
eu foreign ministers meeting in luxembourg this week said they wanted to support the pro-european position of serbian president boris tadic , instructing the european commission to comment on serbia 's membership application .
an official statement from the commission is not expected before the second half of 2011 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de drugs -pipe- 30.10.2010 russians join american troops in afghanistan drug raid großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia has criticized us anti-drug efforts in afghanistan russian and us forces raided four drug laboratories in afghanistan in their first joint anti-drug operation .
more than a dent in trafficking , the raid represents growing cooperation between russia and the west . russian and american forces conducted their first joint anti-narcotics raid in afghanistan early on thursday , signaling closer cooperation between the two countries in the battle to control drug cultivation in the war-torn country , the world 's largest producer of opium .
russian anti-drug chief viktor ivanov told a news conference on friday that the raid took place near the pakistani border , and that russian and us forces were supported by helicopters and afghan police .
" four laboratories were found and destroyed - three for heroin and one for morphine , " ivanov said .
" as a result , 932 kilograms -lrb- 2,055 pounds -rrb- of very highly concentrated heroin and 156 kilograms of opium were destroyed . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : afghanistan is the world 's biggest source of opium he added that the street value of the drugs could be up to $ 250 million -lrb- 180 million euros -rrb- .
the us drug enforcement administration released a statement noting the same amount of drugs seized , but said the heroin was worth $ 55.9 million .
eric rubin , deputy chief of mission at the american embassy in moscow , said the operation was a " very big " seizure .
" just in terms of disruption , this was a very important operation , but it was also part of a larger strategy to attack the drug flows , " rubin said at the news conference with ivanov .
shadows of soviet war trafficking from afghanistan has stoked a major heroin problem in russia , and ivanov has criticized the us strategy in its war on afghan drugs , urging more aggressive eradication of poppy crops .
the amount seized in thursday 's raid is unlikely to have a significant effect on the afghan drug trade .
the country produces about 90 percent of the world 's opium , which is used to make heroin .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us funded afghan militias to fight the soviet union but the raid did represent an increase in cooperation between the us and russia , two decades after the us funded afghan militias to chase out soviet occupying forces .
thousands of soviet soldiers were killed in the 10-year war , and going back to afghanistan remains a sensitive issue in russia .
several politicians , including prime minister vladimir putin , have said sending russian troops to join the nato-led mission afghanistan is out of the question .
but the joint us-russian drug raid - along with russia 's willingness to let nato forces fly in and out of afghanistan through russian territory and its offer to sell helicopters to the afghan army - suggests russia 's cooperation with the west on afghanistan is improving .

more than a dent in trafficking , the raid represents growing cooperation between russia and the west . russian and american forces conducted their first joint anti-narcotics raid in afghanistan early on thursday , signaling closer cooperation between the two countries in the battle to control drug cultivation in the war-torn country , the world 's largest producer of opium .
russian anti-drug chief viktor ivanov told a news conference on friday that the raid took place near the pakistani border , and that russian and us forces were supported by helicopters and afghan police .
" four laboratories were found and destroyed - three for heroin and one for morphine , " ivanov said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de human rights -pipe- 30.10.2010 un resolutions support women , but fail to change winds of war großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in places like congo , women coninue to be victimized by war - despite resolutions ten years ago , the un passed a resolution underscoring the role of women in promoting peace and security .
yet despite the passage of three similar agreements since then , men still hold most of the influence . following the passage of the groundbreaking resolution 1325 on oct .
31 , 2000 , the united nations women 's fund unifem appointed two women – elisabeth rehn , the former finnish minister of defence , and ellen johnson-sirleaf , who is now president of liberia – to conduct an independent , expert assessment on " women , war and peace . "
their findings confirmed the central idea at the heart of the resolution : " without women 's representation – without half the population – no country can truly claim to be engaged in democratic development and participatory governance . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hillary clinton pushed through new resolutions - to little avail resolution 1325 was the first to address war 's consequences for women , as well as the female role in preventing conflict and securing and building peace .
the security council unanimously adopted the resolution a decade ago , marking a turning point in the history of international rights for women .
the document called on all un member states to develop national action plans to help incorporate women into strategies for security and peace-building .
a female voice in peace talks the resolution ensures that women around the world are entitled to a role in peace negotiations .
but in many cases , their voices have yet to be heard by parties engaged in conflict .
according to un statistics , only 7.5 percent of negotiators participating in 22 peace processes since 1992 were female .
in 14 talks , only three percent of the signatories to peace deals were women .
despite those figures , the un security council has continued to stand up for women in conflict zones .
on june 19 , 2008 , resolution 1820 stated that rape and other forms of sexual violence could constitute war crimes and crimes against humanity , as well as a constitutive act with respect to genocide .
the resolution was coupled with calls for a " zero-tolerance policy " on sexual abuse by un staff engaged in peacekeeping and peace-building missions .
sexual violence on the rise but just a year later , a number of non-governmental organizations noted an increase in sex-related violence in countries like the democratic republic of congo , sudan , chad and the central african republic .
only rarely were the perpetrators held accountable for their crimes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the number of women civilians - if not troops - has risen in peacekeeping ranks the fact that 30 percent of civilian personnel for un peacekeeping missions are women can be seen as a breakthrough – and a by-product of both resolutions .
out of 27 peacekeeping operations , five are led by women – a huge success over previous years .
yet women today make up less than three percent of the military .
backed by us secretary of state hillary clinton , in the fall of 2009 , the un security council once again passed two resolutions , 1888 and 1889 .
they did n't strike off in any new directions , but they were more concrete than their predecessors .
as a result of the resolutions , ex-eu commissioner margot wallstroem , from sweden , was named special representative on sexual violence in conflict , a post that aims to fight violence against girls and women .
but it seems that overall the key strategy has been a disaster .
only 19 states have developed and passed a national action plan to enact resolution 1325 .
most countries do n't have the money push it through .
more analysis , more money , legal action speaking about the strategy recently , un secretary general ban ki-moon said , " we have made too little progress . "
looking at the horrible violence against women in congo , where more than 250,000 women have been raped in the past decade , ban said it was clear the international community was still failing to protect the people who are the most vulnerable .
according to the un security council , more steps are needed to make progress at last when it comes to women , peace and security .
these include more financial support for national action plans , systematic information delivery , an analysis of the topic of women in conflicts , and prosecution of those who breach the human rights of women - or who order their rights to be breached in war .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de drugs -pipe- 30.10.2010 russians join american troops in afghanistan drug raid großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia has criticized us anti-drug efforts in afghanistan russian and us forces raided four drug laboratories in afghanistan in their first joint anti-drug operation .
more than a dent in trafficking , the raid represents growing cooperation between russia and the west . russian and american forces conducted their first joint anti-narcotics raid in afghanistan early on thursday , signaling closer cooperation between the two countries in the battle to control drug cultivation in the war-torn country , the world 's largest producer of opium .
russian anti-drug chief viktor ivanov told a news conference on friday that the raid took place near the pakistani border , and that russian and us forces were supported by helicopters and afghan police .
" four laboratories were found and destroyed - three for heroin and one for morphine , " ivanov said .
" as a result , 932 kilograms -lrb- 2,055 pounds -rrb- of very highly concentrated heroin and 156 kilograms of opium were destroyed . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : afghanistan is the world 's biggest source of opium he added that the street value of the drugs could be up to $ 250 million -lrb- 180 million euros -rrb- .
the us drug enforcement administration released a statement noting the same amount of drugs seized , but said the heroin was worth $ 55.9 million .
eric rubin , deputy chief of mission at the american embassy in moscow , said the operation was a " very big " seizure .
" just in terms of disruption , this was a very important operation , but it was also part of a larger strategy to attack the drug flows , " rubin said at the news conference with ivanov .
shadows of soviet war trafficking from afghanistan has stoked a major heroin problem in russia , and ivanov has criticized the us strategy in its war on afghan drugs , urging more aggressive eradication of poppy crops .
the amount seized in thursday 's raid is unlikely to have a significant effect on the afghan drug trade .
the country produces about 90 percent of the world 's opium , which is used to make heroin .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us funded afghan militias to fight the soviet union but the raid did represent an increase in cooperation between the us and russia , two decades after the us funded afghan militias to chase out soviet occupying forces .
thousands of soviet soldiers were killed in the 10-year war , and going back to afghanistan remains a sensitive issue in russia .
several politicians , including prime minister vladimir putin , have said sending russian troops to join the nato-led mission afghanistan is out of the question .
but the joint us-russian drug raid - along with russia 's willingness to let nato forces fly in and out of afghanistan through russian territory and its offer to sell helicopters to the afghan army - suggests russia 's cooperation with the west on afghanistan is improving .

" we are generally in a situation where we always have to be prepared for terrorist attacks , " he told reuters tv at the convention of his party , the christian social union , on saturday .
" for some , it is abstract , but it is actually very real .
and often , things happen in the most remote places on earth , that 's why we need to adapt our approach to security , " he added .
no specific threat to germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guttenberg says terror threats are not " abstract " despite this warning , german interior minister thomas de maiziere insisted in a statement on saturday that " there are no specific indications of planned attacks against germany " .
it comes after it emerged that a suspect parcel found on a us-bound plane in britain was routed via the western german city of cologne .
" germany has raised its security measures to a higher level and is adapting to the situation , " de maiziere added .
de maiziere announced late on saturday that germany was blocking all freight from yemen , with orders being issued to air carriers and other relevant businesses . " the government is making sure that , from now on , no freight coming from yemen will arrive in germany , " said de maiziere .
suspicious packages were found on friday on us-bound cargo planes at britain 's east midlands airport near nottingham and in dubai .
british and dubai authorities later confirmed that the explosives , found hidden in printers in those parcels , were viable and could have exploded .

but this is far from the case in afghanistan , where many women are pushing for more participation . marzia is a police officer in uniform , still a rare sight in afghan society , even though the female component of the afghan security forces is important in a muslim society .
if apartments need to be searched , then marzia 's job is to check the women 's bedrooms and closets .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women in afghanistan are still struggling to make their voices heard marzia says there should be more afghan women with jobs , and believes that the political climate is auspicious .
" the freedom of movement has improved for women , " she said .
" women are now allowed to work alongside men .
it does n't matter where or what it is , women should get jobs . "
women as negotiators although afghan society may be changing , women are still a minority in positions of responsibility when it comes to peace negotiations - as they are throughout the world .
it was for this reason that the united nations agreed resolution 1325 10 years ago , a document that demanded that women be given an equal role in conflict resolution in all regional , national and international institutions .
the prominent afghan women 's rights campaigner soraya parlika believes that her country is still a long way from this aim .
she points to president hamid karzai 's newly-founded peace council , of whose 69 members only nine are women .
seven of those nine have been appointed by karzai , which parlika believes limits their independence .
" these women are sitting together with men who only know war , " she said .
" they are not heard and they have no chance to influence the negotiations in any way . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : afghan women live in fear of losing family members golzum seddiqi , director of an initiative for women lawyers in the western town of herat , does not see the women on the peace council in a particularly positive light .
" up until now , they do n't have any plans or strategies for positions in which they have political or social responsibility , " she said .
" they need to get rid of other problems first .
some women with no qualifications have used the opportunity to get important positions through bribes and connections . "
peace starts in the family but herat provincial councillor djamila karimi believes that the lack of qualifications is a minor concern for the women on the peace council .
she thinks women are not taken seriously as peace negotiators simply because afghan women have been locked into a passive role in society that wo n't be changed overnight .
" these are women who constantly live with the fear of losing family members to the war .
i think women can teach their children not to take up weapons in the future , " karimi said .
" a bearded warlord in afghanistan wo n't listen to women 's demands at the end of the war .
but a child listens to its mother . "
according to karimi , many afghan women want nothing more than to see their children go to school to learn how to build a new afghan society , while very few want a political career .
instead , they still concentrate on their responsibilities within the family .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women in afghanistan are still struggling to make their voices heard marzia says there should be more afghan women with jobs , and believes that the political climate is auspicious .
" the freedom of movement has improved for women , " she said .
" women are now allowed to work alongside men .
it does n't matter where or what it is , women should get jobs . "
women as negotiators although afghan society may be changing , women are still a minority in positions of responsibility when it comes to peace negotiations - as they are throughout the world .
it was for this reason that the united nations agreed resolution 1325 10 years ago , a document that demanded that women be given an equal role in conflict resolution in all regional , national and international institutions .
the prominent afghan women 's rights campaigner soraya parlika believes that her country is still a long way from this aim .
she points to president hamid karzai 's newly-founded peace council , of whose 69 members only nine are women .
seven of those nine have been appointed by karzai , which parlika believes limits their independence .
" these women are sitting together with men who only know war , " she said .
" they are not heard and they have no chance to influence the negotiations in any way . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : afghan women live in fear of losing family members golzum seddiqi , director of an initiative for women lawyers in the western town of herat , does not see the women on the peace council in a particularly positive light .
" up until now , they do n't have any plans or strategies for positions in which they have political or social responsibility , " she said .
" they need to get rid of other problems first .
some women with no qualifications have used the opportunity to get important positions through bribes and connections . "
peace starts in the family but herat provincial councillor djamila karimi believes that the lack of qualifications is a minor concern for the women on the peace council .
she thinks women are not taken seriously as peace negotiators simply because afghan women have been locked into a passive role in society that wo n't be changed overnight .
" these are women who constantly live with the fear of losing family members to the war .
i think women can teach their children not to take up weapons in the future , " karimi said .
" a bearded warlord in afghanistan wo n't listen to women 's demands at the end of the war .
but a child listens to its mother . "
according to karimi , many afghan women want nothing more than to see their children go to school to learn how to build a new afghan society , while very few want a political career .
instead , they still concentrate on their responsibilities within the family .

more than a dent in trafficking , the raid represents growing cooperation between russia and the west . russian and american forces conducted their first joint anti-narcotics raid in afghanistan early on thursday , signaling closer cooperation between the two countries in the battle to control drug cultivation in the war-torn country , the world 's largest producer of opium .
russian anti-drug chief viktor ivanov told a news conference on friday that the raid took place near the pakistani border , and that russian and us forces were supported by helicopters and afghan police .
" four laboratories were found and destroyed - three for heroin and one for morphine , " ivanov said .
" as a result , 932 kilograms -lrb- 2,055 pounds -rrb- of very highly concentrated heroin and 156 kilograms of opium were destroyed . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : afghanistan is the world 's biggest source of opium he added that the street value of the drugs could be up to $ 250 million -lrb- 180 million euros -rrb- .
the us drug enforcement administration released a statement noting the same amount of drugs seized , but said the heroin was worth $ 55.9 million .
eric rubin , deputy chief of mission at the american embassy in moscow , said the operation was a " very big " seizure .
" just in terms of disruption , this was a very important operation , but it was also part of a larger strategy to attack the drug flows , " rubin said at the news conference with ivanov .
shadows of soviet war trafficking from afghanistan has stoked a major heroin problem in russia , and ivanov has criticized the us strategy in its war on afghan drugs , urging more aggressive eradication of poppy crops .
the amount seized in thursday 's raid is unlikely to have a significant effect on the afghan drug trade .
the country produces about 90 percent of the world 's opium , which is used to make heroin .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us funded afghan militias to fight the soviet union but the raid did represent an increase in cooperation between the us and russia , two decades after the us funded afghan militias to chase out soviet occupying forces .
thousands of soviet soldiers were killed in the 10-year war , and going back to afghanistan remains a sensitive issue in russia .
several politicians , including prime minister vladimir putin , have said sending russian troops to join the nato-led mission afghanistan is out of the question .
but the joint us-russian drug raid - along with russia 's willingness to let nato forces fly in and out of afghanistan through russian territory and its offer to sell helicopters to the afghan army - suggests russia 's cooperation with the west on afghanistan is improving .

yet despite the passage of three similar agreements since then , men still hold most of the influence . following the passage of the groundbreaking resolution 1325 on oct .
31 , 2000 , the united nations women 's fund unifem appointed two women – elisabeth rehn , the former finnish minister of defence , and ellen johnson-sirleaf , who is now president of liberia – to conduct an independent , expert assessment on " women , war and peace . "
their findings confirmed the central idea at the heart of the resolution : " without women 's representation – without half the population – no country can truly claim to be engaged in democratic development and participatory governance . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hillary clinton pushed through new resolutions - to little avail resolution 1325 was the first to address war 's consequences for women , as well as the female role in preventing conflict and securing and building peace .
the security council unanimously adopted the resolution a decade ago , marking a turning point in the history of international rights for women .
the document called on all un member states to develop national action plans to help incorporate women into strategies for security and peace-building .
a female voice in peace talks the resolution ensures that women around the world are entitled to a role in peace negotiations .
but in many cases , their voices have yet to be heard by parties engaged in conflict .
according to un statistics , only 7.5 percent of negotiators participating in 22 peace processes since 1992 were female .
in 14 talks , only three percent of the signatories to peace deals were women .
despite those figures , the un security council has continued to stand up for women in conflict zones .
on june 19 , 2008 , resolution 1820 stated that rape and other forms of sexual violence could constitute war crimes and crimes against humanity , as well as a constitutive act with respect to genocide .
the resolution was coupled with calls for a " zero-tolerance policy " on sexual abuse by un staff engaged in peacekeeping and peace-building missions .
sexual violence on the rise but just a year later , a number of non-governmental organizations noted an increase in sex-related violence in countries like the democratic republic of congo , sudan , chad and the central african republic .
only rarely were the perpetrators held accountable for their crimes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the number of women civilians - if not troops - has risen in peacekeeping ranks the fact that 30 percent of civilian personnel for un peacekeeping missions are women can be seen as a breakthrough – and a by-product of both resolutions .
out of 27 peacekeeping operations , five are led by women – a huge success over previous years .
yet women today make up less than three percent of the military .
backed by us secretary of state hillary clinton , in the fall of 2009 , the un security council once again passed two resolutions , 1888 and 1889 .
they did n't strike off in any new directions , but they were more concrete than their predecessors .
as a result of the resolutions , ex-eu commissioner margot wallstroem , from sweden , was named special representative on sexual violence in conflict , a post that aims to fight violence against girls and women .
but it seems that overall the key strategy has been a disaster .
only 19 states have developed and passed a national action plan to enact resolution 1325 .
most countries do n't have the money push it through .
more analysis , more money , legal action speaking about the strategy recently , un secretary general ban ki-moon said , " we have made too little progress . "
looking at the horrible violence against women in congo , where more than 250,000 women have been raped in the past decade , ban said it was clear the international community was still failing to protect the people who are the most vulnerable .
according to the un security council , more steps are needed to make progress at last when it comes to women , peace and security .
these include more financial support for national action plans , systematic information delivery , an analysis of the topic of women in conflicts , and prosecution of those who breach the human rights of women - or who order their rights to be breached in war .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de human rights -pipe- 30.10.2010 un resolutions support women , but fail to change winds of war großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in places like congo , women coninue to be victimized by war - despite resolutions ten years ago , the un passed a resolution underscoring the role of women in promoting peace and security .
yet despite the passage of three similar agreements since then , men still hold most of the influence . following the passage of the groundbreaking resolution 1325 on oct .
31 , 2000 , the united nations women 's fund unifem appointed two women – elisabeth rehn , the former finnish minister of defence , and ellen johnson-sirleaf , who is now president of liberia – to conduct an independent , expert assessment on " women , war and peace . "
their findings confirmed the central idea at the heart of the resolution : " without women 's representation – without half the population – no country can truly claim to be engaged in democratic development and participatory governance . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hillary clinton pushed through new resolutions - to little avail resolution 1325 was the first to address war 's consequences for women , as well as the female role in preventing conflict and securing and building peace .
the security council unanimously adopted the resolution a decade ago , marking a turning point in the history of international rights for women .
the document called on all un member states to develop national action plans to help incorporate women into strategies for security and peace-building .
a female voice in peace talks the resolution ensures that women around the world are entitled to a role in peace negotiations .
but in many cases , their voices have yet to be heard by parties engaged in conflict .
according to un statistics , only 7.5 percent of negotiators participating in 22 peace processes since 1992 were female .
in 14 talks , only three percent of the signatories to peace deals were women .
despite those figures , the un security council has continued to stand up for women in conflict zones .
on june 19 , 2008 , resolution 1820 stated that rape and other forms of sexual violence could constitute war crimes and crimes against humanity , as well as a constitutive act with respect to genocide .
the resolution was coupled with calls for a " zero-tolerance policy " on sexual abuse by un staff engaged in peacekeeping and peace-building missions .
sexual violence on the rise but just a year later , a number of non-governmental organizations noted an increase in sex-related violence in countries like the democratic republic of congo , sudan , chad and the central african republic .
only rarely were the perpetrators held accountable for their crimes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the number of women civilians - if not troops - has risen in peacekeeping ranks the fact that 30 percent of civilian personnel for un peacekeeping missions are women can be seen as a breakthrough – and a by-product of both resolutions .
out of 27 peacekeeping operations , five are led by women – a huge success over previous years .
yet women today make up less than three percent of the military .
backed by us secretary of state hillary clinton , in the fall of 2009 , the un security council once again passed two resolutions , 1888 and 1889 .
they did n't strike off in any new directions , but they were more concrete than their predecessors .
as a result of the resolutions , ex-eu commissioner margot wallstroem , from sweden , was named special representative on sexual violence in conflict , a post that aims to fight violence against girls and women .
but it seems that overall the key strategy has been a disaster .
only 19 states have developed and passed a national action plan to enact resolution 1325 .
most countries do n't have the money push it through .
more analysis , more money , legal action speaking about the strategy recently , un secretary general ban ki-moon said , " we have made too little progress . "
looking at the horrible violence against women in congo , where more than 250,000 women have been raped in the past decade , ban said it was clear the international community was still failing to protect the people who are the most vulnerable .
according to the un security council , more steps are needed to make progress at last when it comes to women , peace and security .
these include more financial support for national action plans , systematic information delivery , an analysis of the topic of women in conflicts , and prosecution of those who breach the human rights of women - or who order their rights to be breached in war .

more than a dent in trafficking , the raid represents growing cooperation between russia and the west . russian and american forces conducted their first joint anti-narcotics raid in afghanistan early on thursday , signaling closer cooperation between the two countries in the battle to control drug cultivation in the war-torn country , the world 's largest producer of opium .
russian anti-drug chief viktor ivanov told a news conference on friday that the raid took place near the pakistani border , and that russian and us forces were supported by helicopters and afghan police .
" four laboratories were found and destroyed - three for heroin and one for morphine , " ivanov said .
" as a result , 932 kilograms -lrb- 2,055 pounds -rrb- of very highly concentrated heroin and 156 kilograms of opium were destroyed . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : afghanistan is the world 's biggest source of opium he added that the street value of the drugs could be up to $ 250 million -lrb- 180 million euros -rrb- .
the us drug enforcement administration released a statement noting the same amount of drugs seized , but said the heroin was worth $ 55.9 million .
eric rubin , deputy chief of mission at the american embassy in moscow , said the operation was a " very big " seizure .
" just in terms of disruption , this was a very important operation , but it was also part of a larger strategy to attack the drug flows , " rubin said at the news conference with ivanov .
shadows of soviet war trafficking from afghanistan has stoked a major heroin problem in russia , and ivanov has criticized the us strategy in its war on afghan drugs , urging more aggressive eradication of poppy crops .
the amount seized in thursday 's raid is unlikely to have a significant effect on the afghan drug trade .
the country produces about 90 percent of the world 's opium , which is used to make heroin .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us funded afghan militias to fight the soviet union but the raid did represent an increase in cooperation between the us and russia , two decades after the us funded afghan militias to chase out soviet occupying forces .
thousands of soviet soldiers were killed in the 10-year war , and going back to afghanistan remains a sensitive issue in russia .
several politicians , including prime minister vladimir putin , have said sending russian troops to join the nato-led mission afghanistan is out of the question .
but the joint us-russian drug raid - along with russia 's willingness to let nato forces fly in and out of afghanistan through russian territory and its offer to sell helicopters to the afghan army - suggests russia 's cooperation with the west on afghanistan is improving .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de human rights -pipe- 30.10.2010 un resolutions support women , but fail to change winds of war großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in places like congo , women coninue to be victimized by war - despite resolutions ten years ago , the un passed a resolution underscoring the role of women in promoting peace and security .
yet despite the passage of three similar agreements since then , men still hold most of the influence . following the passage of the groundbreaking resolution 1325 on oct .
31 , 2000 , the united nations women 's fund unifem appointed two women – elisabeth rehn , the former finnish minister of defence , and ellen johnson-sirleaf , who is now president of liberia – to conduct an independent , expert assessment on " women , war and peace . "
their findings confirmed the central idea at the heart of the resolution : " without women 's representation – without half the population – no country can truly claim to be engaged in democratic development and participatory governance . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hillary clinton pushed through new resolutions - to little avail resolution 1325 was the first to address war 's consequences for women , as well as the female role in preventing conflict and securing and building peace .
the security council unanimously adopted the resolution a decade ago , marking a turning point in the history of international rights for women .
the document called on all un member states to develop national action plans to help incorporate women into strategies for security and peace-building .
a female voice in peace talks the resolution ensures that women around the world are entitled to a role in peace negotiations .
but in many cases , their voices have yet to be heard by parties engaged in conflict .
according to un statistics , only 7.5 percent of negotiators participating in 22 peace processes since 1992 were female .
in 14 talks , only three percent of the signatories to peace deals were women .
despite those figures , the un security council has continued to stand up for women in conflict zones .
on june 19 , 2008 , resolution 1820 stated that rape and other forms of sexual violence could constitute war crimes and crimes against humanity , as well as a constitutive act with respect to genocide .
the resolution was coupled with calls for a " zero-tolerance policy " on sexual abuse by un staff engaged in peacekeeping and peace-building missions .
sexual violence on the rise but just a year later , a number of non-governmental organizations noted an increase in sex-related violence in countries like the democratic republic of congo , sudan , chad and the central african republic .
only rarely were the perpetrators held accountable for their crimes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the number of women civilians - if not troops - has risen in peacekeeping ranks the fact that 30 percent of civilian personnel for un peacekeeping missions are women can be seen as a breakthrough – and a by-product of both resolutions .
out of 27 peacekeeping operations , five are led by women – a huge success over previous years .
yet women today make up less than three percent of the military .
backed by us secretary of state hillary clinton , in the fall of 2009 , the un security council once again passed two resolutions , 1888 and 1889 .
they did n't strike off in any new directions , but they were more concrete than their predecessors .
as a result of the resolutions , ex-eu commissioner margot wallstroem , from sweden , was named special representative on sexual violence in conflict , a post that aims to fight violence against girls and women .
but it seems that overall the key strategy has been a disaster .
only 19 states have developed and passed a national action plan to enact resolution 1325 .
most countries do n't have the money push it through .
more analysis , more money , legal action speaking about the strategy recently , un secretary general ban ki-moon said , " we have made too little progress . "
looking at the horrible violence against women in congo , where more than 250,000 women have been raped in the past decade , ban said it was clear the international community was still failing to protect the people who are the most vulnerable .
according to the un security council , more steps are needed to make progress at last when it comes to women , peace and security .
these include more financial support for national action plans , systematic information delivery , an analysis of the topic of women in conflicts , and prosecution of those who breach the human rights of women - or who order their rights to be breached in war .

yanukovych told federal prosecutors to investigate the case .
the ballot papers were a " special reserve " which had to be printed as required by law , said prosecutor yevhen popovych later .

accusations fly yulia tymoshenko , the head of fatherland , said no one could rule out that fraudulent ballot papers like the ones in kharkiv might turn up in other areas of ukraine as well .

yanukovych has said his party is so far ahead in the polls and its record so solid that there would be no reason to tamper with the election results .
opposition votes but opinion polls show that yanukovych 's party has lost support since the presidential election at the beginning of this year .
experts at the open society institute put the blame on campaign pledges that have not been fulfilled .
yanukovych had promised to improve transparency and give tax benefits to small company owners .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : petro simonenko is critical of his coalition partner ukrainian voters are also resentful of a drastic increase in the price of gas , which in turn has led to higher prices for staple foods and public transportation .
therefore , opposition parties like tymoshenko 's bloc are expected to gain votes .
according to the open society institute , other parties , such as strong ukraine and front for change , will also benefit from voter dissatisfaction .
voters expect manipulation according to a poll by the democratic initiatives foundation , a ukrainian ngo , almost 50 percent of those interviewed do not think the elections will change anything .
positive change is expected by one third of the interviewees , while four percent expect a drastic change for the worse .
only two percent believe that the candidates are going to fulfil their campaign promises .
still most of the interviewees - three quarters - will go and cast their vote .
but only 8.5 percent believe the election results will not be manipulated .

yet despite the passage of three similar agreements since then , men still hold most of the influence . following the passage of the groundbreaking resolution 1325 on oct .
31 , 2000 , the united nations women 's fund unifem appointed two women – elisabeth rehn , the former finnish minister of defence , and ellen johnson-sirleaf , who is now president of liberia – to conduct an independent , expert assessment on " women , war and peace . "
their findings confirmed the central idea at the heart of the resolution : " without women 's representation – without half the population – no country can truly claim to be engaged in democratic development and participatory governance . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hillary clinton pushed through new resolutions - to little avail resolution 1325 was the first to address war 's consequences for women , as well as the female role in preventing conflict and securing and building peace .
the security council unanimously adopted the resolution a decade ago , marking a turning point in the history of international rights for women .
the document called on all un member states to develop national action plans to help incorporate women into strategies for security and peace-building .
a female voice in peace talks the resolution ensures that women around the world are entitled to a role in peace negotiations .
but in many cases , their voices have yet to be heard by parties engaged in conflict .
according to un statistics , only 7.5 percent of negotiators participating in 22 peace processes since 1992 were female .
in 14 talks , only three percent of the signatories to peace deals were women .
despite those figures , the un security council has continued to stand up for women in conflict zones .
on june 19 , 2008 , resolution 1820 stated that rape and other forms of sexual violence could constitute war crimes and crimes against humanity , as well as a constitutive act with respect to genocide .
the resolution was coupled with calls for a " zero-tolerance policy " on sexual abuse by un staff engaged in peacekeeping and peace-building missions .
sexual violence on the rise but just a year later , a number of non-governmental organizations noted an increase in sex-related violence in countries like the democratic republic of congo , sudan , chad and the central african republic .
only rarely were the perpetrators held accountable for their crimes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the number of women civilians - if not troops - has risen in peacekeeping ranks the fact that 30 percent of civilian personnel for un peacekeeping missions are women can be seen as a breakthrough – and a by-product of both resolutions .
out of 27 peacekeeping operations , five are led by women – a huge success over previous years .
yet women today make up less than three percent of the military .
backed by us secretary of state hillary clinton , in the fall of 2009 , the un security council once again passed two resolutions , 1888 and 1889 .
they did n't strike off in any new directions , but they were more concrete than their predecessors .
as a result of the resolutions , ex-eu commissioner margot wallstroem , from sweden , was named special representative on sexual violence in conflict , a post that aims to fight violence against girls and women .
but it seems that overall the key strategy has been a disaster .
only 19 states have developed and passed a national action plan to enact resolution 1325 .
most countries do n't have the money push it through .
more analysis , more money , legal action speaking about the strategy recently , un secretary general ban ki-moon said , " we have made too little progress . "
looking at the horrible violence against women in congo , where more than 250,000 women have been raped in the past decade , ban said it was clear the international community was still failing to protect the people who are the most vulnerable .
according to the un security council , more steps are needed to make progress at last when it comes to women , peace and security .
these include more financial support for national action plans , systematic information delivery , an analysis of the topic of women in conflicts , and prosecution of those who breach the human rights of women - or who order their rights to be breached in war .

bundesliga leaders mainz take on nearest rivals dortmund sunday after both were beaten in mid-week cup matches . with the bundesliga ’ s designated 800-pound gorilla bayern munich sputtering in mid-table , and other top teams from recent years like wolfsburg , stuttgart , bremen and schalke doing likewise , two teams coached by ambitious young coaches have risen to the challenge and claimed the top spots for themselves .
just two points separate the teams in first and second place , so sunday 's match will determine who will be top dog at the end of match day ten .
both teams come into the game on the back of embarrassing german cup defeats in midweek and nothing will be allowed to cloud the focus as mainz and dortmund look to bounce back and keep their exciting , entertaining and surprising rivalry at the top of the bundesliga on track .
both mainz and dortmund have earned their positions through attacking soccer .
their coaches , both combustible and passionate characters , have fashioned their teams in their own images and are reaping the benefits of molding their players into systems and tactics full of their own belief and confidence .
thomas tuchel at mainz and juergen klopp at dortmund have hugely competitive personalities and their desire to win can be seen in the way that their teams hound and harass the opposition and attack with purpose .
but while points and league position are important in the pursuit of the title , both coaches have also impressed on their players the need to win with style .
dortmund coach adds youth to solid base bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klopp looks to improve on last season 's fifth-place finish klopp , the former mainz boss who coached the team who won the club ’ s first-ever promotion to the top flight in 2004 , has built on his impressive first season in dortmund by spending wisely and investing in the club 's already rich vein of youth .
since klopp has taken over at bvb , shinji kagawa , kevin grosskreutz , sven bender , marcel schmelzer , mario goetze and mats hummels - none older then 22 - have come into the bvb first team and excelled , adding fluidity and danger to the side .
meanwhile nuri sahin , whose career was once thought to have entered a holding pattern after an up-and-down loan spell in holland at feyenoord , has become the rock of dortmund ’ s midfield .
he too is still just 22 .
up front , lucas barrios has been a revelation since joining last season and has cemented his reputation as one of the bundesliga 's most feared marksmen .
after hitting 19 goals in his debut campaign , he ’ s netted four thus far in the new season , and the attention he draws from opposing defenders often opens up ample space for his teammates .
tuchel adds flair and verve to turn mainz into contenders bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tuchel has instilled belief and camaraderie in his team tuchel , meanwhile , has transformed mainz from a mid-table entity into a title-chasing force since taking the reins in 2009 .
he led the team to ninth last season , its best ever bundesliga finish , and has built on that performance by finding his own set of precocious talents .
he snared schalke ’ s lewis holtby on loan and seen him shine , and he ’ s turned the andre schuerrle and adam szalai , once cosseted talents , into linchpins of the side .
both dortmund and mainz have seen the benefits of giving youngsters their chance , a reflection of the current philosophy being promoted at international level in germany .
adhering to the old standard of " if you 're old enough , you 're good enough , " klopp and tuchel have tapped into the desire young players have to succeed and challenge for places and silverware .
the results are there to see in the bundesliga table .
sunday 's clash will always be an emotional one for klopp , the former fan favorite and hero of mainz 's promotion campaign six years ago .
but forced to choose between taking it easy on his old club and going top himself , there will be no room for sentimentality .

bundesliga leaders mainz take on nearest rivals dortmund sunday after both were beaten in mid-week cup matches . with the bundesliga ’ s designated 800-pound gorilla bayern munich sputtering in mid-table , and other top teams from recent years like wolfsburg , stuttgart , bremen and schalke doing likewise , two teams coached by ambitious young coaches have risen to the challenge and claimed the top spots for themselves .
just two points separate the teams in first and second place , so sunday 's match will determine who will be top dog at the end of match day ten .
both teams come into the game on the back of embarrassing german cup defeats in midweek and nothing will be allowed to cloud the focus as mainz and dortmund look to bounce back and keep their exciting , entertaining and surprising rivalry at the top of the bundesliga on track .
both mainz and dortmund have earned their positions through attacking soccer .
their coaches , both combustible and passionate characters , have fashioned their teams in their own images and are reaping the benefits of molding their players into systems and tactics full of their own belief and confidence .
thomas tuchel at mainz and juergen klopp at dortmund have hugely competitive personalities and their desire to win can be seen in the way that their teams hound and harass the opposition and attack with purpose .
but while points and league position are important in the pursuit of the title , both coaches have also impressed on their players the need to win with style .

since klopp has taken over at bvb , shinji kagawa , kevin grosskreutz , sven bender , marcel schmelzer , mario goetze and mats hummels - none older then 22 - have come into the bvb first team and excelled , adding fluidity and danger to the side .

he too is still just 22 .
up front , lucas barrios has been a revelation since joining last season and has cemented his reputation as one of the bundesliga 's most feared marksmen .

adhering to the old standard of " if you 're old enough , you 're good enough , " klopp and tuchel have tapped into the desire young players have to succeed and challenge for places and silverware .
the results are there to see in the bundesliga table .
sunday 's clash will always be an emotional one for klopp , the former fan favorite and hero of mainz 's promotion campaign six years ago .
but forced to choose between taking it easy on his old club and going top himself , there will be no room for sentimentality .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de drugs -pipe- 30.10.2010 russians join american troops in afghanistan drug raid großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia has criticized us anti-drug efforts in afghanistan russian and us forces raided four drug laboratories in afghanistan in their first joint anti-drug operation .
more than a dent in trafficking , the raid represents growing cooperation between russia and the west . russian and american forces conducted their first joint anti-narcotics raid in afghanistan early on thursday , signaling closer cooperation between the two countries in the battle to control drug cultivation in the war-torn country , the world 's largest producer of opium .
russian anti-drug chief viktor ivanov told a news conference on friday that the raid took place near the pakistani border , and that russian and us forces were supported by helicopters and afghan police .
" four laboratories were found and destroyed - three for heroin and one for morphine , " ivanov said .
" as a result , 932 kilograms -lrb- 2,055 pounds -rrb- of very highly concentrated heroin and 156 kilograms of opium were destroyed . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : afghanistan is the world 's biggest source of opium he added that the street value of the drugs could be up to $ 250 million -lrb- 180 million euros -rrb- .
the us drug enforcement administration released a statement noting the same amount of drugs seized , but said the heroin was worth $ 55.9 million .
eric rubin , deputy chief of mission at the american embassy in moscow , said the operation was a " very big " seizure .
" just in terms of disruption , this was a very important operation , but it was also part of a larger strategy to attack the drug flows , " rubin said at the news conference with ivanov .
shadows of soviet war trafficking from afghanistan has stoked a major heroin problem in russia , and ivanov has criticized the us strategy in its war on afghan drugs , urging more aggressive eradication of poppy crops .
the amount seized in thursday 's raid is unlikely to have a significant effect on the afghan drug trade .
the country produces about 90 percent of the world 's opium , which is used to make heroin .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us funded afghan militias to fight the soviet union but the raid did represent an increase in cooperation between the us and russia , two decades after the us funded afghan militias to chase out soviet occupying forces .
thousands of soviet soldiers were killed in the 10-year war , and going back to afghanistan remains a sensitive issue in russia .
several politicians , including prime minister vladimir putin , have said sending russian troops to join the nato-led mission afghanistan is out of the question .
but the joint us-russian drug raid - along with russia 's willingness to let nato forces fly in and out of afghanistan through russian territory and its offer to sell helicopters to the afghan army - suggests russia 's cooperation with the west on afghanistan is improving .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de afghanistan -pipe- 30.10.2010 women seek a role in afghanistan peace process großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the afghanistan peace council includes only nine women un resolution 1325 calls on women to be given an equal role in peace negotiations in areas of conflict .
but this is far from the case in afghanistan , where many women are pushing for more participation . marzia is a police officer in uniform , still a rare sight in afghan society , even though the female component of the afghan security forces is important in a muslim society .
if apartments need to be searched , then marzia 's job is to check the women 's bedrooms and closets .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women in afghanistan are still struggling to make their voices heard marzia says there should be more afghan women with jobs , and believes that the political climate is auspicious .
" the freedom of movement has improved for women , " she said .
" women are now allowed to work alongside men .
it does n't matter where or what it is , women should get jobs . "
women as negotiators although afghan society may be changing , women are still a minority in positions of responsibility when it comes to peace negotiations - as they are throughout the world .
it was for this reason that the united nations agreed resolution 1325 10 years ago , a document that demanded that women be given an equal role in conflict resolution in all regional , national and international institutions .
the prominent afghan women 's rights campaigner soraya parlika believes that her country is still a long way from this aim .
she points to president hamid karzai 's newly-founded peace council , of whose 69 members only nine are women .
seven of those nine have been appointed by karzai , which parlika believes limits their independence .
" these women are sitting together with men who only know war , " she said .
" they are not heard and they have no chance to influence the negotiations in any way . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : afghan women live in fear of losing family members golzum seddiqi , director of an initiative for women lawyers in the western town of herat , does not see the women on the peace council in a particularly positive light .
" up until now , they do n't have any plans or strategies for positions in which they have political or social responsibility , " she said .
" they need to get rid of other problems first .
some women with no qualifications have used the opportunity to get important positions through bribes and connections . "
peace starts in the family but herat provincial councillor djamila karimi believes that the lack of qualifications is a minor concern for the women on the peace council .
she thinks women are not taken seriously as peace negotiators simply because afghan women have been locked into a passive role in society that wo n't be changed overnight .
" these are women who constantly live with the fear of losing family members to the war .
i think women can teach their children not to take up weapons in the future , " karimi said .
" a bearded warlord in afghanistan wo n't listen to women 's demands at the end of the war .
but a child listens to its mother . "
according to karimi , many afghan women want nothing more than to see their children go to school to learn how to build a new afghan society , while very few want a political career .
instead , they still concentrate on their responsibilities within the family .

but this is far from the case in afghanistan , where many women are pushing for more participation . marzia is a police officer in uniform , still a rare sight in afghan society , even though the female component of the afghan security forces is important in a muslim society .
if apartments need to be searched , then marzia 's job is to check the women 's bedrooms and closets .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women in afghanistan are still struggling to make their voices heard marzia says there should be more afghan women with jobs , and believes that the political climate is auspicious .
" the freedom of movement has improved for women , " she said .
" women are now allowed to work alongside men .
it does n't matter where or what it is , women should get jobs . "
women as negotiators although afghan society may be changing , women are still a minority in positions of responsibility when it comes to peace negotiations - as they are throughout the world .
it was for this reason that the united nations agreed resolution 1325 10 years ago , a document that demanded that women be given an equal role in conflict resolution in all regional , national and international institutions .
the prominent afghan women 's rights campaigner soraya parlika believes that her country is still a long way from this aim .
she points to president hamid karzai 's newly-founded peace council , of whose 69 members only nine are women .
seven of those nine have been appointed by karzai , which parlika believes limits their independence .
" these women are sitting together with men who only know war , " she said .
" they are not heard and they have no chance to influence the negotiations in any way . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : afghan women live in fear of losing family members golzum seddiqi , director of an initiative for women lawyers in the western town of herat , does not see the women on the peace council in a particularly positive light .
" up until now , they do n't have any plans or strategies for positions in which they have political or social responsibility , " she said .
" they need to get rid of other problems first .
some women with no qualifications have used the opportunity to get important positions through bribes and connections . "
peace starts in the family but herat provincial councillor djamila karimi believes that the lack of qualifications is a minor concern for the women on the peace council .
she thinks women are not taken seriously as peace negotiators simply because afghan women have been locked into a passive role in society that wo n't be changed overnight .
" these are women who constantly live with the fear of losing family members to the war .
i think women can teach their children not to take up weapons in the future , " karimi said .
" a bearded warlord in afghanistan wo n't listen to women 's demands at the end of the war .
but a child listens to its mother . "
according to karimi , many afghan women want nothing more than to see their children go to school to learn how to build a new afghan society , while very few want a political career .
instead , they still concentrate on their responsibilities within the family .

accusations are already flying about fraud and possible election rigging . just a few days before regional and local elections in ukraine , president viktor yanukovych addressed governors in a tv show in order to make sure they will work to ensure a fair election .
" i will prosecute any attempts to tamper with election results with the utmost severity , " yanukovych said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yanukovych has said he will react swiftly to any election irregularities but yanukovych already had to react to accusations when members of the opposition fatherland party discovered 130,000 allegedly forged ballot papers in a printing house in kharkiv , a city in ukraine 's east .
yanukovych told federal prosecutors to investigate the case .
the ballot papers were a " special reserve " which had to be printed as required by law , said prosecutor yevhen popovych later .
according to the director of the printing house , however , the ballot papers were simply part of a test print .
accusations fly yulia tymoshenko , the head of fatherland , said no one could rule out that fraudulent ballot papers like the ones in kharkiv might turn up in other areas of ukraine as well .
" there is no limit to what these people will do .
they will falsify the vote , you can depend on it , " she said .
several opposition parties have announced that they found tens of thousand of forged ballot papers in two other towns in western ukraine .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tymoshenko says she fears election fraud they also warn about the use of " administrative resources " by yanukovych 's party , called party of the regions , including using state-owned vehicles to increase voter turnout or mobilizing voters , who work in government institutions and businesses .
the communists are also raising concerns over yanukovych , although they are technically in a coalition with his party and a bloc headed by parliamentary leader volodymyr lytvyn .
members of yanukovych 's party could interfere with communist party candidates in the eastern regions of donezk and luhansk , according to communist leader petro simonenko .
he said he suspects that on orders from kiev , " devised reasons " are found to block communist candidates , thus ensuring that yanukovych 's party gets at least 60 percent of the votes .
yanukovych has said his party is so far ahead in the polls and its record so solid that there would be no reason to tamper with the election results .
opposition votes but opinion polls show that yanukovych 's party has lost support since the presidential election at the beginning of this year .
experts at the open society institute put the blame on campaign pledges that have not been fulfilled .
yanukovych had promised to improve transparency and give tax benefits to small company owners .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : petro simonenko is critical of his coalition partner ukrainian voters are also resentful of a drastic increase in the price of gas , which in turn has led to higher prices for staple foods and public transportation .
therefore , opposition parties like tymoshenko 's bloc are expected to gain votes .
according to the open society institute , other parties , such as strong ukraine and front for change , will also benefit from voter dissatisfaction .
voters expect manipulation according to a poll by the democratic initiatives foundation , a ukrainian ngo , almost 50 percent of those interviewed do not think the elections will change anything .
positive change is expected by one third of the interviewees , while four percent expect a drastic change for the worse .
only two percent believe that the candidates are going to fulfil their campaign promises .
still most of the interviewees - three quarters - will go and cast their vote .
but only 8.5 percent believe the election results will not be manipulated .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de drugs -pipe- 30.10.2010 russians join american troops in afghanistan drug raid großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia has criticized us anti-drug efforts in afghanistan russian and us forces raided four drug laboratories in afghanistan in their first joint anti-drug operation .
more than a dent in trafficking , the raid represents growing cooperation between russia and the west . russian and american forces conducted their first joint anti-narcotics raid in afghanistan early on thursday , signaling closer cooperation between the two countries in the battle to control drug cultivation in the war-torn country , the world 's largest producer of opium .
russian anti-drug chief viktor ivanov told a news conference on friday that the raid took place near the pakistani border , and that russian and us forces were supported by helicopters and afghan police .
" four laboratories were found and destroyed - three for heroin and one for morphine , " ivanov said .
" as a result , 932 kilograms -lrb- 2,055 pounds -rrb- of very highly concentrated heroin and 156 kilograms of opium were destroyed . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : afghanistan is the world 's biggest source of opium he added that the street value of the drugs could be up to $ 250 million -lrb- 180 million euros -rrb- .
the us drug enforcement administration released a statement noting the same amount of drugs seized , but said the heroin was worth $ 55.9 million .
eric rubin , deputy chief of mission at the american embassy in moscow , said the operation was a " very big " seizure .
" just in terms of disruption , this was a very important operation , but it was also part of a larger strategy to attack the drug flows , " rubin said at the news conference with ivanov .
shadows of soviet war trafficking from afghanistan has stoked a major heroin problem in russia , and ivanov has criticized the us strategy in its war on afghan drugs , urging more aggressive eradication of poppy crops .
the amount seized in thursday 's raid is unlikely to have a significant effect on the afghan drug trade .
the country produces about 90 percent of the world 's opium , which is used to make heroin .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us funded afghan militias to fight the soviet union but the raid did represent an increase in cooperation between the us and russia , two decades after the us funded afghan militias to chase out soviet occupying forces .
thousands of soviet soldiers were killed in the 10-year war , and going back to afghanistan remains a sensitive issue in russia .
several politicians , including prime minister vladimir putin , have said sending russian troops to join the nato-led mission afghanistan is out of the question .
but the joint us-russian drug raid - along with russia 's willingness to let nato forces fly in and out of afghanistan through russian territory and its offer to sell helicopters to the afghan army - suggests russia 's cooperation with the west on afghanistan is improving .

accusations are already flying about fraud and possible election rigging . just a few days before regional and local elections in ukraine , president viktor yanukovych addressed governors in a tv show in order to make sure they will work to ensure a fair election .
" i will prosecute any attempts to tamper with election results with the utmost severity , " yanukovych said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yanukovych has said he will react swiftly to any election irregularities but yanukovych already had to react to accusations when members of the opposition fatherland party discovered 130,000 allegedly forged ballot papers in a printing house in kharkiv , a city in ukraine 's east .
yanukovych told federal prosecutors to investigate the case .
the ballot papers were a " special reserve " which had to be printed as required by law , said prosecutor yevhen popovych later .
according to the director of the printing house , however , the ballot papers were simply part of a test print .
accusations fly yulia tymoshenko , the head of fatherland , said no one could rule out that fraudulent ballot papers like the ones in kharkiv might turn up in other areas of ukraine as well .
" there is no limit to what these people will do .
they will falsify the vote , you can depend on it , " she said .
several opposition parties have announced that they found tens of thousand of forged ballot papers in two other towns in western ukraine .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tymoshenko says she fears election fraud they also warn about the use of " administrative resources " by yanukovych 's party , called party of the regions , including using state-owned vehicles to increase voter turnout or mobilizing voters , who work in government institutions and businesses .
the communists are also raising concerns over yanukovych , although they are technically in a coalition with his party and a bloc headed by parliamentary leader volodymyr lytvyn .
members of yanukovych 's party could interfere with communist party candidates in the eastern regions of donezk and luhansk , according to communist leader petro simonenko .
he said he suspects that on orders from kiev , " devised reasons " are found to block communist candidates , thus ensuring that yanukovych 's party gets at least 60 percent of the votes .
yanukovych has said his party is so far ahead in the polls and its record so solid that there would be no reason to tamper with the election results .
opposition votes but opinion polls show that yanukovych 's party has lost support since the presidential election at the beginning of this year .
experts at the open society institute put the blame on campaign pledges that have not been fulfilled .
yanukovych had promised to improve transparency and give tax benefits to small company owners .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : petro simonenko is critical of his coalition partner ukrainian voters are also resentful of a drastic increase in the price of gas , which in turn has led to higher prices for staple foods and public transportation .
therefore , opposition parties like tymoshenko 's bloc are expected to gain votes .
according to the open society institute , other parties , such as strong ukraine and front for change , will also benefit from voter dissatisfaction .
voters expect manipulation according to a poll by the democratic initiatives foundation , a ukrainian ngo , almost 50 percent of those interviewed do not think the elections will change anything .
positive change is expected by one third of the interviewees , while four percent expect a drastic change for the worse .
only two percent believe that the candidates are going to fulfil their campaign promises .
still most of the interviewees - three quarters - will go and cast their vote .
but only 8.5 percent believe the election results will not be manipulated .

the communists are also raising concerns over yanukovych , although they are technically in a coalition with his party and a bloc headed by parliamentary leader volodymyr lytvyn .
members of yanukovych 's party could interfere with communist party candidates in the eastern regions of donezk and luhansk , according to communist leader petro simonenko .
he said he suspects that on orders from kiev , " devised reasons " are found to block communist candidates , thus ensuring that yanukovych 's party gets at least 60 percent of the votes .
yanukovych has said his party is so far ahead in the polls and its record so solid that there would be no reason to tamper with the election results .
opposition votes but opinion polls show that yanukovych 's party has lost support since the presidential election at the beginning of this year .
experts at the open society institute put the blame on campaign pledges that have not been fulfilled .
yanukovych had promised to improve transparency and give tax benefits to small company owners .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : petro simonenko is critical of his coalition partner ukrainian voters are also resentful of a drastic increase in the price of gas , which in turn has led to higher prices for staple foods and public transportation .
therefore , opposition parties like tymoshenko 's bloc are expected to gain votes .
according to the open society institute , other parties , such as strong ukraine and front for change , will also benefit from voter dissatisfaction .
voters expect manipulation according to a poll by the democratic initiatives foundation , a ukrainian ngo , almost 50 percent of those interviewed do not think the elections will change anything .
positive change is expected by one third of the interviewees , while four percent expect a drastic change for the worse .
only two percent believe that the candidates are going to fulfil their campaign promises .
still most of the interviewees - three quarters - will go and cast their vote .
but only 8.5 percent believe the election results will not be manipulated .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de drugs -pipe- 30.10.2010 russians join american troops in afghanistan drug raid großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia has criticized us anti-drug efforts in afghanistan russian and us forces raided four drug laboratories in afghanistan in their first joint anti-drug operation .
more than a dent in trafficking , the raid represents growing cooperation between russia and the west . russian and american forces conducted their first joint anti-narcotics raid in afghanistan early on thursday , signaling closer cooperation between the two countries in the battle to control drug cultivation in the war-torn country , the world 's largest producer of opium .
russian anti-drug chief viktor ivanov told a news conference on friday that the raid took place near the pakistani border , and that russian and us forces were supported by helicopters and afghan police .
" four laboratories were found and destroyed - three for heroin and one for morphine , " ivanov said .
" as a result , 932 kilograms -lrb- 2,055 pounds -rrb- of very highly concentrated heroin and 156 kilograms of opium were destroyed . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : afghanistan is the world 's biggest source of opium he added that the street value of the drugs could be up to $ 250 million -lrb- 180 million euros -rrb- .
the us drug enforcement administration released a statement noting the same amount of drugs seized , but said the heroin was worth $ 55.9 million .
eric rubin , deputy chief of mission at the american embassy in moscow , said the operation was a " very big " seizure .
" just in terms of disruption , this was a very important operation , but it was also part of a larger strategy to attack the drug flows , " rubin said at the news conference with ivanov .
shadows of soviet war trafficking from afghanistan has stoked a major heroin problem in russia , and ivanov has criticized the us strategy in its war on afghan drugs , urging more aggressive eradication of poppy crops .
the amount seized in thursday 's raid is unlikely to have a significant effect on the afghan drug trade .
the country produces about 90 percent of the world 's opium , which is used to make heroin .

more than a dent in trafficking , the raid represents growing cooperation between russia and the west . russian and american forces conducted their first joint anti-narcotics raid in afghanistan early on thursday , signaling closer cooperation between the two countries in the battle to control drug cultivation in the war-torn country , the world 's largest producer of opium .
russian anti-drug chief viktor ivanov told a news conference on friday that the raid took place near the pakistani border , and that russian and us forces were supported by helicopters and afghan police .
" four laboratories were found and destroyed - three for heroin and one for morphine , " ivanov said .
" as a result , 932 kilograms -lrb- 2,055 pounds -rrb- of very highly concentrated heroin and 156 kilograms of opium were destroyed . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : afghanistan is the world 's biggest source of opium he added that the street value of the drugs could be up to $ 250 million -lrb- 180 million euros -rrb- .
the us drug enforcement administration released a statement noting the same amount of drugs seized , but said the heroin was worth $ 55.9 million .
eric rubin , deputy chief of mission at the american embassy in moscow , said the operation was a " very big " seizure .
" just in terms of disruption , this was a very important operation , but it was also part of a larger strategy to attack the drug flows , " rubin said at the news conference with ivanov .
shadows of soviet war trafficking from afghanistan has stoked a major heroin problem in russia , and ivanov has criticized the us strategy in its war on afghan drugs , urging more aggressive eradication of poppy crops .
the amount seized in thursday 's raid is unlikely to have a significant effect on the afghan drug trade .

now trade unions want employers to start hiring temp workers for long-term employment . the number of unemployed in germany fell to below 3 million for the first time in 18 years , labor minister ursula von der leyen said this week . michael sommer , head of the german trade union federation -lrb- dgb -rrb- , said he now wants to see germany 's recovery from the global economic crisis translate into improved conditions for german workers . " people have to be able to live from their work , " he said .
" they also have to have a say in their work .
economic bosses ca n't say they want to do things one way then change their tune and start doing things another way .
employers ' and workers ' interests need to be considered . " while german workers grew accustomed to spending their working lives with a single company , current statistics show the situation on the job market has undergone serious changes . temp work on the rise bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : temp workers are regarded as flexible employees the number of people with permanent contracts accompanied by unemployment and other social benefits has fallen while the number of people in recent years while the number of people requiring state aid to round out their pay has increased , according to the dgb . the unions reported that 2.2 million people in germany work for an hourly wage of less than 6 euros and that 1.3 million people receive state subsidies since their pay alone does not keep them above the poverty line .
temp work , which usually comes without benefits , has also increased from 704,000 in june to 1 million in october . " temp workers are a very flexible reserve of workers and , as we saw during the crisis , are the first be fired and are paid much worse than staff doing the same job , " sommer said , adding that the pay gap amounted to 7 euros per hour . german companies were able to avoid widespread layoffs by implementing government subsidies for shortened working hours .
this allowed businesses respond to an upturn in orders without delays associated with having to rehire workers . companies re-evaluate staffing options bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : employers want to make sure everyone is busy but the jobs that were lost may not come back in their pre-recession form as companies re-evaluate their employment policies and may rehire temp workers as needed rather than creating new positions , according to hans-peter kloes of the cologne institute for economic research . " there is a need for flexibility on the part of employers and a need for stability from the employed , " he said .
" the idea has to be to create a form of ' modern employment ' by balancing the sets of interests . " kloes added that germany 's relatively quick recovery from the global crisis relied on temp workers . " we are not dealing with cheap workers or undercutting wages , but with the creation of new alternatives , " he said . trial run bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : metal workers and employers agreed to equal pay for equal work temporary positions , kloes said , represent an opportunity for employers to test the new employees ' skills before hiring them in more permanent positions . " it has to be clear that people coming from unemployment are not going to walk into full-time positions , " he said . about half of the people who took on temp work in 2003 had received permanent positions within five years , according to a study done by the cologne institute . but trade unions do n't see the same benefits for temp workers , saying that many of those who do not receive permanent contracts are in positions for long periods of time without the benefits of long-term employment .
sommer has called on the government to change the laws making this possible . unions and employers agreed in september to pay temporary workers in the steel industry at the same rate as permanent employees , a move sommer said should serve as a model for other sectors as well . " we have to give in to european law and institute equal pay for equal work , " he said . author : sabine kinkartz / sms editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de labor market -pipe- 30.10.2010 unions , employers debate benefits of temp workers großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : finding a permanent job is getting harder in germany the economic crisis seems to have run its course in germany as unemployment falls and businesses predict growth for 2010 and 2011 .
now trade unions want employers to start hiring temp workers for long-term employment . the number of unemployed in germany fell to below 3 million for the first time in 18 years , labor minister ursula von der leyen said this week . michael sommer , head of the german trade union federation -lrb- dgb -rrb- , said he now wants to see germany 's recovery from the global economic crisis translate into improved conditions for german workers . " people have to be able to live from their work , " he said .
" they also have to have a say in their work .
economic bosses ca n't say they want to do things one way then change their tune and start doing things another way .
employers ' and workers ' interests need to be considered . " while german workers grew accustomed to spending their working lives with a single company , current statistics show the situation on the job market has undergone serious changes . temp work on the rise bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : temp workers are regarded as flexible employees the number of people with permanent contracts accompanied by unemployment and other social benefits has fallen while the number of people in recent years while the number of people requiring state aid to round out their pay has increased , according to the dgb . the unions reported that 2.2 million people in germany work for an hourly wage of less than 6 euros and that 1.3 million people receive state subsidies since their pay alone does not keep them above the poverty line .
temp work , which usually comes without benefits , has also increased from 704,000 in june to 1 million in october . " temp workers are a very flexible reserve of workers and , as we saw during the crisis , are the first be fired and are paid much worse than staff doing the same job , " sommer said , adding that the pay gap amounted to 7 euros per hour . german companies were able to avoid widespread layoffs by implementing government subsidies for shortened working hours .
this allowed businesses respond to an upturn in orders without delays associated with having to rehire workers . companies re-evaluate staffing options bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : employers want to make sure everyone is busy but the jobs that were lost may not come back in their pre-recession form as companies re-evaluate their employment policies and may rehire temp workers as needed rather than creating new positions , according to hans-peter kloes of the cologne institute for economic research . " there is a need for flexibility on the part of employers and a need for stability from the employed , " he said .
" the idea has to be to create a form of ' modern employment ' by balancing the sets of interests . " kloes added that germany 's relatively quick recovery from the global crisis relied on temp workers . " we are not dealing with cheap workers or undercutting wages , but with the creation of new alternatives , " he said . trial run bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : metal workers and employers agreed to equal pay for equal work temporary positions , kloes said , represent an opportunity for employers to test the new employees ' skills before hiring them in more permanent positions . " it has to be clear that people coming from unemployment are not going to walk into full-time positions , " he said . about half of the people who took on temp work in 2003 had received permanent positions within five years , according to a study done by the cologne institute . but trade unions do n't see the same benefits for temp workers , saying that many of those who do not receive permanent contracts are in positions for long periods of time without the benefits of long-term employment .
sommer has called on the government to change the laws making this possible . unions and employers agreed in september to pay temporary workers in the steel industry at the same rate as permanent employees , a move sommer said should serve as a model for other sectors as well . " we have to give in to european law and institute equal pay for equal work , " he said . author : sabine kinkartz / sms editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de human rights -pipe- 30.10.2010 un resolutions support women , but fail to change winds of war großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in places like congo , women coninue to be victimized by war - despite resolutions ten years ago , the un passed a resolution underscoring the role of women in promoting peace and security .
yet despite the passage of three similar agreements since then , men still hold most of the influence . following the passage of the groundbreaking resolution 1325 on oct .
31 , 2000 , the united nations women 's fund unifem appointed two women – elisabeth rehn , the former finnish minister of defence , and ellen johnson-sirleaf , who is now president of liberia – to conduct an independent , expert assessment on " women , war and peace . "
their findings confirmed the central idea at the heart of the resolution : " without women 's representation – without half the population – no country can truly claim to be engaged in democratic development and participatory governance . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hillary clinton pushed through new resolutions - to little avail resolution 1325 was the first to address war 's consequences for women , as well as the female role in preventing conflict and securing and building peace .
the security council unanimously adopted the resolution a decade ago , marking a turning point in the history of international rights for women .
the document called on all un member states to develop national action plans to help incorporate women into strategies for security and peace-building .
a female voice in peace talks the resolution ensures that women around the world are entitled to a role in peace negotiations .
but in many cases , their voices have yet to be heard by parties engaged in conflict .
according to un statistics , only 7.5 percent of negotiators participating in 22 peace processes since 1992 were female .
in 14 talks , only three percent of the signatories to peace deals were women .
despite those figures , the un security council has continued to stand up for women in conflict zones .
on june 19 , 2008 , resolution 1820 stated that rape and other forms of sexual violence could constitute war crimes and crimes against humanity , as well as a constitutive act with respect to genocide .
the resolution was coupled with calls for a " zero-tolerance policy " on sexual abuse by un staff engaged in peacekeeping and peace-building missions .
sexual violence on the rise but just a year later , a number of non-governmental organizations noted an increase in sex-related violence in countries like the democratic republic of congo , sudan , chad and the central african republic .
only rarely were the perpetrators held accountable for their crimes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the number of women civilians - if not troops - has risen in peacekeeping ranks the fact that 30 percent of civilian personnel for un peacekeeping missions are women can be seen as a breakthrough – and a by-product of both resolutions .
out of 27 peacekeeping operations , five are led by women – a huge success over previous years .
yet women today make up less than three percent of the military .
backed by us secretary of state hillary clinton , in the fall of 2009 , the un security council once again passed two resolutions , 1888 and 1889 .
they did n't strike off in any new directions , but they were more concrete than their predecessors .
as a result of the resolutions , ex-eu commissioner margot wallstroem , from sweden , was named special representative on sexual violence in conflict , a post that aims to fight violence against girls and women .
but it seems that overall the key strategy has been a disaster .
only 19 states have developed and passed a national action plan to enact resolution 1325 .
most countries do n't have the money push it through .
more analysis , more money , legal action speaking about the strategy recently , un secretary general ban ki-moon said , " we have made too little progress . "
looking at the horrible violence against women in congo , where more than 250,000 women have been raped in the past decade , ban said it was clear the international community was still failing to protect the people who are the most vulnerable .
according to the un security council , more steps are needed to make progress at last when it comes to women , peace and security .
these include more financial support for national action plans , systematic information delivery , an analysis of the topic of women in conflicts , and prosecution of those who breach the human rights of women - or who order their rights to be breached in war .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de labor market -pipe- 30.10.2010 unions , employers debate benefits of temp workers großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : finding a permanent job is getting harder in germany the economic crisis seems to have run its course in germany as unemployment falls and businesses predict growth for 2010 and 2011 .
now trade unions want employers to start hiring temp workers for long-term employment . the number of unemployed in germany fell to below 3 million for the first time in 18 years , labor minister ursula von der leyen said this week . michael sommer , head of the german trade union federation -lrb- dgb -rrb- , said he now wants to see germany 's recovery from the global economic crisis translate into improved conditions for german workers . " people have to be able to live from their work , " he said .
" they also have to have a say in their work .
economic bosses ca n't say they want to do things one way then change their tune and start doing things another way .
employers ' and workers ' interests need to be considered . " while german workers grew accustomed to spending their working lives with a single company , current statistics show the situation on the job market has undergone serious changes . temp work on the rise bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : temp workers are regarded as flexible employees the number of people with permanent contracts accompanied by unemployment and other social benefits has fallen while the number of people in recent years while the number of people requiring state aid to round out their pay has increased , according to the dgb . the unions reported that 2.2 million people in germany work for an hourly wage of less than 6 euros and that 1.3 million people receive state subsidies since their pay alone does not keep them above the poverty line .
temp work , which usually comes without benefits , has also increased from 704,000 in june to 1 million in october . " temp workers are a very flexible reserve of workers and , as we saw during the crisis , are the first be fired and are paid much worse than staff doing the same job , " sommer said , adding that the pay gap amounted to 7 euros per hour . german companies were able to avoid widespread layoffs by implementing government subsidies for shortened working hours .
this allowed businesses respond to an upturn in orders without delays associated with having to rehire workers . companies re-evaluate staffing options bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : employers want to make sure everyone is busy but the jobs that were lost may not come back in their pre-recession form as companies re-evaluate their employment policies and may rehire temp workers as needed rather than creating new positions , according to hans-peter kloes of the cologne institute for economic research . " there is a need for flexibility on the part of employers and a need for stability from the employed , " he said .
" the idea has to be to create a form of ' modern employment ' by balancing the sets of interests . " kloes added that germany 's relatively quick recovery from the global crisis relied on temp workers . " we are not dealing with cheap workers or undercutting wages , but with the creation of new alternatives , " he said . trial run bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : metal workers and employers agreed to equal pay for equal work temporary positions , kloes said , represent an opportunity for employers to test the new employees ' skills before hiring them in more permanent positions . " it has to be clear that people coming from unemployment are not going to walk into full-time positions , " he said . about half of the people who took on temp work in 2003 had received permanent positions within five years , according to a study done by the cologne institute . but trade unions do n't see the same benefits for temp workers , saying that many of those who do not receive permanent contracts are in positions for long periods of time without the benefits of long-term employment .
sommer has called on the government to change the laws making this possible . unions and employers agreed in september to pay temporary workers in the steel industry at the same rate as permanent employees , a move sommer said should serve as a model for other sectors as well . " we have to give in to european law and institute equal pay for equal work , " he said . author : sabine kinkartz / sms editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the 67-year-old musician founded the west-eastern divan orchestra , made up of young jewish and arab musicians , in 1999 .
he shares the prize , worth 50,000 euros -lrb- $ 70,000 -rrb- with the members of the orchestra .
at the ceremony in the western german town of muenster on saturday , barenboim said the conflict between israelis and palestinians was no ordinary one .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barenboim founded the arab-israeli west-eastern divan orchestra " it 's not a military or a political conflict , but a human conflict , a conflict between two peoples , " he said .
building bridges and moving on german foreign minister guido westerwelle on saturday honored barenboim as a " peace activist in the best sense of the word . "
" often , it 's ordinary people like barenboim , whose activism builds bridges and sets the foundations for peace , " he said .
barenboim is also known in germany for promoting german composer richard wagner 's work , saying wagner ’ s work had nothing to do with the holocaust .
two weeks ago , at a symposium held by the berlin state opera ahead of the premiere of german composer richard wagner 's work , " das rheingold " , which barenboim will conduct , the musician said it was time to move on from the long-standing taboo of boycotting wagner 's work in countries like israel .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : westerwelle honored barenboim as an " activist in the best sense " " i do not believe that one can connect wagner with the final solution , " he said .
wagner , who created the opera cycle " the ring of the niebelungen " and other central works of the german canon , has long been stigmatized because of anti-semitic attitudes , and the fact that he was hitler 's favorite composer .
barenboim was born in buenos aires , argentina , on november 15 , 1942 to russian-born jewish parents .
he and his family moved to israel in 1952 .
the westphalia peace prize was last awarded in 2008 to former un secretary general kofi annan , and in earlier years to conductor kurt masur .
the prize is named after the peace of westphalia treaty from 1648 , which ended the thirty years ' war in the holy roman empire .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de war crimes -pipe- 30.10.2010 serbia multiplies reward for indicted war criminal mladic großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ratko mladic has been hiding since 1995 serbia has greatly increased the reward for information leading to the arrest of indicted war criminal ratko mladic .
arresting mladic is a crucial condition for serbia 's bid to join the european union . serbia increased the reward for information leading to the arrest of ratko mladic tenfold to 10 million euros -lrb- $ 13.7 million -rrb- , apparently to prove belgrade 's political will to capture the indicted war criminal .
the decision , announced on thursday , " represents serbia 's clear political will to remove the last remaining obstacle on its path towards the european union , " deputy war crimes prosecutor bruno vekaric told beta news agency .
the reward for wartime croation serb rebel leader goran hadzic was also raised to 500,000 euros .
both mladic and hadzic are believed to be hiding in serbia .
" these two men have kept the whole nation hostage , -lrb- but -rrb- also their families and future generations , " vekaric said experts are skeptical bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the srebrenica massacre was europe 's worst since world war ii ratko mladic was the bosnian serb army commander and is accused by the un of being responsible for the srebrenica massacre of 8,000 muslim men and boys , the worst single atrocity on european soil since world war ii .
he is also charged for masterminding the 1992-1995 siege of sarajevo , which killed 10,000 people .
mladic has been on the run for 15 years .
in may , his family tried to declare him dead , claiming that he had been in poor health and that they had had no contact with him for more than five years .
despite serbia 's intentions , raising the reward will likely have no affect mladic 's arrest , serbian security expert ljubodrag stojadinovic told deutsche welle .
it is not a question of gratification , but rather the government 's lack of control of the secret service who would be in charge of arresting mladic , he said .
according to dragan popovic , director of the center of applied politics in belgrade , serbia simply tries to send out a positive message to the international community in order to make them believe the government is actively going after mladic .

now trade unions want employers to start hiring temp workers for long-term employment . the number of unemployed in germany fell to below 3 million for the first time in 18 years , labor minister ursula von der leyen said this week . michael sommer , head of the german trade union federation -lrb- dgb -rrb- , said he now wants to see germany 's recovery from the global economic crisis translate into improved conditions for german workers . " people have to be able to live from their work , " he said .
" they also have to have a say in their work .
economic bosses ca n't say they want to do things one way then change their tune and start doing things another way .
employers ' and workers ' interests need to be considered . " while german workers grew accustomed to spending their working lives with a single company , current statistics show the situation on the job market has undergone serious changes . temp work on the rise bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : temp workers are regarded as flexible employees the number of people with permanent contracts accompanied by unemployment and other social benefits has fallen while the number of people in recent years while the number of people requiring state aid to round out their pay has increased , according to the dgb . the unions reported that 2.2 million people in germany work for an hourly wage of less than 6 euros and that 1.3 million people receive state subsidies since their pay alone does not keep them above the poverty line .
temp work , which usually comes without benefits , has also increased from 704,000 in june to 1 million in october . " temp workers are a very flexible reserve of workers and , as we saw during the crisis , are the first be fired and are paid much worse than staff doing the same job , " sommer said , adding that the pay gap amounted to 7 euros per hour . german companies were able to avoid widespread layoffs by implementing government subsidies for shortened working hours .
this allowed businesses respond to an upturn in orders without delays associated with having to rehire workers . companies re-evaluate staffing options bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : employers want to make sure everyone is busy but the jobs that were lost may not come back in their pre-recession form as companies re-evaluate their employment policies and may rehire temp workers as needed rather than creating new positions , according to hans-peter kloes of the cologne institute for economic research . " there is a need for flexibility on the part of employers and a need for stability from the employed , " he said .
" the idea has to be to create a form of ' modern employment ' by balancing the sets of interests . " kloes added that germany 's relatively quick recovery from the global crisis relied on temp workers . " we are not dealing with cheap workers or undercutting wages , but with the creation of new alternatives , " he said . trial run bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : metal workers and employers agreed to equal pay for equal work temporary positions , kloes said , represent an opportunity for employers to test the new employees ' skills before hiring them in more permanent positions . " it has to be clear that people coming from unemployment are not going to walk into full-time positions , " he said . about half of the people who took on temp work in 2003 had received permanent positions within five years , according to a study done by the cologne institute . but trade unions do n't see the same benefits for temp workers , saying that many of those who do not receive permanent contracts are in positions for long periods of time without the benefits of long-term employment .
sommer has called on the government to change the laws making this possible . unions and employers agreed in september to pay temporary workers in the steel industry at the same rate as permanent employees , a move sommer said should serve as a model for other sectors as well . " we have to give in to european law and institute equal pay for equal work , " he said . author : sabine kinkartz / sms editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

us and uk authorities are investigating the apparent plot to bomb jewish targets in chicago . the us and uk are investigating a terror threat after explosive material was found in packages on two cargo planes headed for the us from yemen on friday . us president barack obama vowed to find the culprits behind the attempted terrorist attack . speaking to reporters at the white house , obama called the two parcels addressed to jewish houses of worship in chicago a " credible terrorist threat , " and said he would spare no effort in investigating their origins . uk home secretary theresa may confirmed on saturday that the device intercepted at east midlands airport and bound for the us was " viable " . " the target may have been an aircraft and had it detonated , the aircraft could have been brought down , " she told reporters after a meeting with the uk government 's emergency committee cobra . one of the packages was found in the uk , the other in dubai .
both were addressed to chicago-area synagogues . yemeni threat police in dubai confirmed that one of the parcels contained " a computer printer whose ink contained explosive material " and that the manner in which the device was prepared bore " the hallmarks of those used by terrorist organizations like al qaeda . " the explosive material was petn , the same chemical used by the nigerian man who attempted to blow up a plane over detroit on christmas day in 2009 . both of the parcels originated in yemen , the base of al qaeda in the arabian peninsula .

he stipulated that he did not yet have all the details behind the incidents . europe reacts german defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg warned that terrorist attacks are a constant threat these days .
" for some it seems abstract , but it 's quite concrete , " he told reuters tv on saturday .

yet despite the passage of three similar agreements since then , men still hold most of the influence . following the passage of the groundbreaking resolution 1325 on oct .
31 , 2000 , the united nations women 's fund unifem appointed two women – elisabeth rehn , the former finnish minister of defence , and ellen johnson-sirleaf , who is now president of liberia – to conduct an independent , expert assessment on " women , war and peace . "
their findings confirmed the central idea at the heart of the resolution : " without women 's representation – without half the population – no country can truly claim to be engaged in democratic development and participatory governance . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hillary clinton pushed through new resolutions - to little avail resolution 1325 was the first to address war 's consequences for women , as well as the female role in preventing conflict and securing and building peace .
the security council unanimously adopted the resolution a decade ago , marking a turning point in the history of international rights for women .
the document called on all un member states to develop national action plans to help incorporate women into strategies for security and peace-building .
a female voice in peace talks the resolution ensures that women around the world are entitled to a role in peace negotiations .
but in many cases , their voices have yet to be heard by parties engaged in conflict .
according to un statistics , only 7.5 percent of negotiators participating in 22 peace processes since 1992 were female .
in 14 talks , only three percent of the signatories to peace deals were women .
despite those figures , the un security council has continued to stand up for women in conflict zones .
on june 19 , 2008 , resolution 1820 stated that rape and other forms of sexual violence could constitute war crimes and crimes against humanity , as well as a constitutive act with respect to genocide .
the resolution was coupled with calls for a " zero-tolerance policy " on sexual abuse by un staff engaged in peacekeeping and peace-building missions .
sexual violence on the rise but just a year later , a number of non-governmental organizations noted an increase in sex-related violence in countries like the democratic republic of congo , sudan , chad and the central african republic .
only rarely were the perpetrators held accountable for their crimes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the number of women civilians - if not troops - has risen in peacekeeping ranks the fact that 30 percent of civilian personnel for un peacekeeping missions are women can be seen as a breakthrough – and a by-product of both resolutions .
out of 27 peacekeeping operations , five are led by women – a huge success over previous years .
yet women today make up less than three percent of the military .
backed by us secretary of state hillary clinton , in the fall of 2009 , the un security council once again passed two resolutions , 1888 and 1889 .
they did n't strike off in any new directions , but they were more concrete than their predecessors .
as a result of the resolutions , ex-eu commissioner margot wallstroem , from sweden , was named special representative on sexual violence in conflict , a post that aims to fight violence against girls and women .
but it seems that overall the key strategy has been a disaster .
only 19 states have developed and passed a national action plan to enact resolution 1325 .
most countries do n't have the money push it through .
more analysis , more money , legal action speaking about the strategy recently , un secretary general ban ki-moon said , " we have made too little progress . "
looking at the horrible violence against women in congo , where more than 250,000 women have been raped in the past decade , ban said it was clear the international community was still failing to protect the people who are the most vulnerable .
according to the un security council , more steps are needed to make progress at last when it comes to women , peace and security .
these include more financial support for national action plans , systematic information delivery , an analysis of the topic of women in conflicts , and prosecution of those who breach the human rights of women - or who order their rights to be breached in war .

according to un statistics , only 7.5 percent of negotiators participating in 22 peace processes since 1992 were female .
in 14 talks , only three percent of the signatories to peace deals were women .
despite those figures , the un security council has continued to stand up for women in conflict zones .
on june 19 , 2008 , resolution 1820 stated that rape and other forms of sexual violence could constitute war crimes and crimes against humanity , as well as a constitutive act with respect to genocide .
the resolution was coupled with calls for a " zero-tolerance policy " on sexual abuse by un staff engaged in peacekeeping and peace-building missions .
sexual violence on the rise but just a year later , a number of non-governmental organizations noted an increase in sex-related violence in countries like the democratic republic of congo , sudan , chad and the central african republic .
only rarely were the perpetrators held accountable for their crimes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the number of women civilians - if not troops - has risen in peacekeeping ranks the fact that 30 percent of civilian personnel for un peacekeeping missions are women can be seen as a breakthrough – and a by-product of both resolutions .
out of 27 peacekeeping operations , five are led by women – a huge success over previous years .
yet women today make up less than three percent of the military .
backed by us secretary of state hillary clinton , in the fall of 2009 , the un security council once again passed two resolutions , 1888 and 1889 .
they did n't strike off in any new directions , but they were more concrete than their predecessors .
as a result of the resolutions , ex-eu commissioner margot wallstroem , from sweden , was named special representative on sexual violence in conflict , a post that aims to fight violence against girls and women .
but it seems that overall the key strategy has been a disaster .
only 19 states have developed and passed a national action plan to enact resolution 1325 .
most countries do n't have the money push it through .
more analysis , more money , legal action speaking about the strategy recently , un secretary general ban ki-moon said , " we have made too little progress . "
looking at the horrible violence against women in congo , where more than 250,000 women have been raped in the past decade , ban said it was clear the international community was still failing to protect the people who are the most vulnerable .
according to the un security council , more steps are needed to make progress at last when it comes to women , peace and security .
these include more financial support for national action plans , systematic information delivery , an analysis of the topic of women in conflicts , and prosecution of those who breach the human rights of women - or who order their rights to be breached in war .

more than a dent in trafficking , the raid represents growing cooperation between russia and the west . russian and american forces conducted their first joint anti-narcotics raid in afghanistan early on thursday , signaling closer cooperation between the two countries in the battle to control drug cultivation in the war-torn country , the world 's largest producer of opium .
russian anti-drug chief viktor ivanov told a news conference on friday that the raid took place near the pakistani border , and that russian and us forces were supported by helicopters and afghan police .
" four laboratories were found and destroyed - three for heroin and one for morphine , " ivanov said .
" as a result , 932 kilograms -lrb- 2,055 pounds -rrb- of very highly concentrated heroin and 156 kilograms of opium were destroyed . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : afghanistan is the world 's biggest source of opium he added that the street value of the drugs could be up to $ 250 million -lrb- 180 million euros -rrb- .
the us drug enforcement administration released a statement noting the same amount of drugs seized , but said the heroin was worth $ 55.9 million .
eric rubin , deputy chief of mission at the american embassy in moscow , said the operation was a " very big " seizure .
" just in terms of disruption , this was a very important operation , but it was also part of a larger strategy to attack the drug flows , " rubin said at the news conference with ivanov .
shadows of soviet war trafficking from afghanistan has stoked a major heroin problem in russia , and ivanov has criticized the us strategy in its war on afghan drugs , urging more aggressive eradication of poppy crops .
the amount seized in thursday 's raid is unlikely to have a significant effect on the afghan drug trade .
the country produces about 90 percent of the world 's opium , which is used to make heroin .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us funded afghan militias to fight the soviet union but the raid did represent an increase in cooperation between the us and russia , two decades after the us funded afghan militias to chase out soviet occupying forces .
thousands of soviet soldiers were killed in the 10-year war , and going back to afghanistan remains a sensitive issue in russia .
several politicians , including prime minister vladimir putin , have said sending russian troops to join the nato-led mission afghanistan is out of the question .
but the joint us-russian drug raid - along with russia 's willingness to let nato forces fly in and out of afghanistan through russian territory and its offer to sell helicopters to the afghan army - suggests russia 's cooperation with the west on afghanistan is improving .

but this is far from the case in afghanistan , where many women are pushing for more participation . marzia is a police officer in uniform , still a rare sight in afghan society , even though the female component of the afghan security forces is important in a muslim society .
if apartments need to be searched , then marzia 's job is to check the women 's bedrooms and closets .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women in afghanistan are still struggling to make their voices heard marzia says there should be more afghan women with jobs , and believes that the political climate is auspicious .
" the freedom of movement has improved for women , " she said .
" women are now allowed to work alongside men .
it does n't matter where or what it is , women should get jobs . "
women as negotiators although afghan society may be changing , women are still a minority in positions of responsibility when it comes to peace negotiations - as they are throughout the world .
it was for this reason that the united nations agreed resolution 1325 10 years ago , a document that demanded that women be given an equal role in conflict resolution in all regional , national and international institutions .
the prominent afghan women 's rights campaigner soraya parlika believes that her country is still a long way from this aim .
she points to president hamid karzai 's newly-founded peace council , of whose 69 members only nine are women .
seven of those nine have been appointed by karzai , which parlika believes limits their independence .
" these women are sitting together with men who only know war , " she said .
" they are not heard and they have no chance to influence the negotiations in any way . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : afghan women live in fear of losing family members golzum seddiqi , director of an initiative for women lawyers in the western town of herat , does not see the women on the peace council in a particularly positive light .
" up until now , they do n't have any plans or strategies for positions in which they have political or social responsibility , " she said .
" they need to get rid of other problems first .
some women with no qualifications have used the opportunity to get important positions through bribes and connections . "
peace starts in the family but herat provincial councillor djamila karimi believes that the lack of qualifications is a minor concern for the women on the peace council .
she thinks women are not taken seriously as peace negotiators simply because afghan women have been locked into a passive role in society that wo n't be changed overnight .
" these are women who constantly live with the fear of losing family members to the war .
i think women can teach their children not to take up weapons in the future , " karimi said .
" a bearded warlord in afghanistan wo n't listen to women 's demands at the end of the war .
but a child listens to its mother . "
according to karimi , many afghan women want nothing more than to see their children go to school to learn how to build a new afghan society , while very few want a political career .
instead , they still concentrate on their responsibilities within the family .

bundesliga leaders mainz take on nearest rivals dortmund sunday after both were beaten in mid-week cup matches . with the bundesliga ’ s designated 800-pound gorilla bayern munich sputtering in mid-table , and other top teams from recent years like wolfsburg , stuttgart , bremen and schalke doing likewise , two teams coached by ambitious young coaches have risen to the challenge and claimed the top spots for themselves .
just two points separate the teams in first and second place , so sunday 's match will determine who will be top dog at the end of match day ten .
both teams come into the game on the back of embarrassing german cup defeats in midweek and nothing will be allowed to cloud the focus as mainz and dortmund look to bounce back and keep their exciting , entertaining and surprising rivalry at the top of the bundesliga on track .
both mainz and dortmund have earned their positions through attacking soccer .
their coaches , both combustible and passionate characters , have fashioned their teams in their own images and are reaping the benefits of molding their players into systems and tactics full of their own belief and confidence .
thomas tuchel at mainz and juergen klopp at dortmund have hugely competitive personalities and their desire to win can be seen in the way that their teams hound and harass the opposition and attack with purpose .
but while points and league position are important in the pursuit of the title , both coaches have also impressed on their players the need to win with style .
dortmund coach adds youth to solid base bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klopp looks to improve on last season 's fifth-place finish klopp , the former mainz boss who coached the team who won the club ’ s first-ever promotion to the top flight in 2004 , has built on his impressive first season in dortmund by spending wisely and investing in the club 's already rich vein of youth .
since klopp has taken over at bvb , shinji kagawa , kevin grosskreutz , sven bender , marcel schmelzer , mario goetze and mats hummels - none older then 22 - have come into the bvb first team and excelled , adding fluidity and danger to the side .
meanwhile nuri sahin , whose career was once thought to have entered a holding pattern after an up-and-down loan spell in holland at feyenoord , has become the rock of dortmund ’ s midfield .
he too is still just 22 .
up front , lucas barrios has been a revelation since joining last season and has cemented his reputation as one of the bundesliga 's most feared marksmen .
after hitting 19 goals in his debut campaign , he ’ s netted four thus far in the new season , and the attention he draws from opposing defenders often opens up ample space for his teammates .
tuchel adds flair and verve to turn mainz into contenders bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tuchel has instilled belief and camaraderie in his team tuchel , meanwhile , has transformed mainz from a mid-table entity into a title-chasing force since taking the reins in 2009 .
he led the team to ninth last season , its best ever bundesliga finish , and has built on that performance by finding his own set of precocious talents .
he snared schalke ’ s lewis holtby on loan and seen him shine , and he ’ s turned the andre schuerrle and adam szalai , once cosseted talents , into linchpins of the side .
both dortmund and mainz have seen the benefits of giving youngsters their chance , a reflection of the current philosophy being promoted at international level in germany .
adhering to the old standard of " if you 're old enough , you 're good enough , " klopp and tuchel have tapped into the desire young players have to succeed and challenge for places and silverware .
the results are there to see in the bundesliga table .
sunday 's clash will always be an emotional one for klopp , the former fan favorite and hero of mainz 's promotion campaign six years ago .
but forced to choose between taking it easy on his old club and going top himself , there will be no room for sentimentality .

now trade unions want employers to start hiring temp workers for long-term employment . the number of unemployed in germany fell to below 3 million for the first time in 18 years , labor minister ursula von der leyen said this week . michael sommer , head of the german trade union federation -lrb- dgb -rrb- , said he now wants to see germany 's recovery from the global economic crisis translate into improved conditions for german workers . " people have to be able to live from their work , " he said .
" they also have to have a say in their work .
economic bosses ca n't say they want to do things one way then change their tune and start doing things another way .
employers ' and workers ' interests need to be considered . " while german workers grew accustomed to spending their working lives with a single company , current statistics show the situation on the job market has undergone serious changes . temp work on the rise bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : temp workers are regarded as flexible employees the number of people with permanent contracts accompanied by unemployment and other social benefits has fallen while the number of people in recent years while the number of people requiring state aid to round out their pay has increased , according to the dgb . the unions reported that 2.2 million people in germany work for an hourly wage of less than 6 euros and that 1.3 million people receive state subsidies since their pay alone does not keep them above the poverty line .
temp work , which usually comes without benefits , has also increased from 704,000 in june to 1 million in october . " temp workers are a very flexible reserve of workers and , as we saw during the crisis , are the first be fired and are paid much worse than staff doing the same job , " sommer said , adding that the pay gap amounted to 7 euros per hour . german companies were able to avoid widespread layoffs by implementing government subsidies for shortened working hours .
this allowed businesses respond to an upturn in orders without delays associated with having to rehire workers . companies re-evaluate staffing options bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : employers want to make sure everyone is busy but the jobs that were lost may not come back in their pre-recession form as companies re-evaluate their employment policies and may rehire temp workers as needed rather than creating new positions , according to hans-peter kloes of the cologne institute for economic research . " there is a need for flexibility on the part of employers and a need for stability from the employed , " he said .
" the idea has to be to create a form of ' modern employment ' by balancing the sets of interests . " kloes added that germany 's relatively quick recovery from the global crisis relied on temp workers . " we are not dealing with cheap workers or undercutting wages , but with the creation of new alternatives , " he said . trial run bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : metal workers and employers agreed to equal pay for equal work temporary positions , kloes said , represent an opportunity for employers to test the new employees ' skills before hiring them in more permanent positions . " it has to be clear that people coming from unemployment are not going to walk into full-time positions , " he said . about half of the people who took on temp work in 2003 had received permanent positions within five years , according to a study done by the cologne institute . but trade unions do n't see the same benefits for temp workers , saying that many of those who do not receive permanent contracts are in positions for long periods of time without the benefits of long-term employment .
sommer has called on the government to change the laws making this possible . unions and employers agreed in september to pay temporary workers in the steel industry at the same rate as permanent employees , a move sommer said should serve as a model for other sectors as well . " we have to give in to european law and institute equal pay for equal work , " he said . author : sabine kinkartz / sms editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

bundesliga leaders mainz take on nearest rivals dortmund sunday after both were beaten in mid-week cup matches . with the bundesliga ’ s designated 800-pound gorilla bayern munich sputtering in mid-table , and other top teams from recent years like wolfsburg , stuttgart , bremen and schalke doing likewise , two teams coached by ambitious young coaches have risen to the challenge and claimed the top spots for themselves .
just two points separate the teams in first and second place , so sunday 's match will determine who will be top dog at the end of match day ten .
both teams come into the game on the back of embarrassing german cup defeats in midweek and nothing will be allowed to cloud the focus as mainz and dortmund look to bounce back and keep their exciting , entertaining and surprising rivalry at the top of the bundesliga on track .
both mainz and dortmund have earned their positions through attacking soccer .
their coaches , both combustible and passionate characters , have fashioned their teams in their own images and are reaping the benefits of molding their players into systems and tactics full of their own belief and confidence .
thomas tuchel at mainz and juergen klopp at dortmund have hugely competitive personalities and their desire to win can be seen in the way that their teams hound and harass the opposition and attack with purpose .
but while points and league position are important in the pursuit of the title , both coaches have also impressed on their players the need to win with style .

since klopp has taken over at bvb , shinji kagawa , kevin grosskreutz , sven bender , marcel schmelzer , mario goetze and mats hummels - none older then 22 - have come into the bvb first team and excelled , adding fluidity and danger to the side .
meanwhile nuri sahin , whose career was once thought to have entered a holding pattern after an up-and-down loan spell in holland at feyenoord , has become the rock of dortmund ’ s midfield .
he too is still just 22 .
up front , lucas barrios has been a revelation since joining last season and has cemented his reputation as one of the bundesliga 's most feared marksmen .

tuchel adds flair and verve to turn mainz into contenders bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tuchel has instilled belief and camaraderie in his team tuchel , meanwhile , has transformed mainz from a mid-table entity into a title-chasing force since taking the reins in 2009 .

adhering to the old standard of " if you 're old enough , you 're good enough , " klopp and tuchel have tapped into the desire young players have to succeed and challenge for places and silverware .
the results are there to see in the bundesliga table .
sunday 's clash will always be an emotional one for klopp , the former fan favorite and hero of mainz 's promotion campaign six years ago .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de afghanistan -pipe- 30.10.2010 women seek a role in afghanistan peace process großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the afghanistan peace council includes only nine women un resolution 1325 calls on women to be given an equal role in peace negotiations in areas of conflict .
but this is far from the case in afghanistan , where many women are pushing for more participation . marzia is a police officer in uniform , still a rare sight in afghan society , even though the female component of the afghan security forces is important in a muslim society .
if apartments need to be searched , then marzia 's job is to check the women 's bedrooms and closets .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women in afghanistan are still struggling to make their voices heard marzia says there should be more afghan women with jobs , and believes that the political climate is auspicious .
" the freedom of movement has improved for women , " she said .
" women are now allowed to work alongside men .
it does n't matter where or what it is , women should get jobs . "
women as negotiators although afghan society may be changing , women are still a minority in positions of responsibility when it comes to peace negotiations - as they are throughout the world .
it was for this reason that the united nations agreed resolution 1325 10 years ago , a document that demanded that women be given an equal role in conflict resolution in all regional , national and international institutions .
the prominent afghan women 's rights campaigner soraya parlika believes that her country is still a long way from this aim .
she points to president hamid karzai 's newly-founded peace council , of whose 69 members only nine are women .
seven of those nine have been appointed by karzai , which parlika believes limits their independence .
" these women are sitting together with men who only know war , " she said .
" they are not heard and they have no chance to influence the negotiations in any way . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : afghan women live in fear of losing family members golzum seddiqi , director of an initiative for women lawyers in the western town of herat , does not see the women on the peace council in a particularly positive light .
" up until now , they do n't have any plans or strategies for positions in which they have political or social responsibility , " she said .
" they need to get rid of other problems first .
some women with no qualifications have used the opportunity to get important positions through bribes and connections . "
peace starts in the family but herat provincial councillor djamila karimi believes that the lack of qualifications is a minor concern for the women on the peace council .
she thinks women are not taken seriously as peace negotiators simply because afghan women have been locked into a passive role in society that wo n't be changed overnight .
" these are women who constantly live with the fear of losing family members to the war .
i think women can teach their children not to take up weapons in the future , " karimi said .
" a bearded warlord in afghanistan wo n't listen to women 's demands at the end of the war .
but a child listens to its mother . "
according to karimi , many afghan women want nothing more than to see their children go to school to learn how to build a new afghan society , while very few want a political career .
instead , they still concentrate on their responsibilities within the family .

but this is far from the case in afghanistan , where many women are pushing for more participation . marzia is a police officer in uniform , still a rare sight in afghan society , even though the female component of the afghan security forces is important in a muslim society .
if apartments need to be searched , then marzia 's job is to check the women 's bedrooms and closets .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women in afghanistan are still struggling to make their voices heard marzia says there should be more afghan women with jobs , and believes that the political climate is auspicious .
" the freedom of movement has improved for women , " she said .
" women are now allowed to work alongside men .
it does n't matter where or what it is , women should get jobs . "
women as negotiators although afghan society may be changing , women are still a minority in positions of responsibility when it comes to peace negotiations - as they are throughout the world .
it was for this reason that the united nations agreed resolution 1325 10 years ago , a document that demanded that women be given an equal role in conflict resolution in all regional , national and international institutions .
the prominent afghan women 's rights campaigner soraya parlika believes that her country is still a long way from this aim .
she points to president hamid karzai 's newly-founded peace council , of whose 69 members only nine are women .
seven of those nine have been appointed by karzai , which parlika believes limits their independence .
" these women are sitting together with men who only know war , " she said .
" they are not heard and they have no chance to influence the negotiations in any way . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : afghan women live in fear of losing family members golzum seddiqi , director of an initiative for women lawyers in the western town of herat , does not see the women on the peace council in a particularly positive light .
" up until now , they do n't have any plans or strategies for positions in which they have political or social responsibility , " she said .
" they need to get rid of other problems first .
some women with no qualifications have used the opportunity to get important positions through bribes and connections . "
peace starts in the family but herat provincial councillor djamila karimi believes that the lack of qualifications is a minor concern for the women on the peace council .
she thinks women are not taken seriously as peace negotiators simply because afghan women have been locked into a passive role in society that wo n't be changed overnight .
" these are women who constantly live with the fear of losing family members to the war .
i think women can teach their children not to take up weapons in the future , " karimi said .
" a bearded warlord in afghanistan wo n't listen to women 's demands at the end of the war .
but a child listens to its mother . "
according to karimi , many afghan women want nothing more than to see their children go to school to learn how to build a new afghan society , while very few want a political career .
instead , they still concentrate on their responsibilities within the family .

bundesliga leaders mainz take on nearest rivals dortmund sunday after both were beaten in mid-week cup matches . with the bundesliga ’ s designated 800-pound gorilla bayern munich sputtering in mid-table , and other top teams from recent years like wolfsburg , stuttgart , bremen and schalke doing likewise , two teams coached by ambitious young coaches have risen to the challenge and claimed the top spots for themselves .
just two points separate the teams in first and second place , so sunday 's match will determine who will be top dog at the end of match day ten .
both teams come into the game on the back of embarrassing german cup defeats in midweek and nothing will be allowed to cloud the focus as mainz and dortmund look to bounce back and keep their exciting , entertaining and surprising rivalry at the top of the bundesliga on track .
both mainz and dortmund have earned their positions through attacking soccer .
their coaches , both combustible and passionate characters , have fashioned their teams in their own images and are reaping the benefits of molding their players into systems and tactics full of their own belief and confidence .
thomas tuchel at mainz and juergen klopp at dortmund have hugely competitive personalities and their desire to win can be seen in the way that their teams hound and harass the opposition and attack with purpose .
but while points and league position are important in the pursuit of the title , both coaches have also impressed on their players the need to win with style .
dortmund coach adds youth to solid base bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klopp looks to improve on last season 's fifth-place finish klopp , the former mainz boss who coached the team who won the club ’ s first-ever promotion to the top flight in 2004 , has built on his impressive first season in dortmund by spending wisely and investing in the club 's already rich vein of youth .
since klopp has taken over at bvb , shinji kagawa , kevin grosskreutz , sven bender , marcel schmelzer , mario goetze and mats hummels - none older then 22 - have come into the bvb first team and excelled , adding fluidity and danger to the side .
meanwhile nuri sahin , whose career was once thought to have entered a holding pattern after an up-and-down loan spell in holland at feyenoord , has become the rock of dortmund ’ s midfield .
he too is still just 22 .
up front , lucas barrios has been a revelation since joining last season and has cemented his reputation as one of the bundesliga 's most feared marksmen .

bundesliga leaders mainz take on nearest rivals dortmund sunday after both were beaten in mid-week cup matches . with the bundesliga ’ s designated 800-pound gorilla bayern munich sputtering in mid-table , and other top teams from recent years like wolfsburg , stuttgart , bremen and schalke doing likewise , two teams coached by ambitious young coaches have risen to the challenge and claimed the top spots for themselves .
just two points separate the teams in first and second place , so sunday 's match will determine who will be top dog at the end of match day ten .
both teams come into the game on the back of embarrassing german cup defeats in midweek and nothing will be allowed to cloud the focus as mainz and dortmund look to bounce back and keep their exciting , entertaining and surprising rivalry at the top of the bundesliga on track .
both mainz and dortmund have earned their positions through attacking soccer .
their coaches , both combustible and passionate characters , have fashioned their teams in their own images and are reaping the benefits of molding their players into systems and tactics full of their own belief and confidence .
thomas tuchel at mainz and juergen klopp at dortmund have hugely competitive personalities and their desire to win can be seen in the way that their teams hound and harass the opposition and attack with purpose .
but while points and league position are important in the pursuit of the title , both coaches have also impressed on their players the need to win with style .
dortmund coach adds youth to solid base bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klopp looks to improve on last season 's fifth-place finish klopp , the former mainz boss who coached the team who won the club ’ s first-ever promotion to the top flight in 2004 , has built on his impressive first season in dortmund by spending wisely and investing in the club 's already rich vein of youth .
since klopp has taken over at bvb , shinji kagawa , kevin grosskreutz , sven bender , marcel schmelzer , mario goetze and mats hummels - none older then 22 - have come into the bvb first team and excelled , adding fluidity and danger to the side .
meanwhile nuri sahin , whose career was once thought to have entered a holding pattern after an up-and-down loan spell in holland at feyenoord , has become the rock of dortmund ’ s midfield .
he too is still just 22 .
up front , lucas barrios has been a revelation since joining last season and has cemented his reputation as one of the bundesliga 's most feared marksmen .
after hitting 19 goals in his debut campaign , he ’ s netted four thus far in the new season , and the attention he draws from opposing defenders often opens up ample space for his teammates .
tuchel adds flair and verve to turn mainz into contenders bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tuchel has instilled belief and camaraderie in his team tuchel , meanwhile , has transformed mainz from a mid-table entity into a title-chasing force since taking the reins in 2009 .
he led the team to ninth last season , its best ever bundesliga finish , and has built on that performance by finding his own set of precocious talents .
he snared schalke ’ s lewis holtby on loan and seen him shine , and he ’ s turned the andre schuerrle and adam szalai , once cosseted talents , into linchpins of the side .
both dortmund and mainz have seen the benefits of giving youngsters their chance , a reflection of the current philosophy being promoted at international level in germany .
adhering to the old standard of " if you 're old enough , you 're good enough , " klopp and tuchel have tapped into the desire young players have to succeed and challenge for places and silverware .
the results are there to see in the bundesliga table .
sunday 's clash will always be an emotional one for klopp , the former fan favorite and hero of mainz 's promotion campaign six years ago .
but forced to choose between taking it easy on his old club and going top himself , there will be no room for sentimentality .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de afghanistan -pipe- 30.10.2010 women seek a role in afghanistan peace process großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the afghanistan peace council includes only nine women un resolution 1325 calls on women to be given an equal role in peace negotiations in areas of conflict .
but this is far from the case in afghanistan , where many women are pushing for more participation . marzia is a police officer in uniform , still a rare sight in afghan society , even though the female component of the afghan security forces is important in a muslim society .
if apartments need to be searched , then marzia 's job is to check the women 's bedrooms and closets .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women in afghanistan are still struggling to make their voices heard marzia says there should be more afghan women with jobs , and believes that the political climate is auspicious .
" the freedom of movement has improved for women , " she said .
" women are now allowed to work alongside men .
it does n't matter where or what it is , women should get jobs . "
women as negotiators although afghan society may be changing , women are still a minority in positions of responsibility when it comes to peace negotiations - as they are throughout the world .
it was for this reason that the united nations agreed resolution 1325 10 years ago , a document that demanded that women be given an equal role in conflict resolution in all regional , national and international institutions .
the prominent afghan women 's rights campaigner soraya parlika believes that her country is still a long way from this aim .
she points to president hamid karzai 's newly-founded peace council , of whose 69 members only nine are women .
seven of those nine have been appointed by karzai , which parlika believes limits their independence .
" these women are sitting together with men who only know war , " she said .
" they are not heard and they have no chance to influence the negotiations in any way . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : afghan women live in fear of losing family members golzum seddiqi , director of an initiative for women lawyers in the western town of herat , does not see the women on the peace council in a particularly positive light .
" up until now , they do n't have any plans or strategies for positions in which they have political or social responsibility , " she said .
" they need to get rid of other problems first .
some women with no qualifications have used the opportunity to get important positions through bribes and connections . "
peace starts in the family but herat provincial councillor djamila karimi believes that the lack of qualifications is a minor concern for the women on the peace council .
she thinks women are not taken seriously as peace negotiators simply because afghan women have been locked into a passive role in society that wo n't be changed overnight .
" these are women who constantly live with the fear of losing family members to the war .
i think women can teach their children not to take up weapons in the future , " karimi said .
" a bearded warlord in afghanistan wo n't listen to women 's demands at the end of the war .
but a child listens to its mother . "
according to karimi , many afghan women want nothing more than to see their children go to school to learn how to build a new afghan society , while very few want a political career .
instead , they still concentrate on their responsibilities within the family .

if apartments need to be searched , then marzia 's job is to check the women 's bedrooms and closets .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women in afghanistan are still struggling to make their voices heard marzia says there should be more afghan women with jobs , and believes that the political climate is auspicious .
" the freedom of movement has improved for women , " she said .
" women are now allowed to work alongside men .
it does n't matter where or what it is , women should get jobs . "
women as negotiators although afghan society may be changing , women are still a minority in positions of responsibility when it comes to peace negotiations - as they are throughout the world .
it was for this reason that the united nations agreed resolution 1325 10 years ago , a document that demanded that women be given an equal role in conflict resolution in all regional , national and international institutions .
the prominent afghan women 's rights campaigner soraya parlika believes that her country is still a long way from this aim .
she points to president hamid karzai 's newly-founded peace council , of whose 69 members only nine are women .
seven of those nine have been appointed by karzai , which parlika believes limits their independence .
" these women are sitting together with men who only know war , " she said .
" they are not heard and they have no chance to influence the negotiations in any way . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : afghan women live in fear of losing family members golzum seddiqi , director of an initiative for women lawyers in the western town of herat , does not see the women on the peace council in a particularly positive light .
" up until now , they do n't have any plans or strategies for positions in which they have political or social responsibility , " she said .
" they need to get rid of other problems first .
some women with no qualifications have used the opportunity to get important positions through bribes and connections . "
peace starts in the family but herat provincial councillor djamila karimi believes that the lack of qualifications is a minor concern for the women on the peace council .
she thinks women are not taken seriously as peace negotiators simply because afghan women have been locked into a passive role in society that wo n't be changed overnight .
" these are women who constantly live with the fear of losing family members to the war .
i think women can teach their children not to take up weapons in the future , " karimi said .
" a bearded warlord in afghanistan wo n't listen to women 's demands at the end of the war .
but a child listens to its mother . "
according to karimi , many afghan women want nothing more than to see their children go to school to learn how to build a new afghan society , while very few want a political career .
instead , they still concentrate on their responsibilities within the family .

bundesliga leaders mainz take on nearest rivals dortmund sunday after both were beaten in mid-week cup matches . with the bundesliga ’ s designated 800-pound gorilla bayern munich sputtering in mid-table , and other top teams from recent years like wolfsburg , stuttgart , bremen and schalke doing likewise , two teams coached by ambitious young coaches have risen to the challenge and claimed the top spots for themselves .
just two points separate the teams in first and second place , so sunday 's match will determine who will be top dog at the end of match day ten .
both teams come into the game on the back of embarrassing german cup defeats in midweek and nothing will be allowed to cloud the focus as mainz and dortmund look to bounce back and keep their exciting , entertaining and surprising rivalry at the top of the bundesliga on track .
both mainz and dortmund have earned their positions through attacking soccer .
their coaches , both combustible and passionate characters , have fashioned their teams in their own images and are reaping the benefits of molding their players into systems and tactics full of their own belief and confidence .
thomas tuchel at mainz and juergen klopp at dortmund have hugely competitive personalities and their desire to win can be seen in the way that their teams hound and harass the opposition and attack with purpose .
but while points and league position are important in the pursuit of the title , both coaches have also impressed on their players the need to win with style .
dortmund coach adds youth to solid base bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klopp looks to improve on last season 's fifth-place finish klopp , the former mainz boss who coached the team who won the club ’ s first-ever promotion to the top flight in 2004 , has built on his impressive first season in dortmund by spending wisely and investing in the club 's already rich vein of youth .
since klopp has taken over at bvb , shinji kagawa , kevin grosskreutz , sven bender , marcel schmelzer , mario goetze and mats hummels - none older then 22 - have come into the bvb first team and excelled , adding fluidity and danger to the side .
meanwhile nuri sahin , whose career was once thought to have entered a holding pattern after an up-and-down loan spell in holland at feyenoord , has become the rock of dortmund ’ s midfield .
he too is still just 22 .
up front , lucas barrios has been a revelation since joining last season and has cemented his reputation as one of the bundesliga 's most feared marksmen .
after hitting 19 goals in his debut campaign , he ’ s netted four thus far in the new season , and the attention he draws from opposing defenders often opens up ample space for his teammates .
tuchel adds flair and verve to turn mainz into contenders bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tuchel has instilled belief and camaraderie in his team tuchel , meanwhile , has transformed mainz from a mid-table entity into a title-chasing force since taking the reins in 2009 .
he led the team to ninth last season , its best ever bundesliga finish , and has built on that performance by finding his own set of precocious talents .
he snared schalke ’ s lewis holtby on loan and seen him shine , and he ’ s turned the andre schuerrle and adam szalai , once cosseted talents , into linchpins of the side .
both dortmund and mainz have seen the benefits of giving youngsters their chance , a reflection of the current philosophy being promoted at international level in germany .
adhering to the old standard of " if you 're old enough , you 're good enough , " klopp and tuchel have tapped into the desire young players have to succeed and challenge for places and silverware .
the results are there to see in the bundesliga table .
sunday 's clash will always be an emotional one for klopp , the former fan favorite and hero of mainz 's promotion campaign six years ago .
but forced to choose between taking it easy on his old club and going top himself , there will be no room for sentimentality .

bundesliga leaders mainz take on nearest rivals dortmund sunday after both were beaten in mid-week cup matches . with the bundesliga ’ s designated 800-pound gorilla bayern munich sputtering in mid-table , and other top teams from recent years like wolfsburg , stuttgart , bremen and schalke doing likewise , two teams coached by ambitious young coaches have risen to the challenge and claimed the top spots for themselves .
just two points separate the teams in first and second place , so sunday 's match will determine who will be top dog at the end of match day ten .
both teams come into the game on the back of embarrassing german cup defeats in midweek and nothing will be allowed to cloud the focus as mainz and dortmund look to bounce back and keep their exciting , entertaining and surprising rivalry at the top of the bundesliga on track .
both mainz and dortmund have earned their positions through attacking soccer .
their coaches , both combustible and passionate characters , have fashioned their teams in their own images and are reaping the benefits of molding their players into systems and tactics full of their own belief and confidence .
thomas tuchel at mainz and juergen klopp at dortmund have hugely competitive personalities and their desire to win can be seen in the way that their teams hound and harass the opposition and attack with purpose .
but while points and league position are important in the pursuit of the title , both coaches have also impressed on their players the need to win with style .
dortmund coach adds youth to solid base bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klopp looks to improve on last season 's fifth-place finish klopp , the former mainz boss who coached the team who won the club ’ s first-ever promotion to the top flight in 2004 , has built on his impressive first season in dortmund by spending wisely and investing in the club 's already rich vein of youth .
since klopp has taken over at bvb , shinji kagawa , kevin grosskreutz , sven bender , marcel schmelzer , mario goetze and mats hummels - none older then 22 - have come into the bvb first team and excelled , adding fluidity and danger to the side .
meanwhile nuri sahin , whose career was once thought to have entered a holding pattern after an up-and-down loan spell in holland at feyenoord , has become the rock of dortmund ’ s midfield .
he too is still just 22 .
up front , lucas barrios has been a revelation since joining last season and has cemented his reputation as one of the bundesliga 's most feared marksmen .
after hitting 19 goals in his debut campaign , he ’ s netted four thus far in the new season , and the attention he draws from opposing defenders often opens up ample space for his teammates .
tuchel adds flair and verve to turn mainz into contenders bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tuchel has instilled belief and camaraderie in his team tuchel , meanwhile , has transformed mainz from a mid-table entity into a title-chasing force since taking the reins in 2009 .
he led the team to ninth last season , its best ever bundesliga finish , and has built on that performance by finding his own set of precocious talents .
he snared schalke ’ s lewis holtby on loan and seen him shine , and he ’ s turned the andre schuerrle and adam szalai , once cosseted talents , into linchpins of the side .
both dortmund and mainz have seen the benefits of giving youngsters their chance , a reflection of the current philosophy being promoted at international level in germany .
adhering to the old standard of " if you 're old enough , you 're good enough , " klopp and tuchel have tapped into the desire young players have to succeed and challenge for places and silverware .
the results are there to see in the bundesliga table .
sunday 's clash will always be an emotional one for klopp , the former fan favorite and hero of mainz 's promotion campaign six years ago .
but forced to choose between taking it easy on his old club and going top himself , there will be no room for sentimentality .

but this is far from the case in afghanistan , where many women are pushing for more participation . marzia is a police officer in uniform , still a rare sight in afghan society , even though the female component of the afghan security forces is important in a muslim society .
if apartments need to be searched , then marzia 's job is to check the women 's bedrooms and closets .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women in afghanistan are still struggling to make their voices heard marzia says there should be more afghan women with jobs , and believes that the political climate is auspicious .
" the freedom of movement has improved for women , " she said .
" women are now allowed to work alongside men .
it does n't matter where or what it is , women should get jobs . "
women as negotiators although afghan society may be changing , women are still a minority in positions of responsibility when it comes to peace negotiations - as they are throughout the world .
it was for this reason that the united nations agreed resolution 1325 10 years ago , a document that demanded that women be given an equal role in conflict resolution in all regional , national and international institutions .
the prominent afghan women 's rights campaigner soraya parlika believes that her country is still a long way from this aim .
she points to president hamid karzai 's newly-founded peace council , of whose 69 members only nine are women .
seven of those nine have been appointed by karzai , which parlika believes limits their independence .
" these women are sitting together with men who only know war , " she said .
" they are not heard and they have no chance to influence the negotiations in any way . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : afghan women live in fear of losing family members golzum seddiqi , director of an initiative for women lawyers in the western town of herat , does not see the women on the peace council in a particularly positive light .
" up until now , they do n't have any plans or strategies for positions in which they have political or social responsibility , " she said .
" they need to get rid of other problems first .
some women with no qualifications have used the opportunity to get important positions through bribes and connections . "
peace starts in the family but herat provincial councillor djamila karimi believes that the lack of qualifications is a minor concern for the women on the peace council .
she thinks women are not taken seriously as peace negotiators simply because afghan women have been locked into a passive role in society that wo n't be changed overnight .
" these are women who constantly live with the fear of losing family members to the war .
i think women can teach their children not to take up weapons in the future , " karimi said .
" a bearded warlord in afghanistan wo n't listen to women 's demands at the end of the war .
but a child listens to its mother . "
according to karimi , many afghan women want nothing more than to see their children go to school to learn how to build a new afghan society , while very few want a political career .
instead , they still concentrate on their responsibilities within the family .
