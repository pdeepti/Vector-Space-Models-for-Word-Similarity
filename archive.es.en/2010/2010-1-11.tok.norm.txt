a report on the website of the french sports daily , l 'equipe , said that the players had decided to ignore the call from togo 's government for the side to return home .
the report quoted alaixys romao , togo 's midfielder , as saying that the unanimous decision to stay and take part in the tournament was taken to honor the dead and wounded .
and also in order to deny the rebels any satisfaction .
the attack by hooded gunmen claimed the lives of togo 's assistant coach and its squad spokesman along with one of the drivers of the convoy .
the togolese backup goalkeeper , kodjovi obilale , reportedly sustained two gunshot wounds in the attack and was flown to south africa for treatment .
he is said to be in a stable condition .
seven others were also injured in the incident on friday , including defender serge akakpo of the romanian team vaslui .
the other injured passengers included two squad doctors and a journalist .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de arts -pipe- 11.01.2010 limit-pushing choreographer christian spuck is in high demand großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : choreographer spuck looks for stories with a lot of emotion choreographer christian spuck is at the top of his game .
in the dance world , he is hailed as being at the vanguard of his generation - and is sought after on both sides of the atlantic . christian spuck is a busy man .
just 40 years old , he is the resident choreographer both in stuttgart and chicago , and he 's in demand at leading ballet companies from montreal to israel .
spuck 's award-winning choreographies blend beauty and sadness , sarcasm and fun , and have opened up dance to new audiences the world over .
on a recent visit to stuttgart , he was adding the final touches to his latest work , " orphee et euridice , " a co-production of the stuttgart ballet with the city 's opera company .
reinventing the classics bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite his success , spuck still has doubts after only six years on stage , spuck ended his own career as a dancer , saying he wanted more from the art form than dancing alone offered him .
" i think that dance , especially if you 're working in a ballet company , is for sure not intellectually stimulating , " he said .
" to be a very good dancer , you have to reflect a lot about dance history and dance technique - but the priority is the very hard , disciplined work in the studio every day .
i wanted to try out things , not follow something that was set . "
he 's done a lot of exploring since his first choreography , a pas de deux called " towards the night , " went straight into the repertoires of the state ballet in stuttgart and the german opera ballet in berlin back in 1996 - a sensation for a debut work .
spuck often draws inspiration for new works from german classic literature , like wedekind 's " lulu , " hoffmann 's " sandman " or buehner 's " leonce and lena . "
but not just any classic will do .
" the story needs excitement , it needs lots of emotions , it needs to tell me something , " he said .
" i should have the feeling it will tell the audience something .
it should be a story that 's not too complicated so that i can adapt it for dance . "
bildunterschrift : spuck 's " orphee et euridice " busy schedule choreographers do n't just compose ballets , they also cast the dancers and train them for their roles .
spuck is particular about the people he chooses to dance the works he creates .
he said he looks for people that he likes and has a connection with , even if they are not the most technically proficient .
" sometimes i choose people who are technically very limited but they have something else i find very fascinating and then i create the part around the dancer , " he explained .
spuck has a tough schedule .
there is the choreography to be written , the studio work with the dancers , and of course , the traveling : chicago , montreal , stuttgart , oslo and berlin are all big on his current itinerary .
all of this is done backstage , without any of the buzz from being in the limelight or the excitement of being onstage .
" it 's actually harder and more nerve-racking to present a choreography than to go on stage myself , because when you dance and perform , you have the situation in your hands , you can manipulate it , " he said .
" but when you create a piece , when the curtain opens , i do n't even have to be there , it 's in the hands of the dancers and the theater - so i 'm just sitting there nervous . "
years in the making bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spuck had to do some reinventing for " leonce and lena " -lrb- here , performed as a play in berlin -rrb- still , being there on opening night is a must for spuck .
sometimes years of steady work - with dancers , technicians , theater administrators , musicians , conductors , and others - go by between a commission and a first night .
for spuck , this time is all a fruitful purgatory until the opening , when critics either celebrate or condemn his work .
there are also times when the audience loves spuck 's work , but he himself has doubts - like with " ulysses , " which he did with the royal ballet of flanders for the edinburgh festival .
" after the first two performances the curtain closed and i thought , ' what have i done ? '
the audience was screaming and they were all really excited but it did n't touch me at all and i thought , ' this is weird , this production . "
despite his claim that he had to " go get drunk in some corner of the theater " because he was so scared he had produced " absolute rubbish " at the premiere of " lulu , " demand for his time and his ideas continues to grow .
" it is painful , " spuck said , " but i think having doubts is important ; otherwise you ca n't step forward . "

heike groos joined up as a doctor but eventually found out that she was also expected to be a soldier , an experience that had long-lasting effects . when heike groos joined the bundeswehr as a doctor more than 20 years ago , she confesses it was just because she was looking for a job .
back in 1987 , when she started working as an emergency medical officer in a germany army hospital , she was still only a doctor .
that changed when she was sent to afghanistan in 2002 .
she became a doctor - and a soldier .
when groos was sent out to afghanistan , she did so without any question and without any concern .
even when it became obvious that she was now both a doctor and a soldier , armed with a weapon to protect her patients if necessary , she knew that this is what service in afghanistan was like .
it was as much part of the job as helping comrades and afghans alike as part of an emergency military ambulance team .
" at the beginning , in 2002 , it was a completely satisfying job , " she says .
" each moment made me think that we were doing something meaningful there .
just being there symbolized to the people that there was peace and that we would ensure that it remained that way , through our medical and humanitarian work there . "
suicide attack changes everything bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heike groos was first on the scene at the bomb blast but the positive feelings did not endure .
the situation changed dramatically with a suicide attack on a bus carrying german soldiers in june 2003 .
six bundeswehr troops were killed and 29 were injured , some seriously .
heike groos was one of the first on the scene ; she bandaged wounds , called for assistance , coordinated the medical efforts , comforted the injured and watched comrades die .
the event and the huge shock changed her and her colleagues ' lives forever .
" after that first suicide attack in june 2003 , we changed and we became deeply , deeply distrustful because we could not at all differentiate between the people , " she says .
" who is taliban and who is not , who is good and who is bad ? that was never clear to me . "
as well as suspicion and caution , heike groos says she felt rage ; rage against the taliban who had carried out the attack , rage against afghanistan , and rage against germany - the country which had sent her there .
she and her comrades also withdrew from the people they were supposed to be helping .
" we withdrew ourselves and wanted nothing do to with anything afghan , " she admits .
" it was because we saw those that we had come to help as those who had attacked us .
this perspective shifted in time , and we recognized that those who were friendly before still were but we were always more cautious after that .
i was never as trusting again . "
disillusionment leads to decision to leave bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : groos decided that her 2007 tour would be her last after the attack , her unit became closer , even more like a family than before .
her younger male comrades looked for comfort and assurance from the older , more experienced heike groos .
but there was no comfort for her .
groos started to see little sense in what she was doing , confined and isolated in the base due to the increasing dangers outside .
she decided that it could not go on .
she returned to afghanistan for the last time in 2007 .
groos says that people could not understand why she went back but she says she wanted to complete her service .
" people looked at me like i was an alien when i walked out of our house in my uniform , " she says .
" i was never at home and people asked my children , ' where is your mother ? ' and they would say ' she is in afghanistan ' . "
when she returned , people would stay out of her way .
her second husband also did n't understand and eventually he and groos divorced .
it was then that she decided that she wanted to leave everything behind and take her children to the other side of the world to start again .
she and three of her five kids moved to new zealand , as far away from afghanistan and germany as possible in order to find peace .
distance does n't end afghanistan trauma bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the horrors of aghanistan have never left heike groos but afghanistan did not release her from its grip .
groos continued to suffer from her experiences , suffering from nightmares and the inability to sleep .
she was also cut off from any kind of support from her previous employer : the bundeswehr .
" i had fulfilled my obligation -lrb- to the bundeswehr -rrb- and i found that very hard , " she says .
" i wish that someone had supported me and had not left me alone , but that did not happen , and i am sad about it .
they pushed me away , sent me to the army physician , to the psychiatrist who said ' you are traumatized . '
and then german people said : ' you were probably not hard enough , soldiers must always be tough . " '
while things were difficult for a long while , in time they also started to get better for heike groos and she began dealing with her experiences in afghanistan and working through her experiences .
the result was her first book , published last year , based on her time there : ' a beautiful day to die ' .

heike groos joined up as a doctor but eventually found out that she was also expected to be a soldier , an experience that had long-lasting effects . when heike groos joined the bundeswehr as a doctor more than 20 years ago , she confesses it was just because she was looking for a job .
back in 1987 , when she started working as an emergency medical officer in a germany army hospital , she was still only a doctor .
that changed when she was sent to afghanistan in 2002 .
she became a doctor - and a soldier .
when groos was sent out to afghanistan , she did so without any question and without any concern .
even when it became obvious that she was now both a doctor and a soldier , armed with a weapon to protect her patients if necessary , she knew that this is what service in afghanistan was like .
it was as much part of the job as helping comrades and afghans alike as part of an emergency military ambulance team .
" at the beginning , in 2002 , it was a completely satisfying job , " she says .
" each moment made me think that we were doing something meaningful there .
just being there symbolized to the people that there was peace and that we would ensure that it remained that way , through our medical and humanitarian work there . "
suicide attack changes everything bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heike groos was first on the scene at the bomb blast but the positive feelings did not endure .
the situation changed dramatically with a suicide attack on a bus carrying german soldiers in june 2003 .
six bundeswehr troops were killed and 29 were injured , some seriously .
heike groos was one of the first on the scene ; she bandaged wounds , called for assistance , coordinated the medical efforts , comforted the injured and watched comrades die .
the event and the huge shock changed her and her colleagues ' lives forever .
" after that first suicide attack in june 2003 , we changed and we became deeply , deeply distrustful because we could not at all differentiate between the people , " she says .
" who is taliban and who is not , who is good and who is bad ? that was never clear to me . "
as well as suspicion and caution , heike groos says she felt rage ; rage against the taliban who had carried out the attack , rage against afghanistan , and rage against germany - the country which had sent her there .
she and her comrades also withdrew from the people they were supposed to be helping .
" we withdrew ourselves and wanted nothing do to with anything afghan , " she admits .
" it was because we saw those that we had come to help as those who had attacked us .
this perspective shifted in time , and we recognized that those who were friendly before still were but we were always more cautious after that .
i was never as trusting again . "
disillusionment leads to decision to leave bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : groos decided that her 2007 tour would be her last after the attack , her unit became closer , even more like a family than before .
her younger male comrades looked for comfort and assurance from the older , more experienced heike groos .
but there was no comfort for her .
groos started to see little sense in what she was doing , confined and isolated in the base due to the increasing dangers outside .
she decided that it could not go on .
she returned to afghanistan for the last time in 2007 .
groos says that people could not understand why she went back but she says she wanted to complete her service .
" people looked at me like i was an alien when i walked out of our house in my uniform , " she says .
" i was never at home and people asked my children , ' where is your mother ? ' and they would say ' she is in afghanistan ' . "
when she returned , people would stay out of her way .
her second husband also did n't understand and eventually he and groos divorced .
it was then that she decided that she wanted to leave everything behind and take her children to the other side of the world to start again .
she and three of her five kids moved to new zealand , as far away from afghanistan and germany as possible in order to find peace .
distance does n't end afghanistan trauma bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the horrors of aghanistan have never left heike groos but afghanistan did not release her from its grip .
groos continued to suffer from her experiences , suffering from nightmares and the inability to sleep .
she was also cut off from any kind of support from her previous employer : the bundeswehr .
" i had fulfilled my obligation -lrb- to the bundeswehr -rrb- and i found that very hard , " she says .
" i wish that someone had supported me and had not left me alone , but that did not happen , and i am sad about it .
they pushed me away , sent me to the army physician , to the psychiatrist who said ' you are traumatized . '
and then german people said : ' you were probably not hard enough , soldiers must always be tough . " '
while things were difficult for a long while , in time they also started to get better for heike groos and she began dealing with her experiences in afghanistan and working through her experiences .
the result was her first book , published last year , based on her time there : ' a beautiful day to die ' .

a surprise pick although ashton has long been regarded as an industry expert , her nomination for the newly-created post of eu foreign affairs minister came as a surprise .
the native of lancashire , england , has served only one year as eu trade commissioner and has no other foreign policy experience .
even in her native britain , ashton is virtually unknown , having never been elected to public office .
her past work experience includes posts in a provincial health authority , as well as positions in a number of government departments , including the education and justice ministries .
in 1999 , the labour government of then-prime minister tony blair awarded ashton the title of “ baroness , ” so that she could represent the party in the house of lords . in 2007 , current prime minister gordon brown appointed her leader of the house of lords .
however , ashton 's big break came in 2008 , when the post of eu trade commissioner became free and ashton became the first woman to hold the office .
hard questions during monday 's confirmation hearing , ashton is expected to have to defend herself against accusations of inadequate diplomatic experience .
also likely to come up during questioning : ashton 's past involvement with britain 's anti-nuclear group , the campaign for nuclear disarmament -lrb- cnd -rrb- .
during the initial round of questioning in november , the nominee for foreign affairs chief was challenged to deny taking funds from the soviet union during her days as treasurer for the cnd over 25 years ago .
all or nothing ashton will be among the first of 26 new appointees to go through the confirmation process in the european parliament . the hearings are scheduled to end on january 19 , with the parliament 's final vote of confidence on the new commission to take place january 26 in brussels .
although parliamentarians can not vote to approve or deny individual appointees , they can vote to reject the commission as a whole .
if approved , the new team is expected to begin its five-year term on february 1. smh / afp / rtre editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

one of those women is stefanie linsener whose time with the bundeswehr has included a four-month tour in afghanistan . stefanie linsener has never met tanja kreil .
but linsener , a soldier in the bundeswehr , is grateful for kreil 's fight for women like her .
in 2000 kreil won an amendment to germany 's constitution from the court of justice of the european union allowing women to take part in bundeswehr 's armed services .
up until that point they had been limited to working in the medical service or the military band .
without tanja kreil , there never would have been bundeswehr soldier stefanie linsener .
one year after the january 11 , 2000 ruling , the 18-year-old linsener joined the bundeswehr and became one of the first women trained to use weapons .
" my father was really proud of me , " she says .
" my mother had some misgivings , but she is also proud of me , of course , that i did it . " diving into an unknown world bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : linsener shows off the different types of uniforms she wears at first linsener had to get used to the drills and the tone her superiors use when speaking to her .
and she found her uniform practical but rather unfashionable " for a woman who pays attention to herself . "
linsener has a well-kept appearance and she wears jewelry when she 's working in her office .
linsener likes to laugh .
but when she , six other women and 60 male recruits had to crawl through the mud and dig out a position with a 30-kilogram -lrb- 66-pound -rrb- pack on her back and a 12-kilogram machine gun , she was n't laughing .
sometimes she wondered what the point of the exercises was , but through them she learned what her mental and physical limits were .
and she found the motivation to keep going .
" i said to myself , ' shut your eyes and get through it .
you 're doing this now , " ' she recounts .
" i think it 's true that women are a little bit more ambitious and have more willpower .
at least i did . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : men and women are treated the same in the bundeswehr , major fischer says major juergen fischer can only confirm linsener 's observations .
it 's been his experience , he said , that the female soldiers inspire the male recruits .
it 's only a matter of time , he says , before a woman is promoted to major or lieutenant colonel .
" women and men are treated equally , including with their salaries , " fischer says .
however , unlike men , women can not be required to participate in the armed services .
thus there is no conscription for female soldiers while german men are still required to serve in the bundeswehr or complete community service .

she knows that it 's a device that can kill but that 's part of being in the army , she says .
another part of being in the army for linsener was a four-month deployment in afghanistan .
she and her fellow soldiers worked 13 to 14 hours a day in afghanistan for four months without a day off .
spending every day armed and in a flak vest and only seeing a country from behind the safety glass in her tank taught linsener to appreciate her life in germany .
female soldiers do find it difficult to gain recognition in a male-dominated country like afghanistan , where women are hardly seen in public , she says .
when she once naively left the camp with her hair loose and uncovered , stones were thrown at her .
" this is like a woman in germany running around naked in the street , " she says she was later told . " helmet , combat boots and camouflage ready to go of those serving in the armed forces , about 17,000 or nine percent are women .
linsener was one those troops for nine years .
now she has another two years of office work responding to press inquiries as fischer 's assistant .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : linsener could be headed back to afghanistan at any moment .

an enlisted soldier like linsener gets two years of paid career training before she leaves the army .

she could be trained to work with the inspection dogs .
though she 's not certain what her next step will be , after what she 's been through , linsener is confident that she 'll be able to rise to the challenge again .

one of those women is stefanie linsener whose time with the bundeswehr has included a four-month tour in afghanistan . stefanie linsener has never met tanja kreil .
but linsener , a soldier in the bundeswehr , is grateful for kreil 's fight for women like her .
in 2000 kreil won an amendment to germany 's constitution from the court of justice of the european union allowing women to take part in bundeswehr 's armed services .
up until that point they had been limited to working in the medical service or the military band .
without tanja kreil , there never would have been bundeswehr soldier stefanie linsener .
one year after the january 11 , 2000 ruling , the 18-year-old linsener joined the bundeswehr and became one of the first women trained to use weapons .
" my father was really proud of me , " she says .
" my mother had some misgivings , but she is also proud of me , of course , that i did it . " diving into an unknown world bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : linsener shows off the different types of uniforms she wears at first linsener had to get used to the drills and the tone her superiors use when speaking to her .
and she found her uniform practical but rather unfashionable " for a woman who pays attention to herself . "
linsener has a well-kept appearance and she wears jewelry when she 's working in her office .
linsener likes to laugh .
but when she , six other women and 60 male recruits had to crawl through the mud and dig out a position with a 30-kilogram -lrb- 66-pound -rrb- pack on her back and a 12-kilogram machine gun , she was n't laughing .
sometimes she wondered what the point of the exercises was , but through them she learned what her mental and physical limits were .
and she found the motivation to keep going .
" i said to myself , ' shut your eyes and get through it .
you 're doing this now , " ' she recounts .
" i think it 's true that women are a little bit more ambitious and have more willpower .
at least i did . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : men and women are treated the same in the bundeswehr , major fischer says major juergen fischer can only confirm linsener 's observations .
it 's been his experience , he said , that the female soldiers inspire the male recruits .
it 's only a matter of time , he says , before a woman is promoted to major or lieutenant colonel .
" women and men are treated equally , including with their salaries , " fischer says .
however , unlike men , women can not be required to participate in the armed services .
thus there is no conscription for female soldiers while german men are still required to serve in the bundeswehr or complete community service .
deployment a part of the job linsener can assemble her gun while blindfolded .
she knows that it 's a device that can kill but that 's part of being in the army , she says .
another part of being in the army for linsener was a four-month deployment in afghanistan .
she and her fellow soldiers worked 13 to 14 hours a day in afghanistan for four months without a day off .
spending every day armed and in a flak vest and only seeing a country from behind the safety glass in her tank taught linsener to appreciate her life in germany .
female soldiers do find it difficult to gain recognition in a male-dominated country like afghanistan , where women are hardly seen in public , she says .
when she once naively left the camp with her hair loose and uncovered , stones were thrown at her .
" this is like a woman in germany running around naked in the street , " she says she was later told . " helmet , combat boots and camouflage ready to go of those serving in the armed forces , about 17,000 or nine percent are women .
linsener was one those troops for nine years .
now she has another two years of office work responding to press inquiries as fischer 's assistant .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : linsener could be headed back to afghanistan at any moment .
her deployment uniform is in her office locker , ready to go .
an enlisted soldier like linsener gets two years of paid career training before she leaves the army .
studying media design interests her , though a switch to the customs authorities seems like a good move too .
she could be trained to work with the inspection dogs .
though she 's not certain what her next step will be , after what she 's been through , linsener is confident that she 'll be able to rise to the challenge again .

gunmen attacked their team bus on friday killing three people . angolan president jose eduardo dos santos denounced the attack by separatist rebels in the northern enclave of cabinda , as the africa cup of nations kicked off in angola on sunday .
" we condemn this act of terror , but the competition will continue in cabinda , " dos santos said as he opened the tournament in the capital , luanda .
his government and african football officials had earlier pleaded with the togolese authorities to allow the players to fulfill their wish to compete in the tournament to honour their slain colleagues .
" it 's very sad .
it 's hard for africa and for us .
these things are part of life , you have to accept it , " togo captain emmanuel adebayor , who plays his club football for manchester city , told the afp news agency at the airport in cabinda .
sad homecoming the team later arrived on a government plane in the togolese capital lome , where it was met at the airport by prime minister gilbert fossoun houngbo , members of the government and sports officials , an afp correspondent reported .
the attack by hooded gunmen claimed the lives of togo 's assistant coach and the team 's press officer along with one of the drivers of the convoy .

the attack lasted some 20 minutes .
responsibility for the assault has been claimed by the separatist group front for the liberation of the enclave of cabinda -lrb- flec -rrb- .
the angolan minister in charge of affairs in cabinda , antonio bento bembe , said that the attack was " an act of terrorism . "
the oil-producing region of cabinda has been the site of a decades-long struggle for independence by the separatist group flec .

his post will be filled by trade and industry minister arlene foster . robinson agreed to the move on monday so that the scandal surrounding his wife 's affair could be settled .
calls for robinson 's resignation escalated over the weekend , as several key politicians feared his wife 's scandal could cause the region 's power-sharing executive to collapse .
robinson 's wife iris , who is also a top politician , admitted to having an affair with a 19-year-old man last week .
she also said she helped to raise 50,000 pounds -lrb- 55,600 euros -rrb- from two wealthy developers for him so he could set up his own café .
iris robinson is expected to leave her seats in the northern ireland assembly and the british house of commons shortly .
she is also receiving psychiatric treatment in belfast , as she has previously admitted to attempting suicide and suffering severe depression .
peter robinson has maintained that he had absolutely no knowledge of his wife 's affair or the financial deal between her and the 19-year-old .
bad timing the robinson scandal has come in the midst of a power-sharing struggle between the protestant democratic unionist party -lrb- dup -rrb- and the catholic sinn fein .
the former foes are finding it hard to hold their alliance together , as both sides have failed to agree on whether policing powers should be transferred from london to belfast .

his post will be filled by trade and industry minister arlene foster . robinson agreed to the move on monday so that the scandal surrounding his wife 's affair could be settled .
calls for robinson 's resignation escalated over the weekend , as several key politicians feared his wife 's scandal could cause the region 's power-sharing executive to collapse .
robinson 's wife iris , who is also a top politician , admitted to having an affair with a 19-year-old man last week .
she also said she helped to raise 50,000 pounds -lrb- 55,600 euros -rrb- from two wealthy developers for him so he could set up his own café .
iris robinson is expected to leave her seats in the northern ireland assembly and the british house of commons shortly .
she is also receiving psychiatric treatment in belfast , as she has previously admitted to attempting suicide and suffering severe depression .
peter robinson has maintained that he had absolutely no knowledge of his wife 's affair or the financial deal between her and the 19-year-old .
bad timing the robinson scandal has come in the midst of a power-sharing struggle between the protestant democratic unionist party -lrb- dup -rrb- and the catholic sinn fein .
the former foes are finding it hard to hold their alliance together , as both sides have failed to agree on whether policing powers should be transferred from london to belfast .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de auto industry -pipe- 11.01.2010 vw announces big expansion plans for us market großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : volkswagen wants to reposition itself in the united states despite years of weak performance in the us market , volkswagen announced it aims to double the number of cars it sells in the us by 2012 or 2013 .
vw wants its cars to escape their niche status and hit the mass market . just prior to the opening of the annual detroit auto show on monday , german carmaker volkswagen announced it plans for ramping up its presence in the united states , aiming to win over american consumers and sell twice the number of cars it does now in three to four years ' time .
" we will sell 400,000 to 450,000 vehicles in 2012/13 , " said stefan jacoby , head of volkswagen of america , on sunday , adding that the company 's us business could become profitable by 2013 . volkswagen , europe 's largest carmaker , has had a hard time finding its footing in the all-important us market .
its presence in china and brazil is strong and sales in germany have been helped by a government program last year that encouraged drivers to trade in old gas guzzlers for more for efficient cars .
in europe , vw has 21 percent of the market .
but vw market share in the us , including its audi brand , is only three percent .
part of the reason for that , according to analysts , has to do with the generally dismal state of the car industry in the wake of global recession .
although , vw 's small market share actually gave it a bit of a foot up since it was not as hard hit by the collapse of american auto sales as some of its rivals were .
american preferences bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vw has been trying to figure out how to fit the pieces together for the us market vw 's lackluster performance can also be traced back to its product line , which was not ideally suited to americans ' taste in cars .
" volkswagen was neither a premium brand like mercedes , nor a mass-market brand , " said marc tonn , a senior analyst at m.m. warburg .
" the company was kind of stuck in the middle . "
the wolfsburg-based concern focused on smaller or mid-size cars with highly advanced technological features when americans were more interested in buying larger vehicles , such as suvs or pick-up trucks .
" i think the focus will now be on maintaining german quality , but going a little in the direction of us size , " tonn added .
nevertheless , vw will not likely be turning out tank-like vehicles any time soon .
jacoby said he expects the market for compact and mid-sized sedans to increase faster than other segments , especially if oil prices convince more americans to downsize from their chevy tahoes and ford explorers .
" with higher oil prices , the us consumer is perhaps going to look a little more closely at smaller cars , " said christian breitsprecher , an auto analyst at sol oppenheim . from the niche to the masses volkswagen , which ranks behind brands like hyundai , honda , mercedes and bmw in the us , wants to emerge from its position as a niche carmaker to a mass-market product , one that can compete with extremely popular makes , such as toyota 's camry .
while the beetle quickly became a cult classic in the us and enjoyed great popularity in the 1960s and early 1970s , vw was never able to imitate its success with subsequent makes , such as its rabbit .
the company closed its last us plant in 1988 in pennsylvania amid sluggish sales .
" the rabbit was a flop and vw never really was able to get back in the mass market after that , " said breitsprecher , who added that volkswagen cars remained niche products .
" i mean , who bought a jetta ?
mostly college kids who could n't afford bmws . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : volkswagen beetle - a hit in america but vw wants a follow-up success becoming a mass-market car in the us is essential to vw 's ambitious expansion plans for the coming years , which include surpassing main rival toyota , the world 's largest automaker by sales volume .
new investments volkswagen is building a new plant in chattanooga , tennessee , investing up to $ 1 billion -lrb- 694 million euros -rrb- in a facility that , according to us head jacoby , " will enable the turnaround of vw 's us operations " and should create around 2,000 jobs .
increasing production and purchasing in the dollar zone is crucial to vw 's return to profitability as it would lower the company 's exposure to a dollar that is weak compared to the euro .
the carmaker is also spending $ 125 million on two new dealerships in new york city , which will begin sales in 2010 .
they are part of the company 's strategy to increase its presence and visibility in the us .
jacoby said he thinks the worst of the automobile sector 's woes to be behind them , with american car sales likely to be 11 million to 11.5 million in 2010 .
because of a stabilization of the labor and real-estate markets , " we are a little bit more optimistic now than we were a few months ago , " he said on sunday .
he added that he expects the us car sales to stabilize at around 15 million over the medium term , and vw 's longer-term us plans include selling 800,000 vehicles a year by 2018 .
" the us is a critical component of vw 's long-term strategy , " said analyst tonn .
" despite all the euphoria about emerging markets these days , if you want to be a global player you have to do well in america . "

vw wants its cars to escape their niche status and hit the mass market . just prior to the opening of the annual detroit auto show on monday , german carmaker volkswagen announced it plans for ramping up its presence in the united states , aiming to win over american consumers and sell twice the number of cars it does now in three to four years ' time .
" we will sell 400,000 to 450,000 vehicles in 2012/13 , " said stefan jacoby , head of volkswagen of america , on sunday , adding that the company 's us business could become profitable by 2013 . volkswagen , europe 's largest carmaker , has had a hard time finding its footing in the all-important us market .
its presence in china and brazil is strong and sales in germany have been helped by a government program last year that encouraged drivers to trade in old gas guzzlers for more for efficient cars .
in europe , vw has 21 percent of the market .
but vw market share in the us , including its audi brand , is only three percent .
part of the reason for that , according to analysts , has to do with the generally dismal state of the car industry in the wake of global recession .
although , vw 's small market share actually gave it a bit of a foot up since it was not as hard hit by the collapse of american auto sales as some of its rivals were .
american preferences bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vw has been trying to figure out how to fit the pieces together for the us market vw 's lackluster performance can also be traced back to its product line , which was not ideally suited to americans ' taste in cars .
" volkswagen was neither a premium brand like mercedes , nor a mass-market brand , " said marc tonn , a senior analyst at m.m. warburg .
" the company was kind of stuck in the middle . "
the wolfsburg-based concern focused on smaller or mid-size cars with highly advanced technological features when americans were more interested in buying larger vehicles , such as suvs or pick-up trucks .
" i think the focus will now be on maintaining german quality , but going a little in the direction of us size , " tonn added .
nevertheless , vw will not likely be turning out tank-like vehicles any time soon .
jacoby said he expects the market for compact and mid-sized sedans to increase faster than other segments , especially if oil prices convince more americans to downsize from their chevy tahoes and ford explorers .
" with higher oil prices , the us consumer is perhaps going to look a little more closely at smaller cars , " said christian breitsprecher , an auto analyst at sol oppenheim . from the niche to the masses volkswagen , which ranks behind brands like hyundai , honda , mercedes and bmw in the us , wants to emerge from its position as a niche carmaker to a mass-market product , one that can compete with extremely popular makes , such as toyota 's camry .
while the beetle quickly became a cult classic in the us and enjoyed great popularity in the 1960s and early 1970s , vw was never able to imitate its success with subsequent makes , such as its rabbit .
the company closed its last us plant in 1988 in pennsylvania amid sluggish sales .
" the rabbit was a flop and vw never really was able to get back in the mass market after that , " said breitsprecher , who added that volkswagen cars remained niche products .
" i mean , who bought a jetta ?

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : volkswagen beetle - a hit in america but vw wants a follow-up success becoming a mass-market car in the us is essential to vw 's ambitious expansion plans for the coming years , which include surpassing main rival toyota , the world 's largest automaker by sales volume .
new investments volkswagen is building a new plant in chattanooga , tennessee , investing up to $ 1 billion -lrb- 694 million euros -rrb- in a facility that , according to us head jacoby , " will enable the turnaround of vw 's us operations " and should create around 2,000 jobs .
increasing production and purchasing in the dollar zone is crucial to vw 's return to profitability as it would lower the company 's exposure to a dollar that is weak compared to the euro .
the carmaker is also spending $ 125 million on two new dealerships in new york city , which will begin sales in 2010 .
they are part of the company 's strategy to increase its presence and visibility in the us .
jacoby said he thinks the worst of the automobile sector 's woes to be behind them , with american car sales likely to be 11 million to 11.5 million in 2010 .
because of a stabilization of the labor and real-estate markets , " we are a little bit more optimistic now than we were a few months ago , " he said on sunday .
he added that he expects the us car sales to stabilize at around 15 million over the medium term , and vw 's longer-term us plans include selling 800,000 vehicles a year by 2018 .
" the us is a critical component of vw 's long-term strategy , " said analyst tonn .
" despite all the euphoria about emerging markets these days , if you want to be a global player you have to do well in america . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de arts -pipe- 11.01.2010 limit-pushing choreographer christian spuck is in high demand großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : choreographer spuck looks for stories with a lot of emotion choreographer christian spuck is at the top of his game .
in the dance world , he is hailed as being at the vanguard of his generation - and is sought after on both sides of the atlantic . christian spuck is a busy man .
just 40 years old , he is the resident choreographer both in stuttgart and chicago , and he 's in demand at leading ballet companies from montreal to israel .
spuck 's award-winning choreographies blend beauty and sadness , sarcasm and fun , and have opened up dance to new audiences the world over .
on a recent visit to stuttgart , he was adding the final touches to his latest work , " orphee et euridice , " a co-production of the stuttgart ballet with the city 's opera company .
reinventing the classics bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite his success , spuck still has doubts after only six years on stage , spuck ended his own career as a dancer , saying he wanted more from the art form than dancing alone offered him .
" i think that dance , especially if you 're working in a ballet company , is for sure not intellectually stimulating , " he said .
" to be a very good dancer , you have to reflect a lot about dance history and dance technique - but the priority is the very hard , disciplined work in the studio every day .
i wanted to try out things , not follow something that was set . "
he 's done a lot of exploring since his first choreography , a pas de deux called " towards the night , " went straight into the repertoires of the state ballet in stuttgart and the german opera ballet in berlin back in 1996 - a sensation for a debut work .
spuck often draws inspiration for new works from german classic literature , like wedekind 's " lulu , " hoffmann 's " sandman " or buehner 's " leonce and lena . "
but not just any classic will do .
" the story needs excitement , it needs lots of emotions , it needs to tell me something , " he said .
" i should have the feeling it will tell the audience something .
it should be a story that 's not too complicated so that i can adapt it for dance . "
bildunterschrift : spuck 's " orphee et euridice " busy schedule choreographers do n't just compose ballets , they also cast the dancers and train them for their roles .
spuck is particular about the people he chooses to dance the works he creates .
he said he looks for people that he likes and has a connection with , even if they are not the most technically proficient .
" sometimes i choose people who are technically very limited but they have something else i find very fascinating and then i create the part around the dancer , " he explained .
spuck has a tough schedule .
there is the choreography to be written , the studio work with the dancers , and of course , the traveling : chicago , montreal , stuttgart , oslo and berlin are all big on his current itinerary .
all of this is done backstage , without any of the buzz from being in the limelight or the excitement of being onstage .
" it 's actually harder and more nerve-racking to present a choreography than to go on stage myself , because when you dance and perform , you have the situation in your hands , you can manipulate it , " he said .
" but when you create a piece , when the curtain opens , i do n't even have to be there , it 's in the hands of the dancers and the theater - so i 'm just sitting there nervous . "
years in the making bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spuck had to do some reinventing for " leonce and lena " -lrb- here , performed as a play in berlin -rrb- still , being there on opening night is a must for spuck .
sometimes years of steady work - with dancers , technicians , theater administrators , musicians , conductors , and others - go by between a commission and a first night .
for spuck , this time is all a fruitful purgatory until the opening , when critics either celebrate or condemn his work .
there are also times when the audience loves spuck 's work , but he himself has doubts - like with " ulysses , " which he did with the royal ballet of flanders for the edinburgh festival .
" after the first two performances the curtain closed and i thought , ' what have i done ? '
the audience was screaming and they were all really excited but it did n't touch me at all and i thought , ' this is weird , this production . "
despite his claim that he had to " go get drunk in some corner of the theater " because he was so scared he had produced " absolute rubbish " at the premiere of " lulu , " demand for his time and his ideas continues to grow .
" it is painful , " spuck said , " but i think having doubts is important ; otherwise you ca n't step forward . "

vw wants its cars to escape their niche status and hit the mass market . just prior to the opening of the annual detroit auto show on monday , german carmaker volkswagen announced it plans for ramping up its presence in the united states , aiming to win over american consumers and sell twice the number of cars it does now in three to four years ' time .
" we will sell 400,000 to 450,000 vehicles in 2012/13 , " said stefan jacoby , head of volkswagen of america , on sunday , adding that the company 's us business could become profitable by 2013 . volkswagen , europe 's largest carmaker , has had a hard time finding its footing in the all-important us market .
its presence in china and brazil is strong and sales in germany have been helped by a government program last year that encouraged drivers to trade in old gas guzzlers for more for efficient cars .
in europe , vw has 21 percent of the market .
but vw market share in the us , including its audi brand , is only three percent .
part of the reason for that , according to analysts , has to do with the generally dismal state of the car industry in the wake of global recession .
although , vw 's small market share actually gave it a bit of a foot up since it was not as hard hit by the collapse of american auto sales as some of its rivals were .
american preferences bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vw has been trying to figure out how to fit the pieces together for the us market vw 's lackluster performance can also be traced back to its product line , which was not ideally suited to americans ' taste in cars .
" volkswagen was neither a premium brand like mercedes , nor a mass-market brand , " said marc tonn , a senior analyst at m.m. warburg .
" the company was kind of stuck in the middle . "
the wolfsburg-based concern focused on smaller or mid-size cars with highly advanced technological features when americans were more interested in buying larger vehicles , such as suvs or pick-up trucks .
" i think the focus will now be on maintaining german quality , but going a little in the direction of us size , " tonn added .
nevertheless , vw will not likely be turning out tank-like vehicles any time soon .
jacoby said he expects the market for compact and mid-sized sedans to increase faster than other segments , especially if oil prices convince more americans to downsize from their chevy tahoes and ford explorers .
" with higher oil prices , the us consumer is perhaps going to look a little more closely at smaller cars , " said christian breitsprecher , an auto analyst at sol oppenheim . from the niche to the masses volkswagen , which ranks behind brands like hyundai , honda , mercedes and bmw in the us , wants to emerge from its position as a niche carmaker to a mass-market product , one that can compete with extremely popular makes , such as toyota 's camry .
while the beetle quickly became a cult classic in the us and enjoyed great popularity in the 1960s and early 1970s , vw was never able to imitate its success with subsequent makes , such as its rabbit .
the company closed its last us plant in 1988 in pennsylvania amid sluggish sales .
" the rabbit was a flop and vw never really was able to get back in the mass market after that , " said breitsprecher , who added that volkswagen cars remained niche products .
" i mean , who bought a jetta ?
mostly college kids who could n't afford bmws . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : volkswagen beetle - a hit in america but vw wants a follow-up success becoming a mass-market car in the us is essential to vw 's ambitious expansion plans for the coming years , which include surpassing main rival toyota , the world 's largest automaker by sales volume .
new investments volkswagen is building a new plant in chattanooga , tennessee , investing up to $ 1 billion -lrb- 694 million euros -rrb- in a facility that , according to us head jacoby , " will enable the turnaround of vw 's us operations " and should create around 2,000 jobs .
increasing production and purchasing in the dollar zone is crucial to vw 's return to profitability as it would lower the company 's exposure to a dollar that is weak compared to the euro .
the carmaker is also spending $ 125 million on two new dealerships in new york city , which will begin sales in 2010 .
they are part of the company 's strategy to increase its presence and visibility in the us .
jacoby said he thinks the worst of the automobile sector 's woes to be behind them , with american car sales likely to be 11 million to 11.5 million in 2010 .
because of a stabilization of the labor and real-estate markets , " we are a little bit more optimistic now than we were a few months ago , " he said on sunday .
he added that he expects the us car sales to stabilize at around 15 million over the medium term , and vw 's longer-term us plans include selling 800,000 vehicles a year by 2018 .
" the us is a critical component of vw 's long-term strategy , " said analyst tonn .
" despite all the euphoria about emerging markets these days , if you want to be a global player you have to do well in america . "

but is it really against the law ? the schlecker drugstore mega-chain has come under heavy criticism for alleged wage dumping . the trade union verdi has accused schlecker of forcing its employees to take new contracts through a temporary employment agency called meniar , which pays only half of the usual hourly wage , about 6.70 euros -lrb- $ 9.73 -rrb- instead of 12.50 euros -lrb- $ 18.17 -rrb- . it also said it believed meniar was entirely controled by schlecker . politicians protest the labor minister in the german state of north rhine-westphalia , karl josef laumann , has also accused schlecker of systematic wage evasion . the süddeutsche zeitung newspaper reported that laumann wrote a letter to schlecker employees stating that temporary work is designed to compensate for operating peaks or in the case of vacation or illness , not to replace permanent staff . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schlecker has about 50,000 employees throughout europe federal labor minister ursula von der leyen appeared on a sunday evening talk show and said that the case would have to be examined closely to see if there abuse is abuse . she added that the federal employment agency -lrb- ba -rrb- is responsible for ensuring that every temporary employment agency has a license that must be renewed regularly . " there is a proper procedure , " she said .
" we are not in the wild west . " is it illegal ? however , a ba spokeswoman denied that schlecker ’ s actions were illegal . " the temporary employment act does not preclude sacking workers and replacing them with ones from a temporary employment agency under worse conditions , " said a ba spokeswoman on monday . she added the government would have to change the laws in order to prohibit similar actions . still , the association of temporary work agencies -lrb- bza -rrb- has been quick to distance itself from the business policies of schlecker . " such business practices are not consistent with the original meaning of temporary work and hurt the reputation of all temporary employment agencies , " bza spokesman wolfram linke told deutsche welle . linke added that companies who are members of the bza have to agree to pay employees an hourly wage of at least 7.51 euros -lrb- $ 10.51 -rrb- , despite the fact that germany does not have a minimum wage . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : labor minister ursula von der leyen said the situation must be carefully examined schlecker responds schlecker has denied the allegations of wage dumping and insists that its new stores pay up to 13 euros -lrb- $ 18.89 -rrb- an hour or more .
however , head of corporate communications florian baum said monday that schlecker had resolved " effective immediately " not to pursue any further contracts with the temporary employment company meniar . achim neumann of verdi was excited to hear the news . " i think this is fantastic - obviously a tremendous amount of pressure was necessary to convince schlecker of that misusing the temporary working laws is unacceptable .
it ’ s a very positive sign , " he told deutsche welle . schlecker has often come under criticism from the unions regarding its employment practices .
it has accused verdi of using " targeted disinformation and defamation campaigns " in the past . with more than 50,000 employees and stores in 12 countries , schlecker is the largest drugstore company in europe .

two squad members and a driver died in the ambush . " if a team or some people present themselves under the togolese flag , it will be a false representation , " gilbert houngbo told journalists in the capital lome on sunday , january 10 .
previously , the togolese national soccer team had reportedly decided to take part in the africa cup of nations in spite of friday 's deadly ambush by gunmen on their convoy in angola .
a report on the website of the french sports daily , l 'equipe , said that the players had decided to ignore the call from togo 's government for the side to return home .
the report quoted alaixys romao , togo 's midfielder , as saying that the unanimous decision to stay and take part in the tournament was taken to honor the dead and wounded .
and also in order to deny the rebels any satisfaction .
the attack by hooded gunmen claimed the lives of togo 's assistant coach and its squad spokesman along with one of the drivers of the convoy .
the togolese backup goalkeeper , kodjovi obilale , reportedly sustained two gunshot wounds in the attack and was flown to south africa for treatment .
he is said to be in a stable condition .
seven others were also injured in the incident on friday , including defender serge akakpo of the romanian team vaslui .
the other injured passengers included two squad doctors and a journalist .

the attack threatens to overshadow the tournament which is to take place over the next three weeks .
the assailants opened fire on the vehicles as they travelled from cabinda , an angolan enclave to the north of the country .
the attack lasted some 20 minutes .
responsibility for the assault has been claimed by the separatist group , the front for the liberation of the enclave of cabinda -lrb- flec -rrb- .
the angolan minister in charge of affairs in cabinda , antonio bento bembe , said that the attack was " an act of terrorism . "
the oil-producing region of cabinda has been the site of a decades-long struggle for independence by the separatist group flec .
despite this , it is scheduled to play host to seven tournament matches this month. td / dfm / afp / reuters / ap / l 'equipe editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

two squad members and a driver died in the ambush . " if a team or some people present themselves under the togolese flag , it will be a false representation , " gilbert houngbo told journalists in the capital lome on sunday , january 10 .
previously , the togolese national soccer team had reportedly decided to take part in the africa cup of nations in spite of friday 's deadly ambush by gunmen on their convoy in angola .
a report on the website of the french sports daily , l 'equipe , said that the players had decided to ignore the call from togo 's government for the side to return home .
the report quoted alaixys romao , togo 's midfielder , as saying that the unanimous decision to stay and take part in the tournament was taken to honor the dead and wounded .
and also in order to deny the rebels any satisfaction .
the attack by hooded gunmen claimed the lives of togo 's assistant coach and its squad spokesman along with one of the drivers of the convoy .
the togolese backup goalkeeper , kodjovi obilale , reportedly sustained two gunshot wounds in the attack and was flown to south africa for treatment .
he is said to be in a stable condition .
seven others were also injured in the incident on friday , including defender serge akakpo of the romanian team vaslui .
the other injured passengers included two squad doctors and a journalist .

the attack threatens to overshadow the tournament which is to take place over the next three weeks .
the assailants opened fire on the vehicles as they travelled from cabinda , an angolan enclave to the north of the country .
the attack lasted some 20 minutes .
responsibility for the assault has been claimed by the separatist group , the front for the liberation of the enclave of cabinda -lrb- flec -rrb- .
the angolan minister in charge of affairs in cabinda , antonio bento bembe , said that the attack was " an act of terrorism . "
the oil-producing region of cabinda has been the site of a decades-long struggle for independence by the separatist group flec .
despite this , it is scheduled to play host to seven tournament matches this month. td / dfm / afp / reuters / ap / l 'equipe editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but experts say counterterrorism wo n't work without addressing yemen 's other woes . concerns are mounting about terrorism in yemen since the botched attempted bombing of a us airliner on christmas day .
us president barack obama has said al-qaeda 's offshoot in yemen was behind the failed attacks .
the issue was on the agenda when the german foreign minister , guido westerwelle , made a surprise visit to yemen on monday at the end of his middle east tour .
as washington ramps up its counterterrorism role in yemen and raises pressure on the government in sanaa to crack down on islamic extremists , some say that a single-minded focus on military force is deeply flawed .
" the united states and other western powers need to provide long-term economic development to reduce poverty and raise educational standards , " yemen 's foreign minister abu bakr al-qirbi said in an interview with the washington post last week .
that , he said , would help combat terrorism " in a more effective fashion than just using military force . "
that view is echoed by international aid agencies working on the ground in yemen , the arab world 's most impoverished nation .
bildunterschrift : experts warn against focusing solely on military means to fight terrorism " poverty is n't the only explanation for terrorism .
but it 's true that yemen 's extensive social and economic pressures contribute to making the country unstable - and thus make it easier for terrorist organizations to exploit people 's grievances and recruit them , " felix eikenberg , head of germany 's friedrich ebert political foundation in the capital sanaa , told deutsche welle .
germany , whose aid involvement in yemen dates back 40 years , is one of europe 's biggest donors to yemen .
massive social and economic pressures home to around 24 million people , yemen is grappling with one of the world 's highest population growth rates , rapidly depleting groundwater levels , and an unemployment rate of more than 20 percent .
the country 's economy is in tatters as it runs out of its meager oil reserves . " some 70 percent of the state 's revenues currently come from oil .
but oil reserves are dwindling so rapidly that we estimate yemen could become an oil importer in ten years , " eikenberg said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yemen faces a lethal cocktail of social and demographic problems total oil production has slumped from about 440,000 barrels per day in 2001 to 300,000 last year , according to the us energy information administration .
all that has contributed to widespread poverty in the country .
children suffer from a 50 percent malnutrition rate ; more than 40 percent of yemenis live below the poverty line , 18 percent on less than a dollar a day .
germany a major donor given the magnitude of its problems , yemen receives comparatively little per-capita international aid .
the world bank and the imf play an important role in financing yemen 's fragile economy .
the handful of bilateral donors to yemen include the netherlands , the us , japan and britain , germany remains one of the largest european players with annual aid amounting to about 37 million euros .
aid for 2009 and 2010 has been budgeted at 79 million euros .
much of it is focused on easing yemen 's severe water shortage , boosting primary education in the country - yemen had a literacy rate of 40 percent in 2007 - and helping diversify its oil-dominated economy .
zoe nautre , an expert at the berlin-based german council on foreign relations who spent a year in yemen reviewing german government aid efforts , said germany enjoyed excellent relations with the yemeni government .
" germany is often apolitical because it provides a lot of good technical assistance in yemen , particularly in the water sector , and does n't appear to be meddling in yemen 's affairs .
so , germany is well trusted in sanaa , " she told deutsche welle .
failure of governance but others point out that aid money is most needed to help tackle the failure of yemen 's corrupt government to maintain control over remote regions in the strife-torn country - which in turn is exacerbating yemen 's security woes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yemen remains a loosely-governed country under president saleh " one of the major reasons al qaeda is so strong in yemen is because the government is so weak , " guido steinberg , an expert on international terrorism and political developments in the gulf region at the berlin-based german institute for international and security affairs told deutsche welle .
" president ali abdullah saleh 's government is losing legitimacy - it 's not just failing to provide its own citizens with basic things such as water and jobs but is also losing control over vast swathes of the country . "
president saleh is facing a rebellion in the north , a secessionist movement in the south and growing islamic terrorism .
expert urges caution experts say that in addition to equipping and training yemen 's security forces to combat terrorism , the country needs a long-term development strategy - that means not just aid in areas such as education , health and infrastructure , but an inclusive politics .
" development policy in yemen has no meaning if it is n't embedded in a political strategy , " steinberg said .
eickenberg , whose organization is involved in democratization and reforming yemen 's political institutions , said western nations meeting at a yemen conference in london later this month needed to focus on promoting better governance , fighting corruption and nudging yemen to solve its northern conflict - with the help of its influential neighbor saudi arabia .
but nautre urged caution in drafting any future western strategy on yemen .
" western involvement in yemen can easily backfire because the population is very wary and there 's a strong anti-american sentiment there , " nautre said .
" the most important thing is for the west not to be seen as interfering in yemen from outside so that the people do n't turn against you and run into the arms of extremist groups . "

but experts say counterterrorism wo n't work without addressing yemen 's other woes . concerns are mounting about terrorism in yemen since the botched attempted bombing of a us airliner on christmas day .
us president barack obama has said al-qaeda 's offshoot in yemen was behind the failed attacks .
the issue was on the agenda when the german foreign minister , guido westerwelle , made a surprise visit to yemen on monday at the end of his middle east tour .
as washington ramps up its counterterrorism role in yemen and raises pressure on the government in sanaa to crack down on islamic extremists , some say that a single-minded focus on military force is deeply flawed .
" the united states and other western powers need to provide long-term economic development to reduce poverty and raise educational standards , " yemen 's foreign minister abu bakr al-qirbi said in an interview with the washington post last week .
that , he said , would help combat terrorism " in a more effective fashion than just using military force . "
that view is echoed by international aid agencies working on the ground in yemen , the arab world 's most impoverished nation .
bildunterschrift : experts warn against focusing solely on military means to fight terrorism " poverty is n't the only explanation for terrorism .
but it 's true that yemen 's extensive social and economic pressures contribute to making the country unstable - and thus make it easier for terrorist organizations to exploit people 's grievances and recruit them , " felix eikenberg , head of germany 's friedrich ebert political foundation in the capital sanaa , told deutsche welle .
germany , whose aid involvement in yemen dates back 40 years , is one of europe 's biggest donors to yemen .
massive social and economic pressures home to around 24 million people , yemen is grappling with one of the world 's highest population growth rates , rapidly depleting groundwater levels , and an unemployment rate of more than 20 percent .
the country 's economy is in tatters as it runs out of its meager oil reserves . " some 70 percent of the state 's revenues currently come from oil .
but oil reserves are dwindling so rapidly that we estimate yemen could become an oil importer in ten years , " eikenberg said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yemen faces a lethal cocktail of social and demographic problems total oil production has slumped from about 440,000 barrels per day in 2001 to 300,000 last year , according to the us energy information administration .
all that has contributed to widespread poverty in the country .
children suffer from a 50 percent malnutrition rate ; more than 40 percent of yemenis live below the poverty line , 18 percent on less than a dollar a day .
germany a major donor given the magnitude of its problems , yemen receives comparatively little per-capita international aid .
the world bank and the imf play an important role in financing yemen 's fragile economy .
the handful of bilateral donors to yemen include the netherlands , the us , japan and britain , germany remains one of the largest european players with annual aid amounting to about 37 million euros .
aid for 2009 and 2010 has been budgeted at 79 million euros .
much of it is focused on easing yemen 's severe water shortage , boosting primary education in the country - yemen had a literacy rate of 40 percent in 2007 - and helping diversify its oil-dominated economy .
zoe nautre , an expert at the berlin-based german council on foreign relations who spent a year in yemen reviewing german government aid efforts , said germany enjoyed excellent relations with the yemeni government .
" germany is often apolitical because it provides a lot of good technical assistance in yemen , particularly in the water sector , and does n't appear to be meddling in yemen 's affairs .
so , germany is well trusted in sanaa , " she told deutsche welle .
failure of governance but others point out that aid money is most needed to help tackle the failure of yemen 's corrupt government to maintain control over remote regions in the strife-torn country - which in turn is exacerbating yemen 's security woes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yemen remains a loosely-governed country under president saleh " one of the major reasons al qaeda is so strong in yemen is because the government is so weak , " guido steinberg , an expert on international terrorism and political developments in the gulf region at the berlin-based german institute for international and security affairs told deutsche welle .
" president ali abdullah saleh 's government is losing legitimacy - it 's not just failing to provide its own citizens with basic things such as water and jobs but is also losing control over vast swathes of the country . "
president saleh is facing a rebellion in the north , a secessionist movement in the south and growing islamic terrorism .
expert urges caution experts say that in addition to equipping and training yemen 's security forces to combat terrorism , the country needs a long-term development strategy - that means not just aid in areas such as education , health and infrastructure , but an inclusive politics .
" development policy in yemen has no meaning if it is n't embedded in a political strategy , " steinberg said .
eickenberg , whose organization is involved in democratization and reforming yemen 's political institutions , said western nations meeting at a yemen conference in london later this month needed to focus on promoting better governance , fighting corruption and nudging yemen to solve its northern conflict - with the help of its influential neighbor saudi arabia .
but nautre urged caution in drafting any future western strategy on yemen .
" western involvement in yemen can easily backfire because the population is very wary and there 's a strong anti-american sentiment there , " nautre said .
" the most important thing is for the west not to be seen as interfering in yemen from outside so that the people do n't turn against you and run into the arms of extremist groups . "

the world bank and the imf play an important role in financing yemen 's fragile economy .
the handful of bilateral donors to yemen include the netherlands , the us , japan and britain , germany remains one of the largest european players with annual aid amounting to about 37 million euros .
aid for 2009 and 2010 has been budgeted at 79 million euros .
much of it is focused on easing yemen 's severe water shortage , boosting primary education in the country - yemen had a literacy rate of 40 percent in 2007 - and helping diversify its oil-dominated economy .
zoe nautre , an expert at the berlin-based german council on foreign relations who spent a year in yemen reviewing german government aid efforts , said germany enjoyed excellent relations with the yemeni government .
" germany is often apolitical because it provides a lot of good technical assistance in yemen , particularly in the water sector , and does n't appear to be meddling in yemen 's affairs .
so , germany is well trusted in sanaa , " she told deutsche welle .
failure of governance but others point out that aid money is most needed to help tackle the failure of yemen 's corrupt government to maintain control over remote regions in the strife-torn country - which in turn is exacerbating yemen 's security woes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yemen remains a loosely-governed country under president saleh " one of the major reasons al qaeda is so strong in yemen is because the government is so weak , " guido steinberg , an expert on international terrorism and political developments in the gulf region at the berlin-based german institute for international and security affairs told deutsche welle .
" president ali abdullah saleh 's government is losing legitimacy - it 's not just failing to provide its own citizens with basic things such as water and jobs but is also losing control over vast swathes of the country . "
president saleh is facing a rebellion in the north , a secessionist movement in the south and growing islamic terrorism .
expert urges caution experts say that in addition to equipping and training yemen 's security forces to combat terrorism , the country needs a long-term development strategy - that means not just aid in areas such as education , health and infrastructure , but an inclusive politics .
" development policy in yemen has no meaning if it is n't embedded in a political strategy , " steinberg said .
eickenberg , whose organization is involved in democratization and reforming yemen 's political institutions , said western nations meeting at a yemen conference in london later this month needed to focus on promoting better governance , fighting corruption and nudging yemen to solve its northern conflict - with the help of its influential neighbor saudi arabia .
but nautre urged caution in drafting any future western strategy on yemen .
" western involvement in yemen can easily backfire because the population is very wary and there 's a strong anti-american sentiment there , " nautre said .
" the most important thing is for the west not to be seen as interfering in yemen from outside so that the people do n't turn against you and run into the arms of extremist groups . "

kaessmann is the lutheran bishop of hanover and the first woman to head the ekd - an umbrella group for 22 churches that encompass germany 's 25 million protestants .

her comments were described as " naive , " " not helpful , " " unrealistic " - soldiers posted in afghanistan were as angered by the bishop 's views as many german politicians .

defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg has invited her to visit the troops . bishop margot kaessmann and karl-theodor zu guttenberg agreed during their half-hour meeting on monday that there should be a broader public debate on the german bundeswehr 's mission in afghanistan , as well as a strengthened civil commitment .
the minister and the protestant church leader said they would continue their " critical dialogue " about the afghan deployment , possibly in the framework of the bundeswehr 's military academy or at protestant church academies . while the issue would n't be solved anytime soon , kaessmann said it was important that the church 's voice was heard in the debate .
kaessmann is the lutheran bishop of hanover and the first woman to head the ekd - an umbrella group for 22 churches that encompass germany 's 25 million protestants .
" nothing is right in afghanistan " the high-level meeting comes as a response to critical remarks by the bishop in december , when kaessmann said in an interview that the war in afghanistan could not be justified .
at two new year 's church services , she told congregations in berlin and dresden she did not approve of the western strategy in afghanistan , where 4,500 german military personnel are deployed with the international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- .
her comments were described as " naive , " " not helpful , " " unrealistic " - soldiers posted in afghanistan were as angered by the bishop 's views as many german politicians .
the german government - the third-largest force contributor after the united states and britain - is expected to decide whether to commit more troops to stabilizing afghanistan at an international conference in late january on how to assist the country .

and debates about safety are sure to continue . like all europe 's major football leagues , the german bundesliga has a number of players competing in the africa cup of nations in angola .
the first priority for clubs when the news of the attack broke was to contact their players and offer to fly them out of africa .
hanover , for example , were concerned about their tunisian defender karim haggui .
" karim told our sports directorship that he feels safe right now , " hanover spokesman andreas kundt told the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung newspaper .
three members of the togolese delegation were killed on friday when separatist rebels in an angolan enclave opened fire on the team bus .
a reserve goalkeeper had to be flown to south africa for emergency treatment for life-threatening gunshot wounds .
the togolese team subsequently quit the tournament and flew home .
bildunterschrift : the togolese team was flown home over the weekend " i was afraid for my life , " togolese defender assimiou toure , who plays for bayer leverkusen , told reporters .
" all i could do was jump under my seat and pray . "
thus far , no african player has asked his german club to get him out of angola .
but the shooting has occasioned furious debate about both the africa cup and safety in general on the continent ahead of the world 's premier soccer event .
relative safety ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany keeper rene adler has said he 's worried about the world cup in south africa international football functionaries , from fifa president sepp blatter on down , have been quick to offer assurances that the shooting in angola did not mean that this summer 's world cup in south africa would be unsafe .
" the measures taken for the africa cup are not comparable with those for a football world cup , which are planned years in advance , " german world cup advisor horst r. schmidt told the frankfurter rundschau newspaper .
indeed , south africa and angola are very different countries .
still , some likely members of the german national team at the world cup said they were worried .
" it 's completely sick , " germany 's top goalkeeper rene adler told the bild am sonntag newspaper .
" i have to ask how they 're going to ensure security at the world cup .
i 'm sure we 'll be safe as a team , but what about family members ? "
other team members had comparable reactions .
' when you hear something like that , you do a double take and start thinking , " germany midfielder bastian schweinsteiger told the sid sports news agency .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : otto pfister coached in africa for four decades german coach otto pfister , who spent most of his career working in africa and who coached the togolese team at the 2006 world cup , offered a more first-hand view .
he said that the world cup would not be especially risky but that different standards applied to africa .
" the security measures are , of course , not comparable with those in germany , " pfister said in an interview with sid .
" in this area , just as in the economy , we 're talking about developing countries .
and the distances are enormous .
how can they be expected to keep all of such vast distances completely under control ? "
hard choices bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stuttgart 's arthur boka -lrb- right -rrb- is one of the bundesliga players competing in angola the attack has focused attention on a number of issues , both for football and society in general .
for instance , pfister is among those who have criticized the togolese decision to withdraw from the tournament , which was ordered by togo 's prime minister .
he has said togo 's pull-out will only encourage extremist groups in angola , and he fears that wrong precedents could be set .
" the africa cup is a spectacular event for africans , one that 's almost more important than the world cup , " pfister told sid .
" you ca n't cancel events like these .
you quickly put yourself in a position where you can be blackmailed . "
in the purely sporting realm , though , the attack has caused football managers outside africa to question the africa cup .
clubs throughout europe were never happy about being forced to allow their employees to take part in the biennial event , and friday 's incident has fuelled arguments that the rules need to be changed .
borussia dortmund sports director michael zorc says teams should have the right to make decisions based on players ' safety .
" until that becomes the case , we ca n't bring our players back because they would then be suspended , " zorc told the frankfurter allegeimeine zeitung .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the shooting has been a huge blow for african football stuttgart commercial manager horst heldt , whose defender arthur boka plays for ivory coast , feels much the same way .
" the ideal thing for me would be if arthur could just come back , " heldt told the same paper .
ultimately , the attack on togo 's national team is going to force everyone concerned to take a realistic look at where africa and international football fit together .
fifa 's decision to award south africa the world cup was a bold and inclusive gesture , intended to signal that the world 's poorest continent was a full-fledged member in the global soccer community .
experts like pfister know that there are risks attached to that decision , but argue that those risks should not be allowed to overshadow all other aspects of the world 's biggest sporting event .
that will surely be one of the main topics of discussion for the duration of the africa cup and in the run-up to the world cup in south africa .

" it 's completely sick , " germany 's top goalkeeper rene adler told the bild am sonntag newspaper .
" i have to ask how they 're going to ensure security at the world cup .
i 'm sure we 'll be safe as a team , but what about family members ? "
other team members had comparable reactions .
' when you hear something like that , you do a double take and start thinking , " germany midfielder bastian schweinsteiger told the sid sports news agency .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : otto pfister coached in africa for four decades german coach otto pfister , who spent most of his career working in africa and who coached the togolese team at the 2006 world cup , offered a more first-hand view .
he said that the world cup would not be especially risky but that different standards applied to africa .
" the security measures are , of course , not comparable with those in germany , " pfister said in an interview with sid .
" in this area , just as in the economy , we 're talking about developing countries .
and the distances are enormous .
how can they be expected to keep all of such vast distances completely under control ? "
hard choices bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stuttgart 's arthur boka -lrb- right -rrb- is one of the bundesliga players competing in angola the attack has focused attention on a number of issues , both for football and society in general .
for instance , pfister is among those who have criticized the togolese decision to withdraw from the tournament , which was ordered by togo 's prime minister .
he has said togo 's pull-out will only encourage extremist groups in angola , and he fears that wrong precedents could be set .
" the africa cup is a spectacular event for africans , one that 's almost more important than the world cup , " pfister told sid .
" you ca n't cancel events like these .
you quickly put yourself in a position where you can be blackmailed . "
in the purely sporting realm , though , the attack has caused football managers outside africa to question the africa cup .
clubs throughout europe were never happy about being forced to allow their employees to take part in the biennial event , and friday 's incident has fuelled arguments that the rules need to be changed .
borussia dortmund sports director michael zorc says teams should have the right to make decisions based on players ' safety .
" until that becomes the case , we ca n't bring our players back because they would then be suspended , " zorc told the frankfurter allegeimeine zeitung .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the shooting has been a huge blow for african football stuttgart commercial manager horst heldt , whose defender arthur boka plays for ivory coast , feels much the same way .
" the ideal thing for me would be if arthur could just come back , " heldt told the same paper .
ultimately , the attack on togo 's national team is going to force everyone concerned to take a realistic look at where africa and international football fit together .
fifa 's decision to award south africa the world cup was a bold and inclusive gesture , intended to signal that the world 's poorest continent was a full-fledged member in the global soccer community .
experts like pfister know that there are risks attached to that decision , but argue that those risks should not be allowed to overshadow all other aspects of the world 's biggest sporting event .
that will surely be one of the main topics of discussion for the duration of the africa cup and in the run-up to the world cup in south africa .

and debates about safety are sure to continue . like all europe 's major football leagues , the german bundesliga has a number of players competing in the africa cup of nations in angola .
the first priority for clubs when the news of the attack broke was to contact their players and offer to fly them out of africa .
hanover , for example , were concerned about their tunisian defender karim haggui .
" karim told our sports directorship that he feels safe right now , " hanover spokesman andreas kundt told the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung newspaper .
three members of the togolese delegation were killed on friday when separatist rebels in an angolan enclave opened fire on the team bus .
a reserve goalkeeper had to be flown to south africa for emergency treatment for life-threatening gunshot wounds .
the togolese team subsequently quit the tournament and flew home .
bildunterschrift : the togolese team was flown home over the weekend " i was afraid for my life , " togolese defender assimiou toure , who plays for bayer leverkusen , told reporters .
" all i could do was jump under my seat and pray . "
thus far , no african player has asked his german club to get him out of angola .
but the shooting has occasioned furious debate about both the africa cup and safety in general on the continent ahead of the world 's premier soccer event .

and debates about safety are sure to continue . like all europe 's major football leagues , the german bundesliga has a number of players competing in the africa cup of nations in angola .
the first priority for clubs when the news of the attack broke was to contact their players and offer to fly them out of africa .
hanover , for example , were concerned about their tunisian defender karim haggui .
" karim told our sports directorship that he feels safe right now , " hanover spokesman andreas kundt told the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung newspaper .
three members of the togolese delegation were killed on friday when separatist rebels in an angolan enclave opened fire on the team bus .
a reserve goalkeeper had to be flown to south africa for emergency treatment for life-threatening gunshot wounds .
the togolese team subsequently quit the tournament and flew home .
bildunterschrift : the togolese team was flown home over the weekend " i was afraid for my life , " togolese defender assimiou toure , who plays for bayer leverkusen , told reporters .
" all i could do was jump under my seat and pray . "
thus far , no african player has asked his german club to get him out of angola .
but the shooting has occasioned furious debate about both the africa cup and safety in general on the continent ahead of the world 's premier soccer event .
relative safety ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany keeper rene adler has said he 's worried about the world cup in south africa international football functionaries , from fifa president sepp blatter on down , have been quick to offer assurances that the shooting in angola did not mean that this summer 's world cup in south africa would be unsafe .
" the measures taken for the africa cup are not comparable with those for a football world cup , which are planned years in advance , " german world cup advisor horst r. schmidt told the frankfurter rundschau newspaper .
indeed , south africa and angola are very different countries .
still , some likely members of the german national team at the world cup said they were worried .
" it 's completely sick , " germany 's top goalkeeper rene adler told the bild am sonntag newspaper .
" i have to ask how they 're going to ensure security at the world cup .
i 'm sure we 'll be safe as a team , but what about family members ? "
other team members had comparable reactions .
' when you hear something like that , you do a double take and start thinking , " germany midfielder bastian schweinsteiger told the sid sports news agency .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : otto pfister coached in africa for four decades german coach otto pfister , who spent most of his career working in africa and who coached the togolese team at the 2006 world cup , offered a more first-hand view .
he said that the world cup would not be especially risky but that different standards applied to africa .
" the security measures are , of course , not comparable with those in germany , " pfister said in an interview with sid .
" in this area , just as in the economy , we 're talking about developing countries .
and the distances are enormous .
how can they be expected to keep all of such vast distances completely under control ? "
hard choices bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stuttgart 's arthur boka -lrb- right -rrb- is one of the bundesliga players competing in angola the attack has focused attention on a number of issues , both for football and society in general .
for instance , pfister is among those who have criticized the togolese decision to withdraw from the tournament , which was ordered by togo 's prime minister .
he has said togo 's pull-out will only encourage extremist groups in angola , and he fears that wrong precedents could be set .
" the africa cup is a spectacular event for africans , one that 's almost more important than the world cup , " pfister told sid .
" you ca n't cancel events like these .
you quickly put yourself in a position where you can be blackmailed . "
in the purely sporting realm , though , the attack has caused football managers outside africa to question the africa cup .
clubs throughout europe were never happy about being forced to allow their employees to take part in the biennial event , and friday 's incident has fuelled arguments that the rules need to be changed .
borussia dortmund sports director michael zorc says teams should have the right to make decisions based on players ' safety .
" until that becomes the case , we ca n't bring our players back because they would then be suspended , " zorc told the frankfurter allegeimeine zeitung .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the shooting has been a huge blow for african football stuttgart commercial manager horst heldt , whose defender arthur boka plays for ivory coast , feels much the same way .
" the ideal thing for me would be if arthur could just come back , " heldt told the same paper .
ultimately , the attack on togo 's national team is going to force everyone concerned to take a realistic look at where africa and international football fit together .
fifa 's decision to award south africa the world cup was a bold and inclusive gesture , intended to signal that the world 's poorest continent was a full-fledged member in the global soccer community .
experts like pfister know that there are risks attached to that decision , but argue that those risks should not be allowed to overshadow all other aspects of the world 's biggest sporting event .
that will surely be one of the main topics of discussion for the duration of the africa cup and in the run-up to the world cup in south africa .

heike groos joined up as a doctor but eventually found out that she was also expected to be a soldier , an experience that had long-lasting effects . when heike groos joined the bundeswehr as a doctor more than 20 years ago , she confesses it was just because she was looking for a job .
back in 1987 , when she started working as an emergency medical officer in a germany army hospital , she was still only a doctor .
that changed when she was sent to afghanistan in 2002 .
she became a doctor - and a soldier .
when groos was sent out to afghanistan , she did so without any question and without any concern .
even when it became obvious that she was now both a doctor and a soldier , armed with a weapon to protect her patients if necessary , she knew that this is what service in afghanistan was like .
it was as much part of the job as helping comrades and afghans alike as part of an emergency military ambulance team .
" at the beginning , in 2002 , it was a completely satisfying job , " she says .
" each moment made me think that we were doing something meaningful there .
just being there symbolized to the people that there was peace and that we would ensure that it remained that way , through our medical and humanitarian work there . "
suicide attack changes everything bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heike groos was first on the scene at the bomb blast but the positive feelings did not endure .
the situation changed dramatically with a suicide attack on a bus carrying german soldiers in june 2003 .
six bundeswehr troops were killed and 29 were injured , some seriously .
heike groos was one of the first on the scene ; she bandaged wounds , called for assistance , coordinated the medical efforts , comforted the injured and watched comrades die .
the event and the huge shock changed her and her colleagues ' lives forever .
" after that first suicide attack in june 2003 , we changed and we became deeply , deeply distrustful because we could not at all differentiate between the people , " she says .
" who is taliban and who is not , who is good and who is bad ? that was never clear to me . "
as well as suspicion and caution , heike groos says she felt rage ; rage against the taliban who had carried out the attack , rage against afghanistan , and rage against germany - the country which had sent her there .
she and her comrades also withdrew from the people they were supposed to be helping .
" we withdrew ourselves and wanted nothing do to with anything afghan , " she admits .
" it was because we saw those that we had come to help as those who had attacked us .
this perspective shifted in time , and we recognized that those who were friendly before still were but we were always more cautious after that .
i was never as trusting again . "
disillusionment leads to decision to leave bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : groos decided that her 2007 tour would be her last after the attack , her unit became closer , even more like a family than before .

but there was no comfort for her .
groos started to see little sense in what she was doing , confined and isolated in the base due to the increasing dangers outside .
she decided that it could not go on .
she returned to afghanistan for the last time in 2007 .
groos says that people could not understand why she went back but she says she wanted to complete her service .
" people looked at me like i was an alien when i walked out of our house in my uniform , " she says .
" i was never at home and people asked my children , ' where is your mother ? ' and they would say ' she is in afghanistan ' . "
when she returned , people would stay out of her way .
her second husband also did n't understand and eventually he and groos divorced .
it was then that she decided that she wanted to leave everything behind and take her children to the other side of the world to start again .

they pushed me away , sent me to the army physician , to the psychiatrist who said ' you are traumatized . '
and then german people said : ' you were probably not hard enough , soldiers must always be tough . " '
while things were difficult for a long while , in time they also started to get better for heike groos and she began dealing with her experiences in afghanistan and working through her experiences .
the result was her first book , published last year , based on her time there : ' a beautiful day to die ' .

heike groos joined up as a doctor but eventually found out that she was also expected to be a soldier , an experience that had long-lasting effects . when heike groos joined the bundeswehr as a doctor more than 20 years ago , she confesses it was just because she was looking for a job .
back in 1987 , when she started working as an emergency medical officer in a germany army hospital , she was still only a doctor .
that changed when she was sent to afghanistan in 2002 .
she became a doctor - and a soldier .
when groos was sent out to afghanistan , she did so without any question and without any concern .
even when it became obvious that she was now both a doctor and a soldier , armed with a weapon to protect her patients if necessary , she knew that this is what service in afghanistan was like .
it was as much part of the job as helping comrades and afghans alike as part of an emergency military ambulance team .
" at the beginning , in 2002 , it was a completely satisfying job , " she says .

just being there symbolized to the people that there was peace and that we would ensure that it remained that way , through our medical and humanitarian work there . "
suicide attack changes everything bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heike groos was first on the scene at the bomb blast but the positive feelings did not endure .
the situation changed dramatically with a suicide attack on a bus carrying german soldiers in june 2003 .
six bundeswehr troops were killed and 29 were injured , some seriously .
heike groos was one of the first on the scene ; she bandaged wounds , called for assistance , coordinated the medical efforts , comforted the injured and watched comrades die .
the event and the huge shock changed her and her colleagues ' lives forever .
" after that first suicide attack in june 2003 , we changed and we became deeply , deeply distrustful because we could not at all differentiate between the people , " she says .
" who is taliban and who is not , who is good and who is bad ? that was never clear to me . "
as well as suspicion and caution , heike groos says she felt rage ; rage against the taliban who had carried out the attack , rage against afghanistan , and rage against germany - the country which had sent her there .
she and her comrades also withdrew from the people they were supposed to be helping .
" we withdrew ourselves and wanted nothing do to with anything afghan , " she admits .
" it was because we saw those that we had come to help as those who had attacked us .
this perspective shifted in time , and we recognized that those who were friendly before still were but we were always more cautious after that .
i was never as trusting again . "
disillusionment leads to decision to leave bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : groos decided that her 2007 tour would be her last after the attack , her unit became closer , even more like a family than before .
her younger male comrades looked for comfort and assurance from the older , more experienced heike groos .
but there was no comfort for her .
groos started to see little sense in what she was doing , confined and isolated in the base due to the increasing dangers outside .
she decided that it could not go on .
she returned to afghanistan for the last time in 2007 .
groos says that people could not understand why she went back but she says she wanted to complete her service .
" people looked at me like i was an alien when i walked out of our house in my uniform , " she says .
" i was never at home and people asked my children , ' where is your mother ? ' and they would say ' she is in afghanistan ' . "
when she returned , people would stay out of her way .
her second husband also did n't understand and eventually he and groos divorced .
it was then that she decided that she wanted to leave everything behind and take her children to the other side of the world to start again .
she and three of her five kids moved to new zealand , as far away from afghanistan and germany as possible in order to find peace .

as 2010 begins with the so-called " war on terror " seemingly no nearer to being won , us president barack obama has been handed an old set of problems to deal with ; problems which stretch back to before hijacked planes slammed into the world trade center in new york and the pentagon in washington .
last week , the usually unflappable obama sought to calm fears caused by the security lapses which allowed a nigerian man with alleged links to yemen-based al qaeda operatives to board a northwest airlines flight from amsterdam to detroit with an explosive device hidden in his underwear .
publicly , obama assured the american people that his administration would work fast and hard to improve security to eradicate the " human and systemic failures " behind the christmas day incident .
but behind closed doors , it is alleged that the president used sharper language with his security chiefs , calling the incident a potentially disastrous " screw up " by the intelligence community , telling them that " we dodged a bullet but just barely . "
intelligence in conflict zones suffering bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the khost blast was one of the biggest attacks on the cia the inability to both anticipate and stop the nature of this evolving threat was painfully highlighted two weeks ago by the bombing inside forward operating base chapman , a well-fortified compound in afghanistan 's khost province near the southeastern border with pakistan .
despite supposedly successful " deradicalization , " humam khalil abu-mulal al-balawi - a jordanian jihadist captured and turned into a cia spy - was allowed to enter the base without adequate security checks .
once inside , balawi , who had been given a mission to infiltrate al qaeda and pass on information on its leaders , detonated a hidden explosive , killing seven operatives and contractors and his jordanian handler .
the attack not only showed an embarrassing lack of vigilance but also exposed the intelligence community 's dearth in understanding of the situation in afghanistan and the current capabilities of al qaeda .
recent us intelligence suggested the terror organization 's power had been diminished but the attack showed that , contrary to that belief , al qaeda has achieved a new level of sophistication and may not be as weakened as us officials had thought .
lack of communication and accurate intelligence the attack also highlighted the problems which all operatives - at home and abroad - seem to encounter : that of an inability to gather and then share information they can trust .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : intel agencies have been under scrutiny since 9/11 " there is clearly a lack of communication at the heart of these problems , " giles merritt , the director of the security & defence agenda think-tank in brussels , told deutsche welle .
" the mechanisms for passing information are not good enough and this clearly needs to be sorted out .
intelligence agencies are meant to share information with each other and then to act on it .
it 's quite clear that the information is actually being shovelled over from one agency to another but not really analyzed , so it 's not being acted on . " richard betts , a terrorism expert at the council on foreign relations in washington , believes that while there have been mistakes made , the steps that follow will lead to a more secure united states . " processes for correlating and disseminating thousands of bits and pieces of information are complex and fixing one problem sometimes complicates another , " betts told deutsche welle . " the recent failure to revoke the visa for the nigerian bomber revealed a glitch in the system that has otherwise worked well in preventing any attacks inside the us since 9/11 , despite al qaeda 's huge incentives to pull one off .
glitches like this will be fixed when found but some precautions to minimize the chances of attack will introduce costs the public may be reluctant to bear - for example , more intrusive airport screening or more compromises in privacy for intelligence gathering .

her younger male comrades looked for comfort and assurance from the older , more experienced heike groos .
but there was no comfort for her .
groos started to see little sense in what she was doing , confined and isolated in the base due to the increasing dangers outside .
she decided that it could not go on .
she returned to afghanistan for the last time in 2007 .
groos says that people could not understand why she went back but she says she wanted to complete her service .
" people looked at me like i was an alien when i walked out of our house in my uniform , " she says .
" i was never at home and people asked my children , ' where is your mother ? ' and they would say ' she is in afghanistan ' . "
when she returned , people would stay out of her way .
her second husband also did n't understand and eventually he and groos divorced .
it was then that she decided that she wanted to leave everything behind and take her children to the other side of the world to start again .
she and three of her five kids moved to new zealand , as far away from afghanistan and germany as possible in order to find peace .
distance does n't end afghanistan trauma bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the horrors of aghanistan have never left heike groos but afghanistan did not release her from its grip .
groos continued to suffer from her experiences , suffering from nightmares and the inability to sleep .
she was also cut off from any kind of support from her previous employer : the bundeswehr .
" i had fulfilled my obligation -lrb- to the bundeswehr -rrb- and i found that very hard , " she says .
" i wish that someone had supported me and had not left me alone , but that did not happen , and i am sad about it .
they pushed me away , sent me to the army physician , to the psychiatrist who said ' you are traumatized . '
and then german people said : ' you were probably not hard enough , soldiers must always be tough . " '
while things were difficult for a long while , in time they also started to get better for heike groos and she began dealing with her experiences in afghanistan and working through her experiences .
the result was her first book , published last year , based on her time there : ' a beautiful day to die ' .

and debates about safety are sure to continue . like all europe 's major football leagues , the german bundesliga has a number of players competing in the africa cup of nations in angola .
the first priority for clubs when the news of the attack broke was to contact their players and offer to fly them out of africa .
hanover , for example , were concerned about their tunisian defender karim haggui .
" karim told our sports directorship that he feels safe right now , " hanover spokesman andreas kundt told the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung newspaper .
three members of the togolese delegation were killed on friday when separatist rebels in an angolan enclave opened fire on the team bus .
a reserve goalkeeper had to be flown to south africa for emergency treatment for life-threatening gunshot wounds .
the togolese team subsequently quit the tournament and flew home .
bildunterschrift : the togolese team was flown home over the weekend " i was afraid for my life , " togolese defender assimiou toure , who plays for bayer leverkusen , told reporters .
" all i could do was jump under my seat and pray . "
thus far , no african player has asked his german club to get him out of angola .
but the shooting has occasioned furious debate about both the africa cup and safety in general on the continent ahead of the world 's premier soccer event .
relative safety ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany keeper rene adler has said he 's worried about the world cup in south africa international football functionaries , from fifa president sepp blatter on down , have been quick to offer assurances that the shooting in angola did not mean that this summer 's world cup in south africa would be unsafe .
" the measures taken for the africa cup are not comparable with those for a football world cup , which are planned years in advance , " german world cup advisor horst r. schmidt told the frankfurter rundschau newspaper .
indeed , south africa and angola are very different countries .
still , some likely members of the german national team at the world cup said they were worried .
" it 's completely sick , " germany 's top goalkeeper rene adler told the bild am sonntag newspaper .
" i have to ask how they 're going to ensure security at the world cup .
i 'm sure we 'll be safe as a team , but what about family members ? "
other team members had comparable reactions .
' when you hear something like that , you do a double take and start thinking , " germany midfielder bastian schweinsteiger told the sid sports news agency .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : otto pfister coached in africa for four decades german coach otto pfister , who spent most of his career working in africa and who coached the togolese team at the 2006 world cup , offered a more first-hand view .
he said that the world cup would not be especially risky but that different standards applied to africa .
" the security measures are , of course , not comparable with those in germany , " pfister said in an interview with sid .
" in this area , just as in the economy , we 're talking about developing countries .
and the distances are enormous .
how can they be expected to keep all of such vast distances completely under control ? "
hard choices bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stuttgart 's arthur boka -lrb- right -rrb- is one of the bundesliga players competing in angola the attack has focused attention on a number of issues , both for football and society in general .
for instance , pfister is among those who have criticized the togolese decision to withdraw from the tournament , which was ordered by togo 's prime minister .
he has said togo 's pull-out will only encourage extremist groups in angola , and he fears that wrong precedents could be set .
" the africa cup is a spectacular event for africans , one that 's almost more important than the world cup , " pfister told sid .
" you ca n't cancel events like these .
you quickly put yourself in a position where you can be blackmailed . "
in the purely sporting realm , though , the attack has caused football managers outside africa to question the africa cup .
clubs throughout europe were never happy about being forced to allow their employees to take part in the biennial event , and friday 's incident has fuelled arguments that the rules need to be changed .
borussia dortmund sports director michael zorc says teams should have the right to make decisions based on players ' safety .
" until that becomes the case , we ca n't bring our players back because they would then be suspended , " zorc told the frankfurter allegeimeine zeitung .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the shooting has been a huge blow for african football stuttgart commercial manager horst heldt , whose defender arthur boka plays for ivory coast , feels much the same way .
" the ideal thing for me would be if arthur could just come back , " heldt told the same paper .
ultimately , the attack on togo 's national team is going to force everyone concerned to take a realistic look at where africa and international football fit together .
fifa 's decision to award south africa the world cup was a bold and inclusive gesture , intended to signal that the world 's poorest continent was a full-fledged member in the global soccer community .
experts like pfister know that there are risks attached to that decision , but argue that those risks should not be allowed to overshadow all other aspects of the world 's biggest sporting event .
that will surely be one of the main topics of discussion for the duration of the africa cup and in the run-up to the world cup in south africa .

and debates about safety are sure to continue . like all europe 's major football leagues , the german bundesliga has a number of players competing in the africa cup of nations in angola .
the first priority for clubs when the news of the attack broke was to contact their players and offer to fly them out of africa .
hanover , for example , were concerned about their tunisian defender karim haggui .
" karim told our sports directorship that he feels safe right now , " hanover spokesman andreas kundt told the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung newspaper .
three members of the togolese delegation were killed on friday when separatist rebels in an angolan enclave opened fire on the team bus .
a reserve goalkeeper had to be flown to south africa for emergency treatment for life-threatening gunshot wounds .
the togolese team subsequently quit the tournament and flew home .
bildunterschrift : the togolese team was flown home over the weekend " i was afraid for my life , " togolese defender assimiou toure , who plays for bayer leverkusen , told reporters .
" all i could do was jump under my seat and pray . "
thus far , no african player has asked his german club to get him out of angola .
but the shooting has occasioned furious debate about both the africa cup and safety in general on the continent ahead of the world 's premier soccer event .
relative safety ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany keeper rene adler has said he 's worried about the world cup in south africa international football functionaries , from fifa president sepp blatter on down , have been quick to offer assurances that the shooting in angola did not mean that this summer 's world cup in south africa would be unsafe .
" the measures taken for the africa cup are not comparable with those for a football world cup , which are planned years in advance , " german world cup advisor horst r. schmidt told the frankfurter rundschau newspaper .
indeed , south africa and angola are very different countries .
still , some likely members of the german national team at the world cup said they were worried .
" it 's completely sick , " germany 's top goalkeeper rene adler told the bild am sonntag newspaper .
" i have to ask how they 're going to ensure security at the world cup .
i 'm sure we 'll be safe as a team , but what about family members ? "
other team members had comparable reactions .
' when you hear something like that , you do a double take and start thinking , " germany midfielder bastian schweinsteiger told the sid sports news agency .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : otto pfister coached in africa for four decades german coach otto pfister , who spent most of his career working in africa and who coached the togolese team at the 2006 world cup , offered a more first-hand view .
he said that the world cup would not be especially risky but that different standards applied to africa .
" the security measures are , of course , not comparable with those in germany , " pfister said in an interview with sid .
" in this area , just as in the economy , we 're talking about developing countries .
and the distances are enormous .
how can they be expected to keep all of such vast distances completely under control ? "
hard choices bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stuttgart 's arthur boka -lrb- right -rrb- is one of the bundesliga players competing in angola the attack has focused attention on a number of issues , both for football and society in general .
for instance , pfister is among those who have criticized the togolese decision to withdraw from the tournament , which was ordered by togo 's prime minister .
he has said togo 's pull-out will only encourage extremist groups in angola , and he fears that wrong precedents could be set .
" the africa cup is a spectacular event for africans , one that 's almost more important than the world cup , " pfister told sid .
" you ca n't cancel events like these .
you quickly put yourself in a position where you can be blackmailed . "
in the purely sporting realm , though , the attack has caused football managers outside africa to question the africa cup .
clubs throughout europe were never happy about being forced to allow their employees to take part in the biennial event , and friday 's incident has fuelled arguments that the rules need to be changed .
borussia dortmund sports director michael zorc says teams should have the right to make decisions based on players ' safety .
" until that becomes the case , we ca n't bring our players back because they would then be suspended , " zorc told the frankfurter allegeimeine zeitung .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the shooting has been a huge blow for african football stuttgart commercial manager horst heldt , whose defender arthur boka plays for ivory coast , feels much the same way .
" the ideal thing for me would be if arthur could just come back , " heldt told the same paper .
ultimately , the attack on togo 's national team is going to force everyone concerned to take a realistic look at where africa and international football fit together .
fifa 's decision to award south africa the world cup was a bold and inclusive gesture , intended to signal that the world 's poorest continent was a full-fledged member in the global soccer community .
experts like pfister know that there are risks attached to that decision , but argue that those risks should not be allowed to overshadow all other aspects of the world 's biggest sporting event .
that will surely be one of the main topics of discussion for the duration of the africa cup and in the run-up to the world cup in south africa .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de soccer -pipe- 11.01.2010 european footballers express concern , criticism after africa cup shooting großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the africa cup has gone ahead , but questions are being asked about security concern for african teammates and worries about safety at the world cup were the main reactions of european footballers following the deadly attack on togo 's national team .
and debates about safety are sure to continue . like all europe 's major football leagues , the german bundesliga has a number of players competing in the africa cup of nations in angola .
the first priority for clubs when the news of the attack broke was to contact their players and offer to fly them out of africa .
hanover , for example , were concerned about their tunisian defender karim haggui .
" karim told our sports directorship that he feels safe right now , " hanover spokesman andreas kundt told the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung newspaper .
three members of the togolese delegation were killed on friday when separatist rebels in an angolan enclave opened fire on the team bus .
a reserve goalkeeper had to be flown to south africa for emergency treatment for life-threatening gunshot wounds .
the togolese team subsequently quit the tournament and flew home .
bildunterschrift : the togolese team was flown home over the weekend " i was afraid for my life , " togolese defender assimiou toure , who plays for bayer leverkusen , told reporters .
" all i could do was jump under my seat and pray . "
thus far , no african player has asked his german club to get him out of angola .
but the shooting has occasioned furious debate about both the africa cup and safety in general on the continent ahead of the world 's premier soccer event .
relative safety ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany keeper rene adler has said he 's worried about the world cup in south africa international football functionaries , from fifa president sepp blatter on down , have been quick to offer assurances that the shooting in angola did not mean that this summer 's world cup in south africa would be unsafe .
" the measures taken for the africa cup are not comparable with those for a football world cup , which are planned years in advance , " german world cup advisor horst r. schmidt told the frankfurter rundschau newspaper .
indeed , south africa and angola are very different countries .
still , some likely members of the german national team at the world cup said they were worried .
" it 's completely sick , " germany 's top goalkeeper rene adler told the bild am sonntag newspaper .
" i have to ask how they 're going to ensure security at the world cup .
i 'm sure we 'll be safe as a team , but what about family members ? "
other team members had comparable reactions .
' when you hear something like that , you do a double take and start thinking , " germany midfielder bastian schweinsteiger told the sid sports news agency .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : otto pfister coached in africa for four decades german coach otto pfister , who spent most of his career working in africa and who coached the togolese team at the 2006 world cup , offered a more first-hand view .
he said that the world cup would not be especially risky but that different standards applied to africa .
" the security measures are , of course , not comparable with those in germany , " pfister said in an interview with sid .
" in this area , just as in the economy , we 're talking about developing countries .
and the distances are enormous .
how can they be expected to keep all of such vast distances completely under control ? "
hard choices bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stuttgart 's arthur boka -lrb- right -rrb- is one of the bundesliga players competing in angola the attack has focused attention on a number of issues , both for football and society in general .
for instance , pfister is among those who have criticized the togolese decision to withdraw from the tournament , which was ordered by togo 's prime minister .
he has said togo 's pull-out will only encourage extremist groups in angola , and he fears that wrong precedents could be set .
" the africa cup is a spectacular event for africans , one that 's almost more important than the world cup , " pfister told sid .
" you ca n't cancel events like these .
you quickly put yourself in a position where you can be blackmailed . "
in the purely sporting realm , though , the attack has caused football managers outside africa to question the africa cup .
clubs throughout europe were never happy about being forced to allow their employees to take part in the biennial event , and friday 's incident has fuelled arguments that the rules need to be changed .
borussia dortmund sports director michael zorc says teams should have the right to make decisions based on players ' safety .
" until that becomes the case , we ca n't bring our players back because they would then be suspended , " zorc told the frankfurter allegeimeine zeitung .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the shooting has been a huge blow for african football stuttgart commercial manager horst heldt , whose defender arthur boka plays for ivory coast , feels much the same way .
" the ideal thing for me would be if arthur could just come back , " heldt told the same paper .
ultimately , the attack on togo 's national team is going to force everyone concerned to take a realistic look at where africa and international football fit together .
fifa 's decision to award south africa the world cup was a bold and inclusive gesture , intended to signal that the world 's poorest continent was a full-fledged member in the global soccer community .
experts like pfister know that there are risks attached to that decision , but argue that those risks should not be allowed to overshadow all other aspects of the world 's biggest sporting event .
that will surely be one of the main topics of discussion for the duration of the africa cup and in the run-up to the world cup in south africa .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de soccer -pipe- 11.01.2010 european footballers express concern , criticism after africa cup shooting großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the africa cup has gone ahead , but questions are being asked about security concern for african teammates and worries about safety at the world cup were the main reactions of european footballers following the deadly attack on togo 's national team .
and debates about safety are sure to continue . like all europe 's major football leagues , the german bundesliga has a number of players competing in the africa cup of nations in angola .
the first priority for clubs when the news of the attack broke was to contact their players and offer to fly them out of africa .
hanover , for example , were concerned about their tunisian defender karim haggui .
" karim told our sports directorship that he feels safe right now , " hanover spokesman andreas kundt told the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung newspaper .
three members of the togolese delegation were killed on friday when separatist rebels in an angolan enclave opened fire on the team bus .
a reserve goalkeeper had to be flown to south africa for emergency treatment for life-threatening gunshot wounds .
the togolese team subsequently quit the tournament and flew home .
bildunterschrift : the togolese team was flown home over the weekend " i was afraid for my life , " togolese defender assimiou toure , who plays for bayer leverkusen , told reporters .
" all i could do was jump under my seat and pray . "
thus far , no african player has asked his german club to get him out of angola .
but the shooting has occasioned furious debate about both the africa cup and safety in general on the continent ahead of the world 's premier soccer event .
relative safety ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany keeper rene adler has said he 's worried about the world cup in south africa international football functionaries , from fifa president sepp blatter on down , have been quick to offer assurances that the shooting in angola did not mean that this summer 's world cup in south africa would be unsafe .
" the measures taken for the africa cup are not comparable with those for a football world cup , which are planned years in advance , " german world cup advisor horst r. schmidt told the frankfurter rundschau newspaper .
indeed , south africa and angola are very different countries .
still , some likely members of the german national team at the world cup said they were worried .
" it 's completely sick , " germany 's top goalkeeper rene adler told the bild am sonntag newspaper .
" i have to ask how they 're going to ensure security at the world cup .
i 'm sure we 'll be safe as a team , but what about family members ? "
other team members had comparable reactions .
' when you hear something like that , you do a double take and start thinking , " germany midfielder bastian schweinsteiger told the sid sports news agency .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : otto pfister coached in africa for four decades german coach otto pfister , who spent most of his career working in africa and who coached the togolese team at the 2006 world cup , offered a more first-hand view .
he said that the world cup would not be especially risky but that different standards applied to africa .
" the security measures are , of course , not comparable with those in germany , " pfister said in an interview with sid .
" in this area , just as in the economy , we 're talking about developing countries .
and the distances are enormous .
how can they be expected to keep all of such vast distances completely under control ? "
hard choices bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stuttgart 's arthur boka -lrb- right -rrb- is one of the bundesliga players competing in angola the attack has focused attention on a number of issues , both for football and society in general .
for instance , pfister is among those who have criticized the togolese decision to withdraw from the tournament , which was ordered by togo 's prime minister .
he has said togo 's pull-out will only encourage extremist groups in angola , and he fears that wrong precedents could be set .
" the africa cup is a spectacular event for africans , one that 's almost more important than the world cup , " pfister told sid .
" you ca n't cancel events like these .
you quickly put yourself in a position where you can be blackmailed . "
in the purely sporting realm , though , the attack has caused football managers outside africa to question the africa cup .
clubs throughout europe were never happy about being forced to allow their employees to take part in the biennial event , and friday 's incident has fuelled arguments that the rules need to be changed .
borussia dortmund sports director michael zorc says teams should have the right to make decisions based on players ' safety .
" until that becomes the case , we ca n't bring our players back because they would then be suspended , " zorc told the frankfurter allegeimeine zeitung .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the shooting has been a huge blow for african football stuttgart commercial manager horst heldt , whose defender arthur boka plays for ivory coast , feels much the same way .
" the ideal thing for me would be if arthur could just come back , " heldt told the same paper .
ultimately , the attack on togo 's national team is going to force everyone concerned to take a realistic look at where africa and international football fit together .
fifa 's decision to award south africa the world cup was a bold and inclusive gesture , intended to signal that the world 's poorest continent was a full-fledged member in the global soccer community .
experts like pfister know that there are risks attached to that decision , but argue that those risks should not be allowed to overshadow all other aspects of the world 's biggest sporting event .
that will surely be one of the main topics of discussion for the duration of the africa cup and in the run-up to the world cup in south africa .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de afghanistan -pipe- 11.01.2010 from bundeswehr doctor to traumatized soldier : one woman 's story großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bundeswehr 's men and women are soldiers first bundeswehr personnel in afghanistan are expected to hold dual roles .
heike groos joined up as a doctor but eventually found out that she was also expected to be a soldier , an experience that had long-lasting effects . when heike groos joined the bundeswehr as a doctor more than 20 years ago , she confesses it was just because she was looking for a job .
back in 1987 , when she started working as an emergency medical officer in a germany army hospital , she was still only a doctor .
that changed when she was sent to afghanistan in 2002 .
she became a doctor - and a soldier .
when groos was sent out to afghanistan , she did so without any question and without any concern .
even when it became obvious that she was now both a doctor and a soldier , armed with a weapon to protect her patients if necessary , she knew that this is what service in afghanistan was like .
it was as much part of the job as helping comrades and afghans alike as part of an emergency military ambulance team .
" at the beginning , in 2002 , it was a completely satisfying job , " she says .
" each moment made me think that we were doing something meaningful there .
just being there symbolized to the people that there was peace and that we would ensure that it remained that way , through our medical and humanitarian work there . "
suicide attack changes everything bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heike groos was first on the scene at the bomb blast but the positive feelings did not endure .
the situation changed dramatically with a suicide attack on a bus carrying german soldiers in june 2003 .
six bundeswehr troops were killed and 29 were injured , some seriously .
heike groos was one of the first on the scene ; she bandaged wounds , called for assistance , coordinated the medical efforts , comforted the injured and watched comrades die .
the event and the huge shock changed her and her colleagues ' lives forever .
" after that first suicide attack in june 2003 , we changed and we became deeply , deeply distrustful because we could not at all differentiate between the people , " she says .
" who is taliban and who is not , who is good and who is bad ? that was never clear to me . "
as well as suspicion and caution , heike groos says she felt rage ; rage against the taliban who had carried out the attack , rage against afghanistan , and rage against germany - the country which had sent her there .
she and her comrades also withdrew from the people they were supposed to be helping .
" we withdrew ourselves and wanted nothing do to with anything afghan , " she admits .
" it was because we saw those that we had come to help as those who had attacked us .
this perspective shifted in time , and we recognized that those who were friendly before still were but we were always more cautious after that .
i was never as trusting again . "
disillusionment leads to decision to leave bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : groos decided that her 2007 tour would be her last after the attack , her unit became closer , even more like a family than before .
her younger male comrades looked for comfort and assurance from the older , more experienced heike groos .
but there was no comfort for her .
groos started to see little sense in what she was doing , confined and isolated in the base due to the increasing dangers outside .
she decided that it could not go on .
she returned to afghanistan for the last time in 2007 .
groos says that people could not understand why she went back but she says she wanted to complete her service .
" people looked at me like i was an alien when i walked out of our house in my uniform , " she says .
" i was never at home and people asked my children , ' where is your mother ? ' and they would say ' she is in afghanistan ' . "
when she returned , people would stay out of her way .
her second husband also did n't understand and eventually he and groos divorced .
it was then that she decided that she wanted to leave everything behind and take her children to the other side of the world to start again .
she and three of her five kids moved to new zealand , as far away from afghanistan and germany as possible in order to find peace .
distance does n't end afghanistan trauma bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the horrors of aghanistan have never left heike groos but afghanistan did not release her from its grip .
groos continued to suffer from her experiences , suffering from nightmares and the inability to sleep .
she was also cut off from any kind of support from her previous employer : the bundeswehr .
" i had fulfilled my obligation -lrb- to the bundeswehr -rrb- and i found that very hard , " she says .
" i wish that someone had supported me and had not left me alone , but that did not happen , and i am sad about it .
they pushed me away , sent me to the army physician , to the psychiatrist who said ' you are traumatized . '
and then german people said : ' you were probably not hard enough , soldiers must always be tough . " '
while things were difficult for a long while , in time they also started to get better for heike groos and she began dealing with her experiences in afghanistan and working through her experiences .
the result was her first book , published last year , based on her time there : ' a beautiful day to die ' .

vw wants its cars to escape their niche status and hit the mass market . just prior to the opening of the annual detroit auto show on monday , german carmaker volkswagen announced it plans for ramping up its presence in the united states , aiming to win over american consumers and sell twice the number of cars it does now in three to four years ' time .
" we will sell 400,000 to 450,000 vehicles in 2012/13 , " said stefan jacoby , head of volkswagen of america , on sunday , adding that the company 's us business could become profitable by 2013 . volkswagen , europe 's largest carmaker , has had a hard time finding its footing in the all-important us market .
its presence in china and brazil is strong and sales in germany have been helped by a government program last year that encouraged drivers to trade in old gas guzzlers for more for efficient cars .
in europe , vw has 21 percent of the market .
but vw market share in the us , including its audi brand , is only three percent .
part of the reason for that , according to analysts , has to do with the generally dismal state of the car industry in the wake of global recession .
although , vw 's small market share actually gave it a bit of a foot up since it was not as hard hit by the collapse of american auto sales as some of its rivals were .
american preferences bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vw has been trying to figure out how to fit the pieces together for the us market vw 's lackluster performance can also be traced back to its product line , which was not ideally suited to americans ' taste in cars .
" volkswagen was neither a premium brand like mercedes , nor a mass-market brand , " said marc tonn , a senior analyst at m.m. warburg .
" the company was kind of stuck in the middle . "
the wolfsburg-based concern focused on smaller or mid-size cars with highly advanced technological features when americans were more interested in buying larger vehicles , such as suvs or pick-up trucks .
" i think the focus will now be on maintaining german quality , but going a little in the direction of us size , " tonn added .
nevertheless , vw will not likely be turning out tank-like vehicles any time soon .
jacoby said he expects the market for compact and mid-sized sedans to increase faster than other segments , especially if oil prices convince more americans to downsize from their chevy tahoes and ford explorers .
" with higher oil prices , the us consumer is perhaps going to look a little more closely at smaller cars , " said christian breitsprecher , an auto analyst at sol oppenheim . from the niche to the masses volkswagen , which ranks behind brands like hyundai , honda , mercedes and bmw in the us , wants to emerge from its position as a niche carmaker to a mass-market product , one that can compete with extremely popular makes , such as toyota 's camry .
while the beetle quickly became a cult classic in the us and enjoyed great popularity in the 1960s and early 1970s , vw was never able to imitate its success with subsequent makes , such as its rabbit .
the company closed its last us plant in 1988 in pennsylvania amid sluggish sales .
" the rabbit was a flop and vw never really was able to get back in the mass market after that , " said breitsprecher , who added that volkswagen cars remained niche products .
" i mean , who bought a jetta ?
mostly college kids who could n't afford bmws . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : volkswagen beetle - a hit in america but vw wants a follow-up success becoming a mass-market car in the us is essential to vw 's ambitious expansion plans for the coming years , which include surpassing main rival toyota , the world 's largest automaker by sales volume .
new investments volkswagen is building a new plant in chattanooga , tennessee , investing up to $ 1 billion -lrb- 694 million euros -rrb- in a facility that , according to us head jacoby , " will enable the turnaround of vw 's us operations " and should create around 2,000 jobs .
increasing production and purchasing in the dollar zone is crucial to vw 's return to profitability as it would lower the company 's exposure to a dollar that is weak compared to the euro .
the carmaker is also spending $ 125 million on two new dealerships in new york city , which will begin sales in 2010 .
they are part of the company 's strategy to increase its presence and visibility in the us .
jacoby said he thinks the worst of the automobile sector 's woes to be behind them , with american car sales likely to be 11 million to 11.5 million in 2010 .
because of a stabilization of the labor and real-estate markets , " we are a little bit more optimistic now than we were a few months ago , " he said on sunday .
he added that he expects the us car sales to stabilize at around 15 million over the medium term , and vw 's longer-term us plans include selling 800,000 vehicles a year by 2018 .
" the us is a critical component of vw 's long-term strategy , " said analyst tonn .
" despite all the euphoria about emerging markets these days , if you want to be a global player you have to do well in america . "

vw wants its cars to escape their niche status and hit the mass market . just prior to the opening of the annual detroit auto show on monday , german carmaker volkswagen announced it plans for ramping up its presence in the united states , aiming to win over american consumers and sell twice the number of cars it does now in three to four years ' time .
" we will sell 400,000 to 450,000 vehicles in 2012/13 , " said stefan jacoby , head of volkswagen of america , on sunday , adding that the company 's us business could become profitable by 2013 . volkswagen , europe 's largest carmaker , has had a hard time finding its footing in the all-important us market .
its presence in china and brazil is strong and sales in germany have been helped by a government program last year that encouraged drivers to trade in old gas guzzlers for more for efficient cars .
in europe , vw has 21 percent of the market .
but vw market share in the us , including its audi brand , is only three percent .
part of the reason for that , according to analysts , has to do with the generally dismal state of the car industry in the wake of global recession .
although , vw 's small market share actually gave it a bit of a foot up since it was not as hard hit by the collapse of american auto sales as some of its rivals were .
american preferences bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vw has been trying to figure out how to fit the pieces together for the us market vw 's lackluster performance can also be traced back to its product line , which was not ideally suited to americans ' taste in cars .
" volkswagen was neither a premium brand like mercedes , nor a mass-market brand , " said marc tonn , a senior analyst at m.m. warburg .
" the company was kind of stuck in the middle . "
the wolfsburg-based concern focused on smaller or mid-size cars with highly advanced technological features when americans were more interested in buying larger vehicles , such as suvs or pick-up trucks .
" i think the focus will now be on maintaining german quality , but going a little in the direction of us size , " tonn added .
nevertheless , vw will not likely be turning out tank-like vehicles any time soon .
jacoby said he expects the market for compact and mid-sized sedans to increase faster than other segments , especially if oil prices convince more americans to downsize from their chevy tahoes and ford explorers .
" with higher oil prices , the us consumer is perhaps going to look a little more closely at smaller cars , " said christian breitsprecher , an auto analyst at sol oppenheim . from the niche to the masses volkswagen , which ranks behind brands like hyundai , honda , mercedes and bmw in the us , wants to emerge from its position as a niche carmaker to a mass-market product , one that can compete with extremely popular makes , such as toyota 's camry .
while the beetle quickly became a cult classic in the us and enjoyed great popularity in the 1960s and early 1970s , vw was never able to imitate its success with subsequent makes , such as its rabbit .
the company closed its last us plant in 1988 in pennsylvania amid sluggish sales .
" the rabbit was a flop and vw never really was able to get back in the mass market after that , " said breitsprecher , who added that volkswagen cars remained niche products .
" i mean , who bought a jetta ?
mostly college kids who could n't afford bmws . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : volkswagen beetle - a hit in america but vw wants a follow-up success becoming a mass-market car in the us is essential to vw 's ambitious expansion plans for the coming years , which include surpassing main rival toyota , the world 's largest automaker by sales volume .
new investments volkswagen is building a new plant in chattanooga , tennessee , investing up to $ 1 billion -lrb- 694 million euros -rrb- in a facility that , according to us head jacoby , " will enable the turnaround of vw 's us operations " and should create around 2,000 jobs .
increasing production and purchasing in the dollar zone is crucial to vw 's return to profitability as it would lower the company 's exposure to a dollar that is weak compared to the euro .
the carmaker is also spending $ 125 million on two new dealerships in new york city , which will begin sales in 2010 .
they are part of the company 's strategy to increase its presence and visibility in the us .
jacoby said he thinks the worst of the automobile sector 's woes to be behind them , with american car sales likely to be 11 million to 11.5 million in 2010 .
because of a stabilization of the labor and real-estate markets , " we are a little bit more optimistic now than we were a few months ago , " he said on sunday .
he added that he expects the us car sales to stabilize at around 15 million over the medium term , and vw 's longer-term us plans include selling 800,000 vehicles a year by 2018 .

new investments volkswagen is building a new plant in chattanooga , tennessee , investing up to $ 1 billion -lrb- 694 million euros -rrb- in a facility that , according to us head jacoby , " will enable the turnaround of vw 's us operations " and should create around 2,000 jobs .
increasing production and purchasing in the dollar zone is crucial to vw 's return to profitability as it would lower the company 's exposure to a dollar that is weak compared to the euro .
the carmaker is also spending $ 125 million on two new dealerships in new york city , which will begin sales in 2010 .
they are part of the company 's strategy to increase its presence and visibility in the us .
jacoby said he thinks the worst of the automobile sector 's woes to be behind them , with american car sales likely to be 11 million to 11.5 million in 2010 .
because of a stabilization of the labor and real-estate markets , " we are a little bit more optimistic now than we were a few months ago , " he said on sunday .
he added that he expects the us car sales to stabilize at around 15 million over the medium term , and vw 's longer-term us plans include selling 800,000 vehicles a year by 2018 .
" the us is a critical component of vw 's long-term strategy , " said analyst tonn .
" despite all the euphoria about emerging markets these days , if you want to be a global player you have to do well in america . "

two squad members and a driver died in the ambush . " if a team or some people present themselves under the togolese flag , it will be a false representation , " gilbert houngbo told journalists in the capital lome on sunday , january 10 .
previously , the togolese national soccer team had reportedly decided to take part in the africa cup of nations in spite of friday 's deadly ambush by gunmen on their convoy in angola .
a report on the website of the french sports daily , l 'equipe , said that the players had decided to ignore the call from togo 's government for the side to return home .
the report quoted alaixys romao , togo 's midfielder , as saying that the unanimous decision to stay and take part in the tournament was taken to honor the dead and wounded .
and also in order to deny the rebels any satisfaction .
the attack by hooded gunmen claimed the lives of togo 's assistant coach and its squad spokesman along with one of the drivers of the convoy .
the togolese backup goalkeeper , kodjovi obilale , reportedly sustained two gunshot wounds in the attack and was flown to south africa for treatment .
he is said to be in a stable condition .
seven others were also injured in the incident on friday , including defender serge akakpo of the romanian team vaslui .
the other injured passengers included two squad doctors and a journalist .
major sporting event bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : togo 's players at the at the world cup stadium in frankfurt , germany angola is playing host to the 2010 africa cup of nations , and is one of africa 's major sporting event .
the attack threatens to overshadow the tournament which is to take place over the next three weeks .
the assailants opened fire on the vehicles as they travelled from cabinda , an angolan enclave to the north of the country .
the attack lasted some 20 minutes .
responsibility for the assault has been claimed by the separatist group , the front for the liberation of the enclave of cabinda -lrb- flec -rrb- .
the angolan minister in charge of affairs in cabinda , antonio bento bembe , said that the attack was " an act of terrorism . "
the oil-producing region of cabinda has been the site of a decades-long struggle for independence by the separatist group flec .
despite this , it is scheduled to play host to seven tournament matches this month. td / dfm / afp / reuters / ap / l 'equipe editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

his post will be filled by trade and industry minister arlene foster . robinson agreed to the move on monday so that the scandal surrounding his wife 's affair could be settled .
calls for robinson 's resignation escalated over the weekend , as several key politicians feared his wife 's scandal could cause the region 's power-sharing executive to collapse .

two squad members and a driver died in the ambush . " if a team or some people present themselves under the togolese flag , it will be a false representation , " gilbert houngbo told journalists in the capital lome on sunday , january 10 .
previously , the togolese national soccer team had reportedly decided to take part in the africa cup of nations in spite of friday 's deadly ambush by gunmen on their convoy in angola .
a report on the website of the french sports daily , l 'equipe , said that the players had decided to ignore the call from togo 's government for the side to return home .

the attack by hooded gunmen claimed the lives of togo 's assistant coach and its squad spokesman along with one of the drivers of the convoy .

" based on his talks in the gulf , westerwelle made the quick decision to go to yemen and get a sense of the situation on the ground , " a member of the german delegation told reporters .
destabilization " spreads terror " the foreign minister was concerned that destablilization in yemen could help fuel the spread of terrorism , the official said .
westerwelle has previously warned that yemen is a sanctuary for terrorists .
after informing european allies and washington of his visit , he is believed to have delivered a message calling for stable government in the country .
yemen is under scrutiny after it was revealed that umar farouk abdulmutallab , the nigerian man who allegedly tried to blow up a us-bound jet on christmas day , prepared for his mission in yemen .
call to deal with disputes the official said that westerwelle would also " press for good governance , " try to address the issue of corruption in yemen and call for dialogue to resolve internal disputes .
the government is engaged in conflicts with separatists in the north and south of the country , as well as with al-qaeda militants .
germany is the biggest european contributor of aid to yemen by far , with about 79 million euros -lrb- $ 114 million -rrb- set aside for the country for 2010 to 2011 .
the country is the poorest on the arabian peninsula .
following talks , westerwelle said that the yemeni government had revealed that it knew the whereabouts of five germans , including three children , who were kidnapped in the country six months ago. rc / afp / reuters / dpa / apn editor : chuck penfold charles duguid penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" based on his talks in the gulf , westerwelle made the quick decision to go to yemen and get a sense of the situation on the ground , " a member of the german delegation told reporters .
destabilization " spreads terror " the foreign minister was concerned that destablilization in yemen could help fuel the spread of terrorism , the official said .
westerwelle has previously warned that yemen is a sanctuary for terrorists .
after informing european allies and washington of his visit , he is believed to have delivered a message calling for stable government in the country .
yemen is under scrutiny after it was revealed that umar farouk abdulmutallab , the nigerian man who allegedly tried to blow up a us-bound jet on christmas day , prepared for his mission in yemen .
call to deal with disputes the official said that westerwelle would also " press for good governance , " try to address the issue of corruption in yemen and call for dialogue to resolve internal disputes .
the government is engaged in conflicts with separatists in the north and south of the country , as well as with al-qaeda militants .
germany is the biggest european contributor of aid to yemen by far , with about 79 million euros -lrb- $ 114 million -rrb- set aside for the country for 2010 to 2011 .
the country is the poorest on the arabian peninsula .

heike groos joined up as a doctor but eventually found out that she was also expected to be a soldier , an experience that had long-lasting effects . when heike groos joined the bundeswehr as a doctor more than 20 years ago , she confesses it was just because she was looking for a job .
back in 1987 , when she started working as an emergency medical officer in a germany army hospital , she was still only a doctor .
that changed when she was sent to afghanistan in 2002 .
she became a doctor - and a soldier .
when groos was sent out to afghanistan , she did so without any question and without any concern .
even when it became obvious that she was now both a doctor and a soldier , armed with a weapon to protect her patients if necessary , she knew that this is what service in afghanistan was like .
it was as much part of the job as helping comrades and afghans alike as part of an emergency military ambulance team .
" at the beginning , in 2002 , it was a completely satisfying job , " she says .
" each moment made me think that we were doing something meaningful there .
just being there symbolized to the people that there was peace and that we would ensure that it remained that way , through our medical and humanitarian work there . "
suicide attack changes everything bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heike groos was first on the scene at the bomb blast but the positive feelings did not endure .
the situation changed dramatically with a suicide attack on a bus carrying german soldiers in june 2003 .
six bundeswehr troops were killed and 29 were injured , some seriously .
heike groos was one of the first on the scene ; she bandaged wounds , called for assistance , coordinated the medical efforts , comforted the injured and watched comrades die .
the event and the huge shock changed her and her colleagues ' lives forever .
" after that first suicide attack in june 2003 , we changed and we became deeply , deeply distrustful because we could not at all differentiate between the people , " she says .
" who is taliban and who is not , who is good and who is bad ? that was never clear to me . "
as well as suspicion and caution , heike groos says she felt rage ; rage against the taliban who had carried out the attack , rage against afghanistan , and rage against germany - the country which had sent her there .
she and her comrades also withdrew from the people they were supposed to be helping .
" we withdrew ourselves and wanted nothing do to with anything afghan , " she admits .
" it was because we saw those that we had come to help as those who had attacked us .
this perspective shifted in time , and we recognized that those who were friendly before still were but we were always more cautious after that .
i was never as trusting again . "
disillusionment leads to decision to leave bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : groos decided that her 2007 tour would be her last after the attack , her unit became closer , even more like a family than before .
her younger male comrades looked for comfort and assurance from the older , more experienced heike groos .
but there was no comfort for her .
groos started to see little sense in what she was doing , confined and isolated in the base due to the increasing dangers outside .
she decided that it could not go on .
she returned to afghanistan for the last time in 2007 .
groos says that people could not understand why she went back but she says she wanted to complete her service .
" people looked at me like i was an alien when i walked out of our house in my uniform , " she says .
" i was never at home and people asked my children , ' where is your mother ? ' and they would say ' she is in afghanistan ' . "
when she returned , people would stay out of her way .
her second husband also did n't understand and eventually he and groos divorced .
it was then that she decided that she wanted to leave everything behind and take her children to the other side of the world to start again .
she and three of her five kids moved to new zealand , as far away from afghanistan and germany as possible in order to find peace .
distance does n't end afghanistan trauma bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the horrors of aghanistan have never left heike groos but afghanistan did not release her from its grip .
groos continued to suffer from her experiences , suffering from nightmares and the inability to sleep .
she was also cut off from any kind of support from her previous employer : the bundeswehr .
" i had fulfilled my obligation -lrb- to the bundeswehr -rrb- and i found that very hard , " she says .
" i wish that someone had supported me and had not left me alone , but that did not happen , and i am sad about it .
they pushed me away , sent me to the army physician , to the psychiatrist who said ' you are traumatized . '
and then german people said : ' you were probably not hard enough , soldiers must always be tough . " '
while things were difficult for a long while , in time they also started to get better for heike groos and she began dealing with her experiences in afghanistan and working through her experiences .
the result was her first book , published last year , based on her time there : ' a beautiful day to die ' .

" based on his talks in the gulf , westerwelle made the quick decision to go to yemen and get a sense of the situation on the ground , " a member of the german delegation told reporters .
destabilization " spreads terror " the foreign minister was concerned that destablilization in yemen could help fuel the spread of terrorism , the official said .
westerwelle has previously warned that yemen is a sanctuary for terrorists .
after informing european allies and washington of his visit , he is believed to have delivered a message calling for stable government in the country .
yemen is under scrutiny after it was revealed that umar farouk abdulmutallab , the nigerian man who allegedly tried to blow up a us-bound jet on christmas day , prepared for his mission in yemen .
call to deal with disputes the official said that westerwelle would also " press for good governance , " try to address the issue of corruption in yemen and call for dialogue to resolve internal disputes .
the government is engaged in conflicts with separatists in the north and south of the country , as well as with al-qaeda militants .
germany is the biggest european contributor of aid to yemen by far , with about 79 million euros -lrb- $ 114 million -rrb- set aside for the country for 2010 to 2011 .
the country is the poorest on the arabian peninsula .
following talks , westerwelle said that the yemeni government had revealed that it knew the whereabouts of five germans , including three children , who were kidnapped in the country six months ago. rc / afp / reuters / dpa / apn editor : chuck penfold charles duguid penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 11.01.2010 a major drugstore chain is criticized for forcing employees to take lower wages großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schlecker has terminated its relationship with meniar the german drugstore chain schlecker is taking heat for reportedly forcing employees to take contracts as lower-paid temporary workers to save on business costs .
but is it really against the law ? the schlecker drugstore mega-chain has come under heavy criticism for alleged wage dumping . the trade union verdi has accused schlecker of forcing its employees to take new contracts through a temporary employment agency called meniar , which pays only half of the usual hourly wage , about 6.70 euros -lrb- $ 9.73 -rrb- instead of 12.50 euros -lrb- $ 18.17 -rrb- . it also said it believed meniar was entirely controled by schlecker . politicians protest the labor minister in the german state of north rhine-westphalia , karl josef laumann , has also accused schlecker of systematic wage evasion . the süddeutsche zeitung newspaper reported that laumann wrote a letter to schlecker employees stating that temporary work is designed to compensate for operating peaks or in the case of vacation or illness , not to replace permanent staff . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schlecker has about 50,000 employees throughout europe federal labor minister ursula von der leyen appeared on a sunday evening talk show and said that the case would have to be examined closely to see if there abuse is abuse . she added that the federal employment agency -lrb- ba -rrb- is responsible for ensuring that every temporary employment agency has a license that must be renewed regularly . " there is a proper procedure , " she said .
" we are not in the wild west . " is it illegal ? however , a ba spokeswoman denied that schlecker ’ s actions were illegal . " the temporary employment act does not preclude sacking workers and replacing them with ones from a temporary employment agency under worse conditions , " said a ba spokeswoman on monday . she added the government would have to change the laws in order to prohibit similar actions . still , the association of temporary work agencies -lrb- bza -rrb- has been quick to distance itself from the business policies of schlecker . " such business practices are not consistent with the original meaning of temporary work and hurt the reputation of all temporary employment agencies , " bza spokesman wolfram linke told deutsche welle . linke added that companies who are members of the bza have to agree to pay employees an hourly wage of at least 7.51 euros -lrb- $ 10.51 -rrb- , despite the fact that germany does not have a minimum wage . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : labor minister ursula von der leyen said the situation must be carefully examined schlecker responds schlecker has denied the allegations of wage dumping and insists that its new stores pay up to 13 euros -lrb- $ 18.89 -rrb- an hour or more .
however , head of corporate communications florian baum said monday that schlecker had resolved " effective immediately " not to pursue any further contracts with the temporary employment company meniar . achim neumann of verdi was excited to hear the news . " i think this is fantastic - obviously a tremendous amount of pressure was necessary to convince schlecker of that misusing the temporary working laws is unacceptable .
it ’ s a very positive sign , " he told deutsche welle . schlecker has often come under criticism from the unions regarding its employment practices .
it has accused verdi of using " targeted disinformation and defamation campaigns " in the past . with more than 50,000 employees and stores in 12 countries , schlecker is the largest drugstore company in europe .

one of those women is stefanie linsener whose time with the bundeswehr has included a four-month tour in afghanistan . stefanie linsener has never met tanja kreil .
but linsener , a soldier in the bundeswehr , is grateful for kreil 's fight for women like her .
in 2000 kreil won an amendment to germany 's constitution from the court of justice of the european union allowing women to take part in bundeswehr 's armed services .
up until that point they had been limited to working in the medical service or the military band .
without tanja kreil , there never would have been bundeswehr soldier stefanie linsener .
one year after the january 11 , 2000 ruling , the 18-year-old linsener joined the bundeswehr and became one of the first women trained to use weapons .
" my father was really proud of me , " she says .
" my mother had some misgivings , but she is also proud of me , of course , that i did it . " diving into an unknown world bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : linsener shows off the different types of uniforms she wears at first linsener had to get used to the drills and the tone her superiors use when speaking to her .
and she found her uniform practical but rather unfashionable " for a woman who pays attention to herself . "
linsener has a well-kept appearance and she wears jewelry when she 's working in her office .
linsener likes to laugh .
but when she , six other women and 60 male recruits had to crawl through the mud and dig out a position with a 30-kilogram -lrb- 66-pound -rrb- pack on her back and a 12-kilogram machine gun , she was n't laughing .
sometimes she wondered what the point of the exercises was , but through them she learned what her mental and physical limits were .
and she found the motivation to keep going .
" i said to myself , ' shut your eyes and get through it .
you 're doing this now , " ' she recounts .
" i think it 's true that women are a little bit more ambitious and have more willpower .
at least i did . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : men and women are treated the same in the bundeswehr , major fischer says major juergen fischer can only confirm linsener 's observations .
it 's been his experience , he said , that the female soldiers inspire the male recruits .
it 's only a matter of time , he says , before a woman is promoted to major or lieutenant colonel .
" women and men are treated equally , including with their salaries , " fischer says .
however , unlike men , women can not be required to participate in the armed services .
thus there is no conscription for female soldiers while german men are still required to serve in the bundeswehr or complete community service .
deployment a part of the job linsener can assemble her gun while blindfolded .
she knows that it 's a device that can kill but that 's part of being in the army , she says .
another part of being in the army for linsener was a four-month deployment in afghanistan .
she and her fellow soldiers worked 13 to 14 hours a day in afghanistan for four months without a day off .
spending every day armed and in a flak vest and only seeing a country from behind the safety glass in her tank taught linsener to appreciate her life in germany .
female soldiers do find it difficult to gain recognition in a male-dominated country like afghanistan , where women are hardly seen in public , she says .
when she once naively left the camp with her hair loose and uncovered , stones were thrown at her .
" this is like a woman in germany running around naked in the street , " she says she was later told . " helmet , combat boots and camouflage ready to go of those serving in the armed forces , about 17,000 or nine percent are women .

deployment a part of the job linsener can assemble her gun while blindfolded .
she knows that it 's a device that can kill but that 's part of being in the army , she says .
another part of being in the army for linsener was a four-month deployment in afghanistan .
she and her fellow soldiers worked 13 to 14 hours a day in afghanistan for four months without a day off .

but is it really against the law ? the schlecker drugstore mega-chain has come under heavy criticism for alleged wage dumping . the trade union verdi has accused schlecker of forcing its employees to take new contracts through a temporary employment agency called meniar , which pays only half of the usual hourly wage , about 6.70 euros -lrb- $ 9.73 -rrb- instead of 12.50 euros -lrb- $ 18.17 -rrb- . it also said it believed meniar was entirely controled by schlecker . politicians protest the labor minister in the german state of north rhine-westphalia , karl josef laumann , has also accused schlecker of systematic wage evasion . the süddeutsche zeitung newspaper reported that laumann wrote a letter to schlecker employees stating that temporary work is designed to compensate for operating peaks or in the case of vacation or illness , not to replace permanent staff . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schlecker has about 50,000 employees throughout europe federal labor minister ursula von der leyen appeared on a sunday evening talk show and said that the case would have to be examined closely to see if there abuse is abuse . she added that the federal employment agency -lrb- ba -rrb- is responsible for ensuring that every temporary employment agency has a license that must be renewed regularly . " there is a proper procedure , " she said .
" we are not in the wild west . " is it illegal ? however , a ba spokeswoman denied that schlecker ’ s actions were illegal . " the temporary employment act does not preclude sacking workers and replacing them with ones from a temporary employment agency under worse conditions , " said a ba spokeswoman on monday . she added the government would have to change the laws in order to prohibit similar actions . still , the association of temporary work agencies -lrb- bza -rrb- has been quick to distance itself from the business policies of schlecker . " such business practices are not consistent with the original meaning of temporary work and hurt the reputation of all temporary employment agencies , " bza spokesman wolfram linke told deutsche welle . linke added that companies who are members of the bza have to agree to pay employees an hourly wage of at least 7.51 euros -lrb- $ 10.51 -rrb- , despite the fact that germany does not have a minimum wage . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : labor minister ursula von der leyen said the situation must be carefully examined schlecker responds schlecker has denied the allegations of wage dumping and insists that its new stores pay up to 13 euros -lrb- $ 18.89 -rrb- an hour or more .
however , head of corporate communications florian baum said monday that schlecker had resolved " effective immediately " not to pursue any further contracts with the temporary employment company meniar . achim neumann of verdi was excited to hear the news . " i think this is fantastic - obviously a tremendous amount of pressure was necessary to convince schlecker of that misusing the temporary working laws is unacceptable .
it ’ s a very positive sign , " he told deutsche welle . schlecker has often come under criticism from the unions regarding its employment practices .
it has accused verdi of using " targeted disinformation and defamation campaigns " in the past . with more than 50,000 employees and stores in 12 countries , schlecker is the largest drugstore company in europe .

ashton made it clear that strengthening the international voice of the 27-nation bloc would be at the top of her agenda .
" i am convinced there is a clear call – inside the eu and around the world – for greater european engagement , to promote peace , protect the vulnerable , fight poverty and address the many problems of our time , " ashton said .
" we have to answer this call .
combining leadership and partnership .
defending our values and promoting our interests .
listening to what our partners say and making sure that when we speak , our voice is heard . "
ashton says she has already planned trips to washington , beijing and new delhi as well as eastern europe and the middle east .
" we need effective partnerships with all relevant players : the us , china and russia , but also turkey , japan , canada , india , brazil and south africa , " she said .
middle east policies with regard to iran , ashton said she feels tehran has made mistakes by rejecting a plan sponsored by the international atomic energy agency , as well as in its violent crackdown on opposition protestors .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ashton criticized iran for its handling of opposition protestors as well as for its nuclear program " if the country wants to be treated as i believe its history , geography and people deserve , it has to work with us , " said ashton .
as for the eu 's involvement in afghanistan , ashton said the bloc is already playing a decisive role in the conflict , but could contribute more in simple ways , such as by providing telephones for local afghan government offices .
ashton also touched on the israeli-palestinian conflict , commenting that a two-state solution is " vital . "
distancing from anti-nuclear past one element of ashton 's past that has raised questions is her involvement as an activist for the campaign for nuclear disarmament -lrb- cnd -rrb- , for which she came under attack from british conservative deputies .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ashton said she is no longer a member of the cnd " the relevance of the 1970s is not the relevance of 2010 , " she responded .
" i 'm not a member of cnd and have not been a member of cnd for 28 or 29 years . "
ashton was picked for the position of eu high representative after the approval of the lisbon treaty at the beginning of december last year .
she was previously a junior minister in britain 's labour government and the head of its house of lords before she was given the job of eu trade commissioner in october 2008 .
her appointment as eu high representative has faced criticism , as her only foreign policy experience was 13 months as trade commissioner. mk / dpa / afp editor : michael lawton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de development aid -pipe- 11.01.2010 yemen needs a broad development strategy , experts say großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yemen faces collapse as it runs out of both oil and water the surprise visit by the german foreign minister to yemen shows how worried the world is about the country as a haven for militants .
but experts say counterterrorism wo n't work without addressing yemen 's other woes . concerns are mounting about terrorism in yemen since the botched attempted bombing of a us airliner on christmas day .
us president barack obama has said al-qaeda 's offshoot in yemen was behind the failed attacks .
the issue was on the agenda when the german foreign minister , guido westerwelle , made a surprise visit to yemen on monday at the end of his middle east tour .
as washington ramps up its counterterrorism role in yemen and raises pressure on the government in sanaa to crack down on islamic extremists , some say that a single-minded focus on military force is deeply flawed .
" the united states and other western powers need to provide long-term economic development to reduce poverty and raise educational standards , " yemen 's foreign minister abu bakr al-qirbi said in an interview with the washington post last week .
that , he said , would help combat terrorism " in a more effective fashion than just using military force . "
that view is echoed by international aid agencies working on the ground in yemen , the arab world 's most impoverished nation .
bildunterschrift : experts warn against focusing solely on military means to fight terrorism " poverty is n't the only explanation for terrorism .
but it 's true that yemen 's extensive social and economic pressures contribute to making the country unstable - and thus make it easier for terrorist organizations to exploit people 's grievances and recruit them , " felix eikenberg , head of germany 's friedrich ebert political foundation in the capital sanaa , told deutsche welle .
germany , whose aid involvement in yemen dates back 40 years , is one of europe 's biggest donors to yemen .
massive social and economic pressures home to around 24 million people , yemen is grappling with one of the world 's highest population growth rates , rapidly depleting groundwater levels , and an unemployment rate of more than 20 percent .
the country 's economy is in tatters as it runs out of its meager oil reserves . " some 70 percent of the state 's revenues currently come from oil .
but oil reserves are dwindling so rapidly that we estimate yemen could become an oil importer in ten years , " eikenberg said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yemen faces a lethal cocktail of social and demographic problems total oil production has slumped from about 440,000 barrels per day in 2001 to 300,000 last year , according to the us energy information administration .
all that has contributed to widespread poverty in the country .
children suffer from a 50 percent malnutrition rate ; more than 40 percent of yemenis live below the poverty line , 18 percent on less than a dollar a day .
germany a major donor given the magnitude of its problems , yemen receives comparatively little per-capita international aid .
the world bank and the imf play an important role in financing yemen 's fragile economy .
the handful of bilateral donors to yemen include the netherlands , the us , japan and britain , germany remains one of the largest european players with annual aid amounting to about 37 million euros .
aid for 2009 and 2010 has been budgeted at 79 million euros .
much of it is focused on easing yemen 's severe water shortage , boosting primary education in the country - yemen had a literacy rate of 40 percent in 2007 - and helping diversify its oil-dominated economy .
zoe nautre , an expert at the berlin-based german council on foreign relations who spent a year in yemen reviewing german government aid efforts , said germany enjoyed excellent relations with the yemeni government .
" germany is often apolitical because it provides a lot of good technical assistance in yemen , particularly in the water sector , and does n't appear to be meddling in yemen 's affairs .
so , germany is well trusted in sanaa , " she told deutsche welle .
failure of governance but others point out that aid money is most needed to help tackle the failure of yemen 's corrupt government to maintain control over remote regions in the strife-torn country - which in turn is exacerbating yemen 's security woes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yemen remains a loosely-governed country under president saleh " one of the major reasons al qaeda is so strong in yemen is because the government is so weak , " guido steinberg , an expert on international terrorism and political developments in the gulf region at the berlin-based german institute for international and security affairs told deutsche welle .
" president ali abdullah saleh 's government is losing legitimacy - it 's not just failing to provide its own citizens with basic things such as water and jobs but is also losing control over vast swathes of the country . "
president saleh is facing a rebellion in the north , a secessionist movement in the south and growing islamic terrorism .
expert urges caution experts say that in addition to equipping and training yemen 's security forces to combat terrorism , the country needs a long-term development strategy - that means not just aid in areas such as education , health and infrastructure , but an inclusive politics .
" development policy in yemen has no meaning if it is n't embedded in a political strategy , " steinberg said .
eickenberg , whose organization is involved in democratization and reforming yemen 's political institutions , said western nations meeting at a yemen conference in london later this month needed to focus on promoting better governance , fighting corruption and nudging yemen to solve its northern conflict - with the help of its influential neighbor saudi arabia .
but nautre urged caution in drafting any future western strategy on yemen .
" western involvement in yemen can easily backfire because the population is very wary and there 's a strong anti-american sentiment there , " nautre said .
" the most important thing is for the west not to be seen as interfering in yemen from outside so that the people do n't turn against you and run into the arms of extremist groups . "

but experts say counterterrorism wo n't work without addressing yemen 's other woes . concerns are mounting about terrorism in yemen since the botched attempted bombing of a us airliner on christmas day .
us president barack obama has said al-qaeda 's offshoot in yemen was behind the failed attacks .
the issue was on the agenda when the german foreign minister , guido westerwelle , made a surprise visit to yemen on monday at the end of his middle east tour .
as washington ramps up its counterterrorism role in yemen and raises pressure on the government in sanaa to crack down on islamic extremists , some say that a single-minded focus on military force is deeply flawed .
" the united states and other western powers need to provide long-term economic development to reduce poverty and raise educational standards , " yemen 's foreign minister abu bakr al-qirbi said in an interview with the washington post last week .
that , he said , would help combat terrorism " in a more effective fashion than just using military force . "
that view is echoed by international aid agencies working on the ground in yemen , the arab world 's most impoverished nation .
bildunterschrift : experts warn against focusing solely on military means to fight terrorism " poverty is n't the only explanation for terrorism .
but it 's true that yemen 's extensive social and economic pressures contribute to making the country unstable - and thus make it easier for terrorist organizations to exploit people 's grievances and recruit them , " felix eikenberg , head of germany 's friedrich ebert political foundation in the capital sanaa , told deutsche welle .
germany , whose aid involvement in yemen dates back 40 years , is one of europe 's biggest donors to yemen .
massive social and economic pressures home to around 24 million people , yemen is grappling with one of the world 's highest population growth rates , rapidly depleting groundwater levels , and an unemployment rate of more than 20 percent .
the country 's economy is in tatters as it runs out of its meager oil reserves . " some 70 percent of the state 's revenues currently come from oil .
but oil reserves are dwindling so rapidly that we estimate yemen could become an oil importer in ten years , " eikenberg said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yemen faces a lethal cocktail of social and demographic problems total oil production has slumped from about 440,000 barrels per day in 2001 to 300,000 last year , according to the us energy information administration .
all that has contributed to widespread poverty in the country .
children suffer from a 50 percent malnutrition rate ; more than 40 percent of yemenis live below the poverty line , 18 percent on less than a dollar a day .
germany a major donor given the magnitude of its problems , yemen receives comparatively little per-capita international aid .
the world bank and the imf play an important role in financing yemen 's fragile economy .
the handful of bilateral donors to yemen include the netherlands , the us , japan and britain , germany remains one of the largest european players with annual aid amounting to about 37 million euros .
aid for 2009 and 2010 has been budgeted at 79 million euros .
much of it is focused on easing yemen 's severe water shortage , boosting primary education in the country - yemen had a literacy rate of 40 percent in 2007 - and helping diversify its oil-dominated economy .
zoe nautre , an expert at the berlin-based german council on foreign relations who spent a year in yemen reviewing german government aid efforts , said germany enjoyed excellent relations with the yemeni government .
" germany is often apolitical because it provides a lot of good technical assistance in yemen , particularly in the water sector , and does n't appear to be meddling in yemen 's affairs .
so , germany is well trusted in sanaa , " she told deutsche welle .
failure of governance but others point out that aid money is most needed to help tackle the failure of yemen 's corrupt government to maintain control over remote regions in the strife-torn country - which in turn is exacerbating yemen 's security woes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yemen remains a loosely-governed country under president saleh " one of the major reasons al qaeda is so strong in yemen is because the government is so weak , " guido steinberg , an expert on international terrorism and political developments in the gulf region at the berlin-based german institute for international and security affairs told deutsche welle .
" president ali abdullah saleh 's government is losing legitimacy - it 's not just failing to provide its own citizens with basic things such as water and jobs but is also losing control over vast swathes of the country . "
president saleh is facing a rebellion in the north , a secessionist movement in the south and growing islamic terrorism .
expert urges caution experts say that in addition to equipping and training yemen 's security forces to combat terrorism , the country needs a long-term development strategy - that means not just aid in areas such as education , health and infrastructure , but an inclusive politics .
" development policy in yemen has no meaning if it is n't embedded in a political strategy , " steinberg said .
eickenberg , whose organization is involved in democratization and reforming yemen 's political institutions , said western nations meeting at a yemen conference in london later this month needed to focus on promoting better governance , fighting corruption and nudging yemen to solve its northern conflict - with the help of its influential neighbor saudi arabia .
but nautre urged caution in drafting any future western strategy on yemen .
" western involvement in yemen can easily backfire because the population is very wary and there 's a strong anti-american sentiment there , " nautre said .
" the most important thing is for the west not to be seen as interfering in yemen from outside so that the people do n't turn against you and run into the arms of extremist groups . "

failure of governance but others point out that aid money is most needed to help tackle the failure of yemen 's corrupt government to maintain control over remote regions in the strife-torn country - which in turn is exacerbating yemen 's security woes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yemen remains a loosely-governed country under president saleh " one of the major reasons al qaeda is so strong in yemen is because the government is so weak , " guido steinberg , an expert on international terrorism and political developments in the gulf region at the berlin-based german institute for international and security affairs told deutsche welle .
" president ali abdullah saleh 's government is losing legitimacy - it 's not just failing to provide its own citizens with basic things such as water and jobs but is also losing control over vast swathes of the country . "
president saleh is facing a rebellion in the north , a secessionist movement in the south and growing islamic terrorism .
expert urges caution experts say that in addition to equipping and training yemen 's security forces to combat terrorism , the country needs a long-term development strategy - that means not just aid in areas such as education , health and infrastructure , but an inclusive politics .
" development policy in yemen has no meaning if it is n't embedded in a political strategy , " steinberg said .
eickenberg , whose organization is involved in democratization and reforming yemen 's political institutions , said western nations meeting at a yemen conference in london later this month needed to focus on promoting better governance , fighting corruption and nudging yemen to solve its northern conflict - with the help of its influential neighbor saudi arabia .
but nautre urged caution in drafting any future western strategy on yemen .
" western involvement in yemen can easily backfire because the population is very wary and there 's a strong anti-american sentiment there , " nautre said .
" the most important thing is for the west not to be seen as interfering in yemen from outside so that the people do n't turn against you and run into the arms of extremist groups . "

defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg has invited her to visit the troops . bishop margot kaessmann and karl-theodor zu guttenberg agreed during their half-hour meeting on monday that there should be a broader public debate on the german bundeswehr 's mission in afghanistan , as well as a strengthened civil commitment .
the minister and the protestant church leader said they would continue their " critical dialogue " about the afghan deployment , possibly in the framework of the bundeswehr 's military academy or at protestant church academies . while the issue would n't be solved anytime soon , kaessmann said it was important that the church 's voice was heard in the debate .
kaessmann is the lutheran bishop of hanover and the first woman to head the ekd - an umbrella group for 22 churches that encompass germany 's 25 million protestants .

the minister and the protestant church leader said they would continue their " critical dialogue " about the afghan deployment , possibly in the framework of the bundeswehr 's military academy or at protestant church academies . while the issue would n't be solved anytime soon , kaessmann said it was important that the church 's voice was heard in the debate .
kaessmann is the lutheran bishop of hanover and the first woman to head the ekd - an umbrella group for 22 churches that encompass germany 's 25 million protestants .
" nothing is right in afghanistan " the high-level meeting comes as a response to critical remarks by the bishop in december , when kaessmann said in an interview that the war in afghanistan could not be justified .
at two new year 's church services , she told congregations in berlin and dresden she did not approve of the western strategy in afghanistan , where 4,500 german military personnel are deployed with the international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- .
her comments were described as " naive , " " not helpful , " " unrealistic " - soldiers posted in afghanistan were as angered by the bishop 's views as many german politicians .
the german government - the third-largest force contributor after the united states and britain - is expected to decide whether to commit more troops to stabilizing afghanistan at an international conference in late january on how to assist the country .

heike groos joined up as a doctor but eventually found out that she was also expected to be a soldier , an experience that had long-lasting effects . when heike groos joined the bundeswehr as a doctor more than 20 years ago , she confesses it was just because she was looking for a job .
back in 1987 , when she started working as an emergency medical officer in a germany army hospital , she was still only a doctor .
that changed when she was sent to afghanistan in 2002 .
she became a doctor - and a soldier .
when groos was sent out to afghanistan , she did so without any question and without any concern .
even when it became obvious that she was now both a doctor and a soldier , armed with a weapon to protect her patients if necessary , she knew that this is what service in afghanistan was like .
it was as much part of the job as helping comrades and afghans alike as part of an emergency military ambulance team .
" at the beginning , in 2002 , it was a completely satisfying job , " she says .
" each moment made me think that we were doing something meaningful there .
just being there symbolized to the people that there was peace and that we would ensure that it remained that way , through our medical and humanitarian work there . "
suicide attack changes everything bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heike groos was first on the scene at the bomb blast but the positive feelings did not endure .
the situation changed dramatically with a suicide attack on a bus carrying german soldiers in june 2003 .
six bundeswehr troops were killed and 29 were injured , some seriously .
heike groos was one of the first on the scene ; she bandaged wounds , called for assistance , coordinated the medical efforts , comforted the injured and watched comrades die .
the event and the huge shock changed her and her colleagues ' lives forever .
" after that first suicide attack in june 2003 , we changed and we became deeply , deeply distrustful because we could not at all differentiate between the people , " she says .
" who is taliban and who is not , who is good and who is bad ? that was never clear to me . "
as well as suspicion and caution , heike groos says she felt rage ; rage against the taliban who had carried out the attack , rage against afghanistan , and rage against germany - the country which had sent her there .
she and her comrades also withdrew from the people they were supposed to be helping .
" we withdrew ourselves and wanted nothing do to with anything afghan , " she admits .
" it was because we saw those that we had come to help as those who had attacked us .
this perspective shifted in time , and we recognized that those who were friendly before still were but we were always more cautious after that .
i was never as trusting again . "
disillusionment leads to decision to leave bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : groos decided that her 2007 tour would be her last after the attack , her unit became closer , even more like a family than before .
her younger male comrades looked for comfort and assurance from the older , more experienced heike groos .
but there was no comfort for her .
groos started to see little sense in what she was doing , confined and isolated in the base due to the increasing dangers outside .
she decided that it could not go on .
she returned to afghanistan for the last time in 2007 .
groos says that people could not understand why she went back but she says she wanted to complete her service .
" people looked at me like i was an alien when i walked out of our house in my uniform , " she says .
" i was never at home and people asked my children , ' where is your mother ? ' and they would say ' she is in afghanistan ' . "
when she returned , people would stay out of her way .
her second husband also did n't understand and eventually he and groos divorced .
it was then that she decided that she wanted to leave everything behind and take her children to the other side of the world to start again .
she and three of her five kids moved to new zealand , as far away from afghanistan and germany as possible in order to find peace .
distance does n't end afghanistan trauma bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the horrors of aghanistan have never left heike groos but afghanistan did not release her from its grip .
groos continued to suffer from her experiences , suffering from nightmares and the inability to sleep .
she was also cut off from any kind of support from her previous employer : the bundeswehr .
" i had fulfilled my obligation -lrb- to the bundeswehr -rrb- and i found that very hard , " she says .
" i wish that someone had supported me and had not left me alone , but that did not happen , and i am sad about it .
they pushed me away , sent me to the army physician , to the psychiatrist who said ' you are traumatized . '
and then german people said : ' you were probably not hard enough , soldiers must always be tough . " '
while things were difficult for a long while , in time they also started to get better for heike groos and she began dealing with her experiences in afghanistan and working through her experiences .
the result was her first book , published last year , based on her time there : ' a beautiful day to die ' .

it was as much part of the job as helping comrades and afghans alike as part of an emergency military ambulance team .
" at the beginning , in 2002 , it was a completely satisfying job , " she says .
" each moment made me think that we were doing something meaningful there .
just being there symbolized to the people that there was peace and that we would ensure that it remained that way , through our medical and humanitarian work there . "
suicide attack changes everything bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heike groos was first on the scene at the bomb blast but the positive feelings did not endure .
the situation changed dramatically with a suicide attack on a bus carrying german soldiers in june 2003 .
six bundeswehr troops were killed and 29 were injured , some seriously .
heike groos was one of the first on the scene ; she bandaged wounds , called for assistance , coordinated the medical efforts , comforted the injured and watched comrades die .
the event and the huge shock changed her and her colleagues ' lives forever .
" after that first suicide attack in june 2003 , we changed and we became deeply , deeply distrustful because we could not at all differentiate between the people , " she says .
" who is taliban and who is not , who is good and who is bad ? that was never clear to me . "
as well as suspicion and caution , heike groos says she felt rage ; rage against the taliban who had carried out the attack , rage against afghanistan , and rage against germany - the country which had sent her there .
she and her comrades also withdrew from the people they were supposed to be helping .
" we withdrew ourselves and wanted nothing do to with anything afghan , " she admits .
" it was because we saw those that we had come to help as those who had attacked us .
this perspective shifted in time , and we recognized that those who were friendly before still were but we were always more cautious after that .
i was never as trusting again . "
disillusionment leads to decision to leave bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : groos decided that her 2007 tour would be her last after the attack , her unit became closer , even more like a family than before .
her younger male comrades looked for comfort and assurance from the older , more experienced heike groos .
but there was no comfort for her .
groos started to see little sense in what she was doing , confined and isolated in the base due to the increasing dangers outside .
she decided that it could not go on .
she returned to afghanistan for the last time in 2007 .
groos says that people could not understand why she went back but she says she wanted to complete her service .
" people looked at me like i was an alien when i walked out of our house in my uniform , " she says .
" i was never at home and people asked my children , ' where is your mother ? ' and they would say ' she is in afghanistan ' . "
when she returned , people would stay out of her way .
her second husband also did n't understand and eventually he and groos divorced .
it was then that she decided that she wanted to leave everything behind and take her children to the other side of the world to start again .
she and three of her five kids moved to new zealand , as far away from afghanistan and germany as possible in order to find peace .
distance does n't end afghanistan trauma bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the horrors of aghanistan have never left heike groos but afghanistan did not release her from its grip .
groos continued to suffer from her experiences , suffering from nightmares and the inability to sleep .
she was also cut off from any kind of support from her previous employer : the bundeswehr .
" i had fulfilled my obligation -lrb- to the bundeswehr -rrb- and i found that very hard , " she says .
" i wish that someone had supported me and had not left me alone , but that did not happen , and i am sad about it .
they pushed me away , sent me to the army physician , to the psychiatrist who said ' you are traumatized . '
and then german people said : ' you were probably not hard enough , soldiers must always be tough . " '
while things were difficult for a long while , in time they also started to get better for heike groos and she began dealing with her experiences in afghanistan and working through her experiences .
the result was her first book , published last year , based on her time there : ' a beautiful day to die ' .

heike groos joined up as a doctor but eventually found out that she was also expected to be a soldier , an experience that had long-lasting effects . when heike groos joined the bundeswehr as a doctor more than 20 years ago , she confesses it was just because she was looking for a job .
back in 1987 , when she started working as an emergency medical officer in a germany army hospital , she was still only a doctor .
that changed when she was sent to afghanistan in 2002 .
she became a doctor - and a soldier .
when groos was sent out to afghanistan , she did so without any question and without any concern .

the west is ready to impose strict sanctions but russia and china disagree .
they want to use diplomacy .
china , which holds the rotating presidency in january , is a strong supporter of the regime in tehran .
however , chinese dissidents are showing their support of the opposition movement on the internet . china thinks that the nuclear row with iran can be resolved with dialogue and negotiations .
it says more time and more patience is needed .
moreover , it seems less certain than the west about tehran ’ s nuclear intentions .
beijing believes that the nuclear programme is only being developed for civilian purposes , says german iran expert udo steinbach .
“ china does not share the international community ’ s dramatic interpretation of the programme , ” he says , “ which presumes that iran is working on a bomb . ”
three un resolutions against iran however , to prevent tehran from building a bomb in the future , beijing has already supported three un resolutions against iran .
these allow sanctions to be imposed on organisations and individuals that develop nuclear weapons .
but china does not support stricter sanctions .
china has massive economic interests in iran , from which the energy-hungry country imports some 15 percent of its oil .
chinese companies have invested millions to tap into the country ’ s oil and gas reserves .
the two regimes are also linked by a similar attitude to the international community .
neither government likes it when the west interferes with what they call their domestic affairs .
they are both extremely intolerant of opposition and ready to use repression to keep it under control .

“ what they did is very courageous - they showed us courage by being willing to stand up to the regime and demand what they actually want .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de terrorism -pipe- 11.01.2010 failures at all levels undermining us spy agencies ' crackdown on terror 1/2 ahead großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some experts believe the cia needs a new broom us intelligence agencies at home and around the world are suffering from endemic failures in communication and information gathering which are threatening to undermine washington 's pursuit of al qaeda and its affiliates . concerns over alleged intelligence gaps that have lingered since the september 11 , 2001 , attacks on the united states have increased in recent weeks after the attempted christmas day bombing of a us airliner and the suicide bomb attack by an al qaeda double agent in afghanistan which killed seven cia officers .
as 2010 begins with the so-called " war on terror " seemingly no nearer to being won , us president barack obama has been handed an old set of problems to deal with ; problems which stretch back to before hijacked planes slammed into the world trade center in new york and the pentagon in washington .
last week , the usually unflappable obama sought to calm fears caused by the security lapses which allowed a nigerian man with alleged links to yemen-based al qaeda operatives to board a northwest airlines flight from amsterdam to detroit with an explosive device hidden in his underwear .
publicly , obama assured the american people that his administration would work fast and hard to improve security to eradicate the " human and systemic failures " behind the christmas day incident .
but behind closed doors , it is alleged that the president used sharper language with his security chiefs , calling the incident a potentially disastrous " screw up " by the intelligence community , telling them that " we dodged a bullet but just barely . "
intelligence in conflict zones suffering bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the khost blast was one of the biggest attacks on the cia the inability to both anticipate and stop the nature of this evolving threat was painfully highlighted two weeks ago by the bombing inside forward operating base chapman , a well-fortified compound in afghanistan 's khost province near the southeastern border with pakistan .
despite supposedly successful " deradicalization , " humam khalil abu-mulal al-balawi - a jordanian jihadist captured and turned into a cia spy - was allowed to enter the base without adequate security checks .
once inside , balawi , who had been given a mission to infiltrate al qaeda and pass on information on its leaders , detonated a hidden explosive , killing seven operatives and contractors and his jordanian handler .
the attack not only showed an embarrassing lack of vigilance but also exposed the intelligence community 's dearth in understanding of the situation in afghanistan and the current capabilities of al qaeda .
recent us intelligence suggested the terror organization 's power had been diminished but the attack showed that , contrary to that belief , al qaeda has achieved a new level of sophistication and may not be as weakened as us officials had thought .
lack of communication and accurate intelligence the attack also highlighted the problems which all operatives - at home and abroad - seem to encounter : that of an inability to gather and then share information they can trust .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : intel agencies have been under scrutiny since 9/11 " there is clearly a lack of communication at the heart of these problems , " giles merritt , the director of the security & defence agenda think-tank in brussels , told deutsche welle .
" the mechanisms for passing information are not good enough and this clearly needs to be sorted out .
intelligence agencies are meant to share information with each other and then to act on it .
it 's quite clear that the information is actually being shovelled over from one agency to another but not really analyzed , so it 's not being acted on . " richard betts , a terrorism expert at the council on foreign relations in washington , believes that while there have been mistakes made , the steps that follow will lead to a more secure united states . " processes for correlating and disseminating thousands of bits and pieces of information are complex and fixing one problem sometimes complicates another , " betts told deutsche welle . " the recent failure to revoke the visa for the nigerian bomber revealed a glitch in the system that has otherwise worked well in preventing any attacks inside the us since 9/11 , despite al qaeda 's huge incentives to pull one off .
glitches like this will be fixed when found but some precautions to minimize the chances of attack will introduce costs the public may be reluctant to bear - for example , more intrusive airport screening or more compromises in privacy for intelligence gathering .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de auto industry -pipe- 11.01.2010 vw announces big expansion plans for us market großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : volkswagen wants to reposition itself in the united states despite years of weak performance in the us market , volkswagen announced it aims to double the number of cars it sells in the us by 2012 or 2013 .
vw wants its cars to escape their niche status and hit the mass market . just prior to the opening of the annual detroit auto show on monday , german carmaker volkswagen announced it plans for ramping up its presence in the united states , aiming to win over american consumers and sell twice the number of cars it does now in three to four years ' time .
" we will sell 400,000 to 450,000 vehicles in 2012/13 , " said stefan jacoby , head of volkswagen of america , on sunday , adding that the company 's us business could become profitable by 2013 . volkswagen , europe 's largest carmaker , has had a hard time finding its footing in the all-important us market .
its presence in china and brazil is strong and sales in germany have been helped by a government program last year that encouraged drivers to trade in old gas guzzlers for more for efficient cars .
in europe , vw has 21 percent of the market .
but vw market share in the us , including its audi brand , is only three percent .
part of the reason for that , according to analysts , has to do with the generally dismal state of the car industry in the wake of global recession .
although , vw 's small market share actually gave it a bit of a foot up since it was not as hard hit by the collapse of american auto sales as some of its rivals were .
american preferences bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vw has been trying to figure out how to fit the pieces together for the us market vw 's lackluster performance can also be traced back to its product line , which was not ideally suited to americans ' taste in cars .
" volkswagen was neither a premium brand like mercedes , nor a mass-market brand , " said marc tonn , a senior analyst at m.m. warburg .
" the company was kind of stuck in the middle . "
the wolfsburg-based concern focused on smaller or mid-size cars with highly advanced technological features when americans were more interested in buying larger vehicles , such as suvs or pick-up trucks .
" i think the focus will now be on maintaining german quality , but going a little in the direction of us size , " tonn added .
nevertheless , vw will not likely be turning out tank-like vehicles any time soon .
jacoby said he expects the market for compact and mid-sized sedans to increase faster than other segments , especially if oil prices convince more americans to downsize from their chevy tahoes and ford explorers .
" with higher oil prices , the us consumer is perhaps going to look a little more closely at smaller cars , " said christian breitsprecher , an auto analyst at sol oppenheim . from the niche to the masses volkswagen , which ranks behind brands like hyundai , honda , mercedes and bmw in the us , wants to emerge from its position as a niche carmaker to a mass-market product , one that can compete with extremely popular makes , such as toyota 's camry .
while the beetle quickly became a cult classic in the us and enjoyed great popularity in the 1960s and early 1970s , vw was never able to imitate its success with subsequent makes , such as its rabbit .
the company closed its last us plant in 1988 in pennsylvania amid sluggish sales .
" the rabbit was a flop and vw never really was able to get back in the mass market after that , " said breitsprecher , who added that volkswagen cars remained niche products .
" i mean , who bought a jetta ?
mostly college kids who could n't afford bmws . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : volkswagen beetle - a hit in america but vw wants a follow-up success becoming a mass-market car in the us is essential to vw 's ambitious expansion plans for the coming years , which include surpassing main rival toyota , the world 's largest automaker by sales volume .
new investments volkswagen is building a new plant in chattanooga , tennessee , investing up to $ 1 billion -lrb- 694 million euros -rrb- in a facility that , according to us head jacoby , " will enable the turnaround of vw 's us operations " and should create around 2,000 jobs .
increasing production and purchasing in the dollar zone is crucial to vw 's return to profitability as it would lower the company 's exposure to a dollar that is weak compared to the euro .
the carmaker is also spending $ 125 million on two new dealerships in new york city , which will begin sales in 2010 .
they are part of the company 's strategy to increase its presence and visibility in the us .
jacoby said he thinks the worst of the automobile sector 's woes to be behind them , with american car sales likely to be 11 million to 11.5 million in 2010 .
because of a stabilization of the labor and real-estate markets , " we are a little bit more optimistic now than we were a few months ago , " he said on sunday .
he added that he expects the us car sales to stabilize at around 15 million over the medium term , and vw 's longer-term us plans include selling 800,000 vehicles a year by 2018 .
" the us is a critical component of vw 's long-term strategy , " said analyst tonn .
" despite all the euphoria about emerging markets these days , if you want to be a global player you have to do well in america . "

" based on his talks in the gulf , westerwelle made the quick decision to go to yemen and get a sense of the situation on the ground , " a member of the german delegation told reporters .
destabilization " spreads terror " the foreign minister was concerned that destablilization in yemen could help fuel the spread of terrorism , the official said .
westerwelle has previously warned that yemen is a sanctuary for terrorists .
after informing european allies and washington of his visit , he is believed to have delivered a message calling for stable government in the country .
yemen is under scrutiny after it was revealed that umar farouk abdulmutallab , the nigerian man who allegedly tried to blow up a us-bound jet on christmas day , prepared for his mission in yemen .
call to deal with disputes the official said that westerwelle would also " press for good governance , " try to address the issue of corruption in yemen and call for dialogue to resolve internal disputes .
the government is engaged in conflicts with separatists in the north and south of the country , as well as with al-qaeda militants .
germany is the biggest european contributor of aid to yemen by far , with about 79 million euros -lrb- $ 114 million -rrb- set aside for the country for 2010 to 2011 .
the country is the poorest on the arabian peninsula .
following talks , westerwelle said that the yemeni government had revealed that it knew the whereabouts of five germans , including three children , who were kidnapped in the country six months ago. rc / afp / reuters / dpa / apn editor : chuck penfold charles duguid penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

catherine ashton can expect tough questions in her confirmation hearing to become the eu 's first foreign policy tchief .
will her negotiating skills compensate for her lack of foreign policy experience ? catherine ashton , the 53-year-old former european union trade commissioner and leader of britain 's house of lords , was expected to face intensive questioning at the european commission confirmation hearings , which began in brussels on monday .
ashton was nominated for the post of high representative for foreign affairs and security policy by eu heads of state at a summit last november , but must still be confirmed by parliament .
a surprise pick although ashton has long been regarded as an industry expert , her nomination for the newly-created post of eu foreign affairs minister came as a surprise .
the native of lancashire , england , has served only one year as eu trade commissioner and has no other foreign policy experience .
even in her native britain , ashton is virtually unknown , having never been elected to public office .
her past work experience includes posts in a provincial health authority , as well as positions in a number of government departments , including the education and justice ministries .
in 1999 , the labour government of then-prime minister tony blair awarded ashton the title of “ baroness , ” so that she could represent the party in the house of lords . in 2007 , current prime minister gordon brown appointed her leader of the house of lords .
however , ashton 's big break came in 2008 , when the post of eu trade commissioner became free and ashton became the first woman to hold the office .
hard questions during monday 's confirmation hearing , ashton is expected to have to defend herself against accusations of inadequate diplomatic experience .
also likely to come up during questioning : ashton 's past involvement with britain 's anti-nuclear group , the campaign for nuclear disarmament -lrb- cnd -rrb- .
during the initial round of questioning in november , the nominee for foreign affairs chief was challenged to deny taking funds from the soviet union during her days as treasurer for the cnd over 25 years ago .
all or nothing ashton will be among the first of 26 new appointees to go through the confirmation process in the european parliament . the hearings are scheduled to end on january 19 , with the parliament 's final vote of confidence on the new commission to take place january 26 in brussels .
although parliamentarians can not vote to approve or deny individual appointees , they can vote to reject the commission as a whole .
if approved , the new team is expected to begin its five-year term on february 1. smh / afp / rtre editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in 2000 kreil won an amendment to germany 's constitution from the court of justice of the european union allowing women to take part in bundeswehr 's armed services .
up until that point they had been limited to working in the medical service or the military band .
without tanja kreil , there never would have been bundeswehr soldier stefanie linsener .
one year after the january 11 , 2000 ruling , the 18-year-old linsener joined the bundeswehr and became one of the first women trained to use weapons .

as 2010 begins with the so-called " war on terror " seemingly no nearer to being won , us president barack obama has been handed an old set of problems to deal with ; problems which stretch back to before hijacked planes slammed into the world trade center in new york and the pentagon in washington .
last week , the usually unflappable obama sought to calm fears caused by the security lapses which allowed a nigerian man with alleged links to yemen-based al qaeda operatives to board a northwest airlines flight from amsterdam to detroit with an explosive device hidden in his underwear .
publicly , obama assured the american people that his administration would work fast and hard to improve security to eradicate the " human and systemic failures " behind the christmas day incident .
but behind closed doors , it is alleged that the president used sharper language with his security chiefs , calling the incident a potentially disastrous " screw up " by the intelligence community , telling them that " we dodged a bullet but just barely . "
intelligence in conflict zones suffering bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the khost blast was one of the biggest attacks on the cia the inability to both anticipate and stop the nature of this evolving threat was painfully highlighted two weeks ago by the bombing inside forward operating base chapman , a well-fortified compound in afghanistan 's khost province near the southeastern border with pakistan .
despite supposedly successful " deradicalization , " humam khalil abu-mulal al-balawi - a jordanian jihadist captured and turned into a cia spy - was allowed to enter the base without adequate security checks .
once inside , balawi , who had been given a mission to infiltrate al qaeda and pass on information on its leaders , detonated a hidden explosive , killing seven operatives and contractors and his jordanian handler .
the attack not only showed an embarrassing lack of vigilance but also exposed the intelligence community 's dearth in understanding of the situation in afghanistan and the current capabilities of al qaeda .
recent us intelligence suggested the terror organization 's power had been diminished but the attack showed that , contrary to that belief , al qaeda has achieved a new level of sophistication and may not be as weakened as us officials had thought .
lack of communication and accurate intelligence the attack also highlighted the problems which all operatives - at home and abroad - seem to encounter : that of an inability to gather and then share information they can trust .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : intel agencies have been under scrutiny since 9/11 " there is clearly a lack of communication at the heart of these problems , " giles merritt , the director of the security & defence agenda think-tank in brussels , told deutsche welle .
" the mechanisms for passing information are not good enough and this clearly needs to be sorted out .
intelligence agencies are meant to share information with each other and then to act on it .
it 's quite clear that the information is actually being shovelled over from one agency to another but not really analyzed , so it 's not being acted on . " richard betts , a terrorism expert at the council on foreign relations in washington , believes that while there have been mistakes made , the steps that follow will lead to a more secure united states . " processes for correlating and disseminating thousands of bits and pieces of information are complex and fixing one problem sometimes complicates another , " betts told deutsche welle . " the recent failure to revoke the visa for the nigerian bomber revealed a glitch in the system that has otherwise worked well in preventing any attacks inside the us since 9/11 , despite al qaeda 's huge incentives to pull one off .
glitches like this will be fixed when found but some precautions to minimize the chances of attack will introduce costs the public may be reluctant to bear - for example , more intrusive airport screening or more compromises in privacy for intelligence gathering .

"
major general michael flynn , the top nato and us military intelligence chief in afghanistan , even said that they were " clueless " and " no more than a fingernail deep in -lrb- their -rrb- understanding of the environment . " richard betts agrees : " the pool of americans who actually really know these countries with enough inside expertise and bicultural sensitivity is very , very small , " he said . " the result is significant reliance on foreign services or american immigrants which reduces the confidence the intelligence agencies may have in the reliability they get or which limits opportunities to exploit openings . " " operatives in these regions do n't have a lot of human input , " said giles merritt .
" they rely on electronic surveillance mostly .
they lack people on the ground which can give them a clear picture of what is going on .
it 's very difficult in such a fragmented society like afghanistan where you have tribal loyalties and regional warlords . " major general flynn has already called for radical structural changes to help an intelligence-gathering apparatus which " still finds itself unable to answer fundamental questions about the environment in which we operate and the people we are trying to protect and persuade . " obama moves to shake up intelligence with reforms back in the us , president obama seized the initiative and announced his intention to launch a set of ambitious reforms , including a revamp of the government 's terrorist " watch-list " system which had omitted potential christmas day bomber abdulmutallab from its no-fly list of people with suspected terrorist links . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama promised sweeping reforms for spy agencies " i want our additional reviews completed this week .
i want specific recommendations for corrective actions to fix what went wrong , " obama said .
" i want those reforms implemented immediately so that this does n't happen again and so that we can prevent future attacks . " " it is politically necessary and proper for the president to make a dramatic effort to fix the vulnerabilities revealed by the failures , " said betts . " the specific fixes are in many cases technical matters of coordinating information technologies and distribution mechanisms .
more general needs , for example deep expertise on non-western societies , and the ability of agents to operate in denied areas , are harder to deal with and will require inventive investments in human capital for the long term - and such investments may not be popular with politicians looking for immediate solutions . " specific intelligence targeting the way forward giles merritt believes that change from all-encompassing security sweeps to specific threat assessment and suspect profiling would be a good place to start . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : airport security will get tougher - but will it get smarter ?
" the big issue concerns whether profiling of suspects is politically acceptable , " he said .
" politicians seem to shy away from profiling because it identifies people of specific nationality and religious beliefs and singles them out as potential terrorists .
but this seems to be the best way to approach security .
this even-handed approach where old ladies are strip-searched just is n't working and i think this detroit incident is going to move the approach more toward profiling , and deeper sharing and analysis of intelligence . " " what needs to be done is a total rethink of security , " merritt added .
" with airport security you need to take the collection of data , the profiling , and the monitoring out of the hands of poorly paid staff and into those of highly-trained professionals .
israel ’ s el al has the best security record despite being the airline under the biggest threat because of the people they have carrying out their security . " we also have to get over this political correctness that all passengers are the same , " he said . " that 's where we need a major rethink .
you need to forget about the 98 percent of people who are never going to be a terrorist and then concentrate on the tiny amount of the remaining two percent who could be , applying advanced profiling and information sharing to identify potential threats . " failures make news but successes save lives despite the furore over the recent intelligence blunders , richard betts is quick to point out that failures will always make bigger headlines than successes . " in the weeks before the recent disasters , there were several arrests of plotters or suspects which received less publicity and which were virtually taken for granted by the public , yet which showed that the system was effectively interdicting actual or potential attacks , " betts said . " successes sometimes are not publicized and at other times , even unknown .
for example - if precautions cause a planned attack to be cancelled , we never know how successful the precautions were .
failures will inevitably get more attention - as they should - but do not in themselves necessarily discredit the whole system of counterintelligence and counterterrorism organization .

two squad members and a driver died in the ambush . " if a team or some people present themselves under the togolese flag , it will be a false representation , " gilbert houngbo told journalists in the capital lome on sunday , january 10 .
previously , the togolese national soccer team had reportedly decided to take part in the africa cup of nations in spite of friday 's deadly ambush by gunmen on their convoy in angola .
a report on the website of the french sports daily , l 'equipe , said that the players had decided to ignore the call from togo 's government for the side to return home .
the report quoted alaixys romao , togo 's midfielder , as saying that the unanimous decision to stay and take part in the tournament was taken to honor the dead and wounded .
and also in order to deny the rebels any satisfaction .
the attack by hooded gunmen claimed the lives of togo 's assistant coach and its squad spokesman along with one of the drivers of the convoy .
the togolese backup goalkeeper , kodjovi obilale , reportedly sustained two gunshot wounds in the attack and was flown to south africa for treatment .
he is said to be in a stable condition .
seven others were also injured in the incident on friday , including defender serge akakpo of the romanian team vaslui .
the other injured passengers included two squad doctors and a journalist .
major sporting event bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : togo 's players at the at the world cup stadium in frankfurt , germany angola is playing host to the 2010 africa cup of nations , and is one of africa 's major sporting event .
the attack threatens to overshadow the tournament which is to take place over the next three weeks .
the assailants opened fire on the vehicles as they travelled from cabinda , an angolan enclave to the north of the country .
the attack lasted some 20 minutes .
responsibility for the assault has been claimed by the separatist group , the front for the liberation of the enclave of cabinda -lrb- flec -rrb- .
the angolan minister in charge of affairs in cabinda , antonio bento bembe , said that the attack was " an act of terrorism . "
the oil-producing region of cabinda has been the site of a decades-long struggle for independence by the separatist group flec .
despite this , it is scheduled to play host to seven tournament matches this month. td / dfm / afp / reuters / ap / l 'equipe editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

"
major general michael flynn , the top nato and us military intelligence chief in afghanistan , even said that they were " clueless " and " no more than a fingernail deep in -lrb- their -rrb- understanding of the environment . " richard betts agrees : " the pool of americans who actually really know these countries with enough inside expertise and bicultural sensitivity is very , very small , " he said . " the result is significant reliance on foreign services or american immigrants which reduces the confidence the intelligence agencies may have in the reliability they get or which limits opportunities to exploit openings . " " operatives in these regions do n't have a lot of human input , " said giles merritt .
" they rely on electronic surveillance mostly .
they lack people on the ground which can give them a clear picture of what is going on .
it 's very difficult in such a fragmented society like afghanistan where you have tribal loyalties and regional warlords . " major general flynn has already called for radical structural changes to help an intelligence-gathering apparatus which " still finds itself unable to answer fundamental questions about the environment in which we operate and the people we are trying to protect and persuade . " obama moves to shake up intelligence with reforms back in the us , president obama seized the initiative and announced his intention to launch a set of ambitious reforms , including a revamp of the government 's terrorist " watch-list " system which had omitted potential christmas day bomber abdulmutallab from its no-fly list of people with suspected terrorist links . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama promised sweeping reforms for spy agencies " i want our additional reviews completed this week .
i want specific recommendations for corrective actions to fix what went wrong , " obama said .
" i want those reforms implemented immediately so that this does n't happen again and so that we can prevent future attacks . " " it is politically necessary and proper for the president to make a dramatic effort to fix the vulnerabilities revealed by the failures , " said betts . " the specific fixes are in many cases technical matters of coordinating information technologies and distribution mechanisms .
more general needs , for example deep expertise on non-western societies , and the ability of agents to operate in denied areas , are harder to deal with and will require inventive investments in human capital for the long term - and such investments may not be popular with politicians looking for immediate solutions . " specific intelligence targeting the way forward giles merritt believes that change from all-encompassing security sweeps to specific threat assessment and suspect profiling would be a good place to start . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : airport security will get tougher - but will it get smarter ?
" the big issue concerns whether profiling of suspects is politically acceptable , " he said .
" politicians seem to shy away from profiling because it identifies people of specific nationality and religious beliefs and singles them out as potential terrorists .
but this seems to be the best way to approach security .
this even-handed approach where old ladies are strip-searched just is n't working and i think this detroit incident is going to move the approach more toward profiling , and deeper sharing and analysis of intelligence . " " what needs to be done is a total rethink of security , " merritt added .
" with airport security you need to take the collection of data , the profiling , and the monitoring out of the hands of poorly paid staff and into those of highly-trained professionals .
israel ’ s el al has the best security record despite being the airline under the biggest threat because of the people they have carrying out their security . " we also have to get over this political correctness that all passengers are the same , " he said . " that 's where we need a major rethink .
you need to forget about the 98 percent of people who are never going to be a terrorist and then concentrate on the tiny amount of the remaining two percent who could be , applying advanced profiling and information sharing to identify potential threats . " failures make news but successes save lives despite the furore over the recent intelligence blunders , richard betts is quick to point out that failures will always make bigger headlines than successes . " in the weeks before the recent disasters , there were several arrests of plotters or suspects which received less publicity and which were virtually taken for granted by the public , yet which showed that the system was effectively interdicting actual or potential attacks , " betts said . " successes sometimes are not publicized and at other times , even unknown .
for example - if precautions cause a planned attack to be cancelled , we never know how successful the precautions were .
failures will inevitably get more attention - as they should - but do not in themselves necessarily discredit the whole system of counterintelligence and counterterrorism organization .

heike groos joined up as a doctor but eventually found out that she was also expected to be a soldier , an experience that had long-lasting effects . when heike groos joined the bundeswehr as a doctor more than 20 years ago , she confesses it was just because she was looking for a job .
back in 1987 , when she started working as an emergency medical officer in a germany army hospital , she was still only a doctor .
that changed when she was sent to afghanistan in 2002 .
she became a doctor - and a soldier .
when groos was sent out to afghanistan , she did so without any question and without any concern .
even when it became obvious that she was now both a doctor and a soldier , armed with a weapon to protect her patients if necessary , she knew that this is what service in afghanistan was like .
it was as much part of the job as helping comrades and afghans alike as part of an emergency military ambulance team .
" at the beginning , in 2002 , it was a completely satisfying job , " she says .
" each moment made me think that we were doing something meaningful there .
just being there symbolized to the people that there was peace and that we would ensure that it remained that way , through our medical and humanitarian work there . "
suicide attack changes everything bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heike groos was first on the scene at the bomb blast but the positive feelings did not endure .
the situation changed dramatically with a suicide attack on a bus carrying german soldiers in june 2003 .
six bundeswehr troops were killed and 29 were injured , some seriously .
heike groos was one of the first on the scene ; she bandaged wounds , called for assistance , coordinated the medical efforts , comforted the injured and watched comrades die .
the event and the huge shock changed her and her colleagues ' lives forever .
" after that first suicide attack in june 2003 , we changed and we became deeply , deeply distrustful because we could not at all differentiate between the people , " she says .
" who is taliban and who is not , who is good and who is bad ? that was never clear to me . "
as well as suspicion and caution , heike groos says she felt rage ; rage against the taliban who had carried out the attack , rage against afghanistan , and rage against germany - the country which had sent her there .
she and her comrades also withdrew from the people they were supposed to be helping .
" we withdrew ourselves and wanted nothing do to with anything afghan , " she admits .
" it was because we saw those that we had come to help as those who had attacked us .
this perspective shifted in time , and we recognized that those who were friendly before still were but we were always more cautious after that .
i was never as trusting again . "
disillusionment leads to decision to leave bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : groos decided that her 2007 tour would be her last after the attack , her unit became closer , even more like a family than before .
her younger male comrades looked for comfort and assurance from the older , more experienced heike groos .
but there was no comfort for her .
groos started to see little sense in what she was doing , confined and isolated in the base due to the increasing dangers outside .
she decided that it could not go on .
she returned to afghanistan for the last time in 2007 .
groos says that people could not understand why she went back but she says she wanted to complete her service .
" people looked at me like i was an alien when i walked out of our house in my uniform , " she says .
" i was never at home and people asked my children , ' where is your mother ? ' and they would say ' she is in afghanistan ' . "
when she returned , people would stay out of her way .
her second husband also did n't understand and eventually he and groos divorced .
it was then that she decided that she wanted to leave everything behind and take her children to the other side of the world to start again .
she and three of her five kids moved to new zealand , as far away from afghanistan and germany as possible in order to find peace .
distance does n't end afghanistan trauma bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the horrors of aghanistan have never left heike groos but afghanistan did not release her from its grip .
groos continued to suffer from her experiences , suffering from nightmares and the inability to sleep .

" i had fulfilled my obligation -lrb- to the bundeswehr -rrb- and i found that very hard , " she says .
" i wish that someone had supported me and had not left me alone , but that did not happen , and i am sad about it .
they pushed me away , sent me to the army physician , to the psychiatrist who said ' you are traumatized . '
and then german people said : ' you were probably not hard enough , soldiers must always be tough . " '

heike groos joined up as a doctor but eventually found out that she was also expected to be a soldier , an experience that had long-lasting effects . when heike groos joined the bundeswehr as a doctor more than 20 years ago , she confesses it was just because she was looking for a job .
back in 1987 , when she started working as an emergency medical officer in a germany army hospital , she was still only a doctor .
that changed when she was sent to afghanistan in 2002 .
she became a doctor - and a soldier .
when groos was sent out to afghanistan , she did so without any question and without any concern .
even when it became obvious that she was now both a doctor and a soldier , armed with a weapon to protect her patients if necessary , she knew that this is what service in afghanistan was like .
it was as much part of the job as helping comrades and afghans alike as part of an emergency military ambulance team .
" at the beginning , in 2002 , it was a completely satisfying job , " she says .
" each moment made me think that we were doing something meaningful there .
just being there symbolized to the people that there was peace and that we would ensure that it remained that way , through our medical and humanitarian work there . "
suicide attack changes everything bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heike groos was first on the scene at the bomb blast but the positive feelings did not endure .
the situation changed dramatically with a suicide attack on a bus carrying german soldiers in june 2003 .
six bundeswehr troops were killed and 29 were injured , some seriously .
heike groos was one of the first on the scene ; she bandaged wounds , called for assistance , coordinated the medical efforts , comforted the injured and watched comrades die .
the event and the huge shock changed her and her colleagues ' lives forever .
" after that first suicide attack in june 2003 , we changed and we became deeply , deeply distrustful because we could not at all differentiate between the people , " she says .
" who is taliban and who is not , who is good and who is bad ? that was never clear to me . "
as well as suspicion and caution , heike groos says she felt rage ; rage against the taliban who had carried out the attack , rage against afghanistan , and rage against germany - the country which had sent her there .
she and her comrades also withdrew from the people they were supposed to be helping .
" we withdrew ourselves and wanted nothing do to with anything afghan , " she admits .
" it was because we saw those that we had come to help as those who had attacked us .
this perspective shifted in time , and we recognized that those who were friendly before still were but we were always more cautious after that .
i was never as trusting again . "
disillusionment leads to decision to leave bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : groos decided that her 2007 tour would be her last after the attack , her unit became closer , even more like a family than before .
her younger male comrades looked for comfort and assurance from the older , more experienced heike groos .
but there was no comfort for her .
groos started to see little sense in what she was doing , confined and isolated in the base due to the increasing dangers outside .
she decided that it could not go on .
she returned to afghanistan for the last time in 2007 .
groos says that people could not understand why she went back but she says she wanted to complete her service .
" people looked at me like i was an alien when i walked out of our house in my uniform , " she says .
" i was never at home and people asked my children , ' where is your mother ? ' and they would say ' she is in afghanistan ' . "
when she returned , people would stay out of her way .
her second husband also did n't understand and eventually he and groos divorced .
it was then that she decided that she wanted to leave everything behind and take her children to the other side of the world to start again .
she and three of her five kids moved to new zealand , as far away from afghanistan and germany as possible in order to find peace .
distance does n't end afghanistan trauma bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the horrors of aghanistan have never left heike groos but afghanistan did not release her from its grip .
groos continued to suffer from her experiences , suffering from nightmares and the inability to sleep .
she was also cut off from any kind of support from her previous employer : the bundeswehr .
" i had fulfilled my obligation -lrb- to the bundeswehr -rrb- and i found that very hard , " she says .
" i wish that someone had supported me and had not left me alone , but that did not happen , and i am sad about it .
they pushed me away , sent me to the army physician , to the psychiatrist who said ' you are traumatized . '
and then german people said : ' you were probably not hard enough , soldiers must always be tough . " '
while things were difficult for a long while , in time they also started to get better for heike groos and she began dealing with her experiences in afghanistan and working through her experiences .
the result was her first book , published last year , based on her time there : ' a beautiful day to die ' .

her second husband also did n't understand and eventually he and groos divorced .
it was then that she decided that she wanted to leave everything behind and take her children to the other side of the world to start again .
she and three of her five kids moved to new zealand , as far away from afghanistan and germany as possible in order to find peace .
distance does n't end afghanistan trauma bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the horrors of aghanistan have never left heike groos but afghanistan did not release her from its grip .
groos continued to suffer from her experiences , suffering from nightmares and the inability to sleep .
she was also cut off from any kind of support from her previous employer : the bundeswehr .
" i had fulfilled my obligation -lrb- to the bundeswehr -rrb- and i found that very hard , " she says .
" i wish that someone had supported me and had not left me alone , but that did not happen , and i am sad about it .
they pushed me away , sent me to the army physician , to the psychiatrist who said ' you are traumatized . '
and then german people said : ' you were probably not hard enough , soldiers must always be tough . " '
while things were difficult for a long while , in time they also started to get better for heike groos and she began dealing with her experiences in afghanistan and working through her experiences .
the result was her first book , published last year , based on her time there : ' a beautiful day to die ' .

vw wants its cars to escape their niche status and hit the mass market . just prior to the opening of the annual detroit auto show on monday , german carmaker volkswagen announced it plans for ramping up its presence in the united states , aiming to win over american consumers and sell twice the number of cars it does now in three to four years ' time .
" we will sell 400,000 to 450,000 vehicles in 2012/13 , " said stefan jacoby , head of volkswagen of america , on sunday , adding that the company 's us business could become profitable by 2013 . volkswagen , europe 's largest carmaker , has had a hard time finding its footing in the all-important us market .
its presence in china and brazil is strong and sales in germany have been helped by a government program last year that encouraged drivers to trade in old gas guzzlers for more for efficient cars .
in europe , vw has 21 percent of the market .
but vw market share in the us , including its audi brand , is only three percent .
part of the reason for that , according to analysts , has to do with the generally dismal state of the car industry in the wake of global recession .
although , vw 's small market share actually gave it a bit of a foot up since it was not as hard hit by the collapse of american auto sales as some of its rivals were .
american preferences bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vw has been trying to figure out how to fit the pieces together for the us market vw 's lackluster performance can also be traced back to its product line , which was not ideally suited to americans ' taste in cars .
" volkswagen was neither a premium brand like mercedes , nor a mass-market brand , " said marc tonn , a senior analyst at m.m. warburg .
" the company was kind of stuck in the middle . "
the wolfsburg-based concern focused on smaller or mid-size cars with highly advanced technological features when americans were more interested in buying larger vehicles , such as suvs or pick-up trucks .
" i think the focus will now be on maintaining german quality , but going a little in the direction of us size , " tonn added .
nevertheless , vw will not likely be turning out tank-like vehicles any time soon .
jacoby said he expects the market for compact and mid-sized sedans to increase faster than other segments , especially if oil prices convince more americans to downsize from their chevy tahoes and ford explorers .
" with higher oil prices , the us consumer is perhaps going to look a little more closely at smaller cars , " said christian breitsprecher , an auto analyst at sol oppenheim . from the niche to the masses volkswagen , which ranks behind brands like hyundai , honda , mercedes and bmw in the us , wants to emerge from its position as a niche carmaker to a mass-market product , one that can compete with extremely popular makes , such as toyota 's camry .
while the beetle quickly became a cult classic in the us and enjoyed great popularity in the 1960s and early 1970s , vw was never able to imitate its success with subsequent makes , such as its rabbit .
the company closed its last us plant in 1988 in pennsylvania amid sluggish sales .
" the rabbit was a flop and vw never really was able to get back in the mass market after that , " said breitsprecher , who added that volkswagen cars remained niche products .
" i mean , who bought a jetta ?
mostly college kids who could n't afford bmws . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : volkswagen beetle - a hit in america but vw wants a follow-up success becoming a mass-market car in the us is essential to vw 's ambitious expansion plans for the coming years , which include surpassing main rival toyota , the world 's largest automaker by sales volume .
new investments volkswagen is building a new plant in chattanooga , tennessee , investing up to $ 1 billion -lrb- 694 million euros -rrb- in a facility that , according to us head jacoby , " will enable the turnaround of vw 's us operations " and should create around 2,000 jobs .
increasing production and purchasing in the dollar zone is crucial to vw 's return to profitability as it would lower the company 's exposure to a dollar that is weak compared to the euro .
the carmaker is also spending $ 125 million on two new dealerships in new york city , which will begin sales in 2010 .
they are part of the company 's strategy to increase its presence and visibility in the us .
jacoby said he thinks the worst of the automobile sector 's woes to be behind them , with american car sales likely to be 11 million to 11.5 million in 2010 .
because of a stabilization of the labor and real-estate markets , " we are a little bit more optimistic now than we were a few months ago , " he said on sunday .
he added that he expects the us car sales to stabilize at around 15 million over the medium term , and vw 's longer-term us plans include selling 800,000 vehicles a year by 2018 .
" the us is a critical component of vw 's long-term strategy , " said analyst tonn .
" despite all the euphoria about emerging markets these days , if you want to be a global player you have to do well in america . "

heike groos joined up as a doctor but eventually found out that she was also expected to be a soldier , an experience that had long-lasting effects . when heike groos joined the bundeswehr as a doctor more than 20 years ago , she confesses it was just because she was looking for a job .
back in 1987 , when she started working as an emergency medical officer in a germany army hospital , she was still only a doctor .
that changed when she was sent to afghanistan in 2002 .
she became a doctor - and a soldier .
when groos was sent out to afghanistan , she did so without any question and without any concern .
even when it became obvious that she was now both a doctor and a soldier , armed with a weapon to protect her patients if necessary , she knew that this is what service in afghanistan was like .
it was as much part of the job as helping comrades and afghans alike as part of an emergency military ambulance team .
" at the beginning , in 2002 , it was a completely satisfying job , " she says .
" each moment made me think that we were doing something meaningful there .
just being there symbolized to the people that there was peace and that we would ensure that it remained that way , through our medical and humanitarian work there . "
suicide attack changes everything bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heike groos was first on the scene at the bomb blast but the positive feelings did not endure .
the situation changed dramatically with a suicide attack on a bus carrying german soldiers in june 2003 .
six bundeswehr troops were killed and 29 were injured , some seriously .
heike groos was one of the first on the scene ; she bandaged wounds , called for assistance , coordinated the medical efforts , comforted the injured and watched comrades die .
the event and the huge shock changed her and her colleagues ' lives forever .
" after that first suicide attack in june 2003 , we changed and we became deeply , deeply distrustful because we could not at all differentiate between the people , " she says .
" who is taliban and who is not , who is good and who is bad ? that was never clear to me . "
as well as suspicion and caution , heike groos says she felt rage ; rage against the taliban who had carried out the attack , rage against afghanistan , and rage against germany - the country which had sent her there .
she and her comrades also withdrew from the people they were supposed to be helping .
" we withdrew ourselves and wanted nothing do to with anything afghan , " she admits .
" it was because we saw those that we had come to help as those who had attacked us .
this perspective shifted in time , and we recognized that those who were friendly before still were but we were always more cautious after that .
i was never as trusting again . "
disillusionment leads to decision to leave bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : groos decided that her 2007 tour would be her last after the attack , her unit became closer , even more like a family than before .
her younger male comrades looked for comfort and assurance from the older , more experienced heike groos .
but there was no comfort for her .
groos started to see little sense in what she was doing , confined and isolated in the base due to the increasing dangers outside .
she decided that it could not go on .
she returned to afghanistan for the last time in 2007 .
groos says that people could not understand why she went back but she says she wanted to complete her service .
" people looked at me like i was an alien when i walked out of our house in my uniform , " she says .
" i was never at home and people asked my children , ' where is your mother ? ' and they would say ' she is in afghanistan ' . "
when she returned , people would stay out of her way .
her second husband also did n't understand and eventually he and groos divorced .
it was then that she decided that she wanted to leave everything behind and take her children to the other side of the world to start again .
she and three of her five kids moved to new zealand , as far away from afghanistan and germany as possible in order to find peace .
distance does n't end afghanistan trauma bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the horrors of aghanistan have never left heike groos but afghanistan did not release her from its grip .
groos continued to suffer from her experiences , suffering from nightmares and the inability to sleep .
she was also cut off from any kind of support from her previous employer : the bundeswehr .
" i had fulfilled my obligation -lrb- to the bundeswehr -rrb- and i found that very hard , " she says .
" i wish that someone had supported me and had not left me alone , but that did not happen , and i am sad about it .
they pushed me away , sent me to the army physician , to the psychiatrist who said ' you are traumatized . '
and then german people said : ' you were probably not hard enough , soldiers must always be tough . " '
while things were difficult for a long while , in time they also started to get better for heike groos and she began dealing with her experiences in afghanistan and working through her experiences .
the result was her first book , published last year , based on her time there : ' a beautiful day to die ' .

vw wants its cars to escape their niche status and hit the mass market . just prior to the opening of the annual detroit auto show on monday , german carmaker volkswagen announced it plans for ramping up its presence in the united states , aiming to win over american consumers and sell twice the number of cars it does now in three to four years ' time .
" we will sell 400,000 to 450,000 vehicles in 2012/13 , " said stefan jacoby , head of volkswagen of america , on sunday , adding that the company 's us business could become profitable by 2013 . volkswagen , europe 's largest carmaker , has had a hard time finding its footing in the all-important us market .
its presence in china and brazil is strong and sales in germany have been helped by a government program last year that encouraged drivers to trade in old gas guzzlers for more for efficient cars .
in europe , vw has 21 percent of the market .
but vw market share in the us , including its audi brand , is only three percent .
part of the reason for that , according to analysts , has to do with the generally dismal state of the car industry in the wake of global recession .
although , vw 's small market share actually gave it a bit of a foot up since it was not as hard hit by the collapse of american auto sales as some of its rivals were .
american preferences bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vw has been trying to figure out how to fit the pieces together for the us market vw 's lackluster performance can also be traced back to its product line , which was not ideally suited to americans ' taste in cars .
" volkswagen was neither a premium brand like mercedes , nor a mass-market brand , " said marc tonn , a senior analyst at m.m. warburg .
" the company was kind of stuck in the middle . "
the wolfsburg-based concern focused on smaller or mid-size cars with highly advanced technological features when americans were more interested in buying larger vehicles , such as suvs or pick-up trucks .
" i think the focus will now be on maintaining german quality , but going a little in the direction of us size , " tonn added .
nevertheless , vw will not likely be turning out tank-like vehicles any time soon .
jacoby said he expects the market for compact and mid-sized sedans to increase faster than other segments , especially if oil prices convince more americans to downsize from their chevy tahoes and ford explorers .
" with higher oil prices , the us consumer is perhaps going to look a little more closely at smaller cars , " said christian breitsprecher , an auto analyst at sol oppenheim . from the niche to the masses volkswagen , which ranks behind brands like hyundai , honda , mercedes and bmw in the us , wants to emerge from its position as a niche carmaker to a mass-market product , one that can compete with extremely popular makes , such as toyota 's camry .
while the beetle quickly became a cult classic in the us and enjoyed great popularity in the 1960s and early 1970s , vw was never able to imitate its success with subsequent makes , such as its rabbit .
the company closed its last us plant in 1988 in pennsylvania amid sluggish sales .
" the rabbit was a flop and vw never really was able to get back in the mass market after that , " said breitsprecher , who added that volkswagen cars remained niche products .
" i mean , who bought a jetta ?
mostly college kids who could n't afford bmws . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : volkswagen beetle - a hit in america but vw wants a follow-up success becoming a mass-market car in the us is essential to vw 's ambitious expansion plans for the coming years , which include surpassing main rival toyota , the world 's largest automaker by sales volume .
new investments volkswagen is building a new plant in chattanooga , tennessee , investing up to $ 1 billion -lrb- 694 million euros -rrb- in a facility that , according to us head jacoby , " will enable the turnaround of vw 's us operations " and should create around 2,000 jobs .
increasing production and purchasing in the dollar zone is crucial to vw 's return to profitability as it would lower the company 's exposure to a dollar that is weak compared to the euro .
the carmaker is also spending $ 125 million on two new dealerships in new york city , which will begin sales in 2010 .
they are part of the company 's strategy to increase its presence and visibility in the us .
jacoby said he thinks the worst of the automobile sector 's woes to be behind them , with american car sales likely to be 11 million to 11.5 million in 2010 .
because of a stabilization of the labor and real-estate markets , " we are a little bit more optimistic now than we were a few months ago , " he said on sunday .
he added that he expects the us car sales to stabilize at around 15 million over the medium term , and vw 's longer-term us plans include selling 800,000 vehicles a year by 2018 .
" the us is a critical component of vw 's long-term strategy , " said analyst tonn .
" despite all the euphoria about emerging markets these days , if you want to be a global player you have to do well in america . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 11.01.2010 ashton faces tough questions from european parliament großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ashton has been nominated for a top job in the eu commission .
catherine ashton can expect tough questions in her confirmation hearing to become the eu 's first foreign policy tchief .
will her negotiating skills compensate for her lack of foreign policy experience ? catherine ashton , the 53-year-old former european union trade commissioner and leader of britain 's house of lords , was expected to face intensive questioning at the european commission confirmation hearings , which began in brussels on monday .
ashton was nominated for the post of high representative for foreign affairs and security policy by eu heads of state at a summit last november , but must still be confirmed by parliament .
a surprise pick although ashton has long been regarded as an industry expert , her nomination for the newly-created post of eu foreign affairs minister came as a surprise .
the native of lancashire , england , has served only one year as eu trade commissioner and has no other foreign policy experience .
even in her native britain , ashton is virtually unknown , having never been elected to public office .
her past work experience includes posts in a provincial health authority , as well as positions in a number of government departments , including the education and justice ministries .
in 1999 , the labour government of then-prime minister tony blair awarded ashton the title of “ baroness , ” so that she could represent the party in the house of lords . in 2007 , current prime minister gordon brown appointed her leader of the house of lords .
however , ashton 's big break came in 2008 , when the post of eu trade commissioner became free and ashton became the first woman to hold the office .
hard questions during monday 's confirmation hearing , ashton is expected to have to defend herself against accusations of inadequate diplomatic experience .
also likely to come up during questioning : ashton 's past involvement with britain 's anti-nuclear group , the campaign for nuclear disarmament -lrb- cnd -rrb- .
during the initial round of questioning in november , the nominee for foreign affairs chief was challenged to deny taking funds from the soviet union during her days as treasurer for the cnd over 25 years ago .
all or nothing ashton will be among the first of 26 new appointees to go through the confirmation process in the european parliament . the hearings are scheduled to end on january 19 , with the parliament 's final vote of confidence on the new commission to take place january 26 in brussels .
although parliamentarians can not vote to approve or deny individual appointees , they can vote to reject the commission as a whole .
if approved , the new team is expected to begin its five-year term on february 1. smh / afp / rtre editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de eu parliament grills new foreign affairs chief the eu 's new director of foreign policy faced a tough question period in european parliament .
critics noted her lack of experience and low-key image .

catherine ashton can expect tough questions in her confirmation hearing to become the eu 's first foreign policy tchief .
will her negotiating skills compensate for her lack of foreign policy experience ? catherine ashton , the 53-year-old former european union trade commissioner and leader of britain 's house of lords , was expected to face intensive questioning at the european commission confirmation hearings , which began in brussels on monday .
ashton was nominated for the post of high representative for foreign affairs and security policy by eu heads of state at a summit last november , but must still be confirmed by parliament .
a surprise pick although ashton has long been regarded as an industry expert , her nomination for the newly-created post of eu foreign affairs minister came as a surprise .
the native of lancashire , england , has served only one year as eu trade commissioner and has no other foreign policy experience .
even in her native britain , ashton is virtually unknown , having never been elected to public office .
her past work experience includes posts in a provincial health authority , as well as positions in a number of government departments , including the education and justice ministries .
in 1999 , the labour government of then-prime minister tony blair awarded ashton the title of “ baroness , ” so that she could represent the party in the house of lords . in 2007 , current prime minister gordon brown appointed her leader of the house of lords .
however , ashton 's big break came in 2008 , when the post of eu trade commissioner became free and ashton became the first woman to hold the office .
hard questions during monday 's confirmation hearing , ashton is expected to have to defend herself against accusations of inadequate diplomatic experience .
also likely to come up during questioning : ashton 's past involvement with britain 's anti-nuclear group , the campaign for nuclear disarmament -lrb- cnd -rrb- .
during the initial round of questioning in november , the nominee for foreign affairs chief was challenged to deny taking funds from the soviet union during her days as treasurer for the cnd over 25 years ago .
all or nothing ashton will be among the first of 26 new appointees to go through the confirmation process in the european parliament . the hearings are scheduled to end on january 19 , with the parliament 's final vote of confidence on the new commission to take place january 26 in brussels .
although parliamentarians can not vote to approve or deny individual appointees , they can vote to reject the commission as a whole .

a surprise pick although ashton has long been regarded as an industry expert , her nomination for the newly-created post of eu foreign affairs minister came as a surprise .
the native of lancashire , england , has served only one year as eu trade commissioner and has no other foreign policy experience .
even in her native britain , ashton is virtually unknown , having never been elected to public office .
her past work experience includes posts in a provincial health authority , as well as positions in a number of government departments , including the education and justice ministries .
in 1999 , the labour government of then-prime minister tony blair awarded ashton the title of “ baroness , ” so that she could represent the party in the house of lords . in 2007 , current prime minister gordon brown appointed her leader of the house of lords .
however , ashton 's big break came in 2008 , when the post of eu trade commissioner became free and ashton became the first woman to hold the office .
hard questions during monday 's confirmation hearing , ashton is expected to have to defend herself against accusations of inadequate diplomatic experience .
also likely to come up during questioning : ashton 's past involvement with britain 's anti-nuclear group , the campaign for nuclear disarmament -lrb- cnd -rrb- .
during the initial round of questioning in november , the nominee for foreign affairs chief was challenged to deny taking funds from the soviet union during her days as treasurer for the cnd over 25 years ago .
all or nothing ashton will be among the first of 26 new appointees to go through the confirmation process in the european parliament . the hearings are scheduled to end on january 19 , with the parliament 's final vote of confidence on the new commission to take place january 26 in brussels .
although parliamentarians can not vote to approve or deny individual appointees , they can vote to reject the commission as a whole .
if approved , the new team is expected to begin its five-year term on february 1. smh / afp / rtre editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

one of those women is stefanie linsener whose time with the bundeswehr has included a four-month tour in afghanistan . stefanie linsener has never met tanja kreil .
but linsener , a soldier in the bundeswehr , is grateful for kreil 's fight for women like her .
in 2000 kreil won an amendment to germany 's constitution from the court of justice of the european union allowing women to take part in bundeswehr 's armed services .
up until that point they had been limited to working in the medical service or the military band .
without tanja kreil , there never would have been bundeswehr soldier stefanie linsener .
one year after the january 11 , 2000 ruling , the 18-year-old linsener joined the bundeswehr and became one of the first women trained to use weapons .

" women and men are treated equally , including with their salaries , " fischer says .

she and her fellow soldiers worked 13 to 14 hours a day in afghanistan for four months without a day off .
spending every day armed and in a flak vest and only seeing a country from behind the safety glass in her tank taught linsener to appreciate her life in germany .

one of those women is stefanie linsener whose time with the bundeswehr has included a four-month tour in afghanistan . stefanie linsener has never met tanja kreil .
but linsener , a soldier in the bundeswehr , is grateful for kreil 's fight for women like her .
in 2000 kreil won an amendment to germany 's constitution from the court of justice of the european union allowing women to take part in bundeswehr 's armed services .
up until that point they had been limited to working in the medical service or the military band .
without tanja kreil , there never would have been bundeswehr soldier stefanie linsener .
one year after the january 11 , 2000 ruling , the 18-year-old linsener joined the bundeswehr and became one of the first women trained to use weapons .
" my father was really proud of me , " she says .
" my mother had some misgivings , but she is also proud of me , of course , that i did it . " diving into an unknown world bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : linsener shows off the different types of uniforms she wears at first linsener had to get used to the drills and the tone her superiors use when speaking to her .
and she found her uniform practical but rather unfashionable " for a woman who pays attention to herself . "
linsener has a well-kept appearance and she wears jewelry when she 's working in her office .
linsener likes to laugh .
but when she , six other women and 60 male recruits had to crawl through the mud and dig out a position with a 30-kilogram -lrb- 66-pound -rrb- pack on her back and a 12-kilogram machine gun , she was n't laughing .
sometimes she wondered what the point of the exercises was , but through them she learned what her mental and physical limits were .
and she found the motivation to keep going .
" i said to myself , ' shut your eyes and get through it .
you 're doing this now , " ' she recounts .
" i think it 's true that women are a little bit more ambitious and have more willpower .
at least i did . "

defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg has invited her to visit the troops . bishop margot kaessmann and karl-theodor zu guttenberg agreed during their half-hour meeting on monday that there should be a broader public debate on the german bundeswehr 's mission in afghanistan , as well as a strengthened civil commitment .
the minister and the protestant church leader said they would continue their " critical dialogue " about the afghan deployment , possibly in the framework of the bundeswehr 's military academy or at protestant church academies . while the issue would n't be solved anytime soon , kaessmann said it was important that the church 's voice was heard in the debate .
kaessmann is the lutheran bishop of hanover and the first woman to head the ekd - an umbrella group for 22 churches that encompass germany 's 25 million protestants .
" nothing is right in afghanistan " the high-level meeting comes as a response to critical remarks by the bishop in december , when kaessmann said in an interview that the war in afghanistan could not be justified .
at two new year 's church services , she told congregations in berlin and dresden she did not approve of the western strategy in afghanistan , where 4,500 german military personnel are deployed with the international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- .
her comments were described as " naive , " " not helpful , " " unrealistic " - soldiers posted in afghanistan were as angered by the bishop 's views as many german politicians .
the german government - the third-largest force contributor after the united states and britain - is expected to decide whether to commit more troops to stabilizing afghanistan at an international conference in late january on how to assist the country .

but is it really against the law ? the schlecker drugstore mega-chain has come under heavy criticism for alleged wage dumping . the trade union verdi has accused schlecker of forcing its employees to take new contracts through a temporary employment agency called meniar , which pays only half of the usual hourly wage , about 6.70 euros -lrb- $ 9.73 -rrb- instead of 12.50 euros -lrb- $ 18.17 -rrb- . it also said it believed meniar was entirely controled by schlecker . politicians protest the labor minister in the german state of north rhine-westphalia , karl josef laumann , has also accused schlecker of systematic wage evasion . the süddeutsche zeitung newspaper reported that laumann wrote a letter to schlecker employees stating that temporary work is designed to compensate for operating peaks or in the case of vacation or illness , not to replace permanent staff . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schlecker has about 50,000 employees throughout europe federal labor minister ursula von der leyen appeared on a sunday evening talk show and said that the case would have to be examined closely to see if there abuse is abuse . she added that the federal employment agency -lrb- ba -rrb- is responsible for ensuring that every temporary employment agency has a license that must be renewed regularly . " there is a proper procedure , " she said .
" we are not in the wild west . " is it illegal ? however , a ba spokeswoman denied that schlecker ’ s actions were illegal . " the temporary employment act does not preclude sacking workers and replacing them with ones from a temporary employment agency under worse conditions , " said a ba spokeswoman on monday . she added the government would have to change the laws in order to prohibit similar actions . still , the association of temporary work agencies -lrb- bza -rrb- has been quick to distance itself from the business policies of schlecker . " such business practices are not consistent with the original meaning of temporary work and hurt the reputation of all temporary employment agencies , " bza spokesman wolfram linke told deutsche welle . linke added that companies who are members of the bza have to agree to pay employees an hourly wage of at least 7.51 euros -lrb- $ 10.51 -rrb- , despite the fact that germany does not have a minimum wage . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : labor minister ursula von der leyen said the situation must be carefully examined schlecker responds schlecker has denied the allegations of wage dumping and insists that its new stores pay up to 13 euros -lrb- $ 18.89 -rrb- an hour or more .
however , head of corporate communications florian baum said monday that schlecker had resolved " effective immediately " not to pursue any further contracts with the temporary employment company meniar . achim neumann of verdi was excited to hear the news . " i think this is fantastic - obviously a tremendous amount of pressure was necessary to convince schlecker of that misusing the temporary working laws is unacceptable .
it ’ s a very positive sign , " he told deutsche welle . schlecker has often come under criticism from the unions regarding its employment practices .
it has accused verdi of using " targeted disinformation and defamation campaigns " in the past . with more than 50,000 employees and stores in 12 countries , schlecker is the largest drugstore company in europe .

his post will be filled by trade and industry minister arlene foster . robinson agreed to the move on monday so that the scandal surrounding his wife 's affair could be settled .
calls for robinson 's resignation escalated over the weekend , as several key politicians feared his wife 's scandal could cause the region 's power-sharing executive to collapse .
robinson 's wife iris , who is also a top politician , admitted to having an affair with a 19-year-old man last week .
she also said she helped to raise 50,000 pounds -lrb- 55,600 euros -rrb- from two wealthy developers for him so he could set up his own café .
iris robinson is expected to leave her seats in the northern ireland assembly and the british house of commons shortly .

peter robinson has maintained that he had absolutely no knowledge of his wife 's affair or the financial deal between her and the 19-year-old .
bad timing the robinson scandal has come in the midst of a power-sharing struggle between the protestant democratic unionist party -lrb- dup -rrb- and the catholic sinn fein .
the former foes are finding it hard to hold their alliance together , as both sides have failed to agree on whether policing powers should be transferred from london to belfast .

his post will be filled by trade and industry minister arlene foster . robinson agreed to the move on monday so that the scandal surrounding his wife 's affair could be settled .
calls for robinson 's resignation escalated over the weekend , as several key politicians feared his wife 's scandal could cause the region 's power-sharing executive to collapse .
robinson 's wife iris , who is also a top politician , admitted to having an affair with a 19-year-old man last week .
she also said she helped to raise 50,000 pounds -lrb- 55,600 euros -rrb- from two wealthy developers for him so he could set up his own café .
iris robinson is expected to leave her seats in the northern ireland assembly and the british house of commons shortly .
she is also receiving psychiatric treatment in belfast , as she has previously admitted to attempting suicide and suffering severe depression .
peter robinson has maintained that he had absolutely no knowledge of his wife 's affair or the financial deal between her and the 19-year-old .
bad timing the robinson scandal has come in the midst of a power-sharing struggle between the protestant democratic unionist party -lrb- dup -rrb- and the catholic sinn fein .

defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg has invited her to visit the troops . bishop margot kaessmann and karl-theodor zu guttenberg agreed during their half-hour meeting on monday that there should be a broader public debate on the german bundeswehr 's mission in afghanistan , as well as a strengthened civil commitment .
the minister and the protestant church leader said they would continue their " critical dialogue " about the afghan deployment , possibly in the framework of the bundeswehr 's military academy or at protestant church academies . while the issue would n't be solved anytime soon , kaessmann said it was important that the church 's voice was heard in the debate .
kaessmann is the lutheran bishop of hanover and the first woman to head the ekd - an umbrella group for 22 churches that encompass germany 's 25 million protestants .
" nothing is right in afghanistan " the high-level meeting comes as a response to critical remarks by the bishop in december , when kaessmann said in an interview that the war in afghanistan could not be justified .
at two new year 's church services , she told congregations in berlin and dresden she did not approve of the western strategy in afghanistan , where 4,500 german military personnel are deployed with the international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- .
her comments were described as " naive , " " not helpful , " " unrealistic " - soldiers posted in afghanistan were as angered by the bishop 's views as many german politicians .
the german government - the third-largest force contributor after the united states and britain - is expected to decide whether to commit more troops to stabilizing afghanistan at an international conference in late january on how to assist the country .
opinion polls have repeatedly shown a majority of germans are opposed to the afghan deployment. db / dpa / epd editor : michael lawton michael lawton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg has invited her to visit the troops . bishop margot kaessmann and karl-theodor zu guttenberg agreed during their half-hour meeting on monday that there should be a broader public debate on the german bundeswehr 's mission in afghanistan , as well as a strengthened civil commitment .
the minister and the protestant church leader said they would continue their " critical dialogue " about the afghan deployment , possibly in the framework of the bundeswehr 's military academy or at protestant church academies . while the issue would n't be solved anytime soon , kaessmann said it was important that the church 's voice was heard in the debate .

and debates about safety are sure to continue . like all europe 's major football leagues , the german bundesliga has a number of players competing in the africa cup of nations in angola .
the first priority for clubs when the news of the attack broke was to contact their players and offer to fly them out of africa .
hanover , for example , were concerned about their tunisian defender karim haggui .
" karim told our sports directorship that he feels safe right now , " hanover spokesman andreas kundt told the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung newspaper .
three members of the togolese delegation were killed on friday when separatist rebels in an angolan enclave opened fire on the team bus .
a reserve goalkeeper had to be flown to south africa for emergency treatment for life-threatening gunshot wounds .
the togolese team subsequently quit the tournament and flew home .
bildunterschrift : the togolese team was flown home over the weekend " i was afraid for my life , " togolese defender assimiou toure , who plays for bayer leverkusen , told reporters .
" all i could do was jump under my seat and pray . "
thus far , no african player has asked his german club to get him out of angola .
but the shooting has occasioned furious debate about both the africa cup and safety in general on the continent ahead of the world 's premier soccer event .
relative safety ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany keeper rene adler has said he 's worried about the world cup in south africa international football functionaries , from fifa president sepp blatter on down , have been quick to offer assurances that the shooting in angola did not mean that this summer 's world cup in south africa would be unsafe .
" the measures taken for the africa cup are not comparable with those for a football world cup , which are planned years in advance , " german world cup advisor horst r. schmidt told the frankfurter rundschau newspaper .
indeed , south africa and angola are very different countries .
still , some likely members of the german national team at the world cup said they were worried .
" it 's completely sick , " germany 's top goalkeeper rene adler told the bild am sonntag newspaper .
" i have to ask how they 're going to ensure security at the world cup .
i 'm sure we 'll be safe as a team , but what about family members ? "
other team members had comparable reactions .
' when you hear something like that , you do a double take and start thinking , " germany midfielder bastian schweinsteiger told the sid sports news agency .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : otto pfister coached in africa for four decades german coach otto pfister , who spent most of his career working in africa and who coached the togolese team at the 2006 world cup , offered a more first-hand view .
he said that the world cup would not be especially risky but that different standards applied to africa .
" the security measures are , of course , not comparable with those in germany , " pfister said in an interview with sid .
" in this area , just as in the economy , we 're talking about developing countries .
and the distances are enormous .
how can they be expected to keep all of such vast distances completely under control ? "

for instance , pfister is among those who have criticized the togolese decision to withdraw from the tournament , which was ordered by togo 's prime minister .
he has said togo 's pull-out will only encourage extremist groups in angola , and he fears that wrong precedents could be set .
" the africa cup is a spectacular event for africans , one that 's almost more important than the world cup , " pfister told sid .
" you ca n't cancel events like these .
you quickly put yourself in a position where you can be blackmailed . "
in the purely sporting realm , though , the attack has caused football managers outside africa to question the africa cup .
clubs throughout europe were never happy about being forced to allow their employees to take part in the biennial event , and friday 's incident has fuelled arguments that the rules need to be changed .
borussia dortmund sports director michael zorc says teams should have the right to make decisions based on players ' safety .
" until that becomes the case , we ca n't bring our players back because they would then be suspended , " zorc told the frankfurter allegeimeine zeitung .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the shooting has been a huge blow for african football stuttgart commercial manager horst heldt , whose defender arthur boka plays for ivory coast , feels much the same way .
" the ideal thing for me would be if arthur could just come back , " heldt told the same paper .
ultimately , the attack on togo 's national team is going to force everyone concerned to take a realistic look at where africa and international football fit together .
fifa 's decision to award south africa the world cup was a bold and inclusive gesture , intended to signal that the world 's poorest continent was a full-fledged member in the global soccer community .
experts like pfister know that there are risks attached to that decision , but argue that those risks should not be allowed to overshadow all other aspects of the world 's biggest sporting event .
that will surely be one of the main topics of discussion for the duration of the africa cup and in the run-up to the world cup in south africa .

one of those women is stefanie linsener whose time with the bundeswehr has included a four-month tour in afghanistan . stefanie linsener has never met tanja kreil .
but linsener , a soldier in the bundeswehr , is grateful for kreil 's fight for women like her .
in 2000 kreil won an amendment to germany 's constitution from the court of justice of the european union allowing women to take part in bundeswehr 's armed services .
up until that point they had been limited to working in the medical service or the military band .
without tanja kreil , there never would have been bundeswehr soldier stefanie linsener .
one year after the january 11 , 2000 ruling , the 18-year-old linsener joined the bundeswehr and became one of the first women trained to use weapons .
" my father was really proud of me , " she says .
" my mother had some misgivings , but she is also proud of me , of course , that i did it .

linsener has a well-kept appearance and she wears jewelry when she 's working in her office .
linsener likes to laugh .
but when she , six other women and 60 male recruits had to crawl through the mud and dig out a position with a 30-kilogram -lrb- 66-pound -rrb- pack on her back and a 12-kilogram machine gun , she was n't laughing .
sometimes she wondered what the point of the exercises was , but through them she learned what her mental and physical limits were .
and she found the motivation to keep going .
" i said to myself , ' shut your eyes and get through it .
you 're doing this now , " ' she recounts .
" i think it 's true that women are a little bit more ambitious and have more willpower .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : men and women are treated the same in the bundeswehr , major fischer says major juergen fischer can only confirm linsener 's observations .
it 's been his experience , he said , that the female soldiers inspire the male recruits .
it 's only a matter of time , he says , before a woman is promoted to major or lieutenant colonel .
" women and men are treated equally , including with their salaries , " fischer says .
however , unlike men , women can not be required to participate in the armed services .
thus there is no conscription for female soldiers while german men are still required to serve in the bundeswehr or complete community service .

she knows that it 's a device that can kill but that 's part of being in the army , she says .
another part of being in the army for linsener was a four-month deployment in afghanistan .
she and her fellow soldiers worked 13 to 14 hours a day in afghanistan for four months without a day off .
spending every day armed and in a flak vest and only seeing a country from behind the safety glass in her tank taught linsener to appreciate her life in germany .
female soldiers do find it difficult to gain recognition in a male-dominated country like afghanistan , where women are hardly seen in public , she says .
when she once naively left the camp with her hair loose and uncovered , stones were thrown at her .
" this is like a woman in germany running around naked in the street , " she says she was later told . " helmet , combat boots and camouflage ready to go of those serving in the armed forces , about 17,000 or nine percent are women .
linsener was one those troops for nine years .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : linsener could be headed back to afghanistan at any moment .

gunmen attacked their team bus on friday killing three people . angolan president jose eduardo dos santos denounced the attack by separatist rebels in the northern enclave of cabinda , as the africa cup of nations kicked off in angola on sunday .
" we condemn this act of terror , but the competition will continue in cabinda , " dos santos said as he opened the tournament in the capital , luanda .
his government and african football officials had earlier pleaded with the togolese authorities to allow the players to fulfill their wish to compete in the tournament to honour their slain colleagues .
" it 's very sad .
it 's hard for africa and for us .
these things are part of life , you have to accept it , " togo captain emmanuel adebayor , who plays his club football for manchester city , told the afp news agency at the airport in cabinda .
sad homecoming the team later arrived on a government plane in the togolese capital lome , where it was met at the airport by prime minister gilbert fossoun houngbo , members of the government and sports officials , an afp correspondent reported .
the attack by hooded gunmen claimed the lives of togo 's assistant coach and the team 's press officer along with one of the drivers of the convoy .
the togolese reserve goalkeeper , kodjovi obilale , reportedly sustained two gunshot wounds in the attack and was flown to south africa for hospital treatment .
he is said to be in a stable condition .
seven others were also injured in the incident on friday , including defender serge akakpo of the romanian team vaslui .
the other injured passengers included two squad doctors and a journalist .
major sporting event the attack threatens to overshadow the tournament , which takes place in angola over the next three weeks .
the assailants opened fire on the vehicles as they travelled from cabinda , an angolan enclave to the north of the country .
the attack lasted some 20 minutes .
responsibility for the assault has been claimed by the separatist group front for the liberation of the enclave of cabinda -lrb- flec -rrb- .
the angolan minister in charge of affairs in cabinda , antonio bento bembe , said that the attack was " an act of terrorism . "
the oil-producing region of cabinda has been the site of a decades-long struggle for independence by the separatist group flec .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de development aid -pipe- 11.01.2010 yemen needs a broad development strategy , experts say großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yemen faces collapse as it runs out of both oil and water the surprise visit by the german foreign minister to yemen shows how worried the world is about the country as a haven for militants .
but experts say counterterrorism wo n't work without addressing yemen 's other woes . concerns are mounting about terrorism in yemen since the botched attempted bombing of a us airliner on christmas day .
us president barack obama has said al-qaeda 's offshoot in yemen was behind the failed attacks .
the issue was on the agenda when the german foreign minister , guido westerwelle , made a surprise visit to yemen on monday at the end of his middle east tour .
as washington ramps up its counterterrorism role in yemen and raises pressure on the government in sanaa to crack down on islamic extremists , some say that a single-minded focus on military force is deeply flawed .
" the united states and other western powers need to provide long-term economic development to reduce poverty and raise educational standards , " yemen 's foreign minister abu bakr al-qirbi said in an interview with the washington post last week .
that , he said , would help combat terrorism " in a more effective fashion than just using military force . "
that view is echoed by international aid agencies working on the ground in yemen , the arab world 's most impoverished nation .
bildunterschrift : experts warn against focusing solely on military means to fight terrorism " poverty is n't the only explanation for terrorism .
but it 's true that yemen 's extensive social and economic pressures contribute to making the country unstable - and thus make it easier for terrorist organizations to exploit people 's grievances and recruit them , " felix eikenberg , head of germany 's friedrich ebert political foundation in the capital sanaa , told deutsche welle .
germany , whose aid involvement in yemen dates back 40 years , is one of europe 's biggest donors to yemen .
massive social and economic pressures home to around 24 million people , yemen is grappling with one of the world 's highest population growth rates , rapidly depleting groundwater levels , and an unemployment rate of more than 20 percent .
the country 's economy is in tatters as it runs out of its meager oil reserves . " some 70 percent of the state 's revenues currently come from oil .
but oil reserves are dwindling so rapidly that we estimate yemen could become an oil importer in ten years , " eikenberg said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yemen faces a lethal cocktail of social and demographic problems total oil production has slumped from about 440,000 barrels per day in 2001 to 300,000 last year , according to the us energy information administration .
all that has contributed to widespread poverty in the country .
children suffer from a 50 percent malnutrition rate ; more than 40 percent of yemenis live below the poverty line , 18 percent on less than a dollar a day .
germany a major donor given the magnitude of its problems , yemen receives comparatively little per-capita international aid .
the world bank and the imf play an important role in financing yemen 's fragile economy .
the handful of bilateral donors to yemen include the netherlands , the us , japan and britain , germany remains one of the largest european players with annual aid amounting to about 37 million euros .
aid for 2009 and 2010 has been budgeted at 79 million euros .
much of it is focused on easing yemen 's severe water shortage , boosting primary education in the country - yemen had a literacy rate of 40 percent in 2007 - and helping diversify its oil-dominated economy .
zoe nautre , an expert at the berlin-based german council on foreign relations who spent a year in yemen reviewing german government aid efforts , said germany enjoyed excellent relations with the yemeni government .
" germany is often apolitical because it provides a lot of good technical assistance in yemen , particularly in the water sector , and does n't appear to be meddling in yemen 's affairs .
so , germany is well trusted in sanaa , " she told deutsche welle .
failure of governance but others point out that aid money is most needed to help tackle the failure of yemen 's corrupt government to maintain control over remote regions in the strife-torn country - which in turn is exacerbating yemen 's security woes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yemen remains a loosely-governed country under president saleh " one of the major reasons al qaeda is so strong in yemen is because the government is so weak , " guido steinberg , an expert on international terrorism and political developments in the gulf region at the berlin-based german institute for international and security affairs told deutsche welle .
" president ali abdullah saleh 's government is losing legitimacy - it 's not just failing to provide its own citizens with basic things such as water and jobs but is also losing control over vast swathes of the country . "
president saleh is facing a rebellion in the north , a secessionist movement in the south and growing islamic terrorism .
expert urges caution experts say that in addition to equipping and training yemen 's security forces to combat terrorism , the country needs a long-term development strategy - that means not just aid in areas such as education , health and infrastructure , but an inclusive politics .
" development policy in yemen has no meaning if it is n't embedded in a political strategy , " steinberg said .
eickenberg , whose organization is involved in democratization and reforming yemen 's political institutions , said western nations meeting at a yemen conference in london later this month needed to focus on promoting better governance , fighting corruption and nudging yemen to solve its northern conflict - with the help of its influential neighbor saudi arabia .
but nautre urged caution in drafting any future western strategy on yemen .
" western involvement in yemen can easily backfire because the population is very wary and there 's a strong anti-american sentiment there , " nautre said .
" the most important thing is for the west not to be seen as interfering in yemen from outside so that the people do n't turn against you and run into the arms of extremist groups . "

but experts say counterterrorism wo n't work without addressing yemen 's other woes . concerns are mounting about terrorism in yemen since the botched attempted bombing of a us airliner on christmas day .
us president barack obama has said al-qaeda 's offshoot in yemen was behind the failed attacks .
the issue was on the agenda when the german foreign minister , guido westerwelle , made a surprise visit to yemen on monday at the end of his middle east tour .
as washington ramps up its counterterrorism role in yemen and raises pressure on the government in sanaa to crack down on islamic extremists , some say that a single-minded focus on military force is deeply flawed .
" the united states and other western powers need to provide long-term economic development to reduce poverty and raise educational standards , " yemen 's foreign minister abu bakr al-qirbi said in an interview with the washington post last week .
that , he said , would help combat terrorism " in a more effective fashion than just using military force . "
that view is echoed by international aid agencies working on the ground in yemen , the arab world 's most impoverished nation .
bildunterschrift : experts warn against focusing solely on military means to fight terrorism " poverty is n't the only explanation for terrorism .
but it 's true that yemen 's extensive social and economic pressures contribute to making the country unstable - and thus make it easier for terrorist organizations to exploit people 's grievances and recruit them , " felix eikenberg , head of germany 's friedrich ebert political foundation in the capital sanaa , told deutsche welle .
germany , whose aid involvement in yemen dates back 40 years , is one of europe 's biggest donors to yemen .
massive social and economic pressures home to around 24 million people , yemen is grappling with one of the world 's highest population growth rates , rapidly depleting groundwater levels , and an unemployment rate of more than 20 percent .
the country 's economy is in tatters as it runs out of its meager oil reserves . " some 70 percent of the state 's revenues currently come from oil .
but oil reserves are dwindling so rapidly that we estimate yemen could become an oil importer in ten years , " eikenberg said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yemen faces a lethal cocktail of social and demographic problems total oil production has slumped from about 440,000 barrels per day in 2001 to 300,000 last year , according to the us energy information administration .
all that has contributed to widespread poverty in the country .
children suffer from a 50 percent malnutrition rate ; more than 40 percent of yemenis live below the poverty line , 18 percent on less than a dollar a day .
germany a major donor given the magnitude of its problems , yemen receives comparatively little per-capita international aid .
the world bank and the imf play an important role in financing yemen 's fragile economy .
the handful of bilateral donors to yemen include the netherlands , the us , japan and britain , germany remains one of the largest european players with annual aid amounting to about 37 million euros .
aid for 2009 and 2010 has been budgeted at 79 million euros .
much of it is focused on easing yemen 's severe water shortage , boosting primary education in the country - yemen had a literacy rate of 40 percent in 2007 - and helping diversify its oil-dominated economy .
zoe nautre , an expert at the berlin-based german council on foreign relations who spent a year in yemen reviewing german government aid efforts , said germany enjoyed excellent relations with the yemeni government .
" germany is often apolitical because it provides a lot of good technical assistance in yemen , particularly in the water sector , and does n't appear to be meddling in yemen 's affairs .
so , germany is well trusted in sanaa , " she told deutsche welle .
failure of governance but others point out that aid money is most needed to help tackle the failure of yemen 's corrupt government to maintain control over remote regions in the strife-torn country - which in turn is exacerbating yemen 's security woes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yemen remains a loosely-governed country under president saleh " one of the major reasons al qaeda is so strong in yemen is because the government is so weak , " guido steinberg , an expert on international terrorism and political developments in the gulf region at the berlin-based german institute for international and security affairs told deutsche welle .
" president ali abdullah saleh 's government is losing legitimacy - it 's not just failing to provide its own citizens with basic things such as water and jobs but is also losing control over vast swathes of the country . "
president saleh is facing a rebellion in the north , a secessionist movement in the south and growing islamic terrorism .
expert urges caution experts say that in addition to equipping and training yemen 's security forces to combat terrorism , the country needs a long-term development strategy - that means not just aid in areas such as education , health and infrastructure , but an inclusive politics .
" development policy in yemen has no meaning if it is n't embedded in a political strategy , " steinberg said .
eickenberg , whose organization is involved in democratization and reforming yemen 's political institutions , said western nations meeting at a yemen conference in london later this month needed to focus on promoting better governance , fighting corruption and nudging yemen to solve its northern conflict - with the help of its influential neighbor saudi arabia .
but nautre urged caution in drafting any future western strategy on yemen .
" western involvement in yemen can easily backfire because the population is very wary and there 's a strong anti-american sentiment there , " nautre said .
" the most important thing is for the west not to be seen as interfering in yemen from outside so that the people do n't turn against you and run into the arms of extremist groups . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de soccer -pipe- 11.01.2010 european footballers express concern , criticism after africa cup shooting großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the africa cup has gone ahead , but questions are being asked about security concern for african teammates and worries about safety at the world cup were the main reactions of european footballers following the deadly attack on togo 's national team .
and debates about safety are sure to continue . like all europe 's major football leagues , the german bundesliga has a number of players competing in the africa cup of nations in angola .
the first priority for clubs when the news of the attack broke was to contact their players and offer to fly them out of africa .
hanover , for example , were concerned about their tunisian defender karim haggui .
" karim told our sports directorship that he feels safe right now , " hanover spokesman andreas kundt told the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung newspaper .
three members of the togolese delegation were killed on friday when separatist rebels in an angolan enclave opened fire on the team bus .
a reserve goalkeeper had to be flown to south africa for emergency treatment for life-threatening gunshot wounds .
the togolese team subsequently quit the tournament and flew home .
bildunterschrift : the togolese team was flown home over the weekend " i was afraid for my life , " togolese defender assimiou toure , who plays for bayer leverkusen , told reporters .
" all i could do was jump under my seat and pray . "
thus far , no african player has asked his german club to get him out of angola .
but the shooting has occasioned furious debate about both the africa cup and safety in general on the continent ahead of the world 's premier soccer event .
relative safety ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany keeper rene adler has said he 's worried about the world cup in south africa international football functionaries , from fifa president sepp blatter on down , have been quick to offer assurances that the shooting in angola did not mean that this summer 's world cup in south africa would be unsafe .
" the measures taken for the africa cup are not comparable with those for a football world cup , which are planned years in advance , " german world cup advisor horst r. schmidt told the frankfurter rundschau newspaper .
indeed , south africa and angola are very different countries .
still , some likely members of the german national team at the world cup said they were worried .
" it 's completely sick , " germany 's top goalkeeper rene adler told the bild am sonntag newspaper .
" i have to ask how they 're going to ensure security at the world cup .
i 'm sure we 'll be safe as a team , but what about family members ? "
other team members had comparable reactions .
' when you hear something like that , you do a double take and start thinking , " germany midfielder bastian schweinsteiger told the sid sports news agency .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : otto pfister coached in africa for four decades german coach otto pfister , who spent most of his career working in africa and who coached the togolese team at the 2006 world cup , offered a more first-hand view .
he said that the world cup would not be especially risky but that different standards applied to africa .
" the security measures are , of course , not comparable with those in germany , " pfister said in an interview with sid .
" in this area , just as in the economy , we 're talking about developing countries .
and the distances are enormous .
how can they be expected to keep all of such vast distances completely under control ? "
hard choices bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stuttgart 's arthur boka -lrb- right -rrb- is one of the bundesliga players competing in angola the attack has focused attention on a number of issues , both for football and society in general .
for instance , pfister is among those who have criticized the togolese decision to withdraw from the tournament , which was ordered by togo 's prime minister .
he has said togo 's pull-out will only encourage extremist groups in angola , and he fears that wrong precedents could be set .
" the africa cup is a spectacular event for africans , one that 's almost more important than the world cup , " pfister told sid .
" you ca n't cancel events like these .
you quickly put yourself in a position where you can be blackmailed . "
in the purely sporting realm , though , the attack has caused football managers outside africa to question the africa cup .
clubs throughout europe were never happy about being forced to allow their employees to take part in the biennial event , and friday 's incident has fuelled arguments that the rules need to be changed .
borussia dortmund sports director michael zorc says teams should have the right to make decisions based on players ' safety .
" until that becomes the case , we ca n't bring our players back because they would then be suspended , " zorc told the frankfurter allegeimeine zeitung .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the shooting has been a huge blow for african football stuttgart commercial manager horst heldt , whose defender arthur boka plays for ivory coast , feels much the same way .
" the ideal thing for me would be if arthur could just come back , " heldt told the same paper .
ultimately , the attack on togo 's national team is going to force everyone concerned to take a realistic look at where africa and international football fit together .
fifa 's decision to award south africa the world cup was a bold and inclusive gesture , intended to signal that the world 's poorest continent was a full-fledged member in the global soccer community .
experts like pfister know that there are risks attached to that decision , but argue that those risks should not be allowed to overshadow all other aspects of the world 's biggest sporting event .
that will surely be one of the main topics of discussion for the duration of the africa cup and in the run-up to the world cup in south africa .

and debates about safety are sure to continue . like all europe 's major football leagues , the german bundesliga has a number of players competing in the africa cup of nations in angola .
the first priority for clubs when the news of the attack broke was to contact their players and offer to fly them out of africa .
hanover , for example , were concerned about their tunisian defender karim haggui .
" karim told our sports directorship that he feels safe right now , " hanover spokesman andreas kundt told the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung newspaper .
three members of the togolese delegation were killed on friday when separatist rebels in an angolan enclave opened fire on the team bus .
a reserve goalkeeper had to be flown to south africa for emergency treatment for life-threatening gunshot wounds .
the togolese team subsequently quit the tournament and flew home .
bildunterschrift : the togolese team was flown home over the weekend " i was afraid for my life , " togolese defender assimiou toure , who plays for bayer leverkusen , told reporters .
" all i could do was jump under my seat and pray . "
thus far , no african player has asked his german club to get him out of angola .
but the shooting has occasioned furious debate about both the africa cup and safety in general on the continent ahead of the world 's premier soccer event .
relative safety ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany keeper rene adler has said he 's worried about the world cup in south africa international football functionaries , from fifa president sepp blatter on down , have been quick to offer assurances that the shooting in angola did not mean that this summer 's world cup in south africa would be unsafe .
" the measures taken for the africa cup are not comparable with those for a football world cup , which are planned years in advance , " german world cup advisor horst r. schmidt told the frankfurter rundschau newspaper .
indeed , south africa and angola are very different countries .
still , some likely members of the german national team at the world cup said they were worried .
" it 's completely sick , " germany 's top goalkeeper rene adler told the bild am sonntag newspaper .
" i have to ask how they 're going to ensure security at the world cup .
i 'm sure we 'll be safe as a team , but what about family members ? "
other team members had comparable reactions .
' when you hear something like that , you do a double take and start thinking , " germany midfielder bastian schweinsteiger told the sid sports news agency .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : otto pfister coached in africa for four decades german coach otto pfister , who spent most of his career working in africa and who coached the togolese team at the 2006 world cup , offered a more first-hand view .
he said that the world cup would not be especially risky but that different standards applied to africa .
" the security measures are , of course , not comparable with those in germany , " pfister said in an interview with sid .
" in this area , just as in the economy , we 're talking about developing countries .
and the distances are enormous .
how can they be expected to keep all of such vast distances completely under control ? "
hard choices bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stuttgart 's arthur boka -lrb- right -rrb- is one of the bundesliga players competing in angola the attack has focused attention on a number of issues , both for football and society in general .
for instance , pfister is among those who have criticized the togolese decision to withdraw from the tournament , which was ordered by togo 's prime minister .
he has said togo 's pull-out will only encourage extremist groups in angola , and he fears that wrong precedents could be set .
" the africa cup is a spectacular event for africans , one that 's almost more important than the world cup , " pfister told sid .
" you ca n't cancel events like these .
you quickly put yourself in a position where you can be blackmailed . "
in the purely sporting realm , though , the attack has caused football managers outside africa to question the africa cup .
clubs throughout europe were never happy about being forced to allow their employees to take part in the biennial event , and friday 's incident has fuelled arguments that the rules need to be changed .
borussia dortmund sports director michael zorc says teams should have the right to make decisions based on players ' safety .
" until that becomes the case , we ca n't bring our players back because they would then be suspended , " zorc told the frankfurter allegeimeine zeitung .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the shooting has been a huge blow for african football stuttgart commercial manager horst heldt , whose defender arthur boka plays for ivory coast , feels much the same way .
" the ideal thing for me would be if arthur could just come back , " heldt told the same paper .
ultimately , the attack on togo 's national team is going to force everyone concerned to take a realistic look at where africa and international football fit together .
fifa 's decision to award south africa the world cup was a bold and inclusive gesture , intended to signal that the world 's poorest continent was a full-fledged member in the global soccer community .
experts like pfister know that there are risks attached to that decision , but argue that those risks should not be allowed to overshadow all other aspects of the world 's biggest sporting event .
that will surely be one of the main topics of discussion for the duration of the africa cup and in the run-up to the world cup in south africa .

but experts say counterterrorism wo n't work without addressing yemen 's other woes . concerns are mounting about terrorism in yemen since the botched attempted bombing of a us airliner on christmas day .
us president barack obama has said al-qaeda 's offshoot in yemen was behind the failed attacks .
the issue was on the agenda when the german foreign minister , guido westerwelle , made a surprise visit to yemen on monday at the end of his middle east tour .
as washington ramps up its counterterrorism role in yemen and raises pressure on the government in sanaa to crack down on islamic extremists , some say that a single-minded focus on military force is deeply flawed .
" the united states and other western powers need to provide long-term economic development to reduce poverty and raise educational standards , " yemen 's foreign minister abu bakr al-qirbi said in an interview with the washington post last week .
that , he said , would help combat terrorism " in a more effective fashion than just using military force . "
that view is echoed by international aid agencies working on the ground in yemen , the arab world 's most impoverished nation .
bildunterschrift : experts warn against focusing solely on military means to fight terrorism " poverty is n't the only explanation for terrorism .
but it 's true that yemen 's extensive social and economic pressures contribute to making the country unstable - and thus make it easier for terrorist organizations to exploit people 's grievances and recruit them , " felix eikenberg , head of germany 's friedrich ebert political foundation in the capital sanaa , told deutsche welle .
germany , whose aid involvement in yemen dates back 40 years , is one of europe 's biggest donors to yemen .
massive social and economic pressures home to around 24 million people , yemen is grappling with one of the world 's highest population growth rates , rapidly depleting groundwater levels , and an unemployment rate of more than 20 percent .
the country 's economy is in tatters as it runs out of its meager oil reserves . " some 70 percent of the state 's revenues currently come from oil .
but oil reserves are dwindling so rapidly that we estimate yemen could become an oil importer in ten years , " eikenberg said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yemen faces a lethal cocktail of social and demographic problems total oil production has slumped from about 440,000 barrels per day in 2001 to 300,000 last year , according to the us energy information administration .
all that has contributed to widespread poverty in the country .
children suffer from a 50 percent malnutrition rate ; more than 40 percent of yemenis live below the poverty line , 18 percent on less than a dollar a day .
germany a major donor given the magnitude of its problems , yemen receives comparatively little per-capita international aid .
the world bank and the imf play an important role in financing yemen 's fragile economy .
the handful of bilateral donors to yemen include the netherlands , the us , japan and britain , germany remains one of the largest european players with annual aid amounting to about 37 million euros .
aid for 2009 and 2010 has been budgeted at 79 million euros .
much of it is focused on easing yemen 's severe water shortage , boosting primary education in the country - yemen had a literacy rate of 40 percent in 2007 - and helping diversify its oil-dominated economy .
zoe nautre , an expert at the berlin-based german council on foreign relations who spent a year in yemen reviewing german government aid efforts , said germany enjoyed excellent relations with the yemeni government .
" germany is often apolitical because it provides a lot of good technical assistance in yemen , particularly in the water sector , and does n't appear to be meddling in yemen 's affairs .
so , germany is well trusted in sanaa , " she told deutsche welle .
failure of governance but others point out that aid money is most needed to help tackle the failure of yemen 's corrupt government to maintain control over remote regions in the strife-torn country - which in turn is exacerbating yemen 's security woes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yemen remains a loosely-governed country under president saleh " one of the major reasons al qaeda is so strong in yemen is because the government is so weak , " guido steinberg , an expert on international terrorism and political developments in the gulf region at the berlin-based german institute for international and security affairs told deutsche welle .
" president ali abdullah saleh 's government is losing legitimacy - it 's not just failing to provide its own citizens with basic things such as water and jobs but is also losing control over vast swathes of the country . "
president saleh is facing a rebellion in the north , a secessionist movement in the south and growing islamic terrorism .
expert urges caution experts say that in addition to equipping and training yemen 's security forces to combat terrorism , the country needs a long-term development strategy - that means not just aid in areas such as education , health and infrastructure , but an inclusive politics .

eickenberg , whose organization is involved in democratization and reforming yemen 's political institutions , said western nations meeting at a yemen conference in london later this month needed to focus on promoting better governance , fighting corruption and nudging yemen to solve its northern conflict - with the help of its influential neighbor saudi arabia .
but nautre urged caution in drafting any future western strategy on yemen .
" western involvement in yemen can easily backfire because the population is very wary and there 's a strong anti-american sentiment there , " nautre said .
" the most important thing is for the west not to be seen as interfering in yemen from outside so that the people do n't turn against you and run into the arms of extremist groups . "

but experts say counterterrorism wo n't work without addressing yemen 's other woes . concerns are mounting about terrorism in yemen since the botched attempted bombing of a us airliner on christmas day .
us president barack obama has said al-qaeda 's offshoot in yemen was behind the failed attacks .
the issue was on the agenda when the german foreign minister , guido westerwelle , made a surprise visit to yemen on monday at the end of his middle east tour .
as washington ramps up its counterterrorism role in yemen and raises pressure on the government in sanaa to crack down on islamic extremists , some say that a single-minded focus on military force is deeply flawed .
" the united states and other western powers need to provide long-term economic development to reduce poverty and raise educational standards , " yemen 's foreign minister abu bakr al-qirbi said in an interview with the washington post last week .
that , he said , would help combat terrorism " in a more effective fashion than just using military force . "
that view is echoed by international aid agencies working on the ground in yemen , the arab world 's most impoverished nation .
bildunterschrift : experts warn against focusing solely on military means to fight terrorism " poverty is n't the only explanation for terrorism .
but it 's true that yemen 's extensive social and economic pressures contribute to making the country unstable - and thus make it easier for terrorist organizations to exploit people 's grievances and recruit them , " felix eikenberg , head of germany 's friedrich ebert political foundation in the capital sanaa , told deutsche welle .
germany , whose aid involvement in yemen dates back 40 years , is one of europe 's biggest donors to yemen .
massive social and economic pressures home to around 24 million people , yemen is grappling with one of the world 's highest population growth rates , rapidly depleting groundwater levels , and an unemployment rate of more than 20 percent .
the country 's economy is in tatters as it runs out of its meager oil reserves . " some 70 percent of the state 's revenues currently come from oil .
but oil reserves are dwindling so rapidly that we estimate yemen could become an oil importer in ten years , " eikenberg said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yemen faces a lethal cocktail of social and demographic problems total oil production has slumped from about 440,000 barrels per day in 2001 to 300,000 last year , according to the us energy information administration .
all that has contributed to widespread poverty in the country .
children suffer from a 50 percent malnutrition rate ; more than 40 percent of yemenis live below the poverty line , 18 percent on less than a dollar a day .
germany a major donor given the magnitude of its problems , yemen receives comparatively little per-capita international aid .
the world bank and the imf play an important role in financing yemen 's fragile economy .
the handful of bilateral donors to yemen include the netherlands , the us , japan and britain , germany remains one of the largest european players with annual aid amounting to about 37 million euros .
aid for 2009 and 2010 has been budgeted at 79 million euros .
much of it is focused on easing yemen 's severe water shortage , boosting primary education in the country - yemen had a literacy rate of 40 percent in 2007 - and helping diversify its oil-dominated economy .
zoe nautre , an expert at the berlin-based german council on foreign relations who spent a year in yemen reviewing german government aid efforts , said germany enjoyed excellent relations with the yemeni government .
" germany is often apolitical because it provides a lot of good technical assistance in yemen , particularly in the water sector , and does n't appear to be meddling in yemen 's affairs .
so , germany is well trusted in sanaa , " she told deutsche welle .
failure of governance but others point out that aid money is most needed to help tackle the failure of yemen 's corrupt government to maintain control over remote regions in the strife-torn country - which in turn is exacerbating yemen 's security woes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yemen remains a loosely-governed country under president saleh " one of the major reasons al qaeda is so strong in yemen is because the government is so weak , " guido steinberg , an expert on international terrorism and political developments in the gulf region at the berlin-based german institute for international and security affairs told deutsche welle .
" president ali abdullah saleh 's government is losing legitimacy - it 's not just failing to provide its own citizens with basic things such as water and jobs but is also losing control over vast swathes of the country . "
president saleh is facing a rebellion in the north , a secessionist movement in the south and growing islamic terrorism .
expert urges caution experts say that in addition to equipping and training yemen 's security forces to combat terrorism , the country needs a long-term development strategy - that means not just aid in areas such as education , health and infrastructure , but an inclusive politics .
" development policy in yemen has no meaning if it is n't embedded in a political strategy , " steinberg said .
eickenberg , whose organization is involved in democratization and reforming yemen 's political institutions , said western nations meeting at a yemen conference in london later this month needed to focus on promoting better governance , fighting corruption and nudging yemen to solve its northern conflict - with the help of its influential neighbor saudi arabia .

as washington ramps up its counterterrorism role in yemen and raises pressure on the government in sanaa to crack down on islamic extremists , some say that a single-minded focus on military force is deeply flawed .
" the united states and other western powers need to provide long-term economic development to reduce poverty and raise educational standards , " yemen 's foreign minister abu bakr al-qirbi said in an interview with the washington post last week .
that , he said , would help combat terrorism " in a more effective fashion than just using military force . "
that view is echoed by international aid agencies working on the ground in yemen , the arab world 's most impoverished nation .
bildunterschrift : experts warn against focusing solely on military means to fight terrorism " poverty is n't the only explanation for terrorism .
but it 's true that yemen 's extensive social and economic pressures contribute to making the country unstable - and thus make it easier for terrorist organizations to exploit people 's grievances and recruit them , " felix eikenberg , head of germany 's friedrich ebert political foundation in the capital sanaa , told deutsche welle .
germany , whose aid involvement in yemen dates back 40 years , is one of europe 's biggest donors to yemen .
massive social and economic pressures home to around 24 million people , yemen is grappling with one of the world 's highest population growth rates , rapidly depleting groundwater levels , and an unemployment rate of more than 20 percent .
the country 's economy is in tatters as it runs out of its meager oil reserves . " some 70 percent of the state 's revenues currently come from oil .
but oil reserves are dwindling so rapidly that we estimate yemen could become an oil importer in ten years , " eikenberg said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yemen faces a lethal cocktail of social and demographic problems total oil production has slumped from about 440,000 barrels per day in 2001 to 300,000 last year , according to the us energy information administration .
all that has contributed to widespread poverty in the country .
children suffer from a 50 percent malnutrition rate ; more than 40 percent of yemenis live below the poverty line , 18 percent on less than a dollar a day .
germany a major donor given the magnitude of its problems , yemen receives comparatively little per-capita international aid .
the world bank and the imf play an important role in financing yemen 's fragile economy .
the handful of bilateral donors to yemen include the netherlands , the us , japan and britain , germany remains one of the largest european players with annual aid amounting to about 37 million euros .
aid for 2009 and 2010 has been budgeted at 79 million euros .
much of it is focused on easing yemen 's severe water shortage , boosting primary education in the country - yemen had a literacy rate of 40 percent in 2007 - and helping diversify its oil-dominated economy .
zoe nautre , an expert at the berlin-based german council on foreign relations who spent a year in yemen reviewing german government aid efforts , said germany enjoyed excellent relations with the yemeni government .
" germany is often apolitical because it provides a lot of good technical assistance in yemen , particularly in the water sector , and does n't appear to be meddling in yemen 's affairs .
so , germany is well trusted in sanaa , " she told deutsche welle .
failure of governance but others point out that aid money is most needed to help tackle the failure of yemen 's corrupt government to maintain control over remote regions in the strife-torn country - which in turn is exacerbating yemen 's security woes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yemen remains a loosely-governed country under president saleh " one of the major reasons al qaeda is so strong in yemen is because the government is so weak , " guido steinberg , an expert on international terrorism and political developments in the gulf region at the berlin-based german institute for international and security affairs told deutsche welle .
" president ali abdullah saleh 's government is losing legitimacy - it 's not just failing to provide its own citizens with basic things such as water and jobs but is also losing control over vast swathes of the country . "
president saleh is facing a rebellion in the north , a secessionist movement in the south and growing islamic terrorism .
expert urges caution experts say that in addition to equipping and training yemen 's security forces to combat terrorism , the country needs a long-term development strategy - that means not just aid in areas such as education , health and infrastructure , but an inclusive politics .
" development policy in yemen has no meaning if it is n't embedded in a political strategy , " steinberg said .
eickenberg , whose organization is involved in democratization and reforming yemen 's political institutions , said western nations meeting at a yemen conference in london later this month needed to focus on promoting better governance , fighting corruption and nudging yemen to solve its northern conflict - with the help of its influential neighbor saudi arabia .
but nautre urged caution in drafting any future western strategy on yemen .
" western involvement in yemen can easily backfire because the population is very wary and there 's a strong anti-american sentiment there , " nautre said .
" the most important thing is for the west not to be seen as interfering in yemen from outside so that the people do n't turn against you and run into the arms of extremist groups . "

but is it really against the law ? the schlecker drugstore mega-chain has come under heavy criticism for alleged wage dumping . the trade union verdi has accused schlecker of forcing its employees to take new contracts through a temporary employment agency called meniar , which pays only half of the usual hourly wage , about 6.70 euros -lrb- $ 9.73 -rrb- instead of 12.50 euros -lrb- $ 18.17 -rrb- . it also said it believed meniar was entirely controled by schlecker . politicians protest the labor minister in the german state of north rhine-westphalia , karl josef laumann , has also accused schlecker of systematic wage evasion . the süddeutsche zeitung newspaper reported that laumann wrote a letter to schlecker employees stating that temporary work is designed to compensate for operating peaks or in the case of vacation or illness , not to replace permanent staff . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schlecker has about 50,000 employees throughout europe federal labor minister ursula von der leyen appeared on a sunday evening talk show and said that the case would have to be examined closely to see if there abuse is abuse . she added that the federal employment agency -lrb- ba -rrb- is responsible for ensuring that every temporary employment agency has a license that must be renewed regularly . " there is a proper procedure , " she said .
" we are not in the wild west . " is it illegal ? however , a ba spokeswoman denied that schlecker ’ s actions were illegal . " the temporary employment act does not preclude sacking workers and replacing them with ones from a temporary employment agency under worse conditions , " said a ba spokeswoman on monday . she added the government would have to change the laws in order to prohibit similar actions . still , the association of temporary work agencies -lrb- bza -rrb- has been quick to distance itself from the business policies of schlecker . " such business practices are not consistent with the original meaning of temporary work and hurt the reputation of all temporary employment agencies , " bza spokesman wolfram linke told deutsche welle . linke added that companies who are members of the bza have to agree to pay employees an hourly wage of at least 7.51 euros -lrb- $ 10.51 -rrb- , despite the fact that germany does not have a minimum wage . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : labor minister ursula von der leyen said the situation must be carefully examined schlecker responds schlecker has denied the allegations of wage dumping and insists that its new stores pay up to 13 euros -lrb- $ 18.89 -rrb- an hour or more .
however , head of corporate communications florian baum said monday that schlecker had resolved " effective immediately " not to pursue any further contracts with the temporary employment company meniar . achim neumann of verdi was excited to hear the news . " i think this is fantastic - obviously a tremendous amount of pressure was necessary to convince schlecker of that misusing the temporary working laws is unacceptable .
it ’ s a very positive sign , " he told deutsche welle . schlecker has often come under criticism from the unions regarding its employment practices .
it has accused verdi of using " targeted disinformation and defamation campaigns " in the past . with more than 50,000 employees and stores in 12 countries , schlecker is the largest drugstore company in europe .

but experts say counterterrorism wo n't work without addressing yemen 's other woes . concerns are mounting about terrorism in yemen since the botched attempted bombing of a us airliner on christmas day .
us president barack obama has said al-qaeda 's offshoot in yemen was behind the failed attacks .
the issue was on the agenda when the german foreign minister , guido westerwelle , made a surprise visit to yemen on monday at the end of his middle east tour .
as washington ramps up its counterterrorism role in yemen and raises pressure on the government in sanaa to crack down on islamic extremists , some say that a single-minded focus on military force is deeply flawed .
" the united states and other western powers need to provide long-term economic development to reduce poverty and raise educational standards , " yemen 's foreign minister abu bakr al-qirbi said in an interview with the washington post last week .
that , he said , would help combat terrorism " in a more effective fashion than just using military force . "
that view is echoed by international aid agencies working on the ground in yemen , the arab world 's most impoverished nation .
bildunterschrift : experts warn against focusing solely on military means to fight terrorism " poverty is n't the only explanation for terrorism .
but it 's true that yemen 's extensive social and economic pressures contribute to making the country unstable - and thus make it easier for terrorist organizations to exploit people 's grievances and recruit them , " felix eikenberg , head of germany 's friedrich ebert political foundation in the capital sanaa , told deutsche welle .
germany , whose aid involvement in yemen dates back 40 years , is one of europe 's biggest donors to yemen .
massive social and economic pressures home to around 24 million people , yemen is grappling with one of the world 's highest population growth rates , rapidly depleting groundwater levels , and an unemployment rate of more than 20 percent .
the country 's economy is in tatters as it runs out of its meager oil reserves . " some 70 percent of the state 's revenues currently come from oil .
but oil reserves are dwindling so rapidly that we estimate yemen could become an oil importer in ten years , " eikenberg said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yemen faces a lethal cocktail of social and demographic problems total oil production has slumped from about 440,000 barrels per day in 2001 to 300,000 last year , according to the us energy information administration .
all that has contributed to widespread poverty in the country .
children suffer from a 50 percent malnutrition rate ; more than 40 percent of yemenis live below the poverty line , 18 percent on less than a dollar a day .
germany a major donor given the magnitude of its problems , yemen receives comparatively little per-capita international aid .
the world bank and the imf play an important role in financing yemen 's fragile economy .
the handful of bilateral donors to yemen include the netherlands , the us , japan and britain , germany remains one of the largest european players with annual aid amounting to about 37 million euros .
aid for 2009 and 2010 has been budgeted at 79 million euros .
much of it is focused on easing yemen 's severe water shortage , boosting primary education in the country - yemen had a literacy rate of 40 percent in 2007 - and helping diversify its oil-dominated economy .
zoe nautre , an expert at the berlin-based german council on foreign relations who spent a year in yemen reviewing german government aid efforts , said germany enjoyed excellent relations with the yemeni government .
" germany is often apolitical because it provides a lot of good technical assistance in yemen , particularly in the water sector , and does n't appear to be meddling in yemen 's affairs .
so , germany is well trusted in sanaa , " she told deutsche welle .
failure of governance but others point out that aid money is most needed to help tackle the failure of yemen 's corrupt government to maintain control over remote regions in the strife-torn country - which in turn is exacerbating yemen 's security woes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yemen remains a loosely-governed country under president saleh " one of the major reasons al qaeda is so strong in yemen is because the government is so weak , " guido steinberg , an expert on international terrorism and political developments in the gulf region at the berlin-based german institute for international and security affairs told deutsche welle .
" president ali abdullah saleh 's government is losing legitimacy - it 's not just failing to provide its own citizens with basic things such as water and jobs but is also losing control over vast swathes of the country . "
president saleh is facing a rebellion in the north , a secessionist movement in the south and growing islamic terrorism .
expert urges caution experts say that in addition to equipping and training yemen 's security forces to combat terrorism , the country needs a long-term development strategy - that means not just aid in areas such as education , health and infrastructure , but an inclusive politics .
" development policy in yemen has no meaning if it is n't embedded in a political strategy , " steinberg said .
eickenberg , whose organization is involved in democratization and reforming yemen 's political institutions , said western nations meeting at a yemen conference in london later this month needed to focus on promoting better governance , fighting corruption and nudging yemen to solve its northern conflict - with the help of its influential neighbor saudi arabia .
but nautre urged caution in drafting any future western strategy on yemen .
" western involvement in yemen can easily backfire because the population is very wary and there 's a strong anti-american sentiment there , " nautre said .
" the most important thing is for the west not to be seen as interfering in yemen from outside so that the people do n't turn against you and run into the arms of extremist groups . "

but is it really against the law ? the schlecker drugstore mega-chain has come under heavy criticism for alleged wage dumping . the trade union verdi has accused schlecker of forcing its employees to take new contracts through a temporary employment agency called meniar , which pays only half of the usual hourly wage , about 6.70 euros -lrb- $ 9.73 -rrb- instead of 12.50 euros -lrb- $ 18.17 -rrb- . it also said it believed meniar was entirely controled by schlecker . politicians protest the labor minister in the german state of north rhine-westphalia , karl josef laumann , has also accused schlecker of systematic wage evasion . the süddeutsche zeitung newspaper reported that laumann wrote a letter to schlecker employees stating that temporary work is designed to compensate for operating peaks or in the case of vacation or illness , not to replace permanent staff . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schlecker has about 50,000 employees throughout europe federal labor minister ursula von der leyen appeared on a sunday evening talk show and said that the case would have to be examined closely to see if there abuse is abuse . she added that the federal employment agency -lrb- ba -rrb- is responsible for ensuring that every temporary employment agency has a license that must be renewed regularly . " there is a proper procedure , " she said .
" we are not in the wild west . " is it illegal ? however , a ba spokeswoman denied that schlecker ’ s actions were illegal . " the temporary employment act does not preclude sacking workers and replacing them with ones from a temporary employment agency under worse conditions , " said a ba spokeswoman on monday . she added the government would have to change the laws in order to prohibit similar actions . still , the association of temporary work agencies -lrb- bza -rrb- has been quick to distance itself from the business policies of schlecker . " such business practices are not consistent with the original meaning of temporary work and hurt the reputation of all temporary employment agencies , " bza spokesman wolfram linke told deutsche welle . linke added that companies who are members of the bza have to agree to pay employees an hourly wage of at least 7.51 euros -lrb- $ 10.51 -rrb- , despite the fact that germany does not have a minimum wage . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : labor minister ursula von der leyen said the situation must be carefully examined schlecker responds schlecker has denied the allegations of wage dumping and insists that its new stores pay up to 13 euros -lrb- $ 18.89 -rrb- an hour or more .
however , head of corporate communications florian baum said monday that schlecker had resolved " effective immediately " not to pursue any further contracts with the temporary employment company meniar . achim neumann of verdi was excited to hear the news . " i think this is fantastic - obviously a tremendous amount of pressure was necessary to convince schlecker of that misusing the temporary working laws is unacceptable .
it ’ s a very positive sign , " he told deutsche welle . schlecker has often come under criticism from the unions regarding its employment practices .
it has accused verdi of using " targeted disinformation and defamation campaigns " in the past . with more than 50,000 employees and stores in 12 countries , schlecker is the largest drugstore company in europe .

the west is ready to impose strict sanctions but russia and china disagree .
they want to use diplomacy .
china , which holds the rotating presidency in january , is a strong supporter of the regime in tehran .
however , chinese dissidents are showing their support of the opposition movement on the internet . china thinks that the nuclear row with iran can be resolved with dialogue and negotiations .
it says more time and more patience is needed .
moreover , it seems less certain than the west about tehran ’ s nuclear intentions .
beijing believes that the nuclear programme is only being developed for civilian purposes , says german iran expert udo steinbach .
“ china does not share the international community ’ s dramatic interpretation of the programme , ” he says , “ which presumes that iran is working on a bomb . ”
three un resolutions against iran however , to prevent tehran from building a bomb in the future , beijing has already supported three un resolutions against iran .
these allow sanctions to be imposed on organisations and individuals that develop nuclear weapons .
but china does not support stricter sanctions .
china has massive economic interests in iran , from which the energy-hungry country imports some 15 percent of its oil .
chinese companies have invested millions to tap into the country ’ s oil and gas reserves .
the two regimes are also linked by a similar attitude to the international community .
neither government likes it when the west interferes with what they call their domestic affairs .
they are both extremely intolerant of opposition and ready to use repression to keep it under control .
“ we can assume that the chinese leadership approves the iranian government ’ s measures against the demonstrators , ” says steinbach .
“ the beijing system is still prepared to beat down any resistance . ”
the iranian opposition website www.rahesabz.net , which translates as the green path , thinks that the chinese government is actively helping the iranian authorities to repress protests by providing weapons and vehicles .
bloggers have posted photos to illustrate these allegations , which tehran has rejected as being western fakes .
chinese dissidents support iranian opposition whilst the regimes are thought to be working together , dissidents in both countries are also connected by the internet .
the iranian opposition movement has received many messages of support via the twitter-based “ china4iran ” group for example .
“ since june , we ’ ve been following really closely because we feel the iranian people are in a similar position as the chinese , ” explains one activist , who refused to be named .
“ what they did is very courageous - they showed us courage by being willing to stand up to the regime and demand what they actually want .
they want to be fully represented in this country .
that ’ s what we want here exactly in china . “ a spokesperson from the chinese foreign ministry said at the beginning of china ’ s un security council presidency that the government hoped iranian society would remain unified and stable .
in january , there is likely to be little talk about international negotiations on iran ’ s nuclear programme .
tehran has more pressing things to attend - it hopes to get iran 's opposition movement under control .

the west is ready to impose strict sanctions but russia and china disagree .
they want to use diplomacy .
china , which holds the rotating presidency in january , is a strong supporter of the regime in tehran .
however , chinese dissidents are showing their support of the opposition movement on the internet . china thinks that the nuclear row with iran can be resolved with dialogue and negotiations .
it says more time and more patience is needed .
moreover , it seems less certain than the west about tehran ’ s nuclear intentions .
beijing believes that the nuclear programme is only being developed for civilian purposes , says german iran expert udo steinbach .
“ china does not share the international community ’ s dramatic interpretation of the programme , ” he says , “ which presumes that iran is working on a bomb . ”
three un resolutions against iran however , to prevent tehran from building a bomb in the future , beijing has already supported three un resolutions against iran .
these allow sanctions to be imposed on organisations and individuals that develop nuclear weapons .
but china does not support stricter sanctions .
china has massive economic interests in iran , from which the energy-hungry country imports some 15 percent of its oil .
chinese companies have invested millions to tap into the country ’ s oil and gas reserves .
the two regimes are also linked by a similar attitude to the international community .
neither government likes it when the west interferes with what they call their domestic affairs .
they are both extremely intolerant of opposition and ready to use repression to keep it under control .
“ we can assume that the chinese leadership approves the iranian government ’ s measures against the demonstrators , ” says steinbach .
“ the beijing system is still prepared to beat down any resistance . ”
the iranian opposition website www.rahesabz.net , which translates as the green path , thinks that the chinese government is actively helping the iranian authorities to repress protests by providing weapons and vehicles .
bloggers have posted photos to illustrate these allegations , which tehran has rejected as being western fakes .
chinese dissidents support iranian opposition whilst the regimes are thought to be working together , dissidents in both countries are also connected by the internet .
the iranian opposition movement has received many messages of support via the twitter-based “ china4iran ” group for example .
“ since june , we ’ ve been following really closely because we feel the iranian people are in a similar position as the chinese , ” explains one activist , who refused to be named .
“ what they did is very courageous - they showed us courage by being willing to stand up to the regime and demand what they actually want .
they want to be fully represented in this country .
that ’ s what we want here exactly in china . “ a spokesperson from the chinese foreign ministry said at the beginning of china ’ s un security council presidency that the government hoped iranian society would remain unified and stable .
in january , there is likely to be little talk about international negotiations on iran ’ s nuclear programme .
tehran has more pressing things to attend - it hopes to get iran 's opposition movement under control .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de development aid -pipe- 11.01.2010 yemen needs a broad development strategy , experts say großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yemen faces collapse as it runs out of both oil and water the surprise visit by the german foreign minister to yemen shows how worried the world is about the country as a haven for militants .
but experts say counterterrorism wo n't work without addressing yemen 's other woes . concerns are mounting about terrorism in yemen since the botched attempted bombing of a us airliner on christmas day .
us president barack obama has said al-qaeda 's offshoot in yemen was behind the failed attacks .
the issue was on the agenda when the german foreign minister , guido westerwelle , made a surprise visit to yemen on monday at the end of his middle east tour .
as washington ramps up its counterterrorism role in yemen and raises pressure on the government in sanaa to crack down on islamic extremists , some say that a single-minded focus on military force is deeply flawed .
" the united states and other western powers need to provide long-term economic development to reduce poverty and raise educational standards , " yemen 's foreign minister abu bakr al-qirbi said in an interview with the washington post last week .
that , he said , would help combat terrorism " in a more effective fashion than just using military force . "
that view is echoed by international aid agencies working on the ground in yemen , the arab world 's most impoverished nation .
bildunterschrift : experts warn against focusing solely on military means to fight terrorism " poverty is n't the only explanation for terrorism .
but it 's true that yemen 's extensive social and economic pressures contribute to making the country unstable - and thus make it easier for terrorist organizations to exploit people 's grievances and recruit them , " felix eikenberg , head of germany 's friedrich ebert political foundation in the capital sanaa , told deutsche welle .
germany , whose aid involvement in yemen dates back 40 years , is one of europe 's biggest donors to yemen .
massive social and economic pressures home to around 24 million people , yemen is grappling with one of the world 's highest population growth rates , rapidly depleting groundwater levels , and an unemployment rate of more than 20 percent .
the country 's economy is in tatters as it runs out of its meager oil reserves . " some 70 percent of the state 's revenues currently come from oil .
but oil reserves are dwindling so rapidly that we estimate yemen could become an oil importer in ten years , " eikenberg said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yemen faces a lethal cocktail of social and demographic problems total oil production has slumped from about 440,000 barrels per day in 2001 to 300,000 last year , according to the us energy information administration .
all that has contributed to widespread poverty in the country .
children suffer from a 50 percent malnutrition rate ; more than 40 percent of yemenis live below the poverty line , 18 percent on less than a dollar a day .
germany a major donor given the magnitude of its problems , yemen receives comparatively little per-capita international aid .
the world bank and the imf play an important role in financing yemen 's fragile economy .
the handful of bilateral donors to yemen include the netherlands , the us , japan and britain , germany remains one of the largest european players with annual aid amounting to about 37 million euros .
aid for 2009 and 2010 has been budgeted at 79 million euros .
much of it is focused on easing yemen 's severe water shortage , boosting primary education in the country - yemen had a literacy rate of 40 percent in 2007 - and helping diversify its oil-dominated economy .
zoe nautre , an expert at the berlin-based german council on foreign relations who spent a year in yemen reviewing german government aid efforts , said germany enjoyed excellent relations with the yemeni government .
" germany is often apolitical because it provides a lot of good technical assistance in yemen , particularly in the water sector , and does n't appear to be meddling in yemen 's affairs .
so , germany is well trusted in sanaa , " she told deutsche welle .
failure of governance but others point out that aid money is most needed to help tackle the failure of yemen 's corrupt government to maintain control over remote regions in the strife-torn country - which in turn is exacerbating yemen 's security woes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yemen remains a loosely-governed country under president saleh " one of the major reasons al qaeda is so strong in yemen is because the government is so weak , " guido steinberg , an expert on international terrorism and political developments in the gulf region at the berlin-based german institute for international and security affairs told deutsche welle .
" president ali abdullah saleh 's government is losing legitimacy - it 's not just failing to provide its own citizens with basic things such as water and jobs but is also losing control over vast swathes of the country . "
president saleh is facing a rebellion in the north , a secessionist movement in the south and growing islamic terrorism .
expert urges caution experts say that in addition to equipping and training yemen 's security forces to combat terrorism , the country needs a long-term development strategy - that means not just aid in areas such as education , health and infrastructure , but an inclusive politics .
" development policy in yemen has no meaning if it is n't embedded in a political strategy , " steinberg said .
eickenberg , whose organization is involved in democratization and reforming yemen 's political institutions , said western nations meeting at a yemen conference in london later this month needed to focus on promoting better governance , fighting corruption and nudging yemen to solve its northern conflict - with the help of its influential neighbor saudi arabia .
but nautre urged caution in drafting any future western strategy on yemen .
" western involvement in yemen can easily backfire because the population is very wary and there 's a strong anti-american sentiment there , " nautre said .
" the most important thing is for the west not to be seen as interfering in yemen from outside so that the people do n't turn against you and run into the arms of extremist groups . "

one of those women is stefanie linsener whose time with the bundeswehr has included a four-month tour in afghanistan . stefanie linsener has never met tanja kreil .
but linsener , a soldier in the bundeswehr , is grateful for kreil 's fight for women like her .
in 2000 kreil won an amendment to germany 's constitution from the court of justice of the european union allowing women to take part in bundeswehr 's armed services .
up until that point they had been limited to working in the medical service or the military band .
without tanja kreil , there never would have been bundeswehr soldier stefanie linsener .
one year after the january 11 , 2000 ruling , the 18-year-old linsener joined the bundeswehr and became one of the first women trained to use weapons .

she and her fellow soldiers worked 13 to 14 hours a day in afghanistan for four months without a day off .
spending every day armed and in a flak vest and only seeing a country from behind the safety glass in her tank taught linsener to appreciate her life in germany .

one of those women is stefanie linsener whose time with the bundeswehr has included a four-month tour in afghanistan . stefanie linsener has never met tanja kreil .
but linsener , a soldier in the bundeswehr , is grateful for kreil 's fight for women like her .
in 2000 kreil won an amendment to germany 's constitution from the court of justice of the european union allowing women to take part in bundeswehr 's armed services .
up until that point they had been limited to working in the medical service or the military band .
without tanja kreil , there never would have been bundeswehr soldier stefanie linsener .
one year after the january 11 , 2000 ruling , the 18-year-old linsener joined the bundeswehr and became one of the first women trained to use weapons .
" my father was really proud of me , " she says .
" my mother had some misgivings , but she is also proud of me , of course , that i did it . " diving into an unknown world bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : linsener shows off the different types of uniforms she wears at first linsener had to get used to the drills and the tone her superiors use when speaking to her .
and she found her uniform practical but rather unfashionable " for a woman who pays attention to herself . "
linsener has a well-kept appearance and she wears jewelry when she 's working in her office .
linsener likes to laugh .
but when she , six other women and 60 male recruits had to crawl through the mud and dig out a position with a 30-kilogram -lrb- 66-pound -rrb- pack on her back and a 12-kilogram machine gun , she was n't laughing .
sometimes she wondered what the point of the exercises was , but through them she learned what her mental and physical limits were .
and she found the motivation to keep going .
" i said to myself , ' shut your eyes and get through it .
you 're doing this now , " ' she recounts .
" i think it 's true that women are a little bit more ambitious and have more willpower .
at least i did . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : men and women are treated the same in the bundeswehr , major fischer says major juergen fischer can only confirm linsener 's observations .
it 's been his experience , he said , that the female soldiers inspire the male recruits .
it 's only a matter of time , he says , before a woman is promoted to major or lieutenant colonel .
" women and men are treated equally , including with their salaries , " fischer says .
however , unlike men , women can not be required to participate in the armed services .
thus there is no conscription for female soldiers while german men are still required to serve in the bundeswehr or complete community service .
deployment a part of the job linsener can assemble her gun while blindfolded .
she knows that it 's a device that can kill but that 's part of being in the army , she says .
another part of being in the army for linsener was a four-month deployment in afghanistan .
she and her fellow soldiers worked 13 to 14 hours a day in afghanistan for four months without a day off .
spending every day armed and in a flak vest and only seeing a country from behind the safety glass in her tank taught linsener to appreciate her life in germany .
female soldiers do find it difficult to gain recognition in a male-dominated country like afghanistan , where women are hardly seen in public , she says .
when she once naively left the camp with her hair loose and uncovered , stones were thrown at her .
" this is like a woman in germany running around naked in the street , " she says she was later told . " helmet , combat boots and camouflage ready to go of those serving in the armed forces , about 17,000 or nine percent are women .
linsener was one those troops for nine years .
now she has another two years of office work responding to press inquiries as fischer 's assistant .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : linsener could be headed back to afghanistan at any moment .
her deployment uniform is in her office locker , ready to go .
an enlisted soldier like linsener gets two years of paid career training before she leaves the army .
studying media design interests her , though a switch to the customs authorities seems like a good move too .
she could be trained to work with the inspection dogs .
though she 's not certain what her next step will be , after what she 's been through , linsener is confident that she 'll be able to rise to the challenge again .

catherine ashton can expect tough questions in her confirmation hearing to become the eu 's first foreign policy tchief .
will her negotiating skills compensate for her lack of foreign policy experience ? catherine ashton , the 53-year-old former european union trade commissioner and leader of britain 's house of lords , was expected to face intensive questioning at the european commission confirmation hearings , which began in brussels on monday .
ashton was nominated for the post of high representative for foreign affairs and security policy by eu heads of state at a summit last november , but must still be confirmed by parliament .
a surprise pick although ashton has long been regarded as an industry expert , her nomination for the newly-created post of eu foreign affairs minister came as a surprise .
the native of lancashire , england , has served only one year as eu trade commissioner and has no other foreign policy experience .
even in her native britain , ashton is virtually unknown , having never been elected to public office .
her past work experience includes posts in a provincial health authority , as well as positions in a number of government departments , including the education and justice ministries .
in 1999 , the labour government of then-prime minister tony blair awarded ashton the title of “ baroness , ” so that she could represent the party in the house of lords . in 2007 , current prime minister gordon brown appointed her leader of the house of lords .
however , ashton 's big break came in 2008 , when the post of eu trade commissioner became free and ashton became the first woman to hold the office .
hard questions during monday 's confirmation hearing , ashton is expected to have to defend herself against accusations of inadequate diplomatic experience .
also likely to come up during questioning : ashton 's past involvement with britain 's anti-nuclear group , the campaign for nuclear disarmament -lrb- cnd -rrb- .
during the initial round of questioning in november , the nominee for foreign affairs chief was challenged to deny taking funds from the soviet union during her days as treasurer for the cnd over 25 years ago .
all or nothing ashton will be among the first of 26 new appointees to go through the confirmation process in the european parliament . the hearings are scheduled to end on january 19 , with the parliament 's final vote of confidence on the new commission to take place january 26 in brussels .
although parliamentarians can not vote to approve or deny individual appointees , they can vote to reject the commission as a whole .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de afghanistan -pipe- 11.01.2010 from bundeswehr doctor to traumatized soldier : one woman 's story großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bundeswehr 's men and women are soldiers first bundeswehr personnel in afghanistan are expected to hold dual roles .
heike groos joined up as a doctor but eventually found out that she was also expected to be a soldier , an experience that had long-lasting effects . when heike groos joined the bundeswehr as a doctor more than 20 years ago , she confesses it was just because she was looking for a job .
back in 1987 , when she started working as an emergency medical officer in a germany army hospital , she was still only a doctor .
that changed when she was sent to afghanistan in 2002 .
she became a doctor - and a soldier .
when groos was sent out to afghanistan , she did so without any question and without any concern .
even when it became obvious that she was now both a doctor and a soldier , armed with a weapon to protect her patients if necessary , she knew that this is what service in afghanistan was like .
it was as much part of the job as helping comrades and afghans alike as part of an emergency military ambulance team .
" at the beginning , in 2002 , it was a completely satisfying job , " she says .
" each moment made me think that we were doing something meaningful there .
just being there symbolized to the people that there was peace and that we would ensure that it remained that way , through our medical and humanitarian work there . "
suicide attack changes everything bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heike groos was first on the scene at the bomb blast but the positive feelings did not endure .
the situation changed dramatically with a suicide attack on a bus carrying german soldiers in june 2003 .
six bundeswehr troops were killed and 29 were injured , some seriously .
heike groos was one of the first on the scene ; she bandaged wounds , called for assistance , coordinated the medical efforts , comforted the injured and watched comrades die .
the event and the huge shock changed her and her colleagues ' lives forever .
" after that first suicide attack in june 2003 , we changed and we became deeply , deeply distrustful because we could not at all differentiate between the people , " she says .
" who is taliban and who is not , who is good and who is bad ? that was never clear to me . "
as well as suspicion and caution , heike groos says she felt rage ; rage against the taliban who had carried out the attack , rage against afghanistan , and rage against germany - the country which had sent her there .
she and her comrades also withdrew from the people they were supposed to be helping .
" we withdrew ourselves and wanted nothing do to with anything afghan , " she admits .
" it was because we saw those that we had come to help as those who had attacked us .
this perspective shifted in time , and we recognized that those who were friendly before still were but we were always more cautious after that .
i was never as trusting again . "
disillusionment leads to decision to leave bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : groos decided that her 2007 tour would be her last after the attack , her unit became closer , even more like a family than before .
her younger male comrades looked for comfort and assurance from the older , more experienced heike groos .
but there was no comfort for her .
groos started to see little sense in what she was doing , confined and isolated in the base due to the increasing dangers outside .
she decided that it could not go on .

heike groos joined up as a doctor but eventually found out that she was also expected to be a soldier , an experience that had long-lasting effects . when heike groos joined the bundeswehr as a doctor more than 20 years ago , she confesses it was just because she was looking for a job .
back in 1987 , when she started working as an emergency medical officer in a germany army hospital , she was still only a doctor .
that changed when she was sent to afghanistan in 2002 .
she became a doctor - and a soldier .
when groos was sent out to afghanistan , she did so without any question and without any concern .
even when it became obvious that she was now both a doctor and a soldier , armed with a weapon to protect her patients if necessary , she knew that this is what service in afghanistan was like .
it was as much part of the job as helping comrades and afghans alike as part of an emergency military ambulance team .
" at the beginning , in 2002 , it was a completely satisfying job , " she says .
" each moment made me think that we were doing something meaningful there .
just being there symbolized to the people that there was peace and that we would ensure that it remained that way , through our medical and humanitarian work there . "
suicide attack changes everything bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heike groos was first on the scene at the bomb blast but the positive feelings did not endure .
the situation changed dramatically with a suicide attack on a bus carrying german soldiers in june 2003 .
six bundeswehr troops were killed and 29 were injured , some seriously .
heike groos was one of the first on the scene ; she bandaged wounds , called for assistance , coordinated the medical efforts , comforted the injured and watched comrades die .
the event and the huge shock changed her and her colleagues ' lives forever .
" after that first suicide attack in june 2003 , we changed and we became deeply , deeply distrustful because we could not at all differentiate between the people , " she says .
" who is taliban and who is not , who is good and who is bad ? that was never clear to me . "
as well as suspicion and caution , heike groos says she felt rage ; rage against the taliban who had carried out the attack , rage against afghanistan , and rage against germany - the country which had sent her there .
she and her comrades also withdrew from the people they were supposed to be helping .
" we withdrew ourselves and wanted nothing do to with anything afghan , " she admits .
" it was because we saw those that we had come to help as those who had attacked us .
this perspective shifted in time , and we recognized that those who were friendly before still were but we were always more cautious after that .
i was never as trusting again . "
disillusionment leads to decision to leave bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : groos decided that her 2007 tour would be her last after the attack , her unit became closer , even more like a family than before .
her younger male comrades looked for comfort and assurance from the older , more experienced heike groos .
but there was no comfort for her .
groos started to see little sense in what she was doing , confined and isolated in the base due to the increasing dangers outside .
she decided that it could not go on .
she returned to afghanistan for the last time in 2007 .
groos says that people could not understand why she went back but she says she wanted to complete her service .

back in 1987 , when she started working as an emergency medical officer in a germany army hospital , she was still only a doctor .
that changed when she was sent to afghanistan in 2002 .
she became a doctor - and a soldier .
when groos was sent out to afghanistan , she did so without any question and without any concern .
even when it became obvious that she was now both a doctor and a soldier , armed with a weapon to protect her patients if necessary , she knew that this is what service in afghanistan was like .
it was as much part of the job as helping comrades and afghans alike as part of an emergency military ambulance team .
" at the beginning , in 2002 , it was a completely satisfying job , " she says .
" each moment made me think that we were doing something meaningful there .
just being there symbolized to the people that there was peace and that we would ensure that it remained that way , through our medical and humanitarian work there . "
suicide attack changes everything bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heike groos was first on the scene at the bomb blast but the positive feelings did not endure .
the situation changed dramatically with a suicide attack on a bus carrying german soldiers in june 2003 .
six bundeswehr troops were killed and 29 were injured , some seriously .
heike groos was one of the first on the scene ; she bandaged wounds , called for assistance , coordinated the medical efforts , comforted the injured and watched comrades die .
the event and the huge shock changed her and her colleagues ' lives forever .
" after that first suicide attack in june 2003 , we changed and we became deeply , deeply distrustful because we could not at all differentiate between the people , " she says .
" who is taliban and who is not , who is good and who is bad ? that was never clear to me . "
as well as suspicion and caution , heike groos says she felt rage ; rage against the taliban who had carried out the attack , rage against afghanistan , and rage against germany - the country which had sent her there .
she and her comrades also withdrew from the people they were supposed to be helping .
" we withdrew ourselves and wanted nothing do to with anything afghan , " she admits .
" it was because we saw those that we had come to help as those who had attacked us .
this perspective shifted in time , and we recognized that those who were friendly before still were but we were always more cautious after that .
i was never as trusting again . "
disillusionment leads to decision to leave bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : groos decided that her 2007 tour would be her last after the attack , her unit became closer , even more like a family than before .
her younger male comrades looked for comfort and assurance from the older , more experienced heike groos .
but there was no comfort for her .
groos started to see little sense in what she was doing , confined and isolated in the base due to the increasing dangers outside .
she decided that it could not go on .
she returned to afghanistan for the last time in 2007 .
groos says that people could not understand why she went back but she says she wanted to complete her service .
" people looked at me like i was an alien when i walked out of our house in my uniform , " she says .
" i was never at home and people asked my children , ' where is your mother ? ' and they would say ' she is in afghanistan ' . "
when she returned , people would stay out of her way .
her second husband also did n't understand and eventually he and groos divorced .
it was then that she decided that she wanted to leave everything behind and take her children to the other side of the world to start again .
she and three of her five kids moved to new zealand , as far away from afghanistan and germany as possible in order to find peace .
distance does n't end afghanistan trauma bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the horrors of aghanistan have never left heike groos but afghanistan did not release her from its grip .
groos continued to suffer from her experiences , suffering from nightmares and the inability to sleep .
she was also cut off from any kind of support from her previous employer : the bundeswehr .
" i had fulfilled my obligation -lrb- to the bundeswehr -rrb- and i found that very hard , " she says .
" i wish that someone had supported me and had not left me alone , but that did not happen , and i am sad about it .
they pushed me away , sent me to the army physician , to the psychiatrist who said ' you are traumatized . '
and then german people said : ' you were probably not hard enough , soldiers must always be tough . " '
while things were difficult for a long while , in time they also started to get better for heike groos and she began dealing with her experiences in afghanistan and working through her experiences .
the result was her first book , published last year , based on her time there : ' a beautiful day to die ' .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundeswehr -pipe- 11.01.2010 females in the ranks : ten years of armed women in the bundeswehr großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stefanie linsener is just one of 17,000 women serving in the bundeswehr ten years ago the eu 's top court cleared the way for female bundeswehr soldiers to be armed .
one of those women is stefanie linsener whose time with the bundeswehr has included a four-month tour in afghanistan . stefanie linsener has never met tanja kreil .
but linsener , a soldier in the bundeswehr , is grateful for kreil 's fight for women like her .
in 2000 kreil won an amendment to germany 's constitution from the court of justice of the european union allowing women to take part in bundeswehr 's armed services .
up until that point they had been limited to working in the medical service or the military band .
without tanja kreil , there never would have been bundeswehr soldier stefanie linsener .
one year after the january 11 , 2000 ruling , the 18-year-old linsener joined the bundeswehr and became one of the first women trained to use weapons .
" my father was really proud of me , " she says .
" my mother had some misgivings , but she is also proud of me , of course , that i did it . " diving into an unknown world bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : linsener shows off the different types of uniforms she wears at first linsener had to get used to the drills and the tone her superiors use when speaking to her .
and she found her uniform practical but rather unfashionable " for a woman who pays attention to herself . "
linsener has a well-kept appearance and she wears jewelry when she 's working in her office .
linsener likes to laugh .
but when she , six other women and 60 male recruits had to crawl through the mud and dig out a position with a 30-kilogram -lrb- 66-pound -rrb- pack on her back and a 12-kilogram machine gun , she was n't laughing .
sometimes she wondered what the point of the exercises was , but through them she learned what her mental and physical limits were .
and she found the motivation to keep going .
" i said to myself , ' shut your eyes and get through it .
you 're doing this now , " ' she recounts .
" i think it 's true that women are a little bit more ambitious and have more willpower .
at least i did . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : men and women are treated the same in the bundeswehr , major fischer says major juergen fischer can only confirm linsener 's observations .
it 's been his experience , he said , that the female soldiers inspire the male recruits .
it 's only a matter of time , he says , before a woman is promoted to major or lieutenant colonel .
" women and men are treated equally , including with their salaries , " fischer says .
however , unlike men , women can not be required to participate in the armed services .
thus there is no conscription for female soldiers while german men are still required to serve in the bundeswehr or complete community service .
deployment a part of the job linsener can assemble her gun while blindfolded .
she knows that it 's a device that can kill but that 's part of being in the army , she says .
another part of being in the army for linsener was a four-month deployment in afghanistan .
she and her fellow soldiers worked 13 to 14 hours a day in afghanistan for four months without a day off .
spending every day armed and in a flak vest and only seeing a country from behind the safety glass in her tank taught linsener to appreciate her life in germany .
female soldiers do find it difficult to gain recognition in a male-dominated country like afghanistan , where women are hardly seen in public , she says .
when she once naively left the camp with her hair loose and uncovered , stones were thrown at her .
" this is like a woman in germany running around naked in the street , " she says she was later told . " helmet , combat boots and camouflage ready to go of those serving in the armed forces , about 17,000 or nine percent are women .
linsener was one those troops for nine years .
now she has another two years of office work responding to press inquiries as fischer 's assistant .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : linsener could be headed back to afghanistan at any moment .
her deployment uniform is in her office locker , ready to go .
an enlisted soldier like linsener gets two years of paid career training before she leaves the army .
studying media design interests her , though a switch to the customs authorities seems like a good move too .
she could be trained to work with the inspection dogs .
though she 's not certain what her next step will be , after what she 's been through , linsener is confident that she 'll be able to rise to the challenge again .

and debates about safety are sure to continue . like all europe 's major football leagues , the german bundesliga has a number of players competing in the africa cup of nations in angola .
the first priority for clubs when the news of the attack broke was to contact their players and offer to fly them out of africa .
hanover , for example , were concerned about their tunisian defender karim haggui .
" karim told our sports directorship that he feels safe right now , " hanover spokesman andreas kundt told the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung newspaper .
three members of the togolese delegation were killed on friday when separatist rebels in an angolan enclave opened fire on the team bus .
a reserve goalkeeper had to be flown to south africa for emergency treatment for life-threatening gunshot wounds .
the togolese team subsequently quit the tournament and flew home .
bildunterschrift : the togolese team was flown home over the weekend " i was afraid for my life , " togolese defender assimiou toure , who plays for bayer leverkusen , told reporters .
" all i could do was jump under my seat and pray . "
thus far , no african player has asked his german club to get him out of angola .
but the shooting has occasioned furious debate about both the africa cup and safety in general on the continent ahead of the world 's premier soccer event .
relative safety ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany keeper rene adler has said he 's worried about the world cup in south africa international football functionaries , from fifa president sepp blatter on down , have been quick to offer assurances that the shooting in angola did not mean that this summer 's world cup in south africa would be unsafe .
" the measures taken for the africa cup are not comparable with those for a football world cup , which are planned years in advance , " german world cup advisor horst r. schmidt told the frankfurter rundschau newspaper .
indeed , south africa and angola are very different countries .
still , some likely members of the german national team at the world cup said they were worried .
" it 's completely sick , " germany 's top goalkeeper rene adler told the bild am sonntag newspaper .
" i have to ask how they 're going to ensure security at the world cup .
i 'm sure we 'll be safe as a team , but what about family members ? "
other team members had comparable reactions .
' when you hear something like that , you do a double take and start thinking , " germany midfielder bastian schweinsteiger told the sid sports news agency .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : otto pfister coached in africa for four decades german coach otto pfister , who spent most of his career working in africa and who coached the togolese team at the 2006 world cup , offered a more first-hand view .
he said that the world cup would not be especially risky but that different standards applied to africa .
" the security measures are , of course , not comparable with those in germany , " pfister said in an interview with sid .
" in this area , just as in the economy , we 're talking about developing countries .
and the distances are enormous .
how can they be expected to keep all of such vast distances completely under control ? "
hard choices bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stuttgart 's arthur boka -lrb- right -rrb- is one of the bundesliga players competing in angola the attack has focused attention on a number of issues , both for football and society in general .
for instance , pfister is among those who have criticized the togolese decision to withdraw from the tournament , which was ordered by togo 's prime minister .
he has said togo 's pull-out will only encourage extremist groups in angola , and he fears that wrong precedents could be set .
" the africa cup is a spectacular event for africans , one that 's almost more important than the world cup , " pfister told sid .
" you ca n't cancel events like these .
you quickly put yourself in a position where you can be blackmailed . "
in the purely sporting realm , though , the attack has caused football managers outside africa to question the africa cup .
clubs throughout europe were never happy about being forced to allow their employees to take part in the biennial event , and friday 's incident has fuelled arguments that the rules need to be changed .
borussia dortmund sports director michael zorc says teams should have the right to make decisions based on players ' safety .
" until that becomes the case , we ca n't bring our players back because they would then be suspended , " zorc told the frankfurter allegeimeine zeitung .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the shooting has been a huge blow for african football stuttgart commercial manager horst heldt , whose defender arthur boka plays for ivory coast , feels much the same way .
" the ideal thing for me would be if arthur could just come back , " heldt told the same paper .
ultimately , the attack on togo 's national team is going to force everyone concerned to take a realistic look at where africa and international football fit together .
fifa 's decision to award south africa the world cup was a bold and inclusive gesture , intended to signal that the world 's poorest continent was a full-fledged member in the global soccer community .
experts like pfister know that there are risks attached to that decision , but argue that those risks should not be allowed to overshadow all other aspects of the world 's biggest sporting event .
that will surely be one of the main topics of discussion for the duration of the africa cup and in the run-up to the world cup in south africa .

and debates about safety are sure to continue . like all europe 's major football leagues , the german bundesliga has a number of players competing in the africa cup of nations in angola .
the first priority for clubs when the news of the attack broke was to contact their players and offer to fly them out of africa .
hanover , for example , were concerned about their tunisian defender karim haggui .
" karim told our sports directorship that he feels safe right now , " hanover spokesman andreas kundt told the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung newspaper .
three members of the togolese delegation were killed on friday when separatist rebels in an angolan enclave opened fire on the team bus .
a reserve goalkeeper had to be flown to south africa for emergency treatment for life-threatening gunshot wounds .
the togolese team subsequently quit the tournament and flew home .
bildunterschrift : the togolese team was flown home over the weekend " i was afraid for my life , " togolese defender assimiou toure , who plays for bayer leverkusen , told reporters .
" all i could do was jump under my seat and pray . "
thus far , no african player has asked his german club to get him out of angola .
but the shooting has occasioned furious debate about both the africa cup and safety in general on the continent ahead of the world 's premier soccer event .
relative safety ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany keeper rene adler has said he 's worried about the world cup in south africa international football functionaries , from fifa president sepp blatter on down , have been quick to offer assurances that the shooting in angola did not mean that this summer 's world cup in south africa would be unsafe .
" the measures taken for the africa cup are not comparable with those for a football world cup , which are planned years in advance , " german world cup advisor horst r. schmidt told the frankfurter rundschau newspaper .
indeed , south africa and angola are very different countries .
still , some likely members of the german national team at the world cup said they were worried .
" it 's completely sick , " germany 's top goalkeeper rene adler told the bild am sonntag newspaper .
" i have to ask how they 're going to ensure security at the world cup .
i 'm sure we 'll be safe as a team , but what about family members ? "
other team members had comparable reactions .
' when you hear something like that , you do a double take and start thinking , " germany midfielder bastian schweinsteiger told the sid sports news agency .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : otto pfister coached in africa for four decades german coach otto pfister , who spent most of his career working in africa and who coached the togolese team at the 2006 world cup , offered a more first-hand view .
he said that the world cup would not be especially risky but that different standards applied to africa .
" the security measures are , of course , not comparable with those in germany , " pfister said in an interview with sid .
" in this area , just as in the economy , we 're talking about developing countries .
and the distances are enormous .
how can they be expected to keep all of such vast distances completely under control ? "
hard choices bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stuttgart 's arthur boka -lrb- right -rrb- is one of the bundesliga players competing in angola the attack has focused attention on a number of issues , both for football and society in general .
for instance , pfister is among those who have criticized the togolese decision to withdraw from the tournament , which was ordered by togo 's prime minister .
he has said togo 's pull-out will only encourage extremist groups in angola , and he fears that wrong precedents could be set .
" the africa cup is a spectacular event for africans , one that 's almost more important than the world cup , " pfister told sid .
" you ca n't cancel events like these .
you quickly put yourself in a position where you can be blackmailed . "
in the purely sporting realm , though , the attack has caused football managers outside africa to question the africa cup .
clubs throughout europe were never happy about being forced to allow their employees to take part in the biennial event , and friday 's incident has fuelled arguments that the rules need to be changed .
borussia dortmund sports director michael zorc says teams should have the right to make decisions based on players ' safety .
" until that becomes the case , we ca n't bring our players back because they would then be suspended , " zorc told the frankfurter allegeimeine zeitung .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the shooting has been a huge blow for african football stuttgart commercial manager horst heldt , whose defender arthur boka plays for ivory coast , feels much the same way .
" the ideal thing for me would be if arthur could just come back , " heldt told the same paper .
ultimately , the attack on togo 's national team is going to force everyone concerned to take a realistic look at where africa and international football fit together .
fifa 's decision to award south africa the world cup was a bold and inclusive gesture , intended to signal that the world 's poorest continent was a full-fledged member in the global soccer community .
experts like pfister know that there are risks attached to that decision , but argue that those risks should not be allowed to overshadow all other aspects of the world 's biggest sporting event .
that will surely be one of the main topics of discussion for the duration of the africa cup and in the run-up to the world cup in south africa .

i 'm sure we 'll be safe as a team , but what about family members ? "
other team members had comparable reactions .
' when you hear something like that , you do a double take and start thinking , " germany midfielder bastian schweinsteiger told the sid sports news agency .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : otto pfister coached in africa for four decades german coach otto pfister , who spent most of his career working in africa and who coached the togolese team at the 2006 world cup , offered a more first-hand view .
he said that the world cup would not be especially risky but that different standards applied to africa .
" the security measures are , of course , not comparable with those in germany , " pfister said in an interview with sid .
" in this area , just as in the economy , we 're talking about developing countries .
and the distances are enormous .
how can they be expected to keep all of such vast distances completely under control ? "
hard choices bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stuttgart 's arthur boka -lrb- right -rrb- is one of the bundesliga players competing in angola the attack has focused attention on a number of issues , both for football and society in general .
for instance , pfister is among those who have criticized the togolese decision to withdraw from the tournament , which was ordered by togo 's prime minister .
he has said togo 's pull-out will only encourage extremist groups in angola , and he fears that wrong precedents could be set .
" the africa cup is a spectacular event for africans , one that 's almost more important than the world cup , " pfister told sid .
" you ca n't cancel events like these .
you quickly put yourself in a position where you can be blackmailed . "
in the purely sporting realm , though , the attack has caused football managers outside africa to question the africa cup .
clubs throughout europe were never happy about being forced to allow their employees to take part in the biennial event , and friday 's incident has fuelled arguments that the rules need to be changed .
borussia dortmund sports director michael zorc says teams should have the right to make decisions based on players ' safety .
" until that becomes the case , we ca n't bring our players back because they would then be suspended , " zorc told the frankfurter allegeimeine zeitung .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the shooting has been a huge blow for african football stuttgart commercial manager horst heldt , whose defender arthur boka plays for ivory coast , feels much the same way .
" the ideal thing for me would be if arthur could just come back , " heldt told the same paper .
ultimately , the attack on togo 's national team is going to force everyone concerned to take a realistic look at where africa and international football fit together .
fifa 's decision to award south africa the world cup was a bold and inclusive gesture , intended to signal that the world 's poorest continent was a full-fledged member in the global soccer community .
experts like pfister know that there are risks attached to that decision , but argue that those risks should not be allowed to overshadow all other aspects of the world 's biggest sporting event .
that will surely be one of the main topics of discussion for the duration of the africa cup and in the run-up to the world cup in south africa .

and debates about safety are sure to continue . like all europe 's major football leagues , the german bundesliga has a number of players competing in the africa cup of nations in angola .
the first priority for clubs when the news of the attack broke was to contact their players and offer to fly them out of africa .
hanover , for example , were concerned about their tunisian defender karim haggui .
" karim told our sports directorship that he feels safe right now , " hanover spokesman andreas kundt told the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung newspaper .
three members of the togolese delegation were killed on friday when separatist rebels in an angolan enclave opened fire on the team bus .
a reserve goalkeeper had to be flown to south africa for emergency treatment for life-threatening gunshot wounds .
the togolese team subsequently quit the tournament and flew home .
bildunterschrift : the togolese team was flown home over the weekend " i was afraid for my life , " togolese defender assimiou toure , who plays for bayer leverkusen , told reporters .
" all i could do was jump under my seat and pray . "
thus far , no african player has asked his german club to get him out of angola .
but the shooting has occasioned furious debate about both the africa cup and safety in general on the continent ahead of the world 's premier soccer event .
relative safety ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany keeper rene adler has said he 's worried about the world cup in south africa international football functionaries , from fifa president sepp blatter on down , have been quick to offer assurances that the shooting in angola did not mean that this summer 's world cup in south africa would be unsafe .
" the measures taken for the africa cup are not comparable with those for a football world cup , which are planned years in advance , " german world cup advisor horst r. schmidt told the frankfurter rundschau newspaper .
indeed , south africa and angola are very different countries .
still , some likely members of the german national team at the world cup said they were worried .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de auto industry -pipe- 11.01.2010 vw announces big expansion plans for us market großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : volkswagen wants to reposition itself in the united states despite years of weak performance in the us market , volkswagen announced it aims to double the number of cars it sells in the us by 2012 or 2013 .
vw wants its cars to escape their niche status and hit the mass market . just prior to the opening of the annual detroit auto show on monday , german carmaker volkswagen announced it plans for ramping up its presence in the united states , aiming to win over american consumers and sell twice the number of cars it does now in three to four years ' time .
" we will sell 400,000 to 450,000 vehicles in 2012/13 , " said stefan jacoby , head of volkswagen of america , on sunday , adding that the company 's us business could become profitable by 2013 . volkswagen , europe 's largest carmaker , has had a hard time finding its footing in the all-important us market .
its presence in china and brazil is strong and sales in germany have been helped by a government program last year that encouraged drivers to trade in old gas guzzlers for more for efficient cars .
in europe , vw has 21 percent of the market .
but vw market share in the us , including its audi brand , is only three percent .
part of the reason for that , according to analysts , has to do with the generally dismal state of the car industry in the wake of global recession .
although , vw 's small market share actually gave it a bit of a foot up since it was not as hard hit by the collapse of american auto sales as some of its rivals were .
american preferences bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vw has been trying to figure out how to fit the pieces together for the us market vw 's lackluster performance can also be traced back to its product line , which was not ideally suited to americans ' taste in cars .
" volkswagen was neither a premium brand like mercedes , nor a mass-market brand , " said marc tonn , a senior analyst at m.m. warburg .
" the company was kind of stuck in the middle . "
the wolfsburg-based concern focused on smaller or mid-size cars with highly advanced technological features when americans were more interested in buying larger vehicles , such as suvs or pick-up trucks .
" i think the focus will now be on maintaining german quality , but going a little in the direction of us size , " tonn added .
nevertheless , vw will not likely be turning out tank-like vehicles any time soon .
jacoby said he expects the market for compact and mid-sized sedans to increase faster than other segments , especially if oil prices convince more americans to downsize from their chevy tahoes and ford explorers .
" with higher oil prices , the us consumer is perhaps going to look a little more closely at smaller cars , " said christian breitsprecher , an auto analyst at sol oppenheim . from the niche to the masses volkswagen , which ranks behind brands like hyundai , honda , mercedes and bmw in the us , wants to emerge from its position as a niche carmaker to a mass-market product , one that can compete with extremely popular makes , such as toyota 's camry .
while the beetle quickly became a cult classic in the us and enjoyed great popularity in the 1960s and early 1970s , vw was never able to imitate its success with subsequent makes , such as its rabbit .
the company closed its last us plant in 1988 in pennsylvania amid sluggish sales .
" the rabbit was a flop and vw never really was able to get back in the mass market after that , " said breitsprecher , who added that volkswagen cars remained niche products .
" i mean , who bought a jetta ?
mostly college kids who could n't afford bmws . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : volkswagen beetle - a hit in america but vw wants a follow-up success becoming a mass-market car in the us is essential to vw 's ambitious expansion plans for the coming years , which include surpassing main rival toyota , the world 's largest automaker by sales volume .
new investments volkswagen is building a new plant in chattanooga , tennessee , investing up to $ 1 billion -lrb- 694 million euros -rrb- in a facility that , according to us head jacoby , " will enable the turnaround of vw 's us operations " and should create around 2,000 jobs .
increasing production and purchasing in the dollar zone is crucial to vw 's return to profitability as it would lower the company 's exposure to a dollar that is weak compared to the euro .
the carmaker is also spending $ 125 million on two new dealerships in new york city , which will begin sales in 2010 .
they are part of the company 's strategy to increase its presence and visibility in the us .
jacoby said he thinks the worst of the automobile sector 's woes to be behind them , with american car sales likely to be 11 million to 11.5 million in 2010 .
because of a stabilization of the labor and real-estate markets , " we are a little bit more optimistic now than we were a few months ago , " he said on sunday .

defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg has invited her to visit the troops . bishop margot kaessmann and karl-theodor zu guttenberg agreed during their half-hour meeting on monday that there should be a broader public debate on the german bundeswehr 's mission in afghanistan , as well as a strengthened civil commitment .
the minister and the protestant church leader said they would continue their " critical dialogue " about the afghan deployment , possibly in the framework of the bundeswehr 's military academy or at protestant church academies . while the issue would n't be solved anytime soon , kaessmann said it was important that the church 's voice was heard in the debate .
kaessmann is the lutheran bishop of hanover and the first woman to head the ekd - an umbrella group for 22 churches that encompass germany 's 25 million protestants .
" nothing is right in afghanistan " the high-level meeting comes as a response to critical remarks by the bishop in december , when kaessmann said in an interview that the war in afghanistan could not be justified .
at two new year 's church services , she told congregations in berlin and dresden she did not approve of the western strategy in afghanistan , where 4,500 german military personnel are deployed with the international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- .
her comments were described as " naive , " " not helpful , " " unrealistic " - soldiers posted in afghanistan were as angered by the bishop 's views as many german politicians .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de development aid -pipe- 11.01.2010 yemen needs a broad development strategy , experts say großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yemen faces collapse as it runs out of both oil and water the surprise visit by the german foreign minister to yemen shows how worried the world is about the country as a haven for militants .
but experts say counterterrorism wo n't work without addressing yemen 's other woes . concerns are mounting about terrorism in yemen since the botched attempted bombing of a us airliner on christmas day .
us president barack obama has said al-qaeda 's offshoot in yemen was behind the failed attacks .
the issue was on the agenda when the german foreign minister , guido westerwelle , made a surprise visit to yemen on monday at the end of his middle east tour .
as washington ramps up its counterterrorism role in yemen and raises pressure on the government in sanaa to crack down on islamic extremists , some say that a single-minded focus on military force is deeply flawed .
" the united states and other western powers need to provide long-term economic development to reduce poverty and raise educational standards , " yemen 's foreign minister abu bakr al-qirbi said in an interview with the washington post last week .
that , he said , would help combat terrorism " in a more effective fashion than just using military force . "
that view is echoed by international aid agencies working on the ground in yemen , the arab world 's most impoverished nation .
bildunterschrift : experts warn against focusing solely on military means to fight terrorism " poverty is n't the only explanation for terrorism .
but it 's true that yemen 's extensive social and economic pressures contribute to making the country unstable - and thus make it easier for terrorist organizations to exploit people 's grievances and recruit them , " felix eikenberg , head of germany 's friedrich ebert political foundation in the capital sanaa , told deutsche welle .
germany , whose aid involvement in yemen dates back 40 years , is one of europe 's biggest donors to yemen .
massive social and economic pressures home to around 24 million people , yemen is grappling with one of the world 's highest population growth rates , rapidly depleting groundwater levels , and an unemployment rate of more than 20 percent .
the country 's economy is in tatters as it runs out of its meager oil reserves . " some 70 percent of the state 's revenues currently come from oil .
but oil reserves are dwindling so rapidly that we estimate yemen could become an oil importer in ten years , " eikenberg said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yemen faces a lethal cocktail of social and demographic problems total oil production has slumped from about 440,000 barrels per day in 2001 to 300,000 last year , according to the us energy information administration .
all that has contributed to widespread poverty in the country .
children suffer from a 50 percent malnutrition rate ; more than 40 percent of yemenis live below the poverty line , 18 percent on less than a dollar a day .
germany a major donor given the magnitude of its problems , yemen receives comparatively little per-capita international aid .
the world bank and the imf play an important role in financing yemen 's fragile economy .
the handful of bilateral donors to yemen include the netherlands , the us , japan and britain , germany remains one of the largest european players with annual aid amounting to about 37 million euros .
aid for 2009 and 2010 has been budgeted at 79 million euros .
much of it is focused on easing yemen 's severe water shortage , boosting primary education in the country - yemen had a literacy rate of 40 percent in 2007 - and helping diversify its oil-dominated economy .
zoe nautre , an expert at the berlin-based german council on foreign relations who spent a year in yemen reviewing german government aid efforts , said germany enjoyed excellent relations with the yemeni government .
" germany is often apolitical because it provides a lot of good technical assistance in yemen , particularly in the water sector , and does n't appear to be meddling in yemen 's affairs .
so , germany is well trusted in sanaa , " she told deutsche welle .
failure of governance but others point out that aid money is most needed to help tackle the failure of yemen 's corrupt government to maintain control over remote regions in the strife-torn country - which in turn is exacerbating yemen 's security woes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yemen remains a loosely-governed country under president saleh " one of the major reasons al qaeda is so strong in yemen is because the government is so weak , " guido steinberg , an expert on international terrorism and political developments in the gulf region at the berlin-based german institute for international and security affairs told deutsche welle .
" president ali abdullah saleh 's government is losing legitimacy - it 's not just failing to provide its own citizens with basic things such as water and jobs but is also losing control over vast swathes of the country . "
president saleh is facing a rebellion in the north , a secessionist movement in the south and growing islamic terrorism .
expert urges caution experts say that in addition to equipping and training yemen 's security forces to combat terrorism , the country needs a long-term development strategy - that means not just aid in areas such as education , health and infrastructure , but an inclusive politics .
" development policy in yemen has no meaning if it is n't embedded in a political strategy , " steinberg said .
eickenberg , whose organization is involved in democratization and reforming yemen 's political institutions , said western nations meeting at a yemen conference in london later this month needed to focus on promoting better governance , fighting corruption and nudging yemen to solve its northern conflict - with the help of its influential neighbor saudi arabia .
but nautre urged caution in drafting any future western strategy on yemen .
" western involvement in yemen can easily backfire because the population is very wary and there 's a strong anti-american sentiment there , " nautre said .
" the most important thing is for the west not to be seen as interfering in yemen from outside so that the people do n't turn against you and run into the arms of extremist groups . "

but experts say counterterrorism wo n't work without addressing yemen 's other woes . concerns are mounting about terrorism in yemen since the botched attempted bombing of a us airliner on christmas day .
us president barack obama has said al-qaeda 's offshoot in yemen was behind the failed attacks .
the issue was on the agenda when the german foreign minister , guido westerwelle , made a surprise visit to yemen on monday at the end of his middle east tour .
as washington ramps up its counterterrorism role in yemen and raises pressure on the government in sanaa to crack down on islamic extremists , some say that a single-minded focus on military force is deeply flawed .
" the united states and other western powers need to provide long-term economic development to reduce poverty and raise educational standards , " yemen 's foreign minister abu bakr al-qirbi said in an interview with the washington post last week .
that , he said , would help combat terrorism " in a more effective fashion than just using military force . "
that view is echoed by international aid agencies working on the ground in yemen , the arab world 's most impoverished nation .
bildunterschrift : experts warn against focusing solely on military means to fight terrorism " poverty is n't the only explanation for terrorism .
but it 's true that yemen 's extensive social and economic pressures contribute to making the country unstable - and thus make it easier for terrorist organizations to exploit people 's grievances and recruit them , " felix eikenberg , head of germany 's friedrich ebert political foundation in the capital sanaa , told deutsche welle .
germany , whose aid involvement in yemen dates back 40 years , is one of europe 's biggest donors to yemen .
massive social and economic pressures home to around 24 million people , yemen is grappling with one of the world 's highest population growth rates , rapidly depleting groundwater levels , and an unemployment rate of more than 20 percent .
the country 's economy is in tatters as it runs out of its meager oil reserves . " some 70 percent of the state 's revenues currently come from oil .
but oil reserves are dwindling so rapidly that we estimate yemen could become an oil importer in ten years , " eikenberg said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yemen faces a lethal cocktail of social and demographic problems total oil production has slumped from about 440,000 barrels per day in 2001 to 300,000 last year , according to the us energy information administration .
all that has contributed to widespread poverty in the country .
children suffer from a 50 percent malnutrition rate ; more than 40 percent of yemenis live below the poverty line , 18 percent on less than a dollar a day .

vw wants its cars to escape their niche status and hit the mass market . just prior to the opening of the annual detroit auto show on monday , german carmaker volkswagen announced it plans for ramping up its presence in the united states , aiming to win over american consumers and sell twice the number of cars it does now in three to four years ' time .
" we will sell 400,000 to 450,000 vehicles in 2012/13 , " said stefan jacoby , head of volkswagen of america , on sunday , adding that the company 's us business could become profitable by 2013 . volkswagen , europe 's largest carmaker , has had a hard time finding its footing in the all-important us market .
its presence in china and brazil is strong and sales in germany have been helped by a government program last year that encouraged drivers to trade in old gas guzzlers for more for efficient cars .
in europe , vw has 21 percent of the market .
but vw market share in the us , including its audi brand , is only three percent .
part of the reason for that , according to analysts , has to do with the generally dismal state of the car industry in the wake of global recession .
although , vw 's small market share actually gave it a bit of a foot up since it was not as hard hit by the collapse of american auto sales as some of its rivals were .
american preferences bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vw has been trying to figure out how to fit the pieces together for the us market vw 's lackluster performance can also be traced back to its product line , which was not ideally suited to americans ' taste in cars .
" volkswagen was neither a premium brand like mercedes , nor a mass-market brand , " said marc tonn , a senior analyst at m.m. warburg .
" the company was kind of stuck in the middle . "
the wolfsburg-based concern focused on smaller or mid-size cars with highly advanced technological features when americans were more interested in buying larger vehicles , such as suvs or pick-up trucks .
" i think the focus will now be on maintaining german quality , but going a little in the direction of us size , " tonn added .
nevertheless , vw will not likely be turning out tank-like vehicles any time soon .
jacoby said he expects the market for compact and mid-sized sedans to increase faster than other segments , especially if oil prices convince more americans to downsize from their chevy tahoes and ford explorers .
" with higher oil prices , the us consumer is perhaps going to look a little more closely at smaller cars , " said christian breitsprecher , an auto analyst at sol oppenheim . from the niche to the masses volkswagen , which ranks behind brands like hyundai , honda , mercedes and bmw in the us , wants to emerge from its position as a niche carmaker to a mass-market product , one that can compete with extremely popular makes , such as toyota 's camry .
while the beetle quickly became a cult classic in the us and enjoyed great popularity in the 1960s and early 1970s , vw was never able to imitate its success with subsequent makes , such as its rabbit .
the company closed its last us plant in 1988 in pennsylvania amid sluggish sales .
" the rabbit was a flop and vw never really was able to get back in the mass market after that , " said breitsprecher , who added that volkswagen cars remained niche products .
" i mean , who bought a jetta ?
mostly college kids who could n't afford bmws . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : volkswagen beetle - a hit in america but vw wants a follow-up success becoming a mass-market car in the us is essential to vw 's ambitious expansion plans for the coming years , which include surpassing main rival toyota , the world 's largest automaker by sales volume .
new investments volkswagen is building a new plant in chattanooga , tennessee , investing up to $ 1 billion -lrb- 694 million euros -rrb- in a facility that , according to us head jacoby , " will enable the turnaround of vw 's us operations " and should create around 2,000 jobs .
increasing production and purchasing in the dollar zone is crucial to vw 's return to profitability as it would lower the company 's exposure to a dollar that is weak compared to the euro .
the carmaker is also spending $ 125 million on two new dealerships in new york city , which will begin sales in 2010 .
they are part of the company 's strategy to increase its presence and visibility in the us .
jacoby said he thinks the worst of the automobile sector 's woes to be behind them , with american car sales likely to be 11 million to 11.5 million in 2010 .
because of a stabilization of the labor and real-estate markets , " we are a little bit more optimistic now than we were a few months ago , " he said on sunday .
he added that he expects the us car sales to stabilize at around 15 million over the medium term , and vw 's longer-term us plans include selling 800,000 vehicles a year by 2018 .
" the us is a critical component of vw 's long-term strategy , " said analyst tonn .
" despite all the euphoria about emerging markets these days , if you want to be a global player you have to do well in america . "

but is it really against the law ? the schlecker drugstore mega-chain has come under heavy criticism for alleged wage dumping . the trade union verdi has accused schlecker of forcing its employees to take new contracts through a temporary employment agency called meniar , which pays only half of the usual hourly wage , about 6.70 euros -lrb- $ 9.73 -rrb- instead of 12.50 euros -lrb- $ 18.17 -rrb- . it also said it believed meniar was entirely controled by schlecker . politicians protest the labor minister in the german state of north rhine-westphalia , karl josef laumann , has also accused schlecker of systematic wage evasion . the süddeutsche zeitung newspaper reported that laumann wrote a letter to schlecker employees stating that temporary work is designed to compensate for operating peaks or in the case of vacation or illness , not to replace permanent staff . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schlecker has about 50,000 employees throughout europe federal labor minister ursula von der leyen appeared on a sunday evening talk show and said that the case would have to be examined closely to see if there abuse is abuse . she added that the federal employment agency -lrb- ba -rrb- is responsible for ensuring that every temporary employment agency has a license that must be renewed regularly . " there is a proper procedure , " she said .
" we are not in the wild west . " is it illegal ? however , a ba spokeswoman denied that schlecker ’ s actions were illegal . " the temporary employment act does not preclude sacking workers and replacing them with ones from a temporary employment agency under worse conditions , " said a ba spokeswoman on monday . she added the government would have to change the laws in order to prohibit similar actions . still , the association of temporary work agencies -lrb- bza -rrb- has been quick to distance itself from the business policies of schlecker . " such business practices are not consistent with the original meaning of temporary work and hurt the reputation of all temporary employment agencies , " bza spokesman wolfram linke told deutsche welle . linke added that companies who are members of the bza have to agree to pay employees an hourly wage of at least 7.51 euros -lrb- $ 10.51 -rrb- , despite the fact that germany does not have a minimum wage . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : labor minister ursula von der leyen said the situation must be carefully examined schlecker responds schlecker has denied the allegations of wage dumping and insists that its new stores pay up to 13 euros -lrb- $ 18.89 -rrb- an hour or more .
however , head of corporate communications florian baum said monday that schlecker had resolved " effective immediately " not to pursue any further contracts with the temporary employment company meniar . achim neumann of verdi was excited to hear the news . " i think this is fantastic - obviously a tremendous amount of pressure was necessary to convince schlecker of that misusing the temporary working laws is unacceptable .
it ’ s a very positive sign , " he told deutsche welle . schlecker has often come under criticism from the unions regarding its employment practices .
it has accused verdi of using " targeted disinformation and defamation campaigns " in the past . with more than 50,000 employees and stores in 12 countries , schlecker is the largest drugstore company in europe .

but is it really against the law ? the schlecker drugstore mega-chain has come under heavy criticism for alleged wage dumping . the trade union verdi has accused schlecker of forcing its employees to take new contracts through a temporary employment agency called meniar , which pays only half of the usual hourly wage , about 6.70 euros -lrb- $ 9.73 -rrb- instead of 12.50 euros -lrb- $ 18.17 -rrb- . it also said it believed meniar was entirely controled by schlecker . politicians protest the labor minister in the german state of north rhine-westphalia , karl josef laumann , has also accused schlecker of systematic wage evasion . the süddeutsche zeitung newspaper reported that laumann wrote a letter to schlecker employees stating that temporary work is designed to compensate for operating peaks or in the case of vacation or illness , not to replace permanent staff . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schlecker has about 50,000 employees throughout europe federal labor minister ursula von der leyen appeared on a sunday evening talk show and said that the case would have to be examined closely to see if there abuse is abuse . she added that the federal employment agency -lrb- ba -rrb- is responsible for ensuring that every temporary employment agency has a license that must be renewed regularly . " there is a proper procedure , " she said .
" we are not in the wild west . " is it illegal ? however , a ba spokeswoman denied that schlecker ’ s actions were illegal . " the temporary employment act does not preclude sacking workers and replacing them with ones from a temporary employment agency under worse conditions , " said a ba spokeswoman on monday . she added the government would have to change the laws in order to prohibit similar actions . still , the association of temporary work agencies -lrb- bza -rrb- has been quick to distance itself from the business policies of schlecker . " such business practices are not consistent with the original meaning of temporary work and hurt the reputation of all temporary employment agencies , " bza spokesman wolfram linke told deutsche welle . linke added that companies who are members of the bza have to agree to pay employees an hourly wage of at least 7.51 euros -lrb- $ 10.51 -rrb- , despite the fact that germany does not have a minimum wage . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : labor minister ursula von der leyen said the situation must be carefully examined schlecker responds schlecker has denied the allegations of wage dumping and insists that its new stores pay up to 13 euros -lrb- $ 18.89 -rrb- an hour or more .
however , head of corporate communications florian baum said monday that schlecker had resolved " effective immediately " not to pursue any further contracts with the temporary employment company meniar . achim neumann of verdi was excited to hear the news . " i think this is fantastic - obviously a tremendous amount of pressure was necessary to convince schlecker of that misusing the temporary working laws is unacceptable .
it ’ s a very positive sign , " he told deutsche welle . schlecker has often come under criticism from the unions regarding its employment practices .
it has accused verdi of using " targeted disinformation and defamation campaigns " in the past . with more than 50,000 employees and stores in 12 countries , schlecker is the largest drugstore company in europe .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de auto industry -pipe- 11.01.2010 vw announces big expansion plans for us market großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : volkswagen wants to reposition itself in the united states despite years of weak performance in the us market , volkswagen announced it aims to double the number of cars it sells in the us by 2012 or 2013 .
vw wants its cars to escape their niche status and hit the mass market . just prior to the opening of the annual detroit auto show on monday , german carmaker volkswagen announced it plans for ramping up its presence in the united states , aiming to win over american consumers and sell twice the number of cars it does now in three to four years ' time .
" we will sell 400,000 to 450,000 vehicles in 2012/13 , " said stefan jacoby , head of volkswagen of america , on sunday , adding that the company 's us business could become profitable by 2013 . volkswagen , europe 's largest carmaker , has had a hard time finding its footing in the all-important us market .
its presence in china and brazil is strong and sales in germany have been helped by a government program last year that encouraged drivers to trade in old gas guzzlers for more for efficient cars .
in europe , vw has 21 percent of the market .
but vw market share in the us , including its audi brand , is only three percent .
part of the reason for that , according to analysts , has to do with the generally dismal state of the car industry in the wake of global recession .
although , vw 's small market share actually gave it a bit of a foot up since it was not as hard hit by the collapse of american auto sales as some of its rivals were .
american preferences bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vw has been trying to figure out how to fit the pieces together for the us market vw 's lackluster performance can also be traced back to its product line , which was not ideally suited to americans ' taste in cars .
" volkswagen was neither a premium brand like mercedes , nor a mass-market brand , " said marc tonn , a senior analyst at m.m. warburg .
" the company was kind of stuck in the middle . "
the wolfsburg-based concern focused on smaller or mid-size cars with highly advanced technological features when americans were more interested in buying larger vehicles , such as suvs or pick-up trucks .
" i think the focus will now be on maintaining german quality , but going a little in the direction of us size , " tonn added .
nevertheless , vw will not likely be turning out tank-like vehicles any time soon .
jacoby said he expects the market for compact and mid-sized sedans to increase faster than other segments , especially if oil prices convince more americans to downsize from their chevy tahoes and ford explorers .
" with higher oil prices , the us consumer is perhaps going to look a little more closely at smaller cars , " said christian breitsprecher , an auto analyst at sol oppenheim . from the niche to the masses volkswagen , which ranks behind brands like hyundai , honda , mercedes and bmw in the us , wants to emerge from its position as a niche carmaker to a mass-market product , one that can compete with extremely popular makes , such as toyota 's camry .
while the beetle quickly became a cult classic in the us and enjoyed great popularity in the 1960s and early 1970s , vw was never able to imitate its success with subsequent makes , such as its rabbit .
the company closed its last us plant in 1988 in pennsylvania amid sluggish sales .
" the rabbit was a flop and vw never really was able to get back in the mass market after that , " said breitsprecher , who added that volkswagen cars remained niche products .
" i mean , who bought a jetta ?
mostly college kids who could n't afford bmws . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : volkswagen beetle - a hit in america but vw wants a follow-up success becoming a mass-market car in the us is essential to vw 's ambitious expansion plans for the coming years , which include surpassing main rival toyota , the world 's largest automaker by sales volume .
new investments volkswagen is building a new plant in chattanooga , tennessee , investing up to $ 1 billion -lrb- 694 million euros -rrb- in a facility that , according to us head jacoby , " will enable the turnaround of vw 's us operations " and should create around 2,000 jobs .
increasing production and purchasing in the dollar zone is crucial to vw 's return to profitability as it would lower the company 's exposure to a dollar that is weak compared to the euro .
the carmaker is also spending $ 125 million on two new dealerships in new york city , which will begin sales in 2010 .
they are part of the company 's strategy to increase its presence and visibility in the us .
jacoby said he thinks the worst of the automobile sector 's woes to be behind them , with american car sales likely to be 11 million to 11.5 million in 2010 .
because of a stabilization of the labor and real-estate markets , " we are a little bit more optimistic now than we were a few months ago , " he said on sunday .
he added that he expects the us car sales to stabilize at around 15 million over the medium term , and vw 's longer-term us plans include selling 800,000 vehicles a year by 2018 .
" the us is a critical component of vw 's long-term strategy , " said analyst tonn .
" despite all the euphoria about emerging markets these days , if you want to be a global player you have to do well in america . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundeswehr -pipe- 11.01.2010 females in the ranks : ten years of armed women in the bundeswehr großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stefanie linsener is just one of 17,000 women serving in the bundeswehr ten years ago the eu 's top court cleared the way for female bundeswehr soldiers to be armed .
one of those women is stefanie linsener whose time with the bundeswehr has included a four-month tour in afghanistan . stefanie linsener has never met tanja kreil .
but linsener , a soldier in the bundeswehr , is grateful for kreil 's fight for women like her .
in 2000 kreil won an amendment to germany 's constitution from the court of justice of the european union allowing women to take part in bundeswehr 's armed services .
up until that point they had been limited to working in the medical service or the military band .
without tanja kreil , there never would have been bundeswehr soldier stefanie linsener .
one year after the january 11 , 2000 ruling , the 18-year-old linsener joined the bundeswehr and became one of the first women trained to use weapons .
" my father was really proud of me , " she says .
" my mother had some misgivings , but she is also proud of me , of course , that i did it . " diving into an unknown world bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : linsener shows off the different types of uniforms she wears at first linsener had to get used to the drills and the tone her superiors use when speaking to her .
and she found her uniform practical but rather unfashionable " for a woman who pays attention to herself . "
linsener has a well-kept appearance and she wears jewelry when she 's working in her office .
linsener likes to laugh .
but when she , six other women and 60 male recruits had to crawl through the mud and dig out a position with a 30-kilogram -lrb- 66-pound -rrb- pack on her back and a 12-kilogram machine gun , she was n't laughing .
sometimes she wondered what the point of the exercises was , but through them she learned what her mental and physical limits were .
and she found the motivation to keep going .
" i said to myself , ' shut your eyes and get through it .
you 're doing this now , " ' she recounts .
" i think it 's true that women are a little bit more ambitious and have more willpower .
at least i did . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : men and women are treated the same in the bundeswehr , major fischer says major juergen fischer can only confirm linsener 's observations .
it 's been his experience , he said , that the female soldiers inspire the male recruits .
it 's only a matter of time , he says , before a woman is promoted to major or lieutenant colonel .
" women and men are treated equally , including with their salaries , " fischer says .
however , unlike men , women can not be required to participate in the armed services .
thus there is no conscription for female soldiers while german men are still required to serve in the bundeswehr or complete community service .
deployment a part of the job linsener can assemble her gun while blindfolded .
she knows that it 's a device that can kill but that 's part of being in the army , she says .
another part of being in the army for linsener was a four-month deployment in afghanistan .
she and her fellow soldiers worked 13 to 14 hours a day in afghanistan for four months without a day off .
spending every day armed and in a flak vest and only seeing a country from behind the safety glass in her tank taught linsener to appreciate her life in germany .
female soldiers do find it difficult to gain recognition in a male-dominated country like afghanistan , where women are hardly seen in public , she says .
when she once naively left the camp with her hair loose and uncovered , stones were thrown at her .
" this is like a woman in germany running around naked in the street , " she says she was later told . " helmet , combat boots and camouflage ready to go of those serving in the armed forces , about 17,000 or nine percent are women .
linsener was one those troops for nine years .
now she has another two years of office work responding to press inquiries as fischer 's assistant .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : linsener could be headed back to afghanistan at any moment .
her deployment uniform is in her office locker , ready to go .
an enlisted soldier like linsener gets two years of paid career training before she leaves the army .
studying media design interests her , though a switch to the customs authorities seems like a good move too .
she could be trained to work with the inspection dogs .
though she 's not certain what her next step will be , after what she 's been through , linsener is confident that she 'll be able to rise to the challenge again .

one of those women is stefanie linsener whose time with the bundeswehr has included a four-month tour in afghanistan . stefanie linsener has never met tanja kreil .
but linsener , a soldier in the bundeswehr , is grateful for kreil 's fight for women like her .
in 2000 kreil won an amendment to germany 's constitution from the court of justice of the european union allowing women to take part in bundeswehr 's armed services .
up until that point they had been limited to working in the medical service or the military band .
without tanja kreil , there never would have been bundeswehr soldier stefanie linsener .
one year after the january 11 , 2000 ruling , the 18-year-old linsener joined the bundeswehr and became one of the first women trained to use weapons .

sometimes she wondered what the point of the exercises was , but through them she learned what her mental and physical limits were .

she and her fellow soldiers worked 13 to 14 hours a day in afghanistan for four months without a day off .
spending every day armed and in a flak vest and only seeing a country from behind the safety glass in her tank taught linsener to appreciate her life in germany .
female soldiers do find it difficult to gain recognition in a male-dominated country like afghanistan , where women are hardly seen in public , she says .

one of those women is stefanie linsener whose time with the bundeswehr has included a four-month tour in afghanistan . stefanie linsener has never met tanja kreil .
but linsener , a soldier in the bundeswehr , is grateful for kreil 's fight for women like her .
in 2000 kreil won an amendment to germany 's constitution from the court of justice of the european union allowing women to take part in bundeswehr 's armed services .
up until that point they had been limited to working in the medical service or the military band .
without tanja kreil , there never would have been bundeswehr soldier stefanie linsener .
one year after the january 11 , 2000 ruling , the 18-year-old linsener joined the bundeswehr and became one of the first women trained to use weapons .
" my father was really proud of me , " she says .
" my mother had some misgivings , but she is also proud of me , of course , that i did it . " diving into an unknown world bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : linsener shows off the different types of uniforms she wears at first linsener had to get used to the drills and the tone her superiors use when speaking to her .
and she found her uniform practical but rather unfashionable " for a woman who pays attention to herself . "
linsener has a well-kept appearance and she wears jewelry when she 's working in her office .
linsener likes to laugh .
but when she , six other women and 60 male recruits had to crawl through the mud and dig out a position with a 30-kilogram -lrb- 66-pound -rrb- pack on her back and a 12-kilogram machine gun , she was n't laughing .
sometimes she wondered what the point of the exercises was , but through them she learned what her mental and physical limits were .
and she found the motivation to keep going .
" i said to myself , ' shut your eyes and get through it .
you 're doing this now , " ' she recounts .
" i think it 's true that women are a little bit more ambitious and have more willpower .
at least i did . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : men and women are treated the same in the bundeswehr , major fischer says major juergen fischer can only confirm linsener 's observations .
it 's been his experience , he said , that the female soldiers inspire the male recruits .
it 's only a matter of time , he says , before a woman is promoted to major or lieutenant colonel .
" women and men are treated equally , including with their salaries , " fischer says .
however , unlike men , women can not be required to participate in the armed services .
thus there is no conscription for female soldiers while german men are still required to serve in the bundeswehr or complete community service .
deployment a part of the job linsener can assemble her gun while blindfolded .
she knows that it 's a device that can kill but that 's part of being in the army , she says .
another part of being in the army for linsener was a four-month deployment in afghanistan .
she and her fellow soldiers worked 13 to 14 hours a day in afghanistan for four months without a day off .
spending every day armed and in a flak vest and only seeing a country from behind the safety glass in her tank taught linsener to appreciate her life in germany .
female soldiers do find it difficult to gain recognition in a male-dominated country like afghanistan , where women are hardly seen in public , she says .
when she once naively left the camp with her hair loose and uncovered , stones were thrown at her .
" this is like a woman in germany running around naked in the street , " she says she was later told . " helmet , combat boots and camouflage ready to go of those serving in the armed forces , about 17,000 or nine percent are women .
linsener was one those troops for nine years .
now she has another two years of office work responding to press inquiries as fischer 's assistant .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : linsener could be headed back to afghanistan at any moment .
her deployment uniform is in her office locker , ready to go .
an enlisted soldier like linsener gets two years of paid career training before she leaves the army .
studying media design interests her , though a switch to the customs authorities seems like a good move too .
she could be trained to work with the inspection dogs .
though she 's not certain what her next step will be , after what she 's been through , linsener is confident that she 'll be able to rise to the challenge again .

his government and african football officials had earlier pleaded with the togolese authorities to allow the players to fulfill their wish to compete in the tournament to honour their slain colleagues .
" it 's very sad .
it 's hard for africa and for us .
these things are part of life , you have to accept it , " togo captain emmanuel adebayor , who plays his club football for manchester city , told the afp news agency at the airport in cabinda .

the angolan minister in charge of affairs in cabinda , antonio bento bembe , said that the attack was " an act of terrorism . "

vw wants its cars to escape their niche status and hit the mass market . just prior to the opening of the annual detroit auto show on monday , german carmaker volkswagen announced it plans for ramping up its presence in the united states , aiming to win over american consumers and sell twice the number of cars it does now in three to four years ' time .
" we will sell 400,000 to 450,000 vehicles in 2012/13 , " said stefan jacoby , head of volkswagen of america , on sunday , adding that the company 's us business could become profitable by 2013 . volkswagen , europe 's largest carmaker , has had a hard time finding its footing in the all-important us market .
its presence in china and brazil is strong and sales in germany have been helped by a government program last year that encouraged drivers to trade in old gas guzzlers for more for efficient cars .
in europe , vw has 21 percent of the market .
but vw market share in the us , including its audi brand , is only three percent .
part of the reason for that , according to analysts , has to do with the generally dismal state of the car industry in the wake of global recession .
although , vw 's small market share actually gave it a bit of a foot up since it was not as hard hit by the collapse of american auto sales as some of its rivals were .
american preferences bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vw has been trying to figure out how to fit the pieces together for the us market vw 's lackluster performance can also be traced back to its product line , which was not ideally suited to americans ' taste in cars .
" volkswagen was neither a premium brand like mercedes , nor a mass-market brand , " said marc tonn , a senior analyst at m.m. warburg .
" the company was kind of stuck in the middle . "
the wolfsburg-based concern focused on smaller or mid-size cars with highly advanced technological features when americans were more interested in buying larger vehicles , such as suvs or pick-up trucks .
" i think the focus will now be on maintaining german quality , but going a little in the direction of us size , " tonn added .
nevertheless , vw will not likely be turning out tank-like vehicles any time soon .
jacoby said he expects the market for compact and mid-sized sedans to increase faster than other segments , especially if oil prices convince more americans to downsize from their chevy tahoes and ford explorers .
" with higher oil prices , the us consumer is perhaps going to look a little more closely at smaller cars , " said christian breitsprecher , an auto analyst at sol oppenheim . from the niche to the masses volkswagen , which ranks behind brands like hyundai , honda , mercedes and bmw in the us , wants to emerge from its position as a niche carmaker to a mass-market product , one that can compete with extremely popular makes , such as toyota 's camry .
while the beetle quickly became a cult classic in the us and enjoyed great popularity in the 1960s and early 1970s , vw was never able to imitate its success with subsequent makes , such as its rabbit .
the company closed its last us plant in 1988 in pennsylvania amid sluggish sales .
" the rabbit was a flop and vw never really was able to get back in the mass market after that , " said breitsprecher , who added that volkswagen cars remained niche products .
" i mean , who bought a jetta ?
mostly college kids who could n't afford bmws . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : volkswagen beetle - a hit in america but vw wants a follow-up success becoming a mass-market car in the us is essential to vw 's ambitious expansion plans for the coming years , which include surpassing main rival toyota , the world 's largest automaker by sales volume .
new investments volkswagen is building a new plant in chattanooga , tennessee , investing up to $ 1 billion -lrb- 694 million euros -rrb- in a facility that , according to us head jacoby , " will enable the turnaround of vw 's us operations " and should create around 2,000 jobs .
increasing production and purchasing in the dollar zone is crucial to vw 's return to profitability as it would lower the company 's exposure to a dollar that is weak compared to the euro .
the carmaker is also spending $ 125 million on two new dealerships in new york city , which will begin sales in 2010 .
they are part of the company 's strategy to increase its presence and visibility in the us .
jacoby said he thinks the worst of the automobile sector 's woes to be behind them , with american car sales likely to be 11 million to 11.5 million in 2010 .
because of a stabilization of the labor and real-estate markets , " we are a little bit more optimistic now than we were a few months ago , " he said on sunday .
he added that he expects the us car sales to stabilize at around 15 million over the medium term , and vw 's longer-term us plans include selling 800,000 vehicles a year by 2018 .
" the us is a critical component of vw 's long-term strategy , " said analyst tonn .
" despite all the euphoria about emerging markets these days , if you want to be a global player you have to do well in america . "

defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg has invited her to visit the troops . bishop margot kaessmann and karl-theodor zu guttenberg agreed during their half-hour meeting on monday that there should be a broader public debate on the german bundeswehr 's mission in afghanistan , as well as a strengthened civil commitment .
the minister and the protestant church leader said they would continue their " critical dialogue " about the afghan deployment , possibly in the framework of the bundeswehr 's military academy or at protestant church academies . while the issue would n't be solved anytime soon , kaessmann said it was important that the church 's voice was heard in the debate .
kaessmann is the lutheran bishop of hanover and the first woman to head the ekd - an umbrella group for 22 churches that encompass germany 's 25 million protestants .
" nothing is right in afghanistan " the high-level meeting comes as a response to critical remarks by the bishop in december , when kaessmann said in an interview that the war in afghanistan could not be justified .
at two new year 's church services , she told congregations in berlin and dresden she did not approve of the western strategy in afghanistan , where 4,500 german military personnel are deployed with the international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- .
her comments were described as " naive , " " not helpful , " " unrealistic " - soldiers posted in afghanistan were as angered by the bishop 's views as many german politicians .
the german government - the third-largest force contributor after the united states and britain - is expected to decide whether to commit more troops to stabilizing afghanistan at an international conference in late january on how to assist the country .
opinion polls have repeatedly shown a majority of germans are opposed to the afghan deployment. db / dpa / epd editor : michael lawton michael lawton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but vw market share in the us , including its audi brand , is only three percent .
part of the reason for that , according to analysts , has to do with the generally dismal state of the car industry in the wake of global recession .
although , vw 's small market share actually gave it a bit of a foot up since it was not as hard hit by the collapse of american auto sales as some of its rivals were .
american preferences bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vw has been trying to figure out how to fit the pieces together for the us market vw 's lackluster performance can also be traced back to its product line , which was not ideally suited to americans ' taste in cars .
" volkswagen was neither a premium brand like mercedes , nor a mass-market brand , " said marc tonn , a senior analyst at m.m. warburg .
" the company was kind of stuck in the middle . "
the wolfsburg-based concern focused on smaller or mid-size cars with highly advanced technological features when americans were more interested in buying larger vehicles , such as suvs or pick-up trucks .
" i think the focus will now be on maintaining german quality , but going a little in the direction of us size , " tonn added .
nevertheless , vw will not likely be turning out tank-like vehicles any time soon .
jacoby said he expects the market for compact and mid-sized sedans to increase faster than other segments , especially if oil prices convince more americans to downsize from their chevy tahoes and ford explorers .
" with higher oil prices , the us consumer is perhaps going to look a little more closely at smaller cars , " said christian breitsprecher , an auto analyst at sol oppenheim . from the niche to the masses volkswagen , which ranks behind brands like hyundai , honda , mercedes and bmw in the us , wants to emerge from its position as a niche carmaker to a mass-market product , one that can compete with extremely popular makes , such as toyota 's camry .
while the beetle quickly became a cult classic in the us and enjoyed great popularity in the 1960s and early 1970s , vw was never able to imitate its success with subsequent makes , such as its rabbit .
the company closed its last us plant in 1988 in pennsylvania amid sluggish sales .
" the rabbit was a flop and vw never really was able to get back in the mass market after that , " said breitsprecher , who added that volkswagen cars remained niche products .
" i mean , who bought a jetta ?
mostly college kids who could n't afford bmws . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : volkswagen beetle - a hit in america but vw wants a follow-up success becoming a mass-market car in the us is essential to vw 's ambitious expansion plans for the coming years , which include surpassing main rival toyota , the world 's largest automaker by sales volume .
new investments volkswagen is building a new plant in chattanooga , tennessee , investing up to $ 1 billion -lrb- 694 million euros -rrb- in a facility that , according to us head jacoby , " will enable the turnaround of vw 's us operations " and should create around 2,000 jobs .
increasing production and purchasing in the dollar zone is crucial to vw 's return to profitability as it would lower the company 's exposure to a dollar that is weak compared to the euro .
the carmaker is also spending $ 125 million on two new dealerships in new york city , which will begin sales in 2010 .
they are part of the company 's strategy to increase its presence and visibility in the us .
jacoby said he thinks the worst of the automobile sector 's woes to be behind them , with american car sales likely to be 11 million to 11.5 million in 2010 .
because of a stabilization of the labor and real-estate markets , " we are a little bit more optimistic now than we were a few months ago , " he said on sunday .
he added that he expects the us car sales to stabilize at around 15 million over the medium term , and vw 's longer-term us plans include selling 800,000 vehicles a year by 2018 .
" the us is a critical component of vw 's long-term strategy , " said analyst tonn .
" despite all the euphoria about emerging markets these days , if you want to be a global player you have to do well in america . "

his post will be filled by trade and industry minister arlene foster . robinson agreed to the move on monday so that the scandal surrounding his wife 's affair could be settled .
calls for robinson 's resignation escalated over the weekend , as several key politicians feared his wife 's scandal could cause the region 's power-sharing executive to collapse .
robinson 's wife iris , who is also a top politician , admitted to having an affair with a 19-year-old man last week .
she also said she helped to raise 50,000 pounds -lrb- 55,600 euros -rrb- from two wealthy developers for him so he could set up his own café .
iris robinson is expected to leave her seats in the northern ireland assembly and the british house of commons shortly .
she is also receiving psychiatric treatment in belfast , as she has previously admitted to attempting suicide and suffering severe depression .
peter robinson has maintained that he had absolutely no knowledge of his wife 's affair or the financial deal between her and the 19-year-old .
bad timing the robinson scandal has come in the midst of a power-sharing struggle between the protestant democratic unionist party -lrb- dup -rrb- and the catholic sinn fein .
the former foes are finding it hard to hold their alliance together , as both sides have failed to agree on whether policing powers should be transferred from london to belfast .
" we have a political crisis in any case , we did n't need this to be in the middle of it , " said sinn fein police and justice spokesperson gerry kelly .

defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg has invited her to visit the troops . bishop margot kaessmann and karl-theodor zu guttenberg agreed during their half-hour meeting on monday that there should be a broader public debate on the german bundeswehr 's mission in afghanistan , as well as a strengthened civil commitment .
the minister and the protestant church leader said they would continue their " critical dialogue " about the afghan deployment , possibly in the framework of the bundeswehr 's military academy or at protestant church academies . while the issue would n't be solved anytime soon , kaessmann said it was important that the church 's voice was heard in the debate .
kaessmann is the lutheran bishop of hanover and the first woman to head the ekd - an umbrella group for 22 churches that encompass germany 's 25 million protestants .
" nothing is right in afghanistan " the high-level meeting comes as a response to critical remarks by the bishop in december , when kaessmann said in an interview that the war in afghanistan could not be justified .
at two new year 's church services , she told congregations in berlin and dresden she did not approve of the western strategy in afghanistan , where 4,500 german military personnel are deployed with the international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- .
her comments were described as " naive , " " not helpful , " " unrealistic " - soldiers posted in afghanistan were as angered by the bishop 's views as many german politicians .
the german government - the third-largest force contributor after the united states and britain - is expected to decide whether to commit more troops to stabilizing afghanistan at an international conference in late january on how to assist the country .
opinion polls have repeatedly shown a majority of germans are opposed to the afghan deployment. db / dpa / epd editor : michael lawton michael lawton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but is it really against the law ? the schlecker drugstore mega-chain has come under heavy criticism for alleged wage dumping . the trade union verdi has accused schlecker of forcing its employees to take new contracts through a temporary employment agency called meniar , which pays only half of the usual hourly wage , about 6.70 euros -lrb- $ 9.73 -rrb- instead of 12.50 euros -lrb- $ 18.17 -rrb- . it also said it believed meniar was entirely controled by schlecker . politicians protest the labor minister in the german state of north rhine-westphalia , karl josef laumann , has also accused schlecker of systematic wage evasion . the süddeutsche zeitung newspaper reported that laumann wrote a letter to schlecker employees stating that temporary work is designed to compensate for operating peaks or in the case of vacation or illness , not to replace permanent staff . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schlecker has about 50,000 employees throughout europe federal labor minister ursula von der leyen appeared on a sunday evening talk show and said that the case would have to be examined closely to see if there abuse is abuse . she added that the federal employment agency -lrb- ba -rrb- is responsible for ensuring that every temporary employment agency has a license that must be renewed regularly . " there is a proper procedure , " she said .
" we are not in the wild west . " is it illegal ? however , a ba spokeswoman denied that schlecker ’ s actions were illegal . " the temporary employment act does not preclude sacking workers and replacing them with ones from a temporary employment agency under worse conditions , " said a ba spokeswoman on monday . she added the government would have to change the laws in order to prohibit similar actions . still , the association of temporary work agencies -lrb- bza -rrb- has been quick to distance itself from the business policies of schlecker . " such business practices are not consistent with the original meaning of temporary work and hurt the reputation of all temporary employment agencies , " bza spokesman wolfram linke told deutsche welle . linke added that companies who are members of the bza have to agree to pay employees an hourly wage of at least 7.51 euros -lrb- $ 10.51 -rrb- , despite the fact that germany does not have a minimum wage . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : labor minister ursula von der leyen said the situation must be carefully examined schlecker responds schlecker has denied the allegations of wage dumping and insists that its new stores pay up to 13 euros -lrb- $ 18.89 -rrb- an hour or more .
however , head of corporate communications florian baum said monday that schlecker had resolved " effective immediately " not to pursue any further contracts with the temporary employment company meniar . achim neumann of verdi was excited to hear the news . " i think this is fantastic - obviously a tremendous amount of pressure was necessary to convince schlecker of that misusing the temporary working laws is unacceptable .
it ’ s a very positive sign , " he told deutsche welle . schlecker has often come under criticism from the unions regarding its employment practices .
it has accused verdi of using " targeted disinformation and defamation campaigns " in the past . with more than 50,000 employees and stores in 12 countries , schlecker is the largest drugstore company in europe .

but experts say counterterrorism wo n't work without addressing yemen 's other woes . concerns are mounting about terrorism in yemen since the botched attempted bombing of a us airliner on christmas day .
us president barack obama has said al-qaeda 's offshoot in yemen was behind the failed attacks .
the issue was on the agenda when the german foreign minister , guido westerwelle , made a surprise visit to yemen on monday at the end of his middle east tour .
as washington ramps up its counterterrorism role in yemen and raises pressure on the government in sanaa to crack down on islamic extremists , some say that a single-minded focus on military force is deeply flawed .
" the united states and other western powers need to provide long-term economic development to reduce poverty and raise educational standards , " yemen 's foreign minister abu bakr al-qirbi said in an interview with the washington post last week .
that , he said , would help combat terrorism " in a more effective fashion than just using military force . "
that view is echoed by international aid agencies working on the ground in yemen , the arab world 's most impoverished nation .
bildunterschrift : experts warn against focusing solely on military means to fight terrorism " poverty is n't the only explanation for terrorism .
but it 's true that yemen 's extensive social and economic pressures contribute to making the country unstable - and thus make it easier for terrorist organizations to exploit people 's grievances and recruit them , " felix eikenberg , head of germany 's friedrich ebert political foundation in the capital sanaa , told deutsche welle .
germany , whose aid involvement in yemen dates back 40 years , is one of europe 's biggest donors to yemen .
massive social and economic pressures home to around 24 million people , yemen is grappling with one of the world 's highest population growth rates , rapidly depleting groundwater levels , and an unemployment rate of more than 20 percent .
the country 's economy is in tatters as it runs out of its meager oil reserves . " some 70 percent of the state 's revenues currently come from oil .
but oil reserves are dwindling so rapidly that we estimate yemen could become an oil importer in ten years , " eikenberg said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yemen faces a lethal cocktail of social and demographic problems total oil production has slumped from about 440,000 barrels per day in 2001 to 300,000 last year , according to the us energy information administration .
all that has contributed to widespread poverty in the country .
children suffer from a 50 percent malnutrition rate ; more than 40 percent of yemenis live below the poverty line , 18 percent on less than a dollar a day .
germany a major donor given the magnitude of its problems , yemen receives comparatively little per-capita international aid .
the world bank and the imf play an important role in financing yemen 's fragile economy .
the handful of bilateral donors to yemen include the netherlands , the us , japan and britain , germany remains one of the largest european players with annual aid amounting to about 37 million euros .
aid for 2009 and 2010 has been budgeted at 79 million euros .
much of it is focused on easing yemen 's severe water shortage , boosting primary education in the country - yemen had a literacy rate of 40 percent in 2007 - and helping diversify its oil-dominated economy .
zoe nautre , an expert at the berlin-based german council on foreign relations who spent a year in yemen reviewing german government aid efforts , said germany enjoyed excellent relations with the yemeni government .
" germany is often apolitical because it provides a lot of good technical assistance in yemen , particularly in the water sector , and does n't appear to be meddling in yemen 's affairs .
so , germany is well trusted in sanaa , " she told deutsche welle .
failure of governance but others point out that aid money is most needed to help tackle the failure of yemen 's corrupt government to maintain control over remote regions in the strife-torn country - which in turn is exacerbating yemen 's security woes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yemen remains a loosely-governed country under president saleh " one of the major reasons al qaeda is so strong in yemen is because the government is so weak , " guido steinberg , an expert on international terrorism and political developments in the gulf region at the berlin-based german institute for international and security affairs told deutsche welle .
" president ali abdullah saleh 's government is losing legitimacy - it 's not just failing to provide its own citizens with basic things such as water and jobs but is also losing control over vast swathes of the country . "
president saleh is facing a rebellion in the north , a secessionist movement in the south and growing islamic terrorism .
expert urges caution experts say that in addition to equipping and training yemen 's security forces to combat terrorism , the country needs a long-term development strategy - that means not just aid in areas such as education , health and infrastructure , but an inclusive politics .
" development policy in yemen has no meaning if it is n't embedded in a political strategy , " steinberg said .
eickenberg , whose organization is involved in democratization and reforming yemen 's political institutions , said western nations meeting at a yemen conference in london later this month needed to focus on promoting better governance , fighting corruption and nudging yemen to solve its northern conflict - with the help of its influential neighbor saudi arabia .
but nautre urged caution in drafting any future western strategy on yemen .
" western involvement in yemen can easily backfire because the population is very wary and there 's a strong anti-american sentiment there , " nautre said .
" the most important thing is for the west not to be seen as interfering in yemen from outside so that the people do n't turn against you and run into the arms of extremist groups . "

much of it is focused on easing yemen 's severe water shortage , boosting primary education in the country - yemen had a literacy rate of 40 percent in 2007 - and helping diversify its oil-dominated economy .
zoe nautre , an expert at the berlin-based german council on foreign relations who spent a year in yemen reviewing german government aid efforts , said germany enjoyed excellent relations with the yemeni government .
" germany is often apolitical because it provides a lot of good technical assistance in yemen , particularly in the water sector , and does n't appear to be meddling in yemen 's affairs .
so , germany is well trusted in sanaa , " she told deutsche welle .
failure of governance but others point out that aid money is most needed to help tackle the failure of yemen 's corrupt government to maintain control over remote regions in the strife-torn country - which in turn is exacerbating yemen 's security woes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yemen remains a loosely-governed country under president saleh " one of the major reasons al qaeda is so strong in yemen is because the government is so weak , " guido steinberg , an expert on international terrorism and political developments in the gulf region at the berlin-based german institute for international and security affairs told deutsche welle .
" president ali abdullah saleh 's government is losing legitimacy - it 's not just failing to provide its own citizens with basic things such as water and jobs but is also losing control over vast swathes of the country . "
president saleh is facing a rebellion in the north , a secessionist movement in the south and growing islamic terrorism .
expert urges caution experts say that in addition to equipping and training yemen 's security forces to combat terrorism , the country needs a long-term development strategy - that means not just aid in areas such as education , health and infrastructure , but an inclusive politics .
" development policy in yemen has no meaning if it is n't embedded in a political strategy , " steinberg said .
eickenberg , whose organization is involved in democratization and reforming yemen 's political institutions , said western nations meeting at a yemen conference in london later this month needed to focus on promoting better governance , fighting corruption and nudging yemen to solve its northern conflict - with the help of its influential neighbor saudi arabia .
but nautre urged caution in drafting any future western strategy on yemen .
" western involvement in yemen can easily backfire because the population is very wary and there 's a strong anti-american sentiment there , " nautre said .
" the most important thing is for the west not to be seen as interfering in yemen from outside so that the people do n't turn against you and run into the arms of extremist groups . "

but experts say counterterrorism wo n't work without addressing yemen 's other woes . concerns are mounting about terrorism in yemen since the botched attempted bombing of a us airliner on christmas day .
us president barack obama has said al-qaeda 's offshoot in yemen was behind the failed attacks .
the issue was on the agenda when the german foreign minister , guido westerwelle , made a surprise visit to yemen on monday at the end of his middle east tour .
as washington ramps up its counterterrorism role in yemen and raises pressure on the government in sanaa to crack down on islamic extremists , some say that a single-minded focus on military force is deeply flawed .
" the united states and other western powers need to provide long-term economic development to reduce poverty and raise educational standards , " yemen 's foreign minister abu bakr al-qirbi said in an interview with the washington post last week .
that , he said , would help combat terrorism " in a more effective fashion than just using military force . "
that view is echoed by international aid agencies working on the ground in yemen , the arab world 's most impoverished nation .
bildunterschrift : experts warn against focusing solely on military means to fight terrorism " poverty is n't the only explanation for terrorism .
but it 's true that yemen 's extensive social and economic pressures contribute to making the country unstable - and thus make it easier for terrorist organizations to exploit people 's grievances and recruit them , " felix eikenberg , head of germany 's friedrich ebert political foundation in the capital sanaa , told deutsche welle .
germany , whose aid involvement in yemen dates back 40 years , is one of europe 's biggest donors to yemen .
massive social and economic pressures home to around 24 million people , yemen is grappling with one of the world 's highest population growth rates , rapidly depleting groundwater levels , and an unemployment rate of more than 20 percent .
the country 's economy is in tatters as it runs out of its meager oil reserves . " some 70 percent of the state 's revenues currently come from oil .
but oil reserves are dwindling so rapidly that we estimate yemen could become an oil importer in ten years , " eikenberg said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yemen faces a lethal cocktail of social and demographic problems total oil production has slumped from about 440,000 barrels per day in 2001 to 300,000 last year , according to the us energy information administration .
all that has contributed to widespread poverty in the country .
children suffer from a 50 percent malnutrition rate ; more than 40 percent of yemenis live below the poverty line , 18 percent on less than a dollar a day .
germany a major donor given the magnitude of its problems , yemen receives comparatively little per-capita international aid .
the world bank and the imf play an important role in financing yemen 's fragile economy .
the handful of bilateral donors to yemen include the netherlands , the us , japan and britain , germany remains one of the largest european players with annual aid amounting to about 37 million euros .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de auto industry -pipe- 11.01.2010 vw announces big expansion plans for us market großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : volkswagen wants to reposition itself in the united states despite years of weak performance in the us market , volkswagen announced it aims to double the number of cars it sells in the us by 2012 or 2013 .
vw wants its cars to escape their niche status and hit the mass market . just prior to the opening of the annual detroit auto show on monday , german carmaker volkswagen announced it plans for ramping up its presence in the united states , aiming to win over american consumers and sell twice the number of cars it does now in three to four years ' time .
" we will sell 400,000 to 450,000 vehicles in 2012/13 , " said stefan jacoby , head of volkswagen of america , on sunday , adding that the company 's us business could become profitable by 2013 . volkswagen , europe 's largest carmaker , has had a hard time finding its footing in the all-important us market .
its presence in china and brazil is strong and sales in germany have been helped by a government program last year that encouraged drivers to trade in old gas guzzlers for more for efficient cars .
in europe , vw has 21 percent of the market .
but vw market share in the us , including its audi brand , is only three percent .
part of the reason for that , according to analysts , has to do with the generally dismal state of the car industry in the wake of global recession .
although , vw 's small market share actually gave it a bit of a foot up since it was not as hard hit by the collapse of american auto sales as some of its rivals were .
american preferences bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vw has been trying to figure out how to fit the pieces together for the us market vw 's lackluster performance can also be traced back to its product line , which was not ideally suited to americans ' taste in cars .
" volkswagen was neither a premium brand like mercedes , nor a mass-market brand , " said marc tonn , a senior analyst at m.m. warburg .
" the company was kind of stuck in the middle . "
the wolfsburg-based concern focused on smaller or mid-size cars with highly advanced technological features when americans were more interested in buying larger vehicles , such as suvs or pick-up trucks .
" i think the focus will now be on maintaining german quality , but going a little in the direction of us size , " tonn added .
nevertheless , vw will not likely be turning out tank-like vehicles any time soon .
jacoby said he expects the market for compact and mid-sized sedans to increase faster than other segments , especially if oil prices convince more americans to downsize from their chevy tahoes and ford explorers .
" with higher oil prices , the us consumer is perhaps going to look a little more closely at smaller cars , " said christian breitsprecher , an auto analyst at sol oppenheim . from the niche to the masses volkswagen , which ranks behind brands like hyundai , honda , mercedes and bmw in the us , wants to emerge from its position as a niche carmaker to a mass-market product , one that can compete with extremely popular makes , such as toyota 's camry .
while the beetle quickly became a cult classic in the us and enjoyed great popularity in the 1960s and early 1970s , vw was never able to imitate its success with subsequent makes , such as its rabbit .
the company closed its last us plant in 1988 in pennsylvania amid sluggish sales .
" the rabbit was a flop and vw never really was able to get back in the mass market after that , " said breitsprecher , who added that volkswagen cars remained niche products .
" i mean , who bought a jetta ?
mostly college kids who could n't afford bmws . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : volkswagen beetle - a hit in america but vw wants a follow-up success becoming a mass-market car in the us is essential to vw 's ambitious expansion plans for the coming years , which include surpassing main rival toyota , the world 's largest automaker by sales volume .
new investments volkswagen is building a new plant in chattanooga , tennessee , investing up to $ 1 billion -lrb- 694 million euros -rrb- in a facility that , according to us head jacoby , " will enable the turnaround of vw 's us operations " and should create around 2,000 jobs .
increasing production and purchasing in the dollar zone is crucial to vw 's return to profitability as it would lower the company 's exposure to a dollar that is weak compared to the euro .
the carmaker is also spending $ 125 million on two new dealerships in new york city , which will begin sales in 2010 .
they are part of the company 's strategy to increase its presence and visibility in the us .
jacoby said he thinks the worst of the automobile sector 's woes to be behind them , with american car sales likely to be 11 million to 11.5 million in 2010 .
because of a stabilization of the labor and real-estate markets , " we are a little bit more optimistic now than we were a few months ago , " he said on sunday .
he added that he expects the us car sales to stabilize at around 15 million over the medium term , and vw 's longer-term us plans include selling 800,000 vehicles a year by 2018 .
" the us is a critical component of vw 's long-term strategy , " said analyst tonn .
" despite all the euphoria about emerging markets these days , if you want to be a global player you have to do well in america . "

defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg has invited her to visit the troops . bishop margot kaessmann and karl-theodor zu guttenberg agreed during their half-hour meeting on monday that there should be a broader public debate on the german bundeswehr 's mission in afghanistan , as well as a strengthened civil commitment .
the minister and the protestant church leader said they would continue their " critical dialogue " about the afghan deployment , possibly in the framework of the bundeswehr 's military academy or at protestant church academies . while the issue would n't be solved anytime soon , kaessmann said it was important that the church 's voice was heard in the debate .
kaessmann is the lutheran bishop of hanover and the first woman to head the ekd - an umbrella group for 22 churches that encompass germany 's 25 million protestants .
" nothing is right in afghanistan " the high-level meeting comes as a response to critical remarks by the bishop in december , when kaessmann said in an interview that the war in afghanistan could not be justified .
at two new year 's church services , she told congregations in berlin and dresden she did not approve of the western strategy in afghanistan , where 4,500 german military personnel are deployed with the international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- .
her comments were described as " naive , " " not helpful , " " unrealistic " - soldiers posted in afghanistan were as angered by the bishop 's views as many german politicians .
the german government - the third-largest force contributor after the united states and britain - is expected to decide whether to commit more troops to stabilizing afghanistan at an international conference in late january on how to assist the country .
opinion polls have repeatedly shown a majority of germans are opposed to the afghan deployment. db / dpa / epd editor : michael lawton michael lawton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

his post will be filled by trade and industry minister arlene foster . robinson agreed to the move on monday so that the scandal surrounding his wife 's affair could be settled .
calls for robinson 's resignation escalated over the weekend , as several key politicians feared his wife 's scandal could cause the region 's power-sharing executive to collapse .
robinson 's wife iris , who is also a top politician , admitted to having an affair with a 19-year-old man last week .
she also said she helped to raise 50,000 pounds -lrb- 55,600 euros -rrb- from two wealthy developers for him so he could set up his own café .
iris robinson is expected to leave her seats in the northern ireland assembly and the british house of commons shortly .
she is also receiving psychiatric treatment in belfast , as she has previously admitted to attempting suicide and suffering severe depression .
peter robinson has maintained that he had absolutely no knowledge of his wife 's affair or the financial deal between her and the 19-year-old .
bad timing the robinson scandal has come in the midst of a power-sharing struggle between the protestant democratic unionist party -lrb- dup -rrb- and the catholic sinn fein .
the former foes are finding it hard to hold their alliance together , as both sides have failed to agree on whether policing powers should be transferred from london to belfast .
" we have a political crisis in any case , we did n't need this to be in the middle of it , " said sinn fein police and justice spokesperson gerry kelly .

but is it really against the law ? the schlecker drugstore mega-chain has come under heavy criticism for alleged wage dumping . the trade union verdi has accused schlecker of forcing its employees to take new contracts through a temporary employment agency called meniar , which pays only half of the usual hourly wage , about 6.70 euros -lrb- $ 9.73 -rrb- instead of 12.50 euros -lrb- $ 18.17 -rrb- . it also said it believed meniar was entirely controled by schlecker . politicians protest the labor minister in the german state of north rhine-westphalia , karl josef laumann , has also accused schlecker of systematic wage evasion . the süddeutsche zeitung newspaper reported that laumann wrote a letter to schlecker employees stating that temporary work is designed to compensate for operating peaks or in the case of vacation or illness , not to replace permanent staff . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schlecker has about 50,000 employees throughout europe federal labor minister ursula von der leyen appeared on a sunday evening talk show and said that the case would have to be examined closely to see if there abuse is abuse . she added that the federal employment agency -lrb- ba -rrb- is responsible for ensuring that every temporary employment agency has a license that must be renewed regularly . " there is a proper procedure , " she said .
" we are not in the wild west . " is it illegal ? however , a ba spokeswoman denied that schlecker ’ s actions were illegal . " the temporary employment act does not preclude sacking workers and replacing them with ones from a temporary employment agency under worse conditions , " said a ba spokeswoman on monday . she added the government would have to change the laws in order to prohibit similar actions . still , the association of temporary work agencies -lrb- bza -rrb- has been quick to distance itself from the business policies of schlecker . " such business practices are not consistent with the original meaning of temporary work and hurt the reputation of all temporary employment agencies , " bza spokesman wolfram linke told deutsche welle . linke added that companies who are members of the bza have to agree to pay employees an hourly wage of at least 7.51 euros -lrb- $ 10.51 -rrb- , despite the fact that germany does not have a minimum wage . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : labor minister ursula von der leyen said the situation must be carefully examined schlecker responds schlecker has denied the allegations of wage dumping and insists that its new stores pay up to 13 euros -lrb- $ 18.89 -rrb- an hour or more .
however , head of corporate communications florian baum said monday that schlecker had resolved " effective immediately " not to pursue any further contracts with the temporary employment company meniar . achim neumann of verdi was excited to hear the news . " i think this is fantastic - obviously a tremendous amount of pressure was necessary to convince schlecker of that misusing the temporary working laws is unacceptable .
it ’ s a very positive sign , " he told deutsche welle . schlecker has often come under criticism from the unions regarding its employment practices .
it has accused verdi of using " targeted disinformation and defamation campaigns " in the past . with more than 50,000 employees and stores in 12 countries , schlecker is the largest drugstore company in europe .

two squad members and a driver died in the ambush . " if a team or some people present themselves under the togolese flag , it will be a false representation , " gilbert houngbo told journalists in the capital lome on sunday , january 10 .
previously , the togolese national soccer team had reportedly decided to take part in the africa cup of nations in spite of friday 's deadly ambush by gunmen on their convoy in angola .
a report on the website of the french sports daily , l 'equipe , said that the players had decided to ignore the call from togo 's government for the side to return home .
the report quoted alaixys romao , togo 's midfielder , as saying that the unanimous decision to stay and take part in the tournament was taken to honor the dead and wounded .
and also in order to deny the rebels any satisfaction .
the attack by hooded gunmen claimed the lives of togo 's assistant coach and its squad spokesman along with one of the drivers of the convoy .
the togolese backup goalkeeper , kodjovi obilale , reportedly sustained two gunshot wounds in the attack and was flown to south africa for treatment .
he is said to be in a stable condition .
seven others were also injured in the incident on friday , including defender serge akakpo of the romanian team vaslui .
the other injured passengers included two squad doctors and a journalist .
major sporting event bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : togo 's players at the at the world cup stadium in frankfurt , germany angola is playing host to the 2010 africa cup of nations , and is one of africa 's major sporting event .
the attack threatens to overshadow the tournament which is to take place over the next three weeks .
the assailants opened fire on the vehicles as they travelled from cabinda , an angolan enclave to the north of the country .
the attack lasted some 20 minutes .
responsibility for the assault has been claimed by the separatist group , the front for the liberation of the enclave of cabinda -lrb- flec -rrb- .
the angolan minister in charge of affairs in cabinda , antonio bento bembe , said that the attack was " an act of terrorism . "
the oil-producing region of cabinda has been the site of a decades-long struggle for independence by the separatist group flec .
despite this , it is scheduled to play host to seven tournament matches this month. td / dfm / afp / reuters / ap / l 'equipe editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

two squad members and a driver died in the ambush . " if a team or some people present themselves under the togolese flag , it will be a false representation , " gilbert houngbo told journalists in the capital lome on sunday , january 10 .
previously , the togolese national soccer team had reportedly decided to take part in the africa cup of nations in spite of friday 's deadly ambush by gunmen on their convoy in angola .
a report on the website of the french sports daily , l 'equipe , said that the players had decided to ignore the call from togo 's government for the side to return home .
the report quoted alaixys romao , togo 's midfielder , as saying that the unanimous decision to stay and take part in the tournament was taken to honor the dead and wounded .
and also in order to deny the rebels any satisfaction .
the attack by hooded gunmen claimed the lives of togo 's assistant coach and its squad spokesman along with one of the drivers of the convoy .
the togolese backup goalkeeper , kodjovi obilale , reportedly sustained two gunshot wounds in the attack and was flown to south africa for treatment .
he is said to be in a stable condition .
seven others were also injured in the incident on friday , including defender serge akakpo of the romanian team vaslui .
the other injured passengers included two squad doctors and a journalist .

the attack threatens to overshadow the tournament which is to take place over the next three weeks .
the assailants opened fire on the vehicles as they travelled from cabinda , an angolan enclave to the north of the country .
the attack lasted some 20 minutes .
responsibility for the assault has been claimed by the separatist group , the front for the liberation of the enclave of cabinda -lrb- flec -rrb- .
the angolan minister in charge of affairs in cabinda , antonio bento bembe , said that the attack was " an act of terrorism . "
the oil-producing region of cabinda has been the site of a decades-long struggle for independence by the separatist group flec .
despite this , it is scheduled to play host to seven tournament matches this month. td / dfm / afp / reuters / ap / l 'equipe editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de auto industry -pipe- 11.01.2010 vw announces big expansion plans for us market großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : volkswagen wants to reposition itself in the united states despite years of weak performance in the us market , volkswagen announced it aims to double the number of cars it sells in the us by 2012 or 2013 .
vw wants its cars to escape their niche status and hit the mass market . just prior to the opening of the annual detroit auto show on monday , german carmaker volkswagen announced it plans for ramping up its presence in the united states , aiming to win over american consumers and sell twice the number of cars it does now in three to four years ' time .
" we will sell 400,000 to 450,000 vehicles in 2012/13 , " said stefan jacoby , head of volkswagen of america , on sunday , adding that the company 's us business could become profitable by 2013 . volkswagen , europe 's largest carmaker , has had a hard time finding its footing in the all-important us market .
its presence in china and brazil is strong and sales in germany have been helped by a government program last year that encouraged drivers to trade in old gas guzzlers for more for efficient cars .
in europe , vw has 21 percent of the market .
but vw market share in the us , including its audi brand , is only three percent .
part of the reason for that , according to analysts , has to do with the generally dismal state of the car industry in the wake of global recession .
although , vw 's small market share actually gave it a bit of a foot up since it was not as hard hit by the collapse of american auto sales as some of its rivals were .
american preferences bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vw has been trying to figure out how to fit the pieces together for the us market vw 's lackluster performance can also be traced back to its product line , which was not ideally suited to americans ' taste in cars .
" volkswagen was neither a premium brand like mercedes , nor a mass-market brand , " said marc tonn , a senior analyst at m.m. warburg .
" the company was kind of stuck in the middle . "
the wolfsburg-based concern focused on smaller or mid-size cars with highly advanced technological features when americans were more interested in buying larger vehicles , such as suvs or pick-up trucks .
" i think the focus will now be on maintaining german quality , but going a little in the direction of us size , " tonn added .
nevertheless , vw will not likely be turning out tank-like vehicles any time soon .
jacoby said he expects the market for compact and mid-sized sedans to increase faster than other segments , especially if oil prices convince more americans to downsize from their chevy tahoes and ford explorers .
" with higher oil prices , the us consumer is perhaps going to look a little more closely at smaller cars , " said christian breitsprecher , an auto analyst at sol oppenheim . from the niche to the masses volkswagen , which ranks behind brands like hyundai , honda , mercedes and bmw in the us , wants to emerge from its position as a niche carmaker to a mass-market product , one that can compete with extremely popular makes , such as toyota 's camry .
while the beetle quickly became a cult classic in the us and enjoyed great popularity in the 1960s and early 1970s , vw was never able to imitate its success with subsequent makes , such as its rabbit .
the company closed its last us plant in 1988 in pennsylvania amid sluggish sales .
" the rabbit was a flop and vw never really was able to get back in the mass market after that , " said breitsprecher , who added that volkswagen cars remained niche products .
" i mean , who bought a jetta ?
mostly college kids who could n't afford bmws . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : volkswagen beetle - a hit in america but vw wants a follow-up success becoming a mass-market car in the us is essential to vw 's ambitious expansion plans for the coming years , which include surpassing main rival toyota , the world 's largest automaker by sales volume .
new investments volkswagen is building a new plant in chattanooga , tennessee , investing up to $ 1 billion -lrb- 694 million euros -rrb- in a facility that , according to us head jacoby , " will enable the turnaround of vw 's us operations " and should create around 2,000 jobs .
increasing production and purchasing in the dollar zone is crucial to vw 's return to profitability as it would lower the company 's exposure to a dollar that is weak compared to the euro .
the carmaker is also spending $ 125 million on two new dealerships in new york city , which will begin sales in 2010 .
they are part of the company 's strategy to increase its presence and visibility in the us .
jacoby said he thinks the worst of the automobile sector 's woes to be behind them , with american car sales likely to be 11 million to 11.5 million in 2010 .
because of a stabilization of the labor and real-estate markets , " we are a little bit more optimistic now than we were a few months ago , " he said on sunday .
he added that he expects the us car sales to stabilize at around 15 million over the medium term , and vw 's longer-term us plans include selling 800,000 vehicles a year by 2018 .
" the us is a critical component of vw 's long-term strategy , " said analyst tonn .
" despite all the euphoria about emerging markets these days , if you want to be a global player you have to do well in america . "

and debates about safety are sure to continue . like all europe 's major football leagues , the german bundesliga has a number of players competing in the africa cup of nations in angola .
the first priority for clubs when the news of the attack broke was to contact their players and offer to fly them out of africa .
hanover , for example , were concerned about their tunisian defender karim haggui .
" karim told our sports directorship that he feels safe right now , " hanover spokesman andreas kundt told the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung newspaper .
three members of the togolese delegation were killed on friday when separatist rebels in an angolan enclave opened fire on the team bus .
a reserve goalkeeper had to be flown to south africa for emergency treatment for life-threatening gunshot wounds .
the togolese team subsequently quit the tournament and flew home .
bildunterschrift : the togolese team was flown home over the weekend " i was afraid for my life , " togolese defender assimiou toure , who plays for bayer leverkusen , told reporters .
" all i could do was jump under my seat and pray . "
thus far , no african player has asked his german club to get him out of angola .
but the shooting has occasioned furious debate about both the africa cup and safety in general on the continent ahead of the world 's premier soccer event .
relative safety ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany keeper rene adler has said he 's worried about the world cup in south africa international football functionaries , from fifa president sepp blatter on down , have been quick to offer assurances that the shooting in angola did not mean that this summer 's world cup in south africa would be unsafe .
" the measures taken for the africa cup are not comparable with those for a football world cup , which are planned years in advance , " german world cup advisor horst r. schmidt told the frankfurter rundschau newspaper .
indeed , south africa and angola are very different countries .
still , some likely members of the german national team at the world cup said they were worried .
" it 's completely sick , " germany 's top goalkeeper rene adler told the bild am sonntag newspaper .
" i have to ask how they 're going to ensure security at the world cup .
i 'm sure we 'll be safe as a team , but what about family members ? "
other team members had comparable reactions .
' when you hear something like that , you do a double take and start thinking , " germany midfielder bastian schweinsteiger told the sid sports news agency .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : otto pfister coached in africa for four decades german coach otto pfister , who spent most of his career working in africa and who coached the togolese team at the 2006 world cup , offered a more first-hand view .
he said that the world cup would not be especially risky but that different standards applied to africa .
" the security measures are , of course , not comparable with those in germany , " pfister said in an interview with sid .
" in this area , just as in the economy , we 're talking about developing countries .
and the distances are enormous .
how can they be expected to keep all of such vast distances completely under control ? "
hard choices bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stuttgart 's arthur boka -lrb- right -rrb- is one of the bundesliga players competing in angola the attack has focused attention on a number of issues , both for football and society in general .
for instance , pfister is among those who have criticized the togolese decision to withdraw from the tournament , which was ordered by togo 's prime minister .
he has said togo 's pull-out will only encourage extremist groups in angola , and he fears that wrong precedents could be set .
" the africa cup is a spectacular event for africans , one that 's almost more important than the world cup , " pfister told sid .
" you ca n't cancel events like these .
you quickly put yourself in a position where you can be blackmailed . "
in the purely sporting realm , though , the attack has caused football managers outside africa to question the africa cup .
clubs throughout europe were never happy about being forced to allow their employees to take part in the biennial event , and friday 's incident has fuelled arguments that the rules need to be changed .
borussia dortmund sports director michael zorc says teams should have the right to make decisions based on players ' safety .
" until that becomes the case , we ca n't bring our players back because they would then be suspended , " zorc told the frankfurter allegeimeine zeitung .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the shooting has been a huge blow for african football stuttgart commercial manager horst heldt , whose defender arthur boka plays for ivory coast , feels much the same way .
" the ideal thing for me would be if arthur could just come back , " heldt told the same paper .
ultimately , the attack on togo 's national team is going to force everyone concerned to take a realistic look at where africa and international football fit together .
fifa 's decision to award south africa the world cup was a bold and inclusive gesture , intended to signal that the world 's poorest continent was a full-fledged member in the global soccer community .
experts like pfister know that there are risks attached to that decision , but argue that those risks should not be allowed to overshadow all other aspects of the world 's biggest sporting event .
that will surely be one of the main topics of discussion for the duration of the africa cup and in the run-up to the world cup in south africa .

he has said togo 's pull-out will only encourage extremist groups in angola , and he fears that wrong precedents could be set .
" the africa cup is a spectacular event for africans , one that 's almost more important than the world cup , " pfister told sid .
" you ca n't cancel events like these .

in the purely sporting realm , though , the attack has caused football managers outside africa to question the africa cup .
clubs throughout europe were never happy about being forced to allow their employees to take part in the biennial event , and friday 's incident has fuelled arguments that the rules need to be changed .
borussia dortmund sports director michael zorc says teams should have the right to make decisions based on players ' safety .
" until that becomes the case , we ca n't bring our players back because they would then be suspended , " zorc told the frankfurter allegeimeine zeitung .

ultimately , the attack on togo 's national team is going to force everyone concerned to take a realistic look at where africa and international football fit together .
fifa 's decision to award south africa the world cup was a bold and inclusive gesture , intended to signal that the world 's poorest continent was a full-fledged member in the global soccer community .
experts like pfister know that there are risks attached to that decision , but argue that those risks should not be allowed to overshadow all other aspects of the world 's biggest sporting event .
that will surely be one of the main topics of discussion for the duration of the africa cup and in the run-up to the world cup in south africa .

and debates about safety are sure to continue . like all europe 's major football leagues , the german bundesliga has a number of players competing in the africa cup of nations in angola .
the first priority for clubs when the news of the attack broke was to contact their players and offer to fly them out of africa .
hanover , for example , were concerned about their tunisian defender karim haggui .
" karim told our sports directorship that he feels safe right now , " hanover spokesman andreas kundt told the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung newspaper .
three members of the togolese delegation were killed on friday when separatist rebels in an angolan enclave opened fire on the team bus .
a reserve goalkeeper had to be flown to south africa for emergency treatment for life-threatening gunshot wounds .
the togolese team subsequently quit the tournament and flew home .

i 'm sure we 'll be safe as a team , but what about family members ? "

heike groos joined up as a doctor but eventually found out that she was also expected to be a soldier , an experience that had long-lasting effects . when heike groos joined the bundeswehr as a doctor more than 20 years ago , she confesses it was just because she was looking for a job .
back in 1987 , when she started working as an emergency medical officer in a germany army hospital , she was still only a doctor .
that changed when she was sent to afghanistan in 2002 .
she became a doctor - and a soldier .
when groos was sent out to afghanistan , she did so without any question and without any concern .
even when it became obvious that she was now both a doctor and a soldier , armed with a weapon to protect her patients if necessary , she knew that this is what service in afghanistan was like .
it was as much part of the job as helping comrades and afghans alike as part of an emergency military ambulance team .
" at the beginning , in 2002 , it was a completely satisfying job , " she says .
" each moment made me think that we were doing something meaningful there .
just being there symbolized to the people that there was peace and that we would ensure that it remained that way , through our medical and humanitarian work there . "
suicide attack changes everything bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heike groos was first on the scene at the bomb blast but the positive feelings did not endure .
the situation changed dramatically with a suicide attack on a bus carrying german soldiers in june 2003 .
six bundeswehr troops were killed and 29 were injured , some seriously .
heike groos was one of the first on the scene ; she bandaged wounds , called for assistance , coordinated the medical efforts , comforted the injured and watched comrades die .
the event and the huge shock changed her and her colleagues ' lives forever .
" after that first suicide attack in june 2003 , we changed and we became deeply , deeply distrustful because we could not at all differentiate between the people , " she says .
" who is taliban and who is not , who is good and who is bad ? that was never clear to me . "
as well as suspicion and caution , heike groos says she felt rage ; rage against the taliban who had carried out the attack , rage against afghanistan , and rage against germany - the country which had sent her there .
she and her comrades also withdrew from the people they were supposed to be helping .
" we withdrew ourselves and wanted nothing do to with anything afghan , " she admits .
" it was because we saw those that we had come to help as those who had attacked us .
this perspective shifted in time , and we recognized that those who were friendly before still were but we were always more cautious after that .
i was never as trusting again . "
disillusionment leads to decision to leave bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : groos decided that her 2007 tour would be her last after the attack , her unit became closer , even more like a family than before .
her younger male comrades looked for comfort and assurance from the older , more experienced heike groos .
but there was no comfort for her .
groos started to see little sense in what she was doing , confined and isolated in the base due to the increasing dangers outside .
she decided that it could not go on .
she returned to afghanistan for the last time in 2007 .
groos says that people could not understand why she went back but she says she wanted to complete her service .
" people looked at me like i was an alien when i walked out of our house in my uniform , " she says .
" i was never at home and people asked my children , ' where is your mother ? ' and they would say ' she is in afghanistan ' . "
when she returned , people would stay out of her way .
her second husband also did n't understand and eventually he and groos divorced .
it was then that she decided that she wanted to leave everything behind and take her children to the other side of the world to start again .
she and three of her five kids moved to new zealand , as far away from afghanistan and germany as possible in order to find peace .
distance does n't end afghanistan trauma bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the horrors of aghanistan have never left heike groos but afghanistan did not release her from its grip .
groos continued to suffer from her experiences , suffering from nightmares and the inability to sleep .
she was also cut off from any kind of support from her previous employer : the bundeswehr .
" i had fulfilled my obligation -lrb- to the bundeswehr -rrb- and i found that very hard , " she says .
" i wish that someone had supported me and had not left me alone , but that did not happen , and i am sad about it .
they pushed me away , sent me to the army physician , to the psychiatrist who said ' you are traumatized . '
and then german people said : ' you were probably not hard enough , soldiers must always be tough . " '
while things were difficult for a long while , in time they also started to get better for heike groos and she began dealing with her experiences in afghanistan and working through her experiences .
the result was her first book , published last year , based on her time there : ' a beautiful day to die ' .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 11.01.2010 ashton faces tough questions from european parliament großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ashton has been nominated for a top job in the eu commission .
catherine ashton can expect tough questions in her confirmation hearing to become the eu 's first foreign policy tchief .
will her negotiating skills compensate for her lack of foreign policy experience ? catherine ashton , the 53-year-old former european union trade commissioner and leader of britain 's house of lords , was expected to face intensive questioning at the european commission confirmation hearings , which began in brussels on monday .
ashton was nominated for the post of high representative for foreign affairs and security policy by eu heads of state at a summit last november , but must still be confirmed by parliament .
a surprise pick although ashton has long been regarded as an industry expert , her nomination for the newly-created post of eu foreign affairs minister came as a surprise .
the native of lancashire , england , has served only one year as eu trade commissioner and has no other foreign policy experience .
even in her native britain , ashton is virtually unknown , having never been elected to public office .
her past work experience includes posts in a provincial health authority , as well as positions in a number of government departments , including the education and justice ministries .
in 1999 , the labour government of then-prime minister tony blair awarded ashton the title of “ baroness , ” so that she could represent the party in the house of lords . in 2007 , current prime minister gordon brown appointed her leader of the house of lords .
however , ashton 's big break came in 2008 , when the post of eu trade commissioner became free and ashton became the first woman to hold the office .
hard questions during monday 's confirmation hearing , ashton is expected to have to defend herself against accusations of inadequate diplomatic experience .
also likely to come up during questioning : ashton 's past involvement with britain 's anti-nuclear group , the campaign for nuclear disarmament -lrb- cnd -rrb- .
during the initial round of questioning in november , the nominee for foreign affairs chief was challenged to deny taking funds from the soviet union during her days as treasurer for the cnd over 25 years ago .
all or nothing ashton will be among the first of 26 new appointees to go through the confirmation process in the european parliament . the hearings are scheduled to end on january 19 , with the parliament 's final vote of confidence on the new commission to take place january 26 in brussels .
although parliamentarians can not vote to approve or deny individual appointees , they can vote to reject the commission as a whole .
if approved , the new team is expected to begin its five-year term on february 1. smh / afp / rtre editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the west is ready to impose strict sanctions but russia and china disagree .
they want to use diplomacy .
china , which holds the rotating presidency in january , is a strong supporter of the regime in tehran .
however , chinese dissidents are showing their support of the opposition movement on the internet . china thinks that the nuclear row with iran can be resolved with dialogue and negotiations .
it says more time and more patience is needed .
moreover , it seems less certain than the west about tehran ’ s nuclear intentions .
beijing believes that the nuclear programme is only being developed for civilian purposes , says german iran expert udo steinbach .
“ china does not share the international community ’ s dramatic interpretation of the programme , ” he says , “ which presumes that iran is working on a bomb . ”
three un resolutions against iran however , to prevent tehran from building a bomb in the future , beijing has already supported three un resolutions against iran .
these allow sanctions to be imposed on organisations and individuals that develop nuclear weapons .
but china does not support stricter sanctions .
china has massive economic interests in iran , from which the energy-hungry country imports some 15 percent of its oil .
chinese companies have invested millions to tap into the country ’ s oil and gas reserves .
the two regimes are also linked by a similar attitude to the international community .
neither government likes it when the west interferes with what they call their domestic affairs .
they are both extremely intolerant of opposition and ready to use repression to keep it under control .
“ we can assume that the chinese leadership approves the iranian government ’ s measures against the demonstrators , ” says steinbach .

“ since june , we ’ ve been following really closely because we feel the iranian people are in a similar position as the chinese , ” explains one activist , who refused to be named .
“ what they did is very courageous - they showed us courage by being willing to stand up to the regime and demand what they actually want .
they want to be fully represented in this country .
that ’ s what we want here exactly in china . “ a spokesperson from the chinese foreign ministry said at the beginning of china ’ s un security council presidency that the government hoped iranian society would remain unified and stable .
in january , there is likely to be little talk about international negotiations on iran ’ s nuclear programme .
tehran has more pressing things to attend - it hopes to get iran 's opposition movement under control .

defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg has invited her to visit the troops . bishop margot kaessmann and karl-theodor zu guttenberg agreed during their half-hour meeting on monday that there should be a broader public debate on the german bundeswehr 's mission in afghanistan , as well as a strengthened civil commitment .
the minister and the protestant church leader said they would continue their " critical dialogue " about the afghan deployment , possibly in the framework of the bundeswehr 's military academy or at protestant church academies . while the issue would n't be solved anytime soon , kaessmann said it was important that the church 's voice was heard in the debate .
kaessmann is the lutheran bishop of hanover and the first woman to head the ekd - an umbrella group for 22 churches that encompass germany 's 25 million protestants .
" nothing is right in afghanistan " the high-level meeting comes as a response to critical remarks by the bishop in december , when kaessmann said in an interview that the war in afghanistan could not be justified .
at two new year 's church services , she told congregations in berlin and dresden she did not approve of the western strategy in afghanistan , where 4,500 german military personnel are deployed with the international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- .
her comments were described as " naive , " " not helpful , " " unrealistic " - soldiers posted in afghanistan were as angered by the bishop 's views as many german politicians .
the german government - the third-largest force contributor after the united states and britain - is expected to decide whether to commit more troops to stabilizing afghanistan at an international conference in late january on how to assist the country .
opinion polls have repeatedly shown a majority of germans are opposed to the afghan deployment. db / dpa / epd editor : michael lawton michael lawton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

china has massive economic interests in iran , from which the energy-hungry country imports some 15 percent of its oil .
chinese companies have invested millions to tap into the country ’ s oil and gas reserves .
the two regimes are also linked by a similar attitude to the international community .
neither government likes it when the west interferes with what they call their domestic affairs .
they are both extremely intolerant of opposition and ready to use repression to keep it under control .
“ we can assume that the chinese leadership approves the iranian government ’ s measures against the demonstrators , ” says steinbach .
“ the beijing system is still prepared to beat down any resistance . ”
the iranian opposition website www.rahesabz.net , which translates as the green path , thinks that the chinese government is actively helping the iranian authorities to repress protests by providing weapons and vehicles .
bloggers have posted photos to illustrate these allegations , which tehran has rejected as being western fakes .
chinese dissidents support iranian opposition whilst the regimes are thought to be working together , dissidents in both countries are also connected by the internet .
the iranian opposition movement has received many messages of support via the twitter-based “ china4iran ” group for example .
“ since june , we ’ ve been following really closely because we feel the iranian people are in a similar position as the chinese , ” explains one activist , who refused to be named .
“ what they did is very courageous - they showed us courage by being willing to stand up to the regime and demand what they actually want .
they want to be fully represented in this country .
that ’ s what we want here exactly in china . “ a spokesperson from the chinese foreign ministry said at the beginning of china ’ s un security council presidency that the government hoped iranian society would remain unified and stable .
in january , there is likely to be little talk about international negotiations on iran ’ s nuclear programme .
tehran has more pressing things to attend - it hopes to get iran 's opposition movement under control .

but experts say counterterrorism wo n't work without addressing yemen 's other woes . concerns are mounting about terrorism in yemen since the botched attempted bombing of a us airliner on christmas day .
us president barack obama has said al-qaeda 's offshoot in yemen was behind the failed attacks .
the issue was on the agenda when the german foreign minister , guido westerwelle , made a surprise visit to yemen on monday at the end of his middle east tour .
as washington ramps up its counterterrorism role in yemen and raises pressure on the government in sanaa to crack down on islamic extremists , some say that a single-minded focus on military force is deeply flawed .
" the united states and other western powers need to provide long-term economic development to reduce poverty and raise educational standards , " yemen 's foreign minister abu bakr al-qirbi said in an interview with the washington post last week .
that , he said , would help combat terrorism " in a more effective fashion than just using military force . "
that view is echoed by international aid agencies working on the ground in yemen , the arab world 's most impoverished nation .
bildunterschrift : experts warn against focusing solely on military means to fight terrorism " poverty is n't the only explanation for terrorism .
but it 's true that yemen 's extensive social and economic pressures contribute to making the country unstable - and thus make it easier for terrorist organizations to exploit people 's grievances and recruit them , " felix eikenberg , head of germany 's friedrich ebert political foundation in the capital sanaa , told deutsche welle .
germany , whose aid involvement in yemen dates back 40 years , is one of europe 's biggest donors to yemen .
massive social and economic pressures home to around 24 million people , yemen is grappling with one of the world 's highest population growth rates , rapidly depleting groundwater levels , and an unemployment rate of more than 20 percent .
the country 's economy is in tatters as it runs out of its meager oil reserves . " some 70 percent of the state 's revenues currently come from oil .
but oil reserves are dwindling so rapidly that we estimate yemen could become an oil importer in ten years , " eikenberg said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yemen faces a lethal cocktail of social and demographic problems total oil production has slumped from about 440,000 barrels per day in 2001 to 300,000 last year , according to the us energy information administration .
all that has contributed to widespread poverty in the country .
children suffer from a 50 percent malnutrition rate ; more than 40 percent of yemenis live below the poverty line , 18 percent on less than a dollar a day .
germany a major donor given the magnitude of its problems , yemen receives comparatively little per-capita international aid .
the world bank and the imf play an important role in financing yemen 's fragile economy .
the handful of bilateral donors to yemen include the netherlands , the us , japan and britain , germany remains one of the largest european players with annual aid amounting to about 37 million euros .
aid for 2009 and 2010 has been budgeted at 79 million euros .
much of it is focused on easing yemen 's severe water shortage , boosting primary education in the country - yemen had a literacy rate of 40 percent in 2007 - and helping diversify its oil-dominated economy .
zoe nautre , an expert at the berlin-based german council on foreign relations who spent a year in yemen reviewing german government aid efforts , said germany enjoyed excellent relations with the yemeni government .
" germany is often apolitical because it provides a lot of good technical assistance in yemen , particularly in the water sector , and does n't appear to be meddling in yemen 's affairs .
so , germany is well trusted in sanaa , " she told deutsche welle .
failure of governance but others point out that aid money is most needed to help tackle the failure of yemen 's corrupt government to maintain control over remote regions in the strife-torn country - which in turn is exacerbating yemen 's security woes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yemen remains a loosely-governed country under president saleh " one of the major reasons al qaeda is so strong in yemen is because the government is so weak , " guido steinberg , an expert on international terrorism and political developments in the gulf region at the berlin-based german institute for international and security affairs told deutsche welle .
" president ali abdullah saleh 's government is losing legitimacy - it 's not just failing to provide its own citizens with basic things such as water and jobs but is also losing control over vast swathes of the country . "
president saleh is facing a rebellion in the north , a secessionist movement in the south and growing islamic terrorism .
expert urges caution experts say that in addition to equipping and training yemen 's security forces to combat terrorism , the country needs a long-term development strategy - that means not just aid in areas such as education , health and infrastructure , but an inclusive politics .
" development policy in yemen has no meaning if it is n't embedded in a political strategy , " steinberg said .
eickenberg , whose organization is involved in democratization and reforming yemen 's political institutions , said western nations meeting at a yemen conference in london later this month needed to focus on promoting better governance , fighting corruption and nudging yemen to solve its northern conflict - with the help of its influential neighbor saudi arabia .
but nautre urged caution in drafting any future western strategy on yemen .
" western involvement in yemen can easily backfire because the population is very wary and there 's a strong anti-american sentiment there , " nautre said .
" the most important thing is for the west not to be seen as interfering in yemen from outside so that the people do n't turn against you and run into the arms of extremist groups . "

defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg has invited her to visit the troops . bishop margot kaessmann and karl-theodor zu guttenberg agreed during their half-hour meeting on monday that there should be a broader public debate on the german bundeswehr 's mission in afghanistan , as well as a strengthened civil commitment .

heike groos joined up as a doctor but eventually found out that she was also expected to be a soldier , an experience that had long-lasting effects . when heike groos joined the bundeswehr as a doctor more than 20 years ago , she confesses it was just because she was looking for a job .
back in 1987 , when she started working as an emergency medical officer in a germany army hospital , she was still only a doctor .
that changed when she was sent to afghanistan in 2002 .
she became a doctor - and a soldier .
when groos was sent out to afghanistan , she did so without any question and without any concern .
even when it became obvious that she was now both a doctor and a soldier , armed with a weapon to protect her patients if necessary , she knew that this is what service in afghanistan was like .
it was as much part of the job as helping comrades and afghans alike as part of an emergency military ambulance team .
" at the beginning , in 2002 , it was a completely satisfying job , " she says .
" each moment made me think that we were doing something meaningful there .
just being there symbolized to the people that there was peace and that we would ensure that it remained that way , through our medical and humanitarian work there . "
suicide attack changes everything bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heike groos was first on the scene at the bomb blast but the positive feelings did not endure .
the situation changed dramatically with a suicide attack on a bus carrying german soldiers in june 2003 .
six bundeswehr troops were killed and 29 were injured , some seriously .
heike groos was one of the first on the scene ; she bandaged wounds , called for assistance , coordinated the medical efforts , comforted the injured and watched comrades die .
the event and the huge shock changed her and her colleagues ' lives forever .
" after that first suicide attack in june 2003 , we changed and we became deeply , deeply distrustful because we could not at all differentiate between the people , " she says .
" who is taliban and who is not , who is good and who is bad ? that was never clear to me . "
as well as suspicion and caution , heike groos says she felt rage ; rage against the taliban who had carried out the attack , rage against afghanistan , and rage against germany - the country which had sent her there .
she and her comrades also withdrew from the people they were supposed to be helping .
" we withdrew ourselves and wanted nothing do to with anything afghan , " she admits .
" it was because we saw those that we had come to help as those who had attacked us .
this perspective shifted in time , and we recognized that those who were friendly before still were but we were always more cautious after that .
i was never as trusting again . "
disillusionment leads to decision to leave bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : groos decided that her 2007 tour would be her last after the attack , her unit became closer , even more like a family than before .
her younger male comrades looked for comfort and assurance from the older , more experienced heike groos .
but there was no comfort for her .
groos started to see little sense in what she was doing , confined and isolated in the base due to the increasing dangers outside .
she decided that it could not go on .
she returned to afghanistan for the last time in 2007 .
groos says that people could not understand why she went back but she says she wanted to complete her service .
" people looked at me like i was an alien when i walked out of our house in my uniform , " she says .
" i was never at home and people asked my children , ' where is your mother ? ' and they would say ' she is in afghanistan ' . "
when she returned , people would stay out of her way .
her second husband also did n't understand and eventually he and groos divorced .
it was then that she decided that she wanted to leave everything behind and take her children to the other side of the world to start again .
she and three of her five kids moved to new zealand , as far away from afghanistan and germany as possible in order to find peace .
distance does n't end afghanistan trauma bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the horrors of aghanistan have never left heike groos but afghanistan did not release her from its grip .
groos continued to suffer from her experiences , suffering from nightmares and the inability to sleep .
she was also cut off from any kind of support from her previous employer : the bundeswehr .
" i had fulfilled my obligation -lrb- to the bundeswehr -rrb- and i found that very hard , " she says .
" i wish that someone had supported me and had not left me alone , but that did not happen , and i am sad about it .
they pushed me away , sent me to the army physician , to the psychiatrist who said ' you are traumatized . '
and then german people said : ' you were probably not hard enough , soldiers must always be tough . " '
while things were difficult for a long while , in time they also started to get better for heike groos and she began dealing with her experiences in afghanistan and working through her experiences .
the result was her first book , published last year , based on her time there : ' a beautiful day to die ' .

heike groos joined up as a doctor but eventually found out that she was also expected to be a soldier , an experience that had long-lasting effects . when heike groos joined the bundeswehr as a doctor more than 20 years ago , she confesses it was just because she was looking for a job .
back in 1987 , when she started working as an emergency medical officer in a germany army hospital , she was still only a doctor .
that changed when she was sent to afghanistan in 2002 .
she became a doctor - and a soldier .
when groos was sent out to afghanistan , she did so without any question and without any concern .
even when it became obvious that she was now both a doctor and a soldier , armed with a weapon to protect her patients if necessary , she knew that this is what service in afghanistan was like .
it was as much part of the job as helping comrades and afghans alike as part of an emergency military ambulance team .
" at the beginning , in 2002 , it was a completely satisfying job , " she says .
" each moment made me think that we were doing something meaningful there .
just being there symbolized to the people that there was peace and that we would ensure that it remained that way , through our medical and humanitarian work there . "
suicide attack changes everything bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heike groos was first on the scene at the bomb blast but the positive feelings did not endure .
the situation changed dramatically with a suicide attack on a bus carrying german soldiers in june 2003 .
six bundeswehr troops were killed and 29 were injured , some seriously .
heike groos was one of the first on the scene ; she bandaged wounds , called for assistance , coordinated the medical efforts , comforted the injured and watched comrades die .
the event and the huge shock changed her and her colleagues ' lives forever .
" after that first suicide attack in june 2003 , we changed and we became deeply , deeply distrustful because we could not at all differentiate between the people , " she says .
" who is taliban and who is not , who is good and who is bad ? that was never clear to me . "
as well as suspicion and caution , heike groos says she felt rage ; rage against the taliban who had carried out the attack , rage against afghanistan , and rage against germany - the country which had sent her there .
she and her comrades also withdrew from the people they were supposed to be helping .
" we withdrew ourselves and wanted nothing do to with anything afghan , " she admits .
" it was because we saw those that we had come to help as those who had attacked us .
this perspective shifted in time , and we recognized that those who were friendly before still were but we were always more cautious after that .
i was never as trusting again . "
disillusionment leads to decision to leave bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : groos decided that her 2007 tour would be her last after the attack , her unit became closer , even more like a family than before .
her younger male comrades looked for comfort and assurance from the older , more experienced heike groos .
but there was no comfort for her .
groos started to see little sense in what she was doing , confined and isolated in the base due to the increasing dangers outside .
she decided that it could not go on .
she returned to afghanistan for the last time in 2007 .
groos says that people could not understand why she went back but she says she wanted to complete her service .
" people looked at me like i was an alien when i walked out of our house in my uniform , " she says .
" i was never at home and people asked my children , ' where is your mother ? ' and they would say ' she is in afghanistan ' . "
when she returned , people would stay out of her way .
her second husband also did n't understand and eventually he and groos divorced .
it was then that she decided that she wanted to leave everything behind and take her children to the other side of the world to start again .
she and three of her five kids moved to new zealand , as far away from afghanistan and germany as possible in order to find peace .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de soccer -pipe- 11.01.2010 european footballers express concern , criticism after africa cup shooting großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the africa cup has gone ahead , but questions are being asked about security concern for african teammates and worries about safety at the world cup were the main reactions of european footballers following the deadly attack on togo 's national team .
and debates about safety are sure to continue . like all europe 's major football leagues , the german bundesliga has a number of players competing in the africa cup of nations in angola .
the first priority for clubs when the news of the attack broke was to contact their players and offer to fly them out of africa .
hanover , for example , were concerned about their tunisian defender karim haggui .
" karim told our sports directorship that he feels safe right now , " hanover spokesman andreas kundt told the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung newspaper .
three members of the togolese delegation were killed on friday when separatist rebels in an angolan enclave opened fire on the team bus .
a reserve goalkeeper had to be flown to south africa for emergency treatment for life-threatening gunshot wounds .
the togolese team subsequently quit the tournament and flew home .
bildunterschrift : the togolese team was flown home over the weekend " i was afraid for my life , " togolese defender assimiou toure , who plays for bayer leverkusen , told reporters .
" all i could do was jump under my seat and pray . "
thus far , no african player has asked his german club to get him out of angola .
but the shooting has occasioned furious debate about both the africa cup and safety in general on the continent ahead of the world 's premier soccer event .
relative safety ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany keeper rene adler has said he 's worried about the world cup in south africa international football functionaries , from fifa president sepp blatter on down , have been quick to offer assurances that the shooting in angola did not mean that this summer 's world cup in south africa would be unsafe .
" the measures taken for the africa cup are not comparable with those for a football world cup , which are planned years in advance , " german world cup advisor horst r. schmidt told the frankfurter rundschau newspaper .
indeed , south africa and angola are very different countries .
still , some likely members of the german national team at the world cup said they were worried .
" it 's completely sick , " germany 's top goalkeeper rene adler told the bild am sonntag newspaper .
" i have to ask how they 're going to ensure security at the world cup .
i 'm sure we 'll be safe as a team , but what about family members ? "
other team members had comparable reactions .
' when you hear something like that , you do a double take and start thinking , " germany midfielder bastian schweinsteiger told the sid sports news agency .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : otto pfister coached in africa for four decades german coach otto pfister , who spent most of his career working in africa and who coached the togolese team at the 2006 world cup , offered a more first-hand view .
he said that the world cup would not be especially risky but that different standards applied to africa .
" the security measures are , of course , not comparable with those in germany , " pfister said in an interview with sid .
" in this area , just as in the economy , we 're talking about developing countries .
and the distances are enormous .
how can they be expected to keep all of such vast distances completely under control ? "
hard choices bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stuttgart 's arthur boka -lrb- right -rrb- is one of the bundesliga players competing in angola the attack has focused attention on a number of issues , both for football and society in general .
for instance , pfister is among those who have criticized the togolese decision to withdraw from the tournament , which was ordered by togo 's prime minister .
he has said togo 's pull-out will only encourage extremist groups in angola , and he fears that wrong precedents could be set .
" the africa cup is a spectacular event for africans , one that 's almost more important than the world cup , " pfister told sid .
" you ca n't cancel events like these .
you quickly put yourself in a position where you can be blackmailed . "
in the purely sporting realm , though , the attack has caused football managers outside africa to question the africa cup .
clubs throughout europe were never happy about being forced to allow their employees to take part in the biennial event , and friday 's incident has fuelled arguments that the rules need to be changed .
borussia dortmund sports director michael zorc says teams should have the right to make decisions based on players ' safety .
" until that becomes the case , we ca n't bring our players back because they would then be suspended , " zorc told the frankfurter allegeimeine zeitung .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the shooting has been a huge blow for african football stuttgart commercial manager horst heldt , whose defender arthur boka plays for ivory coast , feels much the same way .
" the ideal thing for me would be if arthur could just come back , " heldt told the same paper .
ultimately , the attack on togo 's national team is going to force everyone concerned to take a realistic look at where africa and international football fit together .
fifa 's decision to award south africa the world cup was a bold and inclusive gesture , intended to signal that the world 's poorest continent was a full-fledged member in the global soccer community .
experts like pfister know that there are risks attached to that decision , but argue that those risks should not be allowed to overshadow all other aspects of the world 's biggest sporting event .
that will surely be one of the main topics of discussion for the duration of the africa cup and in the run-up to the world cup in south africa .

and debates about safety are sure to continue . like all europe 's major football leagues , the german bundesliga has a number of players competing in the africa cup of nations in angola .
the first priority for clubs when the news of the attack broke was to contact their players and offer to fly them out of africa .
hanover , for example , were concerned about their tunisian defender karim haggui .
" karim told our sports directorship that he feels safe right now , " hanover spokesman andreas kundt told the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung newspaper .
three members of the togolese delegation were killed on friday when separatist rebels in an angolan enclave opened fire on the team bus .
a reserve goalkeeper had to be flown to south africa for emergency treatment for life-threatening gunshot wounds .
the togolese team subsequently quit the tournament and flew home .
bildunterschrift : the togolese team was flown home over the weekend " i was afraid for my life , " togolese defender assimiou toure , who plays for bayer leverkusen , told reporters .
" all i could do was jump under my seat and pray . "
thus far , no african player has asked his german club to get him out of angola .
but the shooting has occasioned furious debate about both the africa cup and safety in general on the continent ahead of the world 's premier soccer event .
relative safety ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany keeper rene adler has said he 's worried about the world cup in south africa international football functionaries , from fifa president sepp blatter on down , have been quick to offer assurances that the shooting in angola did not mean that this summer 's world cup in south africa would be unsafe .
" the measures taken for the africa cup are not comparable with those for a football world cup , which are planned years in advance , " german world cup advisor horst r. schmidt told the frankfurter rundschau newspaper .
indeed , south africa and angola are very different countries .
still , some likely members of the german national team at the world cup said they were worried .
" it 's completely sick , " germany 's top goalkeeper rene adler told the bild am sonntag newspaper .
" i have to ask how they 're going to ensure security at the world cup .
i 'm sure we 'll be safe as a team , but what about family members ? "
other team members had comparable reactions .
' when you hear something like that , you do a double take and start thinking , " germany midfielder bastian schweinsteiger told the sid sports news agency .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : otto pfister coached in africa for four decades german coach otto pfister , who spent most of his career working in africa and who coached the togolese team at the 2006 world cup , offered a more first-hand view .
he said that the world cup would not be especially risky but that different standards applied to africa .
" the security measures are , of course , not comparable with those in germany , " pfister said in an interview with sid .
" in this area , just as in the economy , we 're talking about developing countries .
and the distances are enormous .
how can they be expected to keep all of such vast distances completely under control ? "
hard choices bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stuttgart 's arthur boka -lrb- right -rrb- is one of the bundesliga players competing in angola the attack has focused attention on a number of issues , both for football and society in general .
for instance , pfister is among those who have criticized the togolese decision to withdraw from the tournament , which was ordered by togo 's prime minister .
he has said togo 's pull-out will only encourage extremist groups in angola , and he fears that wrong precedents could be set .
" the africa cup is a spectacular event for africans , one that 's almost more important than the world cup , " pfister told sid .
" you ca n't cancel events like these .
you quickly put yourself in a position where you can be blackmailed . "
in the purely sporting realm , though , the attack has caused football managers outside africa to question the africa cup .
clubs throughout europe were never happy about being forced to allow their employees to take part in the biennial event , and friday 's incident has fuelled arguments that the rules need to be changed .
borussia dortmund sports director michael zorc says teams should have the right to make decisions based on players ' safety .
" until that becomes the case , we ca n't bring our players back because they would then be suspended , " zorc told the frankfurter allegeimeine zeitung .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the shooting has been a huge blow for african football stuttgart commercial manager horst heldt , whose defender arthur boka plays for ivory coast , feels much the same way .
" the ideal thing for me would be if arthur could just come back , " heldt told the same paper .
ultimately , the attack on togo 's national team is going to force everyone concerned to take a realistic look at where africa and international football fit together .
fifa 's decision to award south africa the world cup was a bold and inclusive gesture , intended to signal that the world 's poorest continent was a full-fledged member in the global soccer community .
experts like pfister know that there are risks attached to that decision , but argue that those risks should not be allowed to overshadow all other aspects of the world 's biggest sporting event .
that will surely be one of the main topics of discussion for the duration of the africa cup and in the run-up to the world cup in south africa .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany keeper rene adler has said he 's worried about the world cup in south africa international football functionaries , from fifa president sepp blatter on down , have been quick to offer assurances that the shooting in angola did not mean that this summer 's world cup in south africa would be unsafe .
" the measures taken for the africa cup are not comparable with those for a football world cup , which are planned years in advance , " german world cup advisor horst r. schmidt told the frankfurter rundschau newspaper .
indeed , south africa and angola are very different countries .
still , some likely members of the german national team at the world cup said they were worried .
" it 's completely sick , " germany 's top goalkeeper rene adler told the bild am sonntag newspaper .
" i have to ask how they 're going to ensure security at the world cup .
i 'm sure we 'll be safe as a team , but what about family members ? "
other team members had comparable reactions .
' when you hear something like that , you do a double take and start thinking , " germany midfielder bastian schweinsteiger told the sid sports news agency .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : otto pfister coached in africa for four decades german coach otto pfister , who spent most of his career working in africa and who coached the togolese team at the 2006 world cup , offered a more first-hand view .
he said that the world cup would not be especially risky but that different standards applied to africa .
" the security measures are , of course , not comparable with those in germany , " pfister said in an interview with sid .
" in this area , just as in the economy , we 're talking about developing countries .
and the distances are enormous .
how can they be expected to keep all of such vast distances completely under control ? "
hard choices bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stuttgart 's arthur boka -lrb- right -rrb- is one of the bundesliga players competing in angola the attack has focused attention on a number of issues , both for football and society in general .
for instance , pfister is among those who have criticized the togolese decision to withdraw from the tournament , which was ordered by togo 's prime minister .
he has said togo 's pull-out will only encourage extremist groups in angola , and he fears that wrong precedents could be set .
" the africa cup is a spectacular event for africans , one that 's almost more important than the world cup , " pfister told sid .
" you ca n't cancel events like these .
you quickly put yourself in a position where you can be blackmailed . "
in the purely sporting realm , though , the attack has caused football managers outside africa to question the africa cup .
clubs throughout europe were never happy about being forced to allow their employees to take part in the biennial event , and friday 's incident has fuelled arguments that the rules need to be changed .
borussia dortmund sports director michael zorc says teams should have the right to make decisions based on players ' safety .
" until that becomes the case , we ca n't bring our players back because they would then be suspended , " zorc told the frankfurter allegeimeine zeitung .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the shooting has been a huge blow for african football stuttgart commercial manager horst heldt , whose defender arthur boka plays for ivory coast , feels much the same way .
" the ideal thing for me would be if arthur could just come back , " heldt told the same paper .
ultimately , the attack on togo 's national team is going to force everyone concerned to take a realistic look at where africa and international football fit together .
fifa 's decision to award south africa the world cup was a bold and inclusive gesture , intended to signal that the world 's poorest continent was a full-fledged member in the global soccer community .
experts like pfister know that there are risks attached to that decision , but argue that those risks should not be allowed to overshadow all other aspects of the world 's biggest sporting event .
that will surely be one of the main topics of discussion for the duration of the africa cup and in the run-up to the world cup in south africa .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 11.01.2010 ashton faces tough questions from european parliament großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ashton has been nominated for a top job in the eu commission .
catherine ashton can expect tough questions in her confirmation hearing to become the eu 's first foreign policy tchief .
will her negotiating skills compensate for her lack of foreign policy experience ? catherine ashton , the 53-year-old former european union trade commissioner and leader of britain 's house of lords , was expected to face intensive questioning at the european commission confirmation hearings , which began in brussels on monday .
ashton was nominated for the post of high representative for foreign affairs and security policy by eu heads of state at a summit last november , but must still be confirmed by parliament .
a surprise pick although ashton has long been regarded as an industry expert , her nomination for the newly-created post of eu foreign affairs minister came as a surprise .
the native of lancashire , england , has served only one year as eu trade commissioner and has no other foreign policy experience .
even in her native britain , ashton is virtually unknown , having never been elected to public office .
her past work experience includes posts in a provincial health authority , as well as positions in a number of government departments , including the education and justice ministries .
in 1999 , the labour government of then-prime minister tony blair awarded ashton the title of “ baroness , ” so that she could represent the party in the house of lords . in 2007 , current prime minister gordon brown appointed her leader of the house of lords .
however , ashton 's big break came in 2008 , when the post of eu trade commissioner became free and ashton became the first woman to hold the office .
hard questions during monday 's confirmation hearing , ashton is expected to have to defend herself against accusations of inadequate diplomatic experience .
also likely to come up during questioning : ashton 's past involvement with britain 's anti-nuclear group , the campaign for nuclear disarmament -lrb- cnd -rrb- .
during the initial round of questioning in november , the nominee for foreign affairs chief was challenged to deny taking funds from the soviet union during her days as treasurer for the cnd over 25 years ago .
all or nothing ashton will be among the first of 26 new appointees to go through the confirmation process in the european parliament . the hearings are scheduled to end on january 19 , with the parliament 's final vote of confidence on the new commission to take place january 26 in brussels .
although parliamentarians can not vote to approve or deny individual appointees , they can vote to reject the commission as a whole .
if approved , the new team is expected to begin its five-year term on february 1. smh / afp / rtre editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" based on his talks in the gulf , westerwelle made the quick decision to go to yemen and get a sense of the situation on the ground , " a member of the german delegation told reporters .
destabilization " spreads terror " the foreign minister was concerned that destablilization in yemen could help fuel the spread of terrorism , the official said .
westerwelle has previously warned that yemen is a sanctuary for terrorists .
after informing european allies and washington of his visit , he is believed to have delivered a message calling for stable government in the country .
yemen is under scrutiny after it was revealed that umar farouk abdulmutallab , the nigerian man who allegedly tried to blow up a us-bound jet on christmas day , prepared for his mission in yemen .
call to deal with disputes the official said that westerwelle would also " press for good governance , " try to address the issue of corruption in yemen and call for dialogue to resolve internal disputes .
the government is engaged in conflicts with separatists in the north and south of the country , as well as with al-qaeda militants .
germany is the biggest european contributor of aid to yemen by far , with about 79 million euros -lrb- $ 114 million -rrb- set aside for the country for 2010 to 2011 .
the country is the poorest on the arabian peninsula .
following talks , westerwelle said that the yemeni government had revealed that it knew the whereabouts of five germans , including three children , who were kidnapped in the country six months ago. rc / afp / reuters / dpa / apn editor : chuck penfold charles duguid penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

one of those women is stefanie linsener whose time with the bundeswehr has included a four-month tour in afghanistan . stefanie linsener has never met tanja kreil .
but linsener , a soldier in the bundeswehr , is grateful for kreil 's fight for women like her .
in 2000 kreil won an amendment to germany 's constitution from the court of justice of the european union allowing women to take part in bundeswehr 's armed services .
up until that point they had been limited to working in the medical service or the military band .
without tanja kreil , there never would have been bundeswehr soldier stefanie linsener .
one year after the january 11 , 2000 ruling , the 18-year-old linsener joined the bundeswehr and became one of the first women trained to use weapons .

linsener has a well-kept appearance and she wears jewelry when she 's working in her office .
linsener likes to laugh .
but when she , six other women and 60 male recruits had to crawl through the mud and dig out a position with a 30-kilogram -lrb- 66-pound -rrb- pack on her back and a 12-kilogram machine gun , she was n't laughing .
sometimes she wondered what the point of the exercises was , but through them she learned what her mental and physical limits were .
and she found the motivation to keep going .
" i said to myself , ' shut your eyes and get through it .

" women and men are treated equally , including with their salaries , " fischer says .

she and her fellow soldiers worked 13 to 14 hours a day in afghanistan for four months without a day off .
spending every day armed and in a flak vest and only seeing a country from behind the safety glass in her tank taught linsener to appreciate her life in germany .
female soldiers do find it difficult to gain recognition in a male-dominated country like afghanistan , where women are hardly seen in public , she says .

one of those women is stefanie linsener whose time with the bundeswehr has included a four-month tour in afghanistan . stefanie linsener has never met tanja kreil .
but linsener , a soldier in the bundeswehr , is grateful for kreil 's fight for women like her .
in 2000 kreil won an amendment to germany 's constitution from the court of justice of the european union allowing women to take part in bundeswehr 's armed services .
up until that point they had been limited to working in the medical service or the military band .
without tanja kreil , there never would have been bundeswehr soldier stefanie linsener .
one year after the january 11 , 2000 ruling , the 18-year-old linsener joined the bundeswehr and became one of the first women trained to use weapons .
" my father was really proud of me , " she says .
" my mother had some misgivings , but she is also proud of me , of course , that i did it . " diving into an unknown world bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : linsener shows off the different types of uniforms she wears at first linsener had to get used to the drills and the tone her superiors use when speaking to her .
and she found her uniform practical but rather unfashionable " for a woman who pays attention to herself . "
linsener has a well-kept appearance and she wears jewelry when she 's working in her office .
linsener likes to laugh .
but when she , six other women and 60 male recruits had to crawl through the mud and dig out a position with a 30-kilogram -lrb- 66-pound -rrb- pack on her back and a 12-kilogram machine gun , she was n't laughing .
sometimes she wondered what the point of the exercises was , but through them she learned what her mental and physical limits were .
and she found the motivation to keep going .
" i said to myself , ' shut your eyes and get through it .
you 're doing this now , " ' she recounts .
" i think it 's true that women are a little bit more ambitious and have more willpower .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : men and women are treated the same in the bundeswehr , major fischer says major juergen fischer can only confirm linsener 's observations .
it 's been his experience , he said , that the female soldiers inspire the male recruits .
it 's only a matter of time , he says , before a woman is promoted to major or lieutenant colonel .
" women and men are treated equally , including with their salaries , " fischer says .
however , unlike men , women can not be required to participate in the armed services .
thus there is no conscription for female soldiers while german men are still required to serve in the bundeswehr or complete community service .
deployment a part of the job linsener can assemble her gun while blindfolded .
she knows that it 's a device that can kill but that 's part of being in the army , she says .
another part of being in the army for linsener was a four-month deployment in afghanistan .
she and her fellow soldiers worked 13 to 14 hours a day in afghanistan for four months without a day off .
spending every day armed and in a flak vest and only seeing a country from behind the safety glass in her tank taught linsener to appreciate her life in germany .
female soldiers do find it difficult to gain recognition in a male-dominated country like afghanistan , where women are hardly seen in public , she says .
when she once naively left the camp with her hair loose and uncovered , stones were thrown at her .
" this is like a woman in germany running around naked in the street , " she says she was later told . " helmet , combat boots and camouflage ready to go of those serving in the armed forces , about 17,000 or nine percent are women .
linsener was one those troops for nine years .
now she has another two years of office work responding to press inquiries as fischer 's assistant .

his post will be filled by trade and industry minister arlene foster . robinson agreed to the move on monday so that the scandal surrounding his wife 's affair could be settled .
calls for robinson 's resignation escalated over the weekend , as several key politicians feared his wife 's scandal could cause the region 's power-sharing executive to collapse .
robinson 's wife iris , who is also a top politician , admitted to having an affair with a 19-year-old man last week .
she also said she helped to raise 50,000 pounds -lrb- 55,600 euros -rrb- from two wealthy developers for him so he could set up his own café .
iris robinson is expected to leave her seats in the northern ireland assembly and the british house of commons shortly .
she is also receiving psychiatric treatment in belfast , as she has previously admitted to attempting suicide and suffering severe depression .
peter robinson has maintained that he had absolutely no knowledge of his wife 's affair or the financial deal between her and the 19-year-old .
bad timing the robinson scandal has come in the midst of a power-sharing struggle between the protestant democratic unionist party -lrb- dup -rrb- and the catholic sinn fein .
the former foes are finding it hard to hold their alliance together , as both sides have failed to agree on whether policing powers should be transferred from london to belfast .
" we have a political crisis in any case , we did n't need this to be in the middle of it , " said sinn fein police and justice spokesperson gerry kelly .

vw wants its cars to escape their niche status and hit the mass market . just prior to the opening of the annual detroit auto show on monday , german carmaker volkswagen announced it plans for ramping up its presence in the united states , aiming to win over american consumers and sell twice the number of cars it does now in three to four years ' time .
" we will sell 400,000 to 450,000 vehicles in 2012/13 , " said stefan jacoby , head of volkswagen of america , on sunday , adding that the company 's us business could become profitable by 2013 . volkswagen , europe 's largest carmaker , has had a hard time finding its footing in the all-important us market .
its presence in china and brazil is strong and sales in germany have been helped by a government program last year that encouraged drivers to trade in old gas guzzlers for more for efficient cars .
in europe , vw has 21 percent of the market .
but vw market share in the us , including its audi brand , is only three percent .
part of the reason for that , according to analysts , has to do with the generally dismal state of the car industry in the wake of global recession .
although , vw 's small market share actually gave it a bit of a foot up since it was not as hard hit by the collapse of american auto sales as some of its rivals were .
american preferences bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vw has been trying to figure out how to fit the pieces together for the us market vw 's lackluster performance can also be traced back to its product line , which was not ideally suited to americans ' taste in cars .
" volkswagen was neither a premium brand like mercedes , nor a mass-market brand , " said marc tonn , a senior analyst at m.m. warburg .
" the company was kind of stuck in the middle . "
the wolfsburg-based concern focused on smaller or mid-size cars with highly advanced technological features when americans were more interested in buying larger vehicles , such as suvs or pick-up trucks .
" i think the focus will now be on maintaining german quality , but going a little in the direction of us size , " tonn added .
nevertheless , vw will not likely be turning out tank-like vehicles any time soon .
jacoby said he expects the market for compact and mid-sized sedans to increase faster than other segments , especially if oil prices convince more americans to downsize from their chevy tahoes and ford explorers .
" with higher oil prices , the us consumer is perhaps going to look a little more closely at smaller cars , " said christian breitsprecher , an auto analyst at sol oppenheim . from the niche to the masses volkswagen , which ranks behind brands like hyundai , honda , mercedes and bmw in the us , wants to emerge from its position as a niche carmaker to a mass-market product , one that can compete with extremely popular makes , such as toyota 's camry .
while the beetle quickly became a cult classic in the us and enjoyed great popularity in the 1960s and early 1970s , vw was never able to imitate its success with subsequent makes , such as its rabbit .
the company closed its last us plant in 1988 in pennsylvania amid sluggish sales .
" the rabbit was a flop and vw never really was able to get back in the mass market after that , " said breitsprecher , who added that volkswagen cars remained niche products .
" i mean , who bought a jetta ?

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : volkswagen beetle - a hit in america but vw wants a follow-up success becoming a mass-market car in the us is essential to vw 's ambitious expansion plans for the coming years , which include surpassing main rival toyota , the world 's largest automaker by sales volume .
new investments volkswagen is building a new plant in chattanooga , tennessee , investing up to $ 1 billion -lrb- 694 million euros -rrb- in a facility that , according to us head jacoby , " will enable the turnaround of vw 's us operations " and should create around 2,000 jobs .
increasing production and purchasing in the dollar zone is crucial to vw 's return to profitability as it would lower the company 's exposure to a dollar that is weak compared to the euro .
the carmaker is also spending $ 125 million on two new dealerships in new york city , which will begin sales in 2010 .
they are part of the company 's strategy to increase its presence and visibility in the us .
jacoby said he thinks the worst of the automobile sector 's woes to be behind them , with american car sales likely to be 11 million to 11.5 million in 2010 .
because of a stabilization of the labor and real-estate markets , " we are a little bit more optimistic now than we were a few months ago , " he said on sunday .
he added that he expects the us car sales to stabilize at around 15 million over the medium term , and vw 's longer-term us plans include selling 800,000 vehicles a year by 2018 .
" the us is a critical component of vw 's long-term strategy , " said analyst tonn .
" despite all the euphoria about emerging markets these days , if you want to be a global player you have to do well in america . "

vw wants its cars to escape their niche status and hit the mass market . just prior to the opening of the annual detroit auto show on monday , german carmaker volkswagen announced it plans for ramping up its presence in the united states , aiming to win over american consumers and sell twice the number of cars it does now in three to four years ' time .
" we will sell 400,000 to 450,000 vehicles in 2012/13 , " said stefan jacoby , head of volkswagen of america , on sunday , adding that the company 's us business could become profitable by 2013 . volkswagen , europe 's largest carmaker , has had a hard time finding its footing in the all-important us market .
its presence in china and brazil is strong and sales in germany have been helped by a government program last year that encouraged drivers to trade in old gas guzzlers for more for efficient cars .
in europe , vw has 21 percent of the market .
but vw market share in the us , including its audi brand , is only three percent .
part of the reason for that , according to analysts , has to do with the generally dismal state of the car industry in the wake of global recession .
although , vw 's small market share actually gave it a bit of a foot up since it was not as hard hit by the collapse of american auto sales as some of its rivals were .
american preferences bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vw has been trying to figure out how to fit the pieces together for the us market vw 's lackluster performance can also be traced back to its product line , which was not ideally suited to americans ' taste in cars .
" volkswagen was neither a premium brand like mercedes , nor a mass-market brand , " said marc tonn , a senior analyst at m.m. warburg .
" the company was kind of stuck in the middle . "
the wolfsburg-based concern focused on smaller or mid-size cars with highly advanced technological features when americans were more interested in buying larger vehicles , such as suvs or pick-up trucks .
" i think the focus will now be on maintaining german quality , but going a little in the direction of us size , " tonn added .
nevertheless , vw will not likely be turning out tank-like vehicles any time soon .
jacoby said he expects the market for compact and mid-sized sedans to increase faster than other segments , especially if oil prices convince more americans to downsize from their chevy tahoes and ford explorers .
" with higher oil prices , the us consumer is perhaps going to look a little more closely at smaller cars , " said christian breitsprecher , an auto analyst at sol oppenheim . from the niche to the masses volkswagen , which ranks behind brands like hyundai , honda , mercedes and bmw in the us , wants to emerge from its position as a niche carmaker to a mass-market product , one that can compete with extremely popular makes , such as toyota 's camry .
while the beetle quickly became a cult classic in the us and enjoyed great popularity in the 1960s and early 1970s , vw was never able to imitate its success with subsequent makes , such as its rabbit .
the company closed its last us plant in 1988 in pennsylvania amid sluggish sales .
" the rabbit was a flop and vw never really was able to get back in the mass market after that , " said breitsprecher , who added that volkswagen cars remained niche products .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : volkswagen beetle - a hit in america but vw wants a follow-up success becoming a mass-market car in the us is essential to vw 's ambitious expansion plans for the coming years , which include surpassing main rival toyota , the world 's largest automaker by sales volume .
new investments volkswagen is building a new plant in chattanooga , tennessee , investing up to $ 1 billion -lrb- 694 million euros -rrb- in a facility that , according to us head jacoby , " will enable the turnaround of vw 's us operations " and should create around 2,000 jobs .
increasing production and purchasing in the dollar zone is crucial to vw 's return to profitability as it would lower the company 's exposure to a dollar that is weak compared to the euro .
the carmaker is also spending $ 125 million on two new dealerships in new york city , which will begin sales in 2010 .
they are part of the company 's strategy to increase its presence and visibility in the us .
jacoby said he thinks the worst of the automobile sector 's woes to be behind them , with american car sales likely to be 11 million to 11.5 million in 2010 .
because of a stabilization of the labor and real-estate markets , " we are a little bit more optimistic now than we were a few months ago , " he said on sunday .
he added that he expects the us car sales to stabilize at around 15 million over the medium term , and vw 's longer-term us plans include selling 800,000 vehicles a year by 2018 .
" the us is a critical component of vw 's long-term strategy , " said analyst tonn .
" despite all the euphoria about emerging markets these days , if you want to be a global player you have to do well in america . "

and debates about safety are sure to continue . like all europe 's major football leagues , the german bundesliga has a number of players competing in the africa cup of nations in angola .
the first priority for clubs when the news of the attack broke was to contact their players and offer to fly them out of africa .
hanover , for example , were concerned about their tunisian defender karim haggui .
" karim told our sports directorship that he feels safe right now , " hanover spokesman andreas kundt told the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung newspaper .
three members of the togolese delegation were killed on friday when separatist rebels in an angolan enclave opened fire on the team bus .
a reserve goalkeeper had to be flown to south africa for emergency treatment for life-threatening gunshot wounds .
the togolese team subsequently quit the tournament and flew home .
bildunterschrift : the togolese team was flown home over the weekend " i was afraid for my life , " togolese defender assimiou toure , who plays for bayer leverkusen , told reporters .
" all i could do was jump under my seat and pray . "
thus far , no african player has asked his german club to get him out of angola .
but the shooting has occasioned furious debate about both the africa cup and safety in general on the continent ahead of the world 's premier soccer event .
relative safety ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany keeper rene adler has said he 's worried about the world cup in south africa international football functionaries , from fifa president sepp blatter on down , have been quick to offer assurances that the shooting in angola did not mean that this summer 's world cup in south africa would be unsafe .
" the measures taken for the africa cup are not comparable with those for a football world cup , which are planned years in advance , " german world cup advisor horst r. schmidt told the frankfurter rundschau newspaper .
indeed , south africa and angola are very different countries .
still , some likely members of the german national team at the world cup said they were worried .
" it 's completely sick , " germany 's top goalkeeper rene adler told the bild am sonntag newspaper .
" i have to ask how they 're going to ensure security at the world cup .
i 'm sure we 'll be safe as a team , but what about family members ? "
other team members had comparable reactions .
' when you hear something like that , you do a double take and start thinking , " germany midfielder bastian schweinsteiger told the sid sports news agency .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : otto pfister coached in africa for four decades german coach otto pfister , who spent most of his career working in africa and who coached the togolese team at the 2006 world cup , offered a more first-hand view .
he said that the world cup would not be especially risky but that different standards applied to africa .
" the security measures are , of course , not comparable with those in germany , " pfister said in an interview with sid .
" in this area , just as in the economy , we 're talking about developing countries .
and the distances are enormous .
how can they be expected to keep all of such vast distances completely under control ? "
hard choices bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stuttgart 's arthur boka -lrb- right -rrb- is one of the bundesliga players competing in angola the attack has focused attention on a number of issues , both for football and society in general .
for instance , pfister is among those who have criticized the togolese decision to withdraw from the tournament , which was ordered by togo 's prime minister .
he has said togo 's pull-out will only encourage extremist groups in angola , and he fears that wrong precedents could be set .
" the africa cup is a spectacular event for africans , one that 's almost more important than the world cup , " pfister told sid .
" you ca n't cancel events like these .
you quickly put yourself in a position where you can be blackmailed . "
in the purely sporting realm , though , the attack has caused football managers outside africa to question the africa cup .
clubs throughout europe were never happy about being forced to allow their employees to take part in the biennial event , and friday 's incident has fuelled arguments that the rules need to be changed .
borussia dortmund sports director michael zorc says teams should have the right to make decisions based on players ' safety .
" until that becomes the case , we ca n't bring our players back because they would then be suspended , " zorc told the frankfurter allegeimeine zeitung .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the shooting has been a huge blow for african football stuttgart commercial manager horst heldt , whose defender arthur boka plays for ivory coast , feels much the same way .
" the ideal thing for me would be if arthur could just come back , " heldt told the same paper .
ultimately , the attack on togo 's national team is going to force everyone concerned to take a realistic look at where africa and international football fit together .
fifa 's decision to award south africa the world cup was a bold and inclusive gesture , intended to signal that the world 's poorest continent was a full-fledged member in the global soccer community .
experts like pfister know that there are risks attached to that decision , but argue that those risks should not be allowed to overshadow all other aspects of the world 's biggest sporting event .
that will surely be one of the main topics of discussion for the duration of the africa cup and in the run-up to the world cup in south africa .

but experts say counterterrorism wo n't work without addressing yemen 's other woes . concerns are mounting about terrorism in yemen since the botched attempted bombing of a us airliner on christmas day .
us president barack obama has said al-qaeda 's offshoot in yemen was behind the failed attacks .
the issue was on the agenda when the german foreign minister , guido westerwelle , made a surprise visit to yemen on monday at the end of his middle east tour .
as washington ramps up its counterterrorism role in yemen and raises pressure on the government in sanaa to crack down on islamic extremists , some say that a single-minded focus on military force is deeply flawed .
" the united states and other western powers need to provide long-term economic development to reduce poverty and raise educational standards , " yemen 's foreign minister abu bakr al-qirbi said in an interview with the washington post last week .
that , he said , would help combat terrorism " in a more effective fashion than just using military force . "
that view is echoed by international aid agencies working on the ground in yemen , the arab world 's most impoverished nation .
bildunterschrift : experts warn against focusing solely on military means to fight terrorism " poverty is n't the only explanation for terrorism .
but it 's true that yemen 's extensive social and economic pressures contribute to making the country unstable - and thus make it easier for terrorist organizations to exploit people 's grievances and recruit them , " felix eikenberg , head of germany 's friedrich ebert political foundation in the capital sanaa , told deutsche welle .
germany , whose aid involvement in yemen dates back 40 years , is one of europe 's biggest donors to yemen .
massive social and economic pressures home to around 24 million people , yemen is grappling with one of the world 's highest population growth rates , rapidly depleting groundwater levels , and an unemployment rate of more than 20 percent .
the country 's economy is in tatters as it runs out of its meager oil reserves . " some 70 percent of the state 's revenues currently come from oil .
but oil reserves are dwindling so rapidly that we estimate yemen could become an oil importer in ten years , " eikenberg said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yemen faces a lethal cocktail of social and demographic problems total oil production has slumped from about 440,000 barrels per day in 2001 to 300,000 last year , according to the us energy information administration .
all that has contributed to widespread poverty in the country .
children suffer from a 50 percent malnutrition rate ; more than 40 percent of yemenis live below the poverty line , 18 percent on less than a dollar a day .
germany a major donor given the magnitude of its problems , yemen receives comparatively little per-capita international aid .
the world bank and the imf play an important role in financing yemen 's fragile economy .
the handful of bilateral donors to yemen include the netherlands , the us , japan and britain , germany remains one of the largest european players with annual aid amounting to about 37 million euros .
aid for 2009 and 2010 has been budgeted at 79 million euros .
much of it is focused on easing yemen 's severe water shortage , boosting primary education in the country - yemen had a literacy rate of 40 percent in 2007 - and helping diversify its oil-dominated economy .
zoe nautre , an expert at the berlin-based german council on foreign relations who spent a year in yemen reviewing german government aid efforts , said germany enjoyed excellent relations with the yemeni government .
" germany is often apolitical because it provides a lot of good technical assistance in yemen , particularly in the water sector , and does n't appear to be meddling in yemen 's affairs .
so , germany is well trusted in sanaa , " she told deutsche welle .
failure of governance but others point out that aid money is most needed to help tackle the failure of yemen 's corrupt government to maintain control over remote regions in the strife-torn country - which in turn is exacerbating yemen 's security woes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yemen remains a loosely-governed country under president saleh " one of the major reasons al qaeda is so strong in yemen is because the government is so weak , " guido steinberg , an expert on international terrorism and political developments in the gulf region at the berlin-based german institute for international and security affairs told deutsche welle .
" president ali abdullah saleh 's government is losing legitimacy - it 's not just failing to provide its own citizens with basic things such as water and jobs but is also losing control over vast swathes of the country . "
president saleh is facing a rebellion in the north , a secessionist movement in the south and growing islamic terrorism .
expert urges caution experts say that in addition to equipping and training yemen 's security forces to combat terrorism , the country needs a long-term development strategy - that means not just aid in areas such as education , health and infrastructure , but an inclusive politics .
" development policy in yemen has no meaning if it is n't embedded in a political strategy , " steinberg said .
eickenberg , whose organization is involved in democratization and reforming yemen 's political institutions , said western nations meeting at a yemen conference in london later this month needed to focus on promoting better governance , fighting corruption and nudging yemen to solve its northern conflict - with the help of its influential neighbor saudi arabia .
but nautre urged caution in drafting any future western strategy on yemen .
" western involvement in yemen can easily backfire because the population is very wary and there 's a strong anti-american sentiment there , " nautre said .
" the most important thing is for the west not to be seen as interfering in yemen from outside so that the people do n't turn against you and run into the arms of extremist groups . "

but it 's true that yemen 's extensive social and economic pressures contribute to making the country unstable - and thus make it easier for terrorist organizations to exploit people 's grievances and recruit them , " felix eikenberg , head of germany 's friedrich ebert political foundation in the capital sanaa , told deutsche welle .
germany , whose aid involvement in yemen dates back 40 years , is one of europe 's biggest donors to yemen .
massive social and economic pressures home to around 24 million people , yemen is grappling with one of the world 's highest population growth rates , rapidly depleting groundwater levels , and an unemployment rate of more than 20 percent .
the country 's economy is in tatters as it runs out of its meager oil reserves . " some 70 percent of the state 's revenues currently come from oil .
but oil reserves are dwindling so rapidly that we estimate yemen could become an oil importer in ten years , " eikenberg said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yemen faces a lethal cocktail of social and demographic problems total oil production has slumped from about 440,000 barrels per day in 2001 to 300,000 last year , according to the us energy information administration .
all that has contributed to widespread poverty in the country .
children suffer from a 50 percent malnutrition rate ; more than 40 percent of yemenis live below the poverty line , 18 percent on less than a dollar a day .
germany a major donor given the magnitude of its problems , yemen receives comparatively little per-capita international aid .
the world bank and the imf play an important role in financing yemen 's fragile economy .
the handful of bilateral donors to yemen include the netherlands , the us , japan and britain , germany remains one of the largest european players with annual aid amounting to about 37 million euros .
aid for 2009 and 2010 has been budgeted at 79 million euros .
much of it is focused on easing yemen 's severe water shortage , boosting primary education in the country - yemen had a literacy rate of 40 percent in 2007 - and helping diversify its oil-dominated economy .
zoe nautre , an expert at the berlin-based german council on foreign relations who spent a year in yemen reviewing german government aid efforts , said germany enjoyed excellent relations with the yemeni government .
" germany is often apolitical because it provides a lot of good technical assistance in yemen , particularly in the water sector , and does n't appear to be meddling in yemen 's affairs .
so , germany is well trusted in sanaa , " she told deutsche welle .
failure of governance but others point out that aid money is most needed to help tackle the failure of yemen 's corrupt government to maintain control over remote regions in the strife-torn country - which in turn is exacerbating yemen 's security woes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yemen remains a loosely-governed country under president saleh " one of the major reasons al qaeda is so strong in yemen is because the government is so weak , " guido steinberg , an expert on international terrorism and political developments in the gulf region at the berlin-based german institute for international and security affairs told deutsche welle .
" president ali abdullah saleh 's government is losing legitimacy - it 's not just failing to provide its own citizens with basic things such as water and jobs but is also losing control over vast swathes of the country . "
president saleh is facing a rebellion in the north , a secessionist movement in the south and growing islamic terrorism .
expert urges caution experts say that in addition to equipping and training yemen 's security forces to combat terrorism , the country needs a long-term development strategy - that means not just aid in areas such as education , health and infrastructure , but an inclusive politics .
" development policy in yemen has no meaning if it is n't embedded in a political strategy , " steinberg said .
eickenberg , whose organization is involved in democratization and reforming yemen 's political institutions , said western nations meeting at a yemen conference in london later this month needed to focus on promoting better governance , fighting corruption and nudging yemen to solve its northern conflict - with the help of its influential neighbor saudi arabia .
but nautre urged caution in drafting any future western strategy on yemen .
" western involvement in yemen can easily backfire because the population is very wary and there 's a strong anti-american sentiment there , " nautre said .
" the most important thing is for the west not to be seen as interfering in yemen from outside so that the people do n't turn against you and run into the arms of extremist groups . "

"
major general michael flynn , the top nato and us military intelligence chief in afghanistan , even said that they were " clueless " and " no more than a fingernail deep in -lrb- their -rrb- understanding of the environment . " richard betts agrees : " the pool of americans who actually really know these countries with enough inside expertise and bicultural sensitivity is very , very small , " he said . " the result is significant reliance on foreign services or american immigrants which reduces the confidence the intelligence agencies may have in the reliability they get or which limits opportunities to exploit openings . " " operatives in these regions do n't have a lot of human input , " said giles merritt .
" they rely on electronic surveillance mostly .
they lack people on the ground which can give them a clear picture of what is going on .
it 's very difficult in such a fragmented society like afghanistan where you have tribal loyalties and regional warlords . " major general flynn has already called for radical structural changes to help an intelligence-gathering apparatus which " still finds itself unable to answer fundamental questions about the environment in which we operate and the people we are trying to protect and persuade . " obama moves to shake up intelligence with reforms back in the us , president obama seized the initiative and announced his intention to launch a set of ambitious reforms , including a revamp of the government 's terrorist " watch-list " system which had omitted potential christmas day bomber abdulmutallab from its no-fly list of people with suspected terrorist links . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama promised sweeping reforms for spy agencies " i want our additional reviews completed this week .
i want specific recommendations for corrective actions to fix what went wrong , " obama said .
" i want those reforms implemented immediately so that this does n't happen again and so that we can prevent future attacks . " " it is politically necessary and proper for the president to make a dramatic effort to fix the vulnerabilities revealed by the failures , " said betts . " the specific fixes are in many cases technical matters of coordinating information technologies and distribution mechanisms .
more general needs , for example deep expertise on non-western societies , and the ability of agents to operate in denied areas , are harder to deal with and will require inventive investments in human capital for the long term - and such investments may not be popular with politicians looking for immediate solutions . " specific intelligence targeting the way forward giles merritt believes that change from all-encompassing security sweeps to specific threat assessment and suspect profiling would be a good place to start . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : airport security will get tougher - but will it get smarter ?
" the big issue concerns whether profiling of suspects is politically acceptable , " he said .
" politicians seem to shy away from profiling because it identifies people of specific nationality and religious beliefs and singles them out as potential terrorists .
but this seems to be the best way to approach security .
this even-handed approach where old ladies are strip-searched just is n't working and i think this detroit incident is going to move the approach more toward profiling , and deeper sharing and analysis of intelligence . " " what needs to be done is a total rethink of security , " merritt added .
" with airport security you need to take the collection of data , the profiling , and the monitoring out of the hands of poorly paid staff and into those of highly-trained professionals .
israel ’ s el al has the best security record despite being the airline under the biggest threat because of the people they have carrying out their security . " we also have to get over this political correctness that all passengers are the same , " he said . " that 's where we need a major rethink .
you need to forget about the 98 percent of people who are never going to be a terrorist and then concentrate on the tiny amount of the remaining two percent who could be , applying advanced profiling and information sharing to identify potential threats . " failures make news but successes save lives despite the furore over the recent intelligence blunders , richard betts is quick to point out that failures will always make bigger headlines than successes . " in the weeks before the recent disasters , there were several arrests of plotters or suspects which received less publicity and which were virtually taken for granted by the public , yet which showed that the system was effectively interdicting actual or potential attacks , " betts said . " successes sometimes are not publicized and at other times , even unknown .
for example - if precautions cause a planned attack to be cancelled , we never know how successful the precautions were .
failures will inevitably get more attention - as they should - but do not in themselves necessarily discredit the whole system of counterintelligence and counterterrorism organization .

as 2010 begins with the so-called " war on terror " seemingly no nearer to being won , us president barack obama has been handed an old set of problems to deal with ; problems which stretch back to before hijacked planes slammed into the world trade center in new york and the pentagon in washington .
last week , the usually unflappable obama sought to calm fears caused by the security lapses which allowed a nigerian man with alleged links to yemen-based al qaeda operatives to board a northwest airlines flight from amsterdam to detroit with an explosive device hidden in his underwear .
publicly , obama assured the american people that his administration would work fast and hard to improve security to eradicate the " human and systemic failures " behind the christmas day incident .
but behind closed doors , it is alleged that the president used sharper language with his security chiefs , calling the incident a potentially disastrous " screw up " by the intelligence community , telling them that " we dodged a bullet but just barely . "
intelligence in conflict zones suffering bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the khost blast was one of the biggest attacks on the cia the inability to both anticipate and stop the nature of this evolving threat was painfully highlighted two weeks ago by the bombing inside forward operating base chapman , a well-fortified compound in afghanistan 's khost province near the southeastern border with pakistan .
despite supposedly successful " deradicalization , " humam khalil abu-mulal al-balawi - a jordanian jihadist captured and turned into a cia spy - was allowed to enter the base without adequate security checks .
once inside , balawi , who had been given a mission to infiltrate al qaeda and pass on information on its leaders , detonated a hidden explosive , killing seven operatives and contractors and his jordanian handler .
the attack not only showed an embarrassing lack of vigilance but also exposed the intelligence community 's dearth in understanding of the situation in afghanistan and the current capabilities of al qaeda .
recent us intelligence suggested the terror organization 's power had been diminished but the attack showed that , contrary to that belief , al qaeda has achieved a new level of sophistication and may not be as weakened as us officials had thought .
lack of communication and accurate intelligence the attack also highlighted the problems which all operatives - at home and abroad - seem to encounter : that of an inability to gather and then share information they can trust .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : intel agencies have been under scrutiny since 9/11 " there is clearly a lack of communication at the heart of these problems , " giles merritt , the director of the security & defence agenda think-tank in brussels , told deutsche welle .
" the mechanisms for passing information are not good enough and this clearly needs to be sorted out .
intelligence agencies are meant to share information with each other and then to act on it .
it 's quite clear that the information is actually being shovelled over from one agency to another but not really analyzed , so it 's not being acted on . " richard betts , a terrorism expert at the council on foreign relations in washington , believes that while there have been mistakes made , the steps that follow will lead to a more secure united states . " processes for correlating and disseminating thousands of bits and pieces of information are complex and fixing one problem sometimes complicates another , " betts told deutsche welle . " the recent failure to revoke the visa for the nigerian bomber revealed a glitch in the system that has otherwise worked well in preventing any attacks inside the us since 9/11 , despite al qaeda 's huge incentives to pull one off .
glitches like this will be fixed when found but some precautions to minimize the chances of attack will introduce costs the public may be reluctant to bear - for example , more intrusive airport screening or more compromises in privacy for intelligence gathering .

two squad members and a driver died in the ambush . " if a team or some people present themselves under the togolese flag , it will be a false representation , " gilbert houngbo told journalists in the capital lome on sunday , january 10 .
previously , the togolese national soccer team had reportedly decided to take part in the africa cup of nations in spite of friday 's deadly ambush by gunmen on their convoy in angola .
a report on the website of the french sports daily , l 'equipe , said that the players had decided to ignore the call from togo 's government for the side to return home .

the attack by hooded gunmen claimed the lives of togo 's assistant coach and its squad spokesman along with one of the drivers of the convoy .

"
major general michael flynn , the top nato and us military intelligence chief in afghanistan , even said that they were " clueless " and " no more than a fingernail deep in -lrb- their -rrb- understanding of the environment . " richard betts agrees : " the pool of americans who actually really know these countries with enough inside expertise and bicultural sensitivity is very , very small , " he said . " the result is significant reliance on foreign services or american immigrants which reduces the confidence the intelligence agencies may have in the reliability they get or which limits opportunities to exploit openings . " " operatives in these regions do n't have a lot of human input , " said giles merritt .
" they rely on electronic surveillance mostly .
they lack people on the ground which can give them a clear picture of what is going on .
it 's very difficult in such a fragmented society like afghanistan where you have tribal loyalties and regional warlords . " major general flynn has already called for radical structural changes to help an intelligence-gathering apparatus which " still finds itself unable to answer fundamental questions about the environment in which we operate and the people we are trying to protect and persuade . " obama moves to shake up intelligence with reforms back in the us , president obama seized the initiative and announced his intention to launch a set of ambitious reforms , including a revamp of the government 's terrorist " watch-list " system which had omitted potential christmas day bomber abdulmutallab from its no-fly list of people with suspected terrorist links . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama promised sweeping reforms for spy agencies " i want our additional reviews completed this week .
i want specific recommendations for corrective actions to fix what went wrong , " obama said .
" i want those reforms implemented immediately so that this does n't happen again and so that we can prevent future attacks . " " it is politically necessary and proper for the president to make a dramatic effort to fix the vulnerabilities revealed by the failures , " said betts . " the specific fixes are in many cases technical matters of coordinating information technologies and distribution mechanisms .
more general needs , for example deep expertise on non-western societies , and the ability of agents to operate in denied areas , are harder to deal with and will require inventive investments in human capital for the long term - and such investments may not be popular with politicians looking for immediate solutions . " specific intelligence targeting the way forward giles merritt believes that change from all-encompassing security sweeps to specific threat assessment and suspect profiling would be a good place to start . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : airport security will get tougher - but will it get smarter ?
" the big issue concerns whether profiling of suspects is politically acceptable , " he said .
" politicians seem to shy away from profiling because it identifies people of specific nationality and religious beliefs and singles them out as potential terrorists .
but this seems to be the best way to approach security .
this even-handed approach where old ladies are strip-searched just is n't working and i think this detroit incident is going to move the approach more toward profiling , and deeper sharing and analysis of intelligence . " " what needs to be done is a total rethink of security , " merritt added .
" with airport security you need to take the collection of data , the profiling , and the monitoring out of the hands of poorly paid staff and into those of highly-trained professionals .
israel ’ s el al has the best security record despite being the airline under the biggest threat because of the people they have carrying out their security . " we also have to get over this political correctness that all passengers are the same , " he said . " that 's where we need a major rethink .
you need to forget about the 98 percent of people who are never going to be a terrorist and then concentrate on the tiny amount of the remaining two percent who could be , applying advanced profiling and information sharing to identify potential threats . " failures make news but successes save lives despite the furore over the recent intelligence blunders , richard betts is quick to point out that failures will always make bigger headlines than successes . " in the weeks before the recent disasters , there were several arrests of plotters or suspects which received less publicity and which were virtually taken for granted by the public , yet which showed that the system was effectively interdicting actual or potential attacks , " betts said . " successes sometimes are not publicized and at other times , even unknown .
for example - if precautions cause a planned attack to be cancelled , we never know how successful the precautions were .
failures will inevitably get more attention - as they should - but do not in themselves necessarily discredit the whole system of counterintelligence and counterterrorism organization .

as 2010 begins with the so-called " war on terror " seemingly no nearer to being won , us president barack obama has been handed an old set of problems to deal with ; problems which stretch back to before hijacked planes slammed into the world trade center in new york and the pentagon in washington .
last week , the usually unflappable obama sought to calm fears caused by the security lapses which allowed a nigerian man with alleged links to yemen-based al qaeda operatives to board a northwest airlines flight from amsterdam to detroit with an explosive device hidden in his underwear .
publicly , obama assured the american people that his administration would work fast and hard to improve security to eradicate the " human and systemic failures " behind the christmas day incident .
but behind closed doors , it is alleged that the president used sharper language with his security chiefs , calling the incident a potentially disastrous " screw up " by the intelligence community , telling them that " we dodged a bullet but just barely . "
intelligence in conflict zones suffering bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the khost blast was one of the biggest attacks on the cia the inability to both anticipate and stop the nature of this evolving threat was painfully highlighted two weeks ago by the bombing inside forward operating base chapman , a well-fortified compound in afghanistan 's khost province near the southeastern border with pakistan .
despite supposedly successful " deradicalization , " humam khalil abu-mulal al-balawi - a jordanian jihadist captured and turned into a cia spy - was allowed to enter the base without adequate security checks .
once inside , balawi , who had been given a mission to infiltrate al qaeda and pass on information on its leaders , detonated a hidden explosive , killing seven operatives and contractors and his jordanian handler .
the attack not only showed an embarrassing lack of vigilance but also exposed the intelligence community 's dearth in understanding of the situation in afghanistan and the current capabilities of al qaeda .
recent us intelligence suggested the terror organization 's power had been diminished but the attack showed that , contrary to that belief , al qaeda has achieved a new level of sophistication and may not be as weakened as us officials had thought .
lack of communication and accurate intelligence the attack also highlighted the problems which all operatives - at home and abroad - seem to encounter : that of an inability to gather and then share information they can trust .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : intel agencies have been under scrutiny since 9/11 " there is clearly a lack of communication at the heart of these problems , " giles merritt , the director of the security & defence agenda think-tank in brussels , told deutsche welle .
" the mechanisms for passing information are not good enough and this clearly needs to be sorted out .
intelligence agencies are meant to share information with each other and then to act on it .
it 's quite clear that the information is actually being shovelled over from one agency to another but not really analyzed , so it 's not being acted on . " richard betts , a terrorism expert at the council on foreign relations in washington , believes that while there have been mistakes made , the steps that follow will lead to a more secure united states . " processes for correlating and disseminating thousands of bits and pieces of information are complex and fixing one problem sometimes complicates another , " betts told deutsche welle . " the recent failure to revoke the visa for the nigerian bomber revealed a glitch in the system that has otherwise worked well in preventing any attacks inside the us since 9/11 , despite al qaeda 's huge incentives to pull one off .
glitches like this will be fixed when found but some precautions to minimize the chances of attack will introduce costs the public may be reluctant to bear - for example , more intrusive airport screening or more compromises in privacy for intelligence gathering .

but behind closed doors , it is alleged that the president used sharper language with his security chiefs , calling the incident a potentially disastrous " screw up " by the intelligence community , telling them that " we dodged a bullet but just barely . "
intelligence in conflict zones suffering bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the khost blast was one of the biggest attacks on the cia the inability to both anticipate and stop the nature of this evolving threat was painfully highlighted two weeks ago by the bombing inside forward operating base chapman , a well-fortified compound in afghanistan 's khost province near the southeastern border with pakistan .
despite supposedly successful " deradicalization , " humam khalil abu-mulal al-balawi - a jordanian jihadist captured and turned into a cia spy - was allowed to enter the base without adequate security checks .
once inside , balawi , who had been given a mission to infiltrate al qaeda and pass on information on its leaders , detonated a hidden explosive , killing seven operatives and contractors and his jordanian handler .
the attack not only showed an embarrassing lack of vigilance but also exposed the intelligence community 's dearth in understanding of the situation in afghanistan and the current capabilities of al qaeda .
recent us intelligence suggested the terror organization 's power had been diminished but the attack showed that , contrary to that belief , al qaeda has achieved a new level of sophistication and may not be as weakened as us officials had thought .
lack of communication and accurate intelligence the attack also highlighted the problems which all operatives - at home and abroad - seem to encounter : that of an inability to gather and then share information they can trust .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : intel agencies have been under scrutiny since 9/11 " there is clearly a lack of communication at the heart of these problems , " giles merritt , the director of the security & defence agenda think-tank in brussels , told deutsche welle .
" the mechanisms for passing information are not good enough and this clearly needs to be sorted out .
intelligence agencies are meant to share information with each other and then to act on it .
it 's quite clear that the information is actually being shovelled over from one agency to another but not really analyzed , so it 's not being acted on . " richard betts , a terrorism expert at the council on foreign relations in washington , believes that while there have been mistakes made , the steps that follow will lead to a more secure united states . " processes for correlating and disseminating thousands of bits and pieces of information are complex and fixing one problem sometimes complicates another , " betts told deutsche welle . " the recent failure to revoke the visa for the nigerian bomber revealed a glitch in the system that has otherwise worked well in preventing any attacks inside the us since 9/11 , despite al qaeda 's huge incentives to pull one off .
glitches like this will be fixed when found but some precautions to minimize the chances of attack will introduce costs the public may be reluctant to bear - for example , more intrusive airport screening or more compromises in privacy for intelligence gathering .

two squad members and a driver died in the ambush . " if a team or some people present themselves under the togolese flag , it will be a false representation , " gilbert houngbo told journalists in the capital lome on sunday , january 10 .
previously , the togolese national soccer team had reportedly decided to take part in the africa cup of nations in spite of friday 's deadly ambush by gunmen on their convoy in angola .
a report on the website of the french sports daily , l 'equipe , said that the players had decided to ignore the call from togo 's government for the side to return home .
the report quoted alaixys romao , togo 's midfielder , as saying that the unanimous decision to stay and take part in the tournament was taken to honor the dead and wounded .
and also in order to deny the rebels any satisfaction .
the attack by hooded gunmen claimed the lives of togo 's assistant coach and its squad spokesman along with one of the drivers of the convoy .
the togolese backup goalkeeper , kodjovi obilale , reportedly sustained two gunshot wounds in the attack and was flown to south africa for treatment .
he is said to be in a stable condition .
seven others were also injured in the incident on friday , including defender serge akakpo of the romanian team vaslui .
the other injured passengers included two squad doctors and a journalist .

the attack threatens to overshadow the tournament which is to take place over the next three weeks .
the assailants opened fire on the vehicles as they travelled from cabinda , an angolan enclave to the north of the country .
the attack lasted some 20 minutes .
responsibility for the assault has been claimed by the separatist group , the front for the liberation of the enclave of cabinda -lrb- flec -rrb- .
the angolan minister in charge of affairs in cabinda , antonio bento bembe , said that the attack was " an act of terrorism . "
the oil-producing region of cabinda has been the site of a decades-long struggle for independence by the separatist group flec .
despite this , it is scheduled to play host to seven tournament matches this month. td / dfm / afp / reuters / ap / l 'equipe editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

as 2010 begins with the so-called " war on terror " seemingly no nearer to being won , us president barack obama has been handed an old set of problems to deal with ; problems which stretch back to before hijacked planes slammed into the world trade center in new york and the pentagon in washington .
last week , the usually unflappable obama sought to calm fears caused by the security lapses which allowed a nigerian man with alleged links to yemen-based al qaeda operatives to board a northwest airlines flight from amsterdam to detroit with an explosive device hidden in his underwear .
publicly , obama assured the american people that his administration would work fast and hard to improve security to eradicate the " human and systemic failures " behind the christmas day incident .
but behind closed doors , it is alleged that the president used sharper language with his security chiefs , calling the incident a potentially disastrous " screw up " by the intelligence community , telling them that " we dodged a bullet but just barely . "
intelligence in conflict zones suffering bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the khost blast was one of the biggest attacks on the cia the inability to both anticipate and stop the nature of this evolving threat was painfully highlighted two weeks ago by the bombing inside forward operating base chapman , a well-fortified compound in afghanistan 's khost province near the southeastern border with pakistan .
despite supposedly successful " deradicalization , " humam khalil abu-mulal al-balawi - a jordanian jihadist captured and turned into a cia spy - was allowed to enter the base without adequate security checks .
once inside , balawi , who had been given a mission to infiltrate al qaeda and pass on information on its leaders , detonated a hidden explosive , killing seven operatives and contractors and his jordanian handler .
the attack not only showed an embarrassing lack of vigilance but also exposed the intelligence community 's dearth in understanding of the situation in afghanistan and the current capabilities of al qaeda .
recent us intelligence suggested the terror organization 's power had been diminished but the attack showed that , contrary to that belief , al qaeda has achieved a new level of sophistication and may not be as weakened as us officials had thought .
lack of communication and accurate intelligence the attack also highlighted the problems which all operatives - at home and abroad - seem to encounter : that of an inability to gather and then share information they can trust .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : intel agencies have been under scrutiny since 9/11 " there is clearly a lack of communication at the heart of these problems , " giles merritt , the director of the security & defence agenda think-tank in brussels , told deutsche welle .
" the mechanisms for passing information are not good enough and this clearly needs to be sorted out .
intelligence agencies are meant to share information with each other and then to act on it .
it 's quite clear that the information is actually being shovelled over from one agency to another but not really analyzed , so it 's not being acted on . " richard betts , a terrorism expert at the council on foreign relations in washington , believes that while there have been mistakes made , the steps that follow will lead to a more secure united states . " processes for correlating and disseminating thousands of bits and pieces of information are complex and fixing one problem sometimes complicates another , " betts told deutsche welle . " the recent failure to revoke the visa for the nigerian bomber revealed a glitch in the system that has otherwise worked well in preventing any attacks inside the us since 9/11 , despite al qaeda 's huge incentives to pull one off .
glitches like this will be fixed when found but some precautions to minimize the chances of attack will introduce costs the public may be reluctant to bear - for example , more intrusive airport screening or more compromises in privacy for intelligence gathering .

" " operatives in these regions do n't have a lot of human input , " said giles merritt .
" they rely on electronic surveillance mostly .
they lack people on the ground which can give them a clear picture of what is going on .
it 's very difficult in such a fragmented society like afghanistan where you have tribal loyalties and regional warlords .

" obama moves to shake up intelligence with reforms back in the us , president obama seized the initiative and announced his intention to launch a set of ambitious reforms , including a revamp of the government 's terrorist " watch-list " system which had omitted potential christmas day bomber abdulmutallab from its no-fly list of people with suspected terrorist links . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama promised sweeping reforms for spy agencies " i want our additional reviews completed this week .
i want specific recommendations for corrective actions to fix what went wrong , " obama said .
" i want those reforms implemented immediately so that this does n't happen again and so that we can prevent future attacks . " " it is politically necessary and proper for the president to make a dramatic effort to fix the vulnerabilities revealed by the failures , " said betts . " the specific fixes are in many cases technical matters of coordinating information technologies and distribution mechanisms .
more general needs , for example deep expertise on non-western societies , and the ability of agents to operate in denied areas , are harder to deal with and will require inventive investments in human capital for the long term - and such investments may not be popular with politicians looking for immediate solutions . " specific intelligence targeting the way forward giles merritt believes that change from all-encompassing security sweeps to specific threat assessment and suspect profiling would be a good place to start . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : airport security will get tougher - but will it get smarter ?
" the big issue concerns whether profiling of suspects is politically acceptable , " he said .
" politicians seem to shy away from profiling because it identifies people of specific nationality and religious beliefs and singles them out as potential terrorists .
but this seems to be the best way to approach security .
this even-handed approach where old ladies are strip-searched just is n't working and i think this detroit incident is going to move the approach more toward profiling , and deeper sharing and analysis of intelligence . " " what needs to be done is a total rethink of security , " merritt added .
" with airport security you need to take the collection of data , the profiling , and the monitoring out of the hands of poorly paid staff and into those of highly-trained professionals .
israel ’ s el al has the best security record despite being the airline under the biggest threat because of the people they have carrying out their security . " we also have to get over this political correctness that all passengers are the same , " he said . " that 's where we need a major rethink .
you need to forget about the 98 percent of people who are never going to be a terrorist and then concentrate on the tiny amount of the remaining two percent who could be , applying advanced profiling and information sharing to identify potential threats . " failures make news but successes save lives despite the furore over the recent intelligence blunders , richard betts is quick to point out that failures will always make bigger headlines than successes . " in the weeks before the recent disasters , there were several arrests of plotters or suspects which received less publicity and which were virtually taken for granted by the public , yet which showed that the system was effectively interdicting actual or potential attacks , " betts said . " successes sometimes are not publicized and at other times , even unknown .
for example - if precautions cause a planned attack to be cancelled , we never know how successful the precautions were .

as 2010 begins with the so-called " war on terror " seemingly no nearer to being won , us president barack obama has been handed an old set of problems to deal with ; problems which stretch back to before hijacked planes slammed into the world trade center in new york and the pentagon in washington .
last week , the usually unflappable obama sought to calm fears caused by the security lapses which allowed a nigerian man with alleged links to yemen-based al qaeda operatives to board a northwest airlines flight from amsterdam to detroit with an explosive device hidden in his underwear .
publicly , obama assured the american people that his administration would work fast and hard to improve security to eradicate the " human and systemic failures " behind the christmas day incident .
but behind closed doors , it is alleged that the president used sharper language with his security chiefs , calling the incident a potentially disastrous " screw up " by the intelligence community , telling them that " we dodged a bullet but just barely . "
intelligence in conflict zones suffering bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the khost blast was one of the biggest attacks on the cia the inability to both anticipate and stop the nature of this evolving threat was painfully highlighted two weeks ago by the bombing inside forward operating base chapman , a well-fortified compound in afghanistan 's khost province near the southeastern border with pakistan .
despite supposedly successful " deradicalization , " humam khalil abu-mulal al-balawi - a jordanian jihadist captured and turned into a cia spy - was allowed to enter the base without adequate security checks .
once inside , balawi , who had been given a mission to infiltrate al qaeda and pass on information on its leaders , detonated a hidden explosive , killing seven operatives and contractors and his jordanian handler .
the attack not only showed an embarrassing lack of vigilance but also exposed the intelligence community 's dearth in understanding of the situation in afghanistan and the current capabilities of al qaeda .
recent us intelligence suggested the terror organization 's power had been diminished but the attack showed that , contrary to that belief , al qaeda has achieved a new level of sophistication and may not be as weakened as us officials had thought .
lack of communication and accurate intelligence the attack also highlighted the problems which all operatives - at home and abroad - seem to encounter : that of an inability to gather and then share information they can trust .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : intel agencies have been under scrutiny since 9/11 " there is clearly a lack of communication at the heart of these problems , " giles merritt , the director of the security & defence agenda think-tank in brussels , told deutsche welle .
" the mechanisms for passing information are not good enough and this clearly needs to be sorted out .
intelligence agencies are meant to share information with each other and then to act on it .
it 's quite clear that the information is actually being shovelled over from one agency to another but not really analyzed , so it 's not being acted on . " richard betts , a terrorism expert at the council on foreign relations in washington , believes that while there have been mistakes made , the steps that follow will lead to a more secure united states . " processes for correlating and disseminating thousands of bits and pieces of information are complex and fixing one problem sometimes complicates another , " betts told deutsche welle . " the recent failure to revoke the visa for the nigerian bomber revealed a glitch in the system that has otherwise worked well in preventing any attacks inside the us since 9/11 , despite al qaeda 's huge incentives to pull one off .
glitches like this will be fixed when found but some precautions to minimize the chances of attack will introduce costs the public may be reluctant to bear - for example , more intrusive airport screening or more compromises in privacy for intelligence gathering .
