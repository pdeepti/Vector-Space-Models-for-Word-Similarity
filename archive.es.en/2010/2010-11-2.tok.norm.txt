but with this unique ecosystem threatened by political unrest in the region , a series of projects aims to ensure they stay that way . the landscape around gisenyi in western rwanda , on the border to the democratic republic of the congo , is breathtakingly beautiful .
mount nyiragongo towers majestically over the city , which is contiguous with the city of goma across the border in drc .
but mount nyiragongo is an active volcano , known for its devastating eruptions .
eight years ago , goma was largely destroyed by lava .
time and again , locals here have rebuilt their devastated city in the aftermath of such eruptions , despite risks posed by the still-hot lava and the frequent earth tremors that occur in the wake of the eruption .
they see the volcano as both a blessing and a curse .
located inside the virunga national park north of goma and lake kivu , and just west of the border with rwanda , its fertile land has made it one of the most densely populated regions on the entire continent . it also boasts virgin forests that are home to some unique flora and fauna , as well as the world 's last remaining population of mountain gorillas .
alternatives to illegal logging after the 1994 genocide in rwanda , hundreds of thousands of refugees fled over the border to goma .
today , the city is home to many former victims and perpetrators who are seeking refuge here from rwandan justice .
what they have in common is the fact that they are all trying to " put down roots in an ecosystem that is not their native one , " as johannes kirchgatter from the world wide fund for nature , or wwf , in germany puts it . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nyungwe rainforest is home to rare mountain gorillas the flow of refugees has resulted in a major population increase in the region , which has proved to be a heavy burden on existing fuel-provision structures .
the roughly one million people who live here depend mainly on firewood and wood charcoal for cooking and heating .
much of the logging activity in the virunga national park for the sale of timber and charcoal is controlled by rebel militia groups , which earn an estimated $ 30 million a year .
in order to put a stop to this illegal exploitation of resources by the charcoal mafia , the public needs alternatives that are affordable and sustainable .
outside the protected areas of the national park , the wwf is therefore overseeing a project to establish , maintain and exploit legal plantations for the production of fuel wood .
it also subsidizes the manufacture of energy-efficient ovens that consume 30 percent less fuel than previous ovens used hitherto .
the organization also trains rangers who work to clamp down on illegal loggers .
the project is already proving constructive , and helping to financially weaken the militias by providing the public with an alternative source for their fuel needs .
an important wilderness bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in drc , militias fund their activities with illegal wood trade the funds are partially provided from the international climate initiative , and kirchgatter hopes they can be put to good use across the entire congo basin .
its tropical forests are a haven for elephants , gorillas and other rare wildlife .
according to the wwf , the congo basin home to one-quarter of the world 's tropical forests and a mosaic of ecosystems – rivers , forests , savanna , swamps and flooded forests – which are teeming with life .
these forests regulate local climate and the flow of water , protect and enrich soils , control diseases and safeguard water quality .
reaching all the way to the atlantic coast , they also make up one of the most important wilderness areas left on the planet .
the wwf is planning to join forces with nasa next year to establish the exact size of its surface area using an optical remote sensing technology known as lidar , which can detect subtle topographic features such as river terraces and river channel banks , and measure the land surface elevation beneath the vegetation canopy .
the technology will allow researchers to establish forest density and even the precise amount of chlorophyll contained in different tree species .
with data provided by lidar , researchers will also be able to divide the congo basin into zones , isolating which areas are made up of primary forest and are therefore most in need of protection , and which areas could best be exploited by local populations .
the ultimate goal is to identify 15 percent of the congo basin as a protected area and thereby help preserve the habitats of species such as forest elephants , bonobo apes and various types of rare flora .
another project , run by the world resources institute , is putting the systems in place to implement effective strategies to reduce emissions from deforestation and forest degradation -lrb- known as redd . -rrb-
it is spearheading an innovative new project aimed at quantifying degradation and the greenhouse gas emissions in the forests of the republic of congo , and developing new methods to measure and monitor forest degradation .
the region will also be able to earn carbon credits by engaging in green carbon sequestering activities .
ideally , redd could deliver millions of dollars to impoverished communities in the congo basin in carbon credits , providing a powerful incentive to protect this land of great value to the planet .
but given that drc is one of the most corrupt nations in the world , negotiations are far from straightforward .
prioritizing needs of people and nature bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : preserving natural habitats in the congo basin is of global benefit nonetheless , johannes kirchgatter can already point to some successes , such as wwf programs in the lac tumba region in the western congo basin , some 1500 kilometers away from the virunga national park .
the region harbors a rich assemblage of terrestrial and aquatic biodiversity , and is an important provider of vital ecosystem services , including carbon sequestration , freshwater supplies , flood mitigation , and non-timber products for both subsistence and commercial use .
in wwf projects , locals are taught about land use planning ; protected area management and species conservation ; community-based natural resource management ; and livelihood improvement . the wwf hopes that 14,000 square kilometers of local forest can be preserved as a protected area and a further 65,000 square kilometers farmed sustainably .
given that the population is set to double in the next two decades , such measures are crucial .
but these valuable ecosystems will only survive if environmental priorities can be reconciled with the needs of local populations .

potentially connected parcel bombs have been sent to chancellor angela merkel 's office and embassies in greece .
the attacks follow mail bombs addressed to french president nicolas sarkozy among others on monday . the package containing explosives that was delivered to german chancellor angela merkel 's office was marked as coming from the greek economics ministry .
the recent bomb discovery comes after five embassies in athens have been targeted in mail box attacks on tuesday . two of the bombs exploded in front of the swiss embassy and a russian embassy compound , but did not cause any injuries , police in greece said .
other parcel bombs sent to the embassies of germany , bulgaria and chile were destroyed in controlled explosions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor merkel 's office and embassies in greece are under attack .
german interior minister thomas de maiziere said the parcel which arrived at chancellor merkel ’ s office resembled the bombs in greece .
suspects linked to far-left group the parcel ’ s delivery follows the arrest of two greek mail bomb suspects on monday who were accused of trying to send at least four parcel bombs to french president nicolas sarkozy and the mexican , dutch and belgian embassies .
the two men have been linked to a far-left group .
deutsche welle 's athens correspondent christine pirovolakis said that greek police are concerned since there were so many bombs at once circulating around in the greek capital .
the bombs are said to be sophisticated , although not powerful enough to cause great harm .
security sources said the package that made it to berlin was a " fast " explosive device that would have released a flame and caused burns had it detonated .
apparently it had not been a pipe bomb , or any other type of bomb that is designed to maim or kill with shrapnel .
similar bomb attacks in the past " one group under investigation is the ' sect of revolutionaries , ' a group that has committed other types of bomb attacks in the past , " pirovolakis said .
" in about a month 's time , we are going to have the two-year anniversary of a police shooting of a teenager , so last year around this time there was also an increase of bomb attacks in athens and it looks like it is the same this year as well . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : similar parcel bombs had been sent out on monday .
the police are starting to crack down , she added , saying that they were checking all governmental buildings and are searching individual visitors to them more closely .
also , parcels coming in and out of buildings are being rigorously screened for further investigation .
major streets in athens were also cut off to traffic .
elections in greece coming up some assume the parcel bombings could be happening due to greece 's austerity measures that have been implemented by the government .
" certainly the ways of attacks have increased since the teenage shooting a few years ago and of course the recent months since the austerity measures have been announced by the socialist government , " pirovolakis said .
" it looks like things are escalating once again .
there are also elections this coming weekend here in greece , so it looks like the left-wing groups are trying to in a way speak on behalf of the public how fed up they are with the austerity measures . "

no one was injured after a package from greece that contained explosive material arrived at the chancellery in berlin . there are still many questions about the mysterious package that arrived at chancellor angela merkel 's office in berlin on tuesday .
at least one thing is clear : the package did contain explosive materials .
that much was confirmed by interior minister thomas de maiziere on tuesday evening .
according to security sources in the capital , anyone who had opened the package would have been injured .
it did n't get that far , however , after the package was identified as suspicious during a routine mail inspection .
bomb defusing experts rendered the package harmless with a water cannon .
the chancellery was not evacuated as the mail room is in a separate building .
merkel was not in berlin during the incident as she is currently in belgium on an official visit .
she did say , however , that the recent series of package bombs from greece and yemen indicated a need for stricter controls on freight shipping in the european union , the united states , and around the globe .

the visit came as strained relations with russia may be turning belarus westward . germany and poland reached out to belarus on tuesday as the two countries ' foreign ministers arrived for an official visit to the authoritarian state , dubbed by human rights groups as " the last dictatorship in europe . "
german foreign minister guido westerwelle made the trip , along with his polish counterpart radoslaw sikorski , at the end of a two-day tour of eastern europe , visiting moscow on monday and vilnius , lithuania earlier on tuesday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : election results in 2006 gave lukashenko 83 percent of the vote the visit represented a shift in german relations with belarus , which has not hosted a german foreign minister in 15 years , and comes less than two months before new presidential elections in the former soviet state on december 19 .
westerwelle met with president alexander lukashenko , who has been in power since 1994 and won the last election with 83 percent , as well as opposition candidates for president , who he said should have free access to state media .
" from our view of things , the presidential elections will be a litmus test for your commitment to democracy , " westerwelle told lukashenko during the meeting .
the allowance of international observers was a " step in the right direction . "
' window of opportunity ' for eu ahead of his trip to belarus , westerwelle said that an approach to the european union by belarus could happen " only if legal standards are met . "
but according to stefan meister , eastern europe expert at the german council on foreign relations , belarus has shown no interest in joining the eu .
and despite the bloc 's attempts to become a greater player on the world stage , he said the eu 's interests remain internal .
" european union has no instruments for countries which have no interest in joining , " he told deutsche welle .
" there is no real functioning policy towards this country , and i think this is also the reason why europe is not really successful towards belarus . "
bildunterschrift : russia cut off gas supplies to belarus in june over a payment dispute still , there are signs that belarus is interested in closer cooperation with the west .
ties with russia , historically its closest ally , hit a new low earlier in the year when russia cut off gas supplies to belarus over a payment dispute .
and according to meister , this may be the time for germany and the eu to step in .
" there is maybe a window of opportunity to get more in contact with lukashenko and his regime , " he said .
" maybe there 's a chance for some reforms or the beginning of a new process between the european union and belarus . "
' diplomatic offensive ' the german visit to belarus continues on wednesday , when chancellor angela merkel 's chief of staff ronald pofalla is to give a speech at the minsk forum , an even created in 1997 to facilitate dialogue between the two countries .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel 's chief of staff ronald pofalla speaks at the minsk forum on wednesday organizers of the event said pofalla would make a " robust " appeal for democratic reforms in belarus , and that germany was launching a " diplomatic offensive . "
poland and germany are two of the few countries in the european union that have taken an interest in belarus , meister said .
but despite their efforts to push democratic reforms , nothing can be expected in the immediate future - and certainly not before next month 's elections .
" if we observe the developments in the last month , we can see that -lsb- lukashenko -rsb- has been pressuring the opposition , that he pressures the media , " he said .
" he still has the same instruments of the regime to make everything clear for the next election . "

the rules would force national nuclear authorities to draw up disposal plans to be vetted by the eu . europe 's energy chief said that the eu needed binding rules for the long-term storage of nuclear waste in europe , namely in deep underground bunkers that would be safe from accidents or sabotage .
" we have to make sure that we have the highest safety standards in the world to protect our citizens , " guenther oettinger said on wednesday in brussels .
" safety is indivisible .
if an accident happens in one country , it can have devastating effects also in others . " oettinger said the current situation within the eu , where most nuclear waste is stored in bunkers or warehouses until it cools down , is no longer acceptable .
the eu 's energy body says " deep geological repositories , " or caverns at depths of between 100 and 700 meters underground , are the best places to permanently store spent fuel rods , which can remain dangerous to humans for up to a million years .
the 50,000 cubic meters of waste generated by the eu annually is currently held in temporary above-ground facilities , although lower-grade nuclear waste , which includes such things as equipment from de-commissioned reactors , is permitted below ground .
oettinger is keen to change this because of surface storage facilities ' vulnerability to environmental damage and terrorist attacks . " the vast majority of experts agree that you need to have deep storage , in other words at least 300 meters below the earth 's surface , " he said .
the eu 's executive wants each of its member states to come up with a national plan for long-term storage within four years of new eu legislation .
those plans would then be vetted by oettinger 's team .
not so black and white bildunterschrift : where europe currently stores its waste but not everyone trusts the burial technique , which has never been put to the test due to the vast timeframes involved .
munich environmental institute board member christina hacker told deutsche welle that the problem is in the use of the word " safe " .
" who knows what is going to be safe for a million years ? " she asked .
" we have never had a depot like this before so it is impossible to guarantee its safety . "
proponents of the idea counter that rock provides a better natural barrier than any man-made constructions and that it is the best possible solution to a complex problem .
they say thirty years of research has established which geological structures are best for the job , and point to structures of clay in germany and granite in sweden .
but nuclear waste expert , stefan alt from the environmental research centre oeko-institut says there are some critical questions that need to be answered before any legislation can be signed off .
" storing waste deep under the ground is the most responsible way to go , " he told deutsche welle .
" but we still have to decide whether we will want access to it in the future or whether we want to seal it away forever . "
a bad precedent bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : burying nuclear waste has proved problematic in germany alt says the difficulties in predicting environmental changes over the next centuries and millennia make it impossible to foresee things like the condition of the containers five hundred years down the line .
furthermore , in light of revelations earlier this year that containers at the asse nuclear storage facility in germany had been damaged as a result of structural instability , he believes it could be wise to make waste accessible .
it 's an argument supported by local anti-nuclear campaigners .
udo dettmann , part of the asse ii community organization , told deutsche welle it would be a critical mistake to bury radioactive waste irreversibly .
" it if would stay deep under the ground that would be fine , but there is no proof that this will be the case over a period of one million years , " he said .
" the only way we have to correct mis-developments is to ensure access to the storage . "
he also said that there had been " insufficient " research into such sites , and that it would be irresponsible for the german government or the european commission to decide upon deep geological repositories without having thoroughly explored other options . politics versus security bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oettinger says current european rules for storing waste are unacceptable for the time being , though that the eu 's executive appears determined to find a long term , subterranean solution to the problem of dealing with nuclear waste .
in a recent article in a regional german newspaper , the badisches tagblatt , oettinger said he could foresee clusters of eu countries agreeing upon a collective waste-storage site .
he did not suggest which of the eu 's 27 member-states might prove suitable for such a facility , but stressed that he would not " tolerate the export of nuclear waste outside the european union . "
and while the idea of one country housing another country 's – or indeed several other countries ' – nuclear waste could itself prove politically tricky , stefan alt says that from a scientific point of view , it makes sense to find the best geological location possible .
" on this issue , security is more important than national boundaries , " he said .
" the alternative would mean that every country tried to locate sites which do n't even exist . "

the up-and-coming talents had been accepted for one of the following areas : camera , scripting , directing , editing , production , production design and sound design .

“ i ’ ve never attended a directing workshop because we don ’ t have anything like this at home , ” said the budding kenyan director jim chuchu .

“ i wish we had an extra five weeks of training because there ’ s so much to learn ! ”

tom tykwer , who accompanied the workshops in nairobi , reports , “ the participants are incredibly enthusiastic and extremely interested in improving their skills . ”
the next step is to choose the best participants “ and form them into a team that can create its own film language and use its own ideas . ”
starting mid-october , the african colleagues will be supported in producing a 90-minute film with the working title “ nairobi half life ” .
but this is not just about professionalizing individuals , says dw-akademie project manager michael tecklenburg , .
“ the goal is to strengthen an independent african film industry .

the photos include streets in the southern german town of oberstaufen , public spaces and soccer stadiums around the country . early on tuesday morning , google unveiled its first street view photographs in germany , honoring the bavarian town of oberstaufen to include " selected streets " where the company had sent its vehicles .
oberstaufen had previously explicitly invited google to their town , and even went so far as to bake the silicon valley company a cake , citing the potential for a boost in tourism .
earlier this year , the company announced it would launch street view in germany 's 20 largest cities , including berlin , hamburg and cologne , by the end of the year .
other specific locations around germany that are also available include a public square surrounded by historical buildings in dresden called the theaterplatz and a number of football stadiums , including munich 's allianz arena .
google said that there had been no reaction from government officials to the launch , despite all the controversy generated by the company 's plans for the last 18 months .
" we have n't heard anything from politicians or -lsb- data protection authorities -rsb- , " said lena wagner , a google germany spokesperson , in an interview with deutsche welle .
after government authorities complained , including consumer affairs minister ilse aigner and foreign affairs minister guido westerwelle , google eventually acquiesced to public pressure , providing an eight-week window , which ended last month , for german citizens to remove themselves from the service .
after the deadline , the california company announced that around 244,000 people had chosen to opt-out of the service , or under three percent of the total number of residents of the 20 selected cities .

oberstaufen had previously explicitly invited google to their town , and even went so far as to bake the silicon valley company a cake , citing the potential for a boost in tourism .
earlier this year , the company announced it would launch street view in germany 's 20 largest cities , including berlin , hamburg and cologne , by the end of the year .
other specific locations around germany that are also available include a public square surrounded by historical buildings in dresden called the theaterplatz and a number of football stadiums , including munich 's allianz arena .
google said that there had been no reaction from government officials to the launch , despite all the controversy generated by the company 's plans for the last 18 months .
" we have n't heard anything from politicians or -lsb- data protection authorities -rsb- , " said lena wagner , a google germany spokesperson , in an interview with deutsche welle .
after government authorities complained , including consumer affairs minister ilse aigner and foreign affairs minister guido westerwelle , google eventually acquiesced to public pressure , providing an eight-week window , which ended last month , for german citizens to remove themselves from the service .
after the deadline , the california company announced that around 244,000 people had chosen to opt-out of the service , or under three percent of the total number of residents of the 20 selected cities .

in an interview last month with deutsche welle , wagner noted that despite their complaints , germans actually like using street view in other countries where it already exists , saying that hundreds of thousands of germans use it every week .
" we also know that germany is the number one country in terms of street view in all countries where we have n't launched street view yet , " she said .
despite the launch of google street view , germany is continuing to investigate possible privacy violations as google admitted that it had captured some " payload data " while scanning open wifi networks during the course of taking photographs for street view .
in late october , the company admitted that it had captured some e-mails and passwords .
those revelations failed to surprise johannes caspar , hamburg 's commissioner for data protection and freedom of information , who is a leading authority in the german google investigation .

potentially connected parcel bombs have been sent to chancellor angela merkel 's office and embassies in greece .
the attacks follow mail bombs addressed to french president nicolas sarkozy among others on monday . the package containing explosives that was delivered to german chancellor angela merkel 's office was marked as coming from the greek economics ministry .
the recent bomb discovery comes after five embassies in athens have been targeted in mail box attacks on tuesday . two of the bombs exploded in front of the swiss embassy and a russian embassy compound , but did not cause any injuries , police in greece said .
other parcel bombs sent to the embassies of germany , bulgaria and chile were destroyed in controlled explosions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor merkel 's office and embassies in greece are under attack .
german interior minister thomas de maiziere said the parcel which arrived at chancellor merkel ’ s office resembled the bombs in greece .
suspects linked to far-left group the parcel ’ s delivery follows the arrest of two greek mail bomb suspects on monday who were accused of trying to send at least four parcel bombs to french president nicolas sarkozy and the mexican , dutch and belgian embassies .
the two men have been linked to a far-left group .
deutsche welle 's athens correspondent christine pirovolakis said that greek police are concerned since there were so many bombs at once circulating around in the greek capital .
the bombs are said to be sophisticated , although not powerful enough to cause great harm .
security sources said the package that made it to berlin was a " fast " explosive device that would have released a flame and caused burns had it detonated .
apparently it had not been a pipe bomb , or any other type of bomb that is designed to maim or kill with shrapnel .
similar bomb attacks in the past " one group under investigation is the ' sect of revolutionaries , ' a group that has committed other types of bomb attacks in the past , " pirovolakis said .
" in about a month 's time , we are going to have the two-year anniversary of a police shooting of a teenager , so last year around this time there was also an increase of bomb attacks in athens and it looks like it is the same this year as well . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : similar parcel bombs had been sent out on monday .
the police are starting to crack down , she added , saying that they were checking all governmental buildings and are searching individual visitors to them more closely .
also , parcels coming in and out of buildings are being rigorously screened for further investigation .
major streets in athens were also cut off to traffic .
elections in greece coming up some assume the parcel bombings could be happening due to greece 's austerity measures that have been implemented by the government .
" certainly the ways of attacks have increased since the teenage shooting a few years ago and of course the recent months since the austerity measures have been announced by the socialist government , " pirovolakis said .
" it looks like things are escalating once again .
there are also elections this coming weekend here in greece , so it looks like the left-wing groups are trying to in a way speak on behalf of the public how fed up they are with the austerity measures . "

security sources said the package that made it to berlin was a " fast " explosive device that would have released a flame and caused burns had it detonated .
apparently it had not been a pipe bomb , or any other type of bomb that is designed to maim or kill with shrapnel .
similar bomb attacks in the past " one group under investigation is the ' sect of revolutionaries , ' a group that has committed other types of bomb attacks in the past , " pirovolakis said .
" in about a month 's time , we are going to have the two-year anniversary of a police shooting of a teenager , so last year around this time there was also an increase of bomb attacks in athens and it looks like it is the same this year as well . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : similar parcel bombs had been sent out on monday .
the police are starting to crack down , she added , saying that they were checking all governmental buildings and are searching individual visitors to them more closely .
also , parcels coming in and out of buildings are being rigorously screened for further investigation .
major streets in athens were also cut off to traffic .
elections in greece coming up some assume the parcel bombings could be happening due to greece 's austerity measures that have been implemented by the government .
" certainly the ways of attacks have increased since the teenage shooting a few years ago and of course the recent months since the austerity measures have been announced by the socialist government , " pirovolakis said .
" it looks like things are escalating once again .
there are also elections this coming weekend here in greece , so it looks like the left-wing groups are trying to in a way speak on behalf of the public how fed up they are with the austerity measures . "

but critics suggest the idea of troops regularly serving under foreign command could cause problems . david cameron and nicolas sarkozy put pen to paper on two treaties in london .
the agreements will see britain and france jointly testing nuclear warheads , coordinating aircraft carriers so there is always a british or french vessel available for joint operations , and creating a combined expeditionary force training troops to deploy together .
france will also be allowed to use british a400m fuelling aircraft when there is spare capacity and there will be joint work on drones , mine counter-measures and satellite communications .
both men were keen to reject claims the move will diminish british or french sovereignty in any way .
david cameron insisted : bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain and france want to get closer and save money too " this is not , as some have suggested , about weakening or pooling british or french sovereignty .
this is not about a european army .
this is not about sharing our nuclear deterrents .
let me say this plainly : britain and france are , and will always remain , sovereign nations , able to deploy our armed forces independently and in our national interest when we choose to do so . "
david cameron ‘ s defence secretary liam fox has pointed out that it is not unusual for british troops to serve under foreign command - it happens often in nato operations .
the prime minister also said that uk forces are deployed alongside those of its allies on a regular basis , saying that " the vast bulk of our military operations - bosnia , kosovo , afghanistan , amongst others , have been conducted together with our allies . "
he added that such operations were always about defending britain 's national interest , and that they were " about practical , hard-headed co-operation between sovereign countries . "
france and britain have disagreed , even fairly recently , on military intervention - for example , on the invasion of iraq in 2003 .
so president sarkozy and prime minister cameron were sure to point out that a ' political agreement ' would have to be reached for the joint taskforce to be deployed .
sarkozy maintained , however , that france and britain already cooperated on major military operations and would continue to do so .
" if you , my british friends , have to face a major crisis , " said sarkozy , " could you imagine france simply sitting there , its arms crossed , saying that it 's none of our business ? "
' unprecedented and historic ' sarkozy did say , however , that the pacts demonstrated that britain and france were especially close at the moment , and hailed the anglo-french relationship : " this is an unprecedented decision and it shows a level of trust and confidence between our two nations that is unequalled in history . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france and britain , historical enemies , have grown quite close the french president , also aware that some analysts had described the pact as a signal of an overall weakening of combined british and french military power , was quick to dispel that notion . " we consider that the security effort should not in any way be drawn down in an increasingly dangerous world , which is that in which we live . "
the two leaders do both hope , however , that co-operation can lead to savings in costs .
the uk has recently announced cuts in its defense budget as part of its austerity drive and wants greater pooling of resources with france to help it maintain its military might , while bringing down its expense .
' big questions ' britain 's shadow defense secretary jim murphy welcomed the emphasis on greater co-operation in military matters , saying that deepening ties is ' essential ' to modern defense policy among allies .
however , he warned that " interdependence is different from dependence , and binding legal treaties pose some big questions for the government . "
murphy also said the uk could be entering " an era where we are reliant on our allies to fill in the gaps in the government 's defense policy . "
maintaining global might bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france sends its soldiers far and wide , but could stand to save money france and britain 's defense budgets are among the largest in the world .
both countries punch above their weight militarily and do not want to surrender their strategic advantage in this area .
alastair cameron , european security expert at the royal united services institute in london , thinks that is in little danger of happening , despite austerity drives .
" one could clearly be tempted to say that , forced to recognize their diminished stature in the world , these two countries are trying to do more together to avoid being overtaken by others , " he said . but cameron also said the two countries were such significant military contributors to global military operations that it would be hard to see much diminishment of their ambition to play a part on the global strategic scene .
" the military is facing a squeeze , of course , " said cameron , " but there is no doubt that their capacity , even under austerity measures , maintains an edge over a good number or other countries . "

" it does not at all account for the problems that we expect to have , like surveillance , profiling , identity theft .
the fact that you have all the data in one central registry could lead to a lot of problems and a changing relationship between the state and the people , " says usha ramanatham , a prominent legal expert . however , economic analyst m. k venu says the project ’ s foremost priority is to identify target groups for various government programmes : " the uid essentially is aimed at providing identities to the very poor , which number about 600 million . " the government spends over $ 100 billion annually in delivering various social welfare programmes for them .
and it is very important that these people have an identity .
the primary importance of the uid in india is to bring 600 million people out of poverty , by targeting them in a transparent manner . " technology will tag everybody and everything ramanathan is still not convinced and says " technology has brought all these problems in .
uids will tag every person , the gps system will tag every place and a public information and infrastructure system will tag every institution .
that ’ s the kind of invasion of privacy that we are actually being told will happen . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nandan nilekani is the chairman of the unique identification authority the head of the unique identification project is nandan nilekani , a former ceo of infosys technologies , the flagship of india 's information technology sector .
in 2009 , he was listed by time magazine among the world 's 100 most influential people . " this concern is limited to the well-off class in india for whom this is a privacy issue , " argues venu .
" whereas for the 600-700 million people who do not have enough to eat , who do not have shelter , who do not have clothing , this is not a privacy issue at all .
they want to be recognized by the state for the delivery of these social welfare programmes .

but critics suggest the idea of troops regularly serving under foreign command could cause problems . david cameron and nicolas sarkozy put pen to paper on two treaties in london .
the agreements will see britain and france jointly testing nuclear warheads , coordinating aircraft carriers so there is always a british or french vessel available for joint operations , and creating a combined expeditionary force training troops to deploy together .
france will also be allowed to use british a400m fuelling aircraft when there is spare capacity and there will be joint work on drones , mine counter-measures and satellite communications .

david cameron insisted : bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain and france want to get closer and save money too " this is not , as some have suggested , about weakening or pooling british or french sovereignty .
this is not about a european army .
this is not about sharing our nuclear deterrents .
let me say this plainly : britain and france are , and will always remain , sovereign nations , able to deploy our armed forces independently and in our national interest when we choose to do so . "
david cameron ‘ s defence secretary liam fox has pointed out that it is not unusual for british troops to serve under foreign command - it happens often in nato operations .
the prime minister also said that uk forces are deployed alongside those of its allies on a regular basis , saying that " the vast bulk of our military operations - bosnia , kosovo , afghanistan , amongst others , have been conducted together with our allies . "
he added that such operations were always about defending britain 's national interest , and that they were " about practical , hard-headed co-operation between sovereign countries . "
france and britain have disagreed , even fairly recently , on military intervention - for example , on the invasion of iraq in 2003 .
so president sarkozy and prime minister cameron were sure to point out that a ' political agreement ' would have to be reached for the joint taskforce to be deployed .
sarkozy maintained , however , that france and britain already cooperated on major military operations and would continue to do so .
" if you , my british friends , have to face a major crisis , " said sarkozy , " could you imagine france simply sitting there , its arms crossed , saying that it 's none of our business ? "
' unprecedented and historic ' sarkozy did say , however , that the pacts demonstrated that britain and france were especially close at the moment , and hailed the anglo-french relationship : " this is an unprecedented decision and it shows a level of trust and confidence between our two nations that is unequalled in history .

the two leaders do both hope , however , that co-operation can lead to savings in costs .

however , he warned that " interdependence is different from dependence , and binding legal treaties pose some big questions for the government . "
murphy also said the uk could be entering " an era where we are reliant on our allies to fill in the gaps in the government 's defense policy . "

alastair cameron , european security expert at the royal united services institute in london , thinks that is in little danger of happening , despite austerity drives .
" one could clearly be tempted to say that , forced to recognize their diminished stature in the world , these two countries are trying to do more together to avoid being overtaken by others , " he said . but cameron also said the two countries were such significant military contributors to global military operations that it would be hard to see much diminishment of their ambition to play a part on the global strategic scene .
" the military is facing a squeeze , of course , " said cameron , " but there is no doubt that their capacity , even under austerity measures , maintains an edge over a good number or other countries . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de nuclear -pipe- 02.11.2010 europe plans binding rules for nuclear waste großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe wants to coordinate a long-term strategy for nuclear waste eu energy commissioner guenther oettinger presented proposals for the safe storage of nuclear waste on wednesday .
the rules would force national nuclear authorities to draw up disposal plans to be vetted by the eu . europe 's energy chief said that the eu needed binding rules for the long-term storage of nuclear waste in europe , namely in deep underground bunkers that would be safe from accidents or sabotage .
" we have to make sure that we have the highest safety standards in the world to protect our citizens , " guenther oettinger said on wednesday in brussels .
" safety is indivisible .
if an accident happens in one country , it can have devastating effects also in others . " oettinger said the current situation within the eu , where most nuclear waste is stored in bunkers or warehouses until it cools down , is no longer acceptable .
the eu 's energy body says " deep geological repositories , " or caverns at depths of between 100 and 700 meters underground , are the best places to permanently store spent fuel rods , which can remain dangerous to humans for up to a million years .
the 50,000 cubic meters of waste generated by the eu annually is currently held in temporary above-ground facilities , although lower-grade nuclear waste , which includes such things as equipment from de-commissioned reactors , is permitted below ground .
oettinger is keen to change this because of surface storage facilities ' vulnerability to environmental damage and terrorist attacks . " the vast majority of experts agree that you need to have deep storage , in other words at least 300 meters below the earth 's surface , " he said .
the eu 's executive wants each of its member states to come up with a national plan for long-term storage within four years of new eu legislation .
those plans would then be vetted by oettinger 's team .
not so black and white bildunterschrift : where europe currently stores its waste but not everyone trusts the burial technique , which has never been put to the test due to the vast timeframes involved .
munich environmental institute board member christina hacker told deutsche welle that the problem is in the use of the word " safe " .
" who knows what is going to be safe for a million years ? " she asked .
" we have never had a depot like this before so it is impossible to guarantee its safety . "
proponents of the idea counter that rock provides a better natural barrier than any man-made constructions and that it is the best possible solution to a complex problem .
they say thirty years of research has established which geological structures are best for the job , and point to structures of clay in germany and granite in sweden .
but nuclear waste expert , stefan alt from the environmental research centre oeko-institut says there are some critical questions that need to be answered before any legislation can be signed off .
" storing waste deep under the ground is the most responsible way to go , " he told deutsche welle .
" but we still have to decide whether we will want access to it in the future or whether we want to seal it away forever . "
a bad precedent bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : burying nuclear waste has proved problematic in germany alt says the difficulties in predicting environmental changes over the next centuries and millennia make it impossible to foresee things like the condition of the containers five hundred years down the line .
furthermore , in light of revelations earlier this year that containers at the asse nuclear storage facility in germany had been damaged as a result of structural instability , he believes it could be wise to make waste accessible .
it 's an argument supported by local anti-nuclear campaigners .
udo dettmann , part of the asse ii community organization , told deutsche welle it would be a critical mistake to bury radioactive waste irreversibly .
" it if would stay deep under the ground that would be fine , but there is no proof that this will be the case over a period of one million years , " he said .
" the only way we have to correct mis-developments is to ensure access to the storage . "
he also said that there had been " insufficient " research into such sites , and that it would be irresponsible for the german government or the european commission to decide upon deep geological repositories without having thoroughly explored other options . politics versus security bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oettinger says current european rules for storing waste are unacceptable for the time being , though that the eu 's executive appears determined to find a long term , subterranean solution to the problem of dealing with nuclear waste .
in a recent article in a regional german newspaper , the badisches tagblatt , oettinger said he could foresee clusters of eu countries agreeing upon a collective waste-storage site .
he did not suggest which of the eu 's 27 member-states might prove suitable for such a facility , but stressed that he would not " tolerate the export of nuclear waste outside the european union . "
and while the idea of one country housing another country 's – or indeed several other countries ' – nuclear waste could itself prove politically tricky , stefan alt says that from a scientific point of view , it makes sense to find the best geological location possible .
" on this issue , security is more important than national boundaries , " he said .
" the alternative would mean that every country tried to locate sites which do n't even exist . "

he wants to close them through the introduction of coordinated , pan-european measures . german interior minister thomas de maiziere has called for security precautions on air cargo jets to be stepped up . the best way to do this , he says , is through closer cooperation between security agencies .
" air freight has been relatively under-monitored up to now , " de maiziere told reporters .
" evidently they recognized that and exploited it .
this means changes for the air freight business . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : package bombs got through security at cologne-bonn airport de maiziere plans to discuss the issue at a meeting of european interior ministers later this week .
his goal is to introduce coordinated security procedures on a european level .
de maiziere 's statement followed the discovery over the weekend that a package containing explosives had passed through cologne-bonn airport undetected before being found in england .
the package had been dispatched from yemen and was bound for the united states .
observers say those who planted the explosives likely exploited lax security in the country from where the aircraft began its journey .
" there are some countries in which there are security gaps , " elmar giemulla , who teaches the air transport law at the technical university of berlin , told the german press agency in an interview .
" there are rules , but whether they are properly observed is another matter , " he said .
stricter checks the international civil aviation organization -lrb- icao -rrb- sets standards for its 190 member nations .
when freight is sent from europe , or from the united states , it is either inspected or it has to be packed by a so-called ' known consignor , ' which is regulated by the state .
but elsewhere measures are n't so strictly observed .
" we need to check the reliability and control measures of third states , " de maiziere said on a visit to cologne-bonn airport on monday .
in response to the discovery of the explosives , berlin has stopped all freight and passenger flights from yemen from entering german airspace .
yemen has criticized germany 's decision to ban flights from its airports , saying it needs help to fight terrorism , not punishment .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de nuclear -pipe- 02.11.2010 europe plans binding rules for nuclear waste großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe wants to coordinate a long-term strategy for nuclear waste eu energy commissioner guenther oettinger presented proposals for the safe storage of nuclear waste on wednesday .
the rules would force national nuclear authorities to draw up disposal plans to be vetted by the eu . europe 's energy chief said that the eu needed binding rules for the long-term storage of nuclear waste in europe , namely in deep underground bunkers that would be safe from accidents or sabotage .
" we have to make sure that we have the highest safety standards in the world to protect our citizens , " guenther oettinger said on wednesday in brussels .
" safety is indivisible .
if an accident happens in one country , it can have devastating effects also in others . " oettinger said the current situation within the eu , where most nuclear waste is stored in bunkers or warehouses until it cools down , is no longer acceptable .
the eu 's energy body says " deep geological repositories , " or caverns at depths of between 100 and 700 meters underground , are the best places to permanently store spent fuel rods , which can remain dangerous to humans for up to a million years .
the 50,000 cubic meters of waste generated by the eu annually is currently held in temporary above-ground facilities , although lower-grade nuclear waste , which includes such things as equipment from de-commissioned reactors , is permitted below ground .
oettinger is keen to change this because of surface storage facilities ' vulnerability to environmental damage and terrorist attacks . " the vast majority of experts agree that you need to have deep storage , in other words at least 300 meters below the earth 's surface , " he said .
the eu 's executive wants each of its member states to come up with a national plan for long-term storage within four years of new eu legislation .
those plans would then be vetted by oettinger 's team .
not so black and white bildunterschrift : where europe currently stores its waste but not everyone trusts the burial technique , which has never been put to the test due to the vast timeframes involved .
munich environmental institute board member christina hacker told deutsche welle that the problem is in the use of the word " safe " .
" who knows what is going to be safe for a million years ? " she asked .
" we have never had a depot like this before so it is impossible to guarantee its safety . "
proponents of the idea counter that rock provides a better natural barrier than any man-made constructions and that it is the best possible solution to a complex problem .
they say thirty years of research has established which geological structures are best for the job , and point to structures of clay in germany and granite in sweden .
but nuclear waste expert , stefan alt from the environmental research centre oeko-institut says there are some critical questions that need to be answered before any legislation can be signed off .
" storing waste deep under the ground is the most responsible way to go , " he told deutsche welle .
" but we still have to decide whether we will want access to it in the future or whether we want to seal it away forever . "
a bad precedent bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : burying nuclear waste has proved problematic in germany alt says the difficulties in predicting environmental changes over the next centuries and millennia make it impossible to foresee things like the condition of the containers five hundred years down the line .
furthermore , in light of revelations earlier this year that containers at the asse nuclear storage facility in germany had been damaged as a result of structural instability , he believes it could be wise to make waste accessible .
it 's an argument supported by local anti-nuclear campaigners .
udo dettmann , part of the asse ii community organization , told deutsche welle it would be a critical mistake to bury radioactive waste irreversibly .
" it if would stay deep under the ground that would be fine , but there is no proof that this will be the case over a period of one million years , " he said .
" the only way we have to correct mis-developments is to ensure access to the storage . "
he also said that there had been " insufficient " research into such sites , and that it would be irresponsible for the german government or the european commission to decide upon deep geological repositories without having thoroughly explored other options . politics versus security bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oettinger says current european rules for storing waste are unacceptable for the time being , though that the eu 's executive appears determined to find a long term , subterranean solution to the problem of dealing with nuclear waste .
in a recent article in a regional german newspaper , the badisches tagblatt , oettinger said he could foresee clusters of eu countries agreeing upon a collective waste-storage site .
he did not suggest which of the eu 's 27 member-states might prove suitable for such a facility , but stressed that he would not " tolerate the export of nuclear waste outside the european union . "
and while the idea of one country housing another country 's – or indeed several other countries ' – nuclear waste could itself prove politically tricky , stefan alt says that from a scientific point of view , it makes sense to find the best geological location possible .
" on this issue , security is more important than national boundaries , " he said .
" the alternative would mean that every country tried to locate sites which do n't even exist . "

" safety is indivisible .
if an accident happens in one country , it can have devastating effects also in others . " oettinger said the current situation within the eu , where most nuclear waste is stored in bunkers or warehouses until it cools down , is no longer acceptable .
the eu 's energy body says " deep geological repositories , " or caverns at depths of between 100 and 700 meters underground , are the best places to permanently store spent fuel rods , which can remain dangerous to humans for up to a million years .
the 50,000 cubic meters of waste generated by the eu annually is currently held in temporary above-ground facilities , although lower-grade nuclear waste , which includes such things as equipment from de-commissioned reactors , is permitted below ground .
oettinger is keen to change this because of surface storage facilities ' vulnerability to environmental damage and terrorist attacks . " the vast majority of experts agree that you need to have deep storage , in other words at least 300 meters below the earth 's surface , " he said .
the eu 's executive wants each of its member states to come up with a national plan for long-term storage within four years of new eu legislation .
those plans would then be vetted by oettinger 's team .
not so black and white bildunterschrift : where europe currently stores its waste but not everyone trusts the burial technique , which has never been put to the test due to the vast timeframes involved .
munich environmental institute board member christina hacker told deutsche welle that the problem is in the use of the word " safe " .
" who knows what is going to be safe for a million years ? " she asked .
" we have never had a depot like this before so it is impossible to guarantee its safety . "
proponents of the idea counter that rock provides a better natural barrier than any man-made constructions and that it is the best possible solution to a complex problem .
they say thirty years of research has established which geological structures are best for the job , and point to structures of clay in germany and granite in sweden .
but nuclear waste expert , stefan alt from the environmental research centre oeko-institut says there are some critical questions that need to be answered before any legislation can be signed off .
" storing waste deep under the ground is the most responsible way to go , " he told deutsche welle .
" but we still have to decide whether we will want access to it in the future or whether we want to seal it away forever . "
a bad precedent bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : burying nuclear waste has proved problematic in germany alt says the difficulties in predicting environmental changes over the next centuries and millennia make it impossible to foresee things like the condition of the containers five hundred years down the line .
furthermore , in light of revelations earlier this year that containers at the asse nuclear storage facility in germany had been damaged as a result of structural instability , he believes it could be wise to make waste accessible .
it 's an argument supported by local anti-nuclear campaigners .
udo dettmann , part of the asse ii community organization , told deutsche welle it would be a critical mistake to bury radioactive waste irreversibly .
" it if would stay deep under the ground that would be fine , but there is no proof that this will be the case over a period of one million years , " he said .
" the only way we have to correct mis-developments is to ensure access to the storage . "
he also said that there had been " insufficient " research into such sites , and that it would be irresponsible for the german government or the european commission to decide upon deep geological repositories without having thoroughly explored other options . politics versus security bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oettinger says current european rules for storing waste are unacceptable for the time being , though that the eu 's executive appears determined to find a long term , subterranean solution to the problem of dealing with nuclear waste .
in a recent article in a regional german newspaper , the badisches tagblatt , oettinger said he could foresee clusters of eu countries agreeing upon a collective waste-storage site .
he did not suggest which of the eu 's 27 member-states might prove suitable for such a facility , but stressed that he would not " tolerate the export of nuclear waste outside the european union . "
and while the idea of one country housing another country 's – or indeed several other countries ' – nuclear waste could itself prove politically tricky , stefan alt says that from a scientific point of view , it makes sense to find the best geological location possible .
" on this issue , security is more important than national boundaries , " he said .
" the alternative would mean that every country tried to locate sites which do n't even exist . "

he wants to close them through the introduction of coordinated , pan-european measures . german interior minister thomas de maiziere has called for security precautions on air cargo jets to be stepped up . the best way to do this , he says , is through closer cooperation between security agencies .
" air freight has been relatively under-monitored up to now , " de maiziere told reporters .
" evidently they recognized that and exploited it .
this means changes for the air freight business . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : package bombs got through security at cologne-bonn airport de maiziere plans to discuss the issue at a meeting of european interior ministers later this week .
his goal is to introduce coordinated security procedures on a european level .
de maiziere 's statement followed the discovery over the weekend that a package containing explosives had passed through cologne-bonn airport undetected before being found in england .
the package had been dispatched from yemen and was bound for the united states .
observers say those who planted the explosives likely exploited lax security in the country from where the aircraft began its journey .
" there are some countries in which there are security gaps , " elmar giemulla , who teaches the air transport law at the technical university of berlin , told the german press agency in an interview .
" there are rules , but whether they are properly observed is another matter , " he said .
stricter checks the international civil aviation organization -lrb- icao -rrb- sets standards for its 190 member nations .
when freight is sent from europe , or from the united states , it is either inspected or it has to be packed by a so-called ' known consignor , ' which is regulated by the state .
but elsewhere measures are n't so strictly observed .
" we need to check the reliability and control measures of third states , " de maiziere said on a visit to cologne-bonn airport on monday .
in response to the discovery of the explosives , berlin has stopped all freight and passenger flights from yemen from entering german airspace .
yemen has criticized germany 's decision to ban flights from its airports , saying it needs help to fight terrorism , not punishment .

but critics suggest the idea of troops regularly serving under foreign command could cause problems . david cameron and nicolas sarkozy put pen to paper on two treaties in london .
the agreements will see britain and france jointly testing nuclear warheads , coordinating aircraft carriers so there is always a british or french vessel available for joint operations , and creating a combined expeditionary force training troops to deploy together .
france will also be allowed to use british a400m fuelling aircraft when there is spare capacity and there will be joint work on drones , mine counter-measures and satellite communications .
both men were keen to reject claims the move will diminish british or french sovereignty in any way .
david cameron insisted : bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain and france want to get closer and save money too " this is not , as some have suggested , about weakening or pooling british or french sovereignty .
this is not about a european army .
this is not about sharing our nuclear deterrents .
let me say this plainly : britain and france are , and will always remain , sovereign nations , able to deploy our armed forces independently and in our national interest when we choose to do so . "
david cameron ‘ s defence secretary liam fox has pointed out that it is not unusual for british troops to serve under foreign command - it happens often in nato operations .
the prime minister also said that uk forces are deployed alongside those of its allies on a regular basis , saying that " the vast bulk of our military operations - bosnia , kosovo , afghanistan , amongst others , have been conducted together with our allies . "
he added that such operations were always about defending britain 's national interest , and that they were " about practical , hard-headed co-operation between sovereign countries . "
france and britain have disagreed , even fairly recently , on military intervention - for example , on the invasion of iraq in 2003 .
so president sarkozy and prime minister cameron were sure to point out that a ' political agreement ' would have to be reached for the joint taskforce to be deployed .
sarkozy maintained , however , that france and britain already cooperated on major military operations and would continue to do so .
" if you , my british friends , have to face a major crisis , " said sarkozy , " could you imagine france simply sitting there , its arms crossed , saying that it 's none of our business ? "
' unprecedented and historic ' sarkozy did say , however , that the pacts demonstrated that britain and france were especially close at the moment , and hailed the anglo-french relationship : " this is an unprecedented decision and it shows a level of trust and confidence between our two nations that is unequalled in history . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france and britain , historical enemies , have grown quite close the french president , also aware that some analysts had described the pact as a signal of an overall weakening of combined british and french military power , was quick to dispel that notion . " we consider that the security effort should not in any way be drawn down in an increasingly dangerous world , which is that in which we live . "
the two leaders do both hope , however , that co-operation can lead to savings in costs .
the uk has recently announced cuts in its defense budget as part of its austerity drive and wants greater pooling of resources with france to help it maintain its military might , while bringing down its expense .
' big questions ' britain 's shadow defense secretary jim murphy welcomed the emphasis on greater co-operation in military matters , saying that deepening ties is ' essential ' to modern defense policy among allies .
however , he warned that " interdependence is different from dependence , and binding legal treaties pose some big questions for the government . "
murphy also said the uk could be entering " an era where we are reliant on our allies to fill in the gaps in the government 's defense policy . "
maintaining global might bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france sends its soldiers far and wide , but could stand to save money france and britain 's defense budgets are among the largest in the world .
both countries punch above their weight militarily and do not want to surrender their strategic advantage in this area .
alastair cameron , european security expert at the royal united services institute in london , thinks that is in little danger of happening , despite austerity drives .
" one could clearly be tempted to say that , forced to recognize their diminished stature in the world , these two countries are trying to do more together to avoid being overtaken by others , " he said . but cameron also said the two countries were such significant military contributors to global military operations that it would be hard to see much diminishment of their ambition to play a part on the global strategic scene .
" the military is facing a squeeze , of course , " said cameron , " but there is no doubt that their capacity , even under austerity measures , maintains an edge over a good number or other countries . "

over 10 days , six million census-takers will visit 400 million households to collect data about names , age and education . every day , hoards of people from the poorer provinces arrive in beijing and china 's other megacities to try their luck .
nobody exactly knows how many migrant workers there are in the country , but duan chengron , a migration expert at beijing 's people 's university , is willing to take a guess . " according to the official figures of 2005 , there are 147 million migrant workers , " he says .
" but many experts say this figure is too low .
i would say about 250 million .
but nobody knows .
that ’ s why we need the census . " difficult to get hold of migrant workers however , it is not easy to find the migrant workers and record their data .
many of them live in collective accommodation .
others share apartments where they often sleep in shifts ; some even sleeping on the floor . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : parents with unregistered children might be unwilling to answer questions for the census feng nailin from the national statistics bureau in beijing says the over six million census-takers are likely to encounter another headache : " citizens are far less cooperative than before and that ’ s a big problem .
maybe it ’ s because lifestyles have changed , things are much faster now and people value their private lives more . " under mao it was normal for the state to interfere in people ’ s private affairs but people are less and less willing to accept this now .
during pilot runs in the summer , some census-takers were met with closed doors . that 's why vice premier le keqiang recently called on the population to cooperate : " we hope that everybody will work together so that the census information is correct and complete .
together , we will make the sixth census a great success . " the census is going to cost well over a billion dollars . 8 , 18 or 45 questions to answer during the 10-day operation , 90 percent of those questioned have to answer 18 questions – about their names , their sex , their education and their ethnic background , as well as their household registration , their " hukou " , on which access to social services depends . but 10 percent have to answer 45 questions , with more detailed information about health , living conditions , whether an apartment is rented or owned , how many rooms it has .
foreigners , who are being counted for the first time this year , have to answer only eight questions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many migrant workers in china live in collective accommodation controversial questions such as religion or income have been left out of this year ’ s census . many people are happy to take part .
" i ’ m not worried , " says one woman .
" i ’ m not doing anything bad and i ’ m a good citizen .
in any case , information about our income and what we own is stored at the tax office .
such information can not be hidden .
i have nothing to hide . " however , there are some who will not be so willing to answer the questionnaire – those , for example , who have unregistered children . author : ruth kirchner -lrb- act -rrb- editor : arun chowdhury send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

experts who investigated the failed bombing of a us-bound plane in december 2009 , an attempted attack later claimed by aqap , said that if the toner bombs had been constructed by yemeni al-qaeda operatives then the group had achieved a level of expertise previously unseen .
" if al-qaeda indeed made them , " former cia agent robert baer told the washington times , " then they 've teamed up with true professionals . "
the sophistication of the bombs helped them to pass undetected through explosives scanners at hubs such as britain 's east midlands airport and cologne-bonn , a fact that prompted the german government - along with britain , france , canada and the united states - to ban airfreight from yemen and extend the restrictions to include passenger flights originating there .
terrorism experts initially suggested that the cargo planes were targeted for explosion over densely populated cities but when it was revealed that the bombs made the first part of the journey on commercial tourism flights , some experts were then forced to revise their theories to include a potential strike against airborne passengers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sophistication of the bombs have surprised experts despite foiling the bomb plots before any lives were lost , us intelligence agencies are concerned that yemen-based terrorist groups are becoming increasingly advanced in their planning .
they are quickly learning not to underestimate the threat coming out of yemen 's impoverished , tribal landscape and are reviewing their risk assessment of the group 's potential international reach .
given the sophistication of the devices , their route through germany and the discovery of one of the bombs at britain 's east midlands airport , the nightmare scenario of aqap extending its reach to europe has put the continent 's anti-terror authorities on alert .
however , jeremy binnie , terrorism and insurgency editor at jane 's defense , believes that aqap has had the opportunity to attack european targets but has so far maintained its focus on the united states .
aqap had opportunity to hit europe but did n't , say experts " the data points we have suggest that the us remains aqap 's primary target , " binnie told deutsche welle .
" they could have blown up the toner bombs anywhere over europe but chose not to which suggests their final destination would have been the united states with detonation taking place over a densely-populated area to maximise casualties .
as with the christmas day attempt last year , the bomb travelled through europe destined for chicago but again , the bomb was not detonated in europe suggesting the target was clearly the us . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aqap boss nasser al-wahaishi leads the yemen franchise " aqap are very ambitious , " he added .
" they want to hit the ' head of the snake ' as osama bin laden calls the us , not washington 's partners .
attacking the us is al-qaeda 's primary objective as it creates the maximum amount of coverage , increases international pressure on governments like yemen 's to confront islamist militants and in turn destabilizes these countries , making them even more vulnerable to al-qaeda 's influence . "
henry wilkinson , the associate director of janusian security risk management , agreed that the us was more likely to be a target for aqap but that europe 's association with the us also put it at a certain amount of risk .
" i do n't think europe is any higher a priority target than the united states , " he told deutsche welle .
" aqap has made threats against all the western powers it argues are causing harm to muslims - by gift of military deployments in afghanistan or iraq , support for israel , or perceived offences against islam such as banning the veil .
i suspect the united states is the most sought after target , but europe seems to be the focus of more plots - i suspect because it is a softer target by gift of border security and a greater preponderance of local sympathisers . "
european nations equally at risk should aqap switch focus when asked if the discovery of a toner bomb in britain or the fact that it passed through germany on its route suggested either country was under specific threat , wilkinson disagreed .
" i do n't think there is any merit in suggesting any one country is at particular risk , " he said .
" aqap has threatened many countries and may have been involved in the kidnap and murder of several german nationals in northern yemen in 2009 .
in this respect , i think germany as a leading european country is as much at risk as france , the uk , or any other prominent european nation . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bombs could have gone off in cologne or britain - but did n't " if aqap or any other groups were intent on mounting an attack in europe , they would take into account operational viability and target opportunity , as well as political significance of attacking the country . "
while the high-profile cases coming out of yemen have certainly turned the world 's attention toward its situation , most experts consider other countries as regions more deserving of concern in relation to european security .
" we have not seen much evidence that aqap has the capability to mount long-lead , multi-cell operations in europe , and its record of attempting such operations have mostly focused on saudi arabia , " wilkinson said .
" while i think this latest incident has focussed minds on the threat from yemen , the hierarchy of threat concerns for most european governments very likely remains , in order , afghanistan-pakistan , somalia and then yemen . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de terrorism -pipe- 02.11.2010 europe not the primary target for yemen-based terrorists , say experts großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us remains the main target for terrorists in yemen the recent discovery of two printer cartridges loaded with explosives aboard two us-bound cargo flights has once again turned the world 's attention to the potential international terror threat emanating from yemen . the bombs , which were traced to the impoverished country on the arabian peninsula after being found at airports in britain and dubai , were described by us security experts as showing a higher degree of professionalism and sophistication than any devices previously linked to yemen 's al-qaeda wing - al-qaeda in the arabian peninsula -lrb- aqap -rrb- .
experts who investigated the failed bombing of a us-bound plane in december 2009 , an attempted attack later claimed by aqap , said that if the toner bombs had been constructed by yemeni al-qaeda operatives then the group had achieved a level of expertise previously unseen .
" if al-qaeda indeed made them , " former cia agent robert baer told the washington times , " then they 've teamed up with true professionals . "
the sophistication of the bombs helped them to pass undetected through explosives scanners at hubs such as britain 's east midlands airport and cologne-bonn , a fact that prompted the german government - along with britain , france , canada and the united states - to ban airfreight from yemen and extend the restrictions to include passenger flights originating there .
terrorism experts initially suggested that the cargo planes were targeted for explosion over densely populated cities but when it was revealed that the bombs made the first part of the journey on commercial tourism flights , some experts were then forced to revise their theories to include a potential strike against airborne passengers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sophistication of the bombs have surprised experts despite foiling the bomb plots before any lives were lost , us intelligence agencies are concerned that yemen-based terrorist groups are becoming increasingly advanced in their planning .
they are quickly learning not to underestimate the threat coming out of yemen 's impoverished , tribal landscape and are reviewing their risk assessment of the group 's potential international reach .
given the sophistication of the devices , their route through germany and the discovery of one of the bombs at britain 's east midlands airport , the nightmare scenario of aqap extending its reach to europe has put the continent 's anti-terror authorities on alert .
however , jeremy binnie , terrorism and insurgency editor at jane 's defense , believes that aqap has had the opportunity to attack european targets but has so far maintained its focus on the united states .
aqap had opportunity to hit europe but did n't , say experts " the data points we have suggest that the us remains aqap 's primary target , " binnie told deutsche welle .
" they could have blown up the toner bombs anywhere over europe but chose not to which suggests their final destination would have been the united states with detonation taking place over a densely-populated area to maximise casualties .
as with the christmas day attempt last year , the bomb travelled through europe destined for chicago but again , the bomb was not detonated in europe suggesting the target was clearly the us . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aqap boss nasser al-wahaishi leads the yemen franchise " aqap are very ambitious , " he added .
" they want to hit the ' head of the snake ' as osama bin laden calls the us , not washington 's partners .
attacking the us is al-qaeda 's primary objective as it creates the maximum amount of coverage , increases international pressure on governments like yemen 's to confront islamist militants and in turn destabilizes these countries , making them even more vulnerable to al-qaeda 's influence . "
henry wilkinson , the associate director of janusian security risk management , agreed that the us was more likely to be a target for aqap but that europe 's association with the us also put it at a certain amount of risk .
" i do n't think europe is any higher a priority target than the united states , " he told deutsche welle .
" aqap has made threats against all the western powers it argues are causing harm to muslims - by gift of military deployments in afghanistan or iraq , support for israel , or perceived offences against islam such as banning the veil .
i suspect the united states is the most sought after target , but europe seems to be the focus of more plots - i suspect because it is a softer target by gift of border security and a greater preponderance of local sympathisers . "
european nations equally at risk should aqap switch focus when asked if the discovery of a toner bomb in britain or the fact that it passed through germany on its route suggested either country was under specific threat , wilkinson disagreed .
" i do n't think there is any merit in suggesting any one country is at particular risk , " he said .
" aqap has threatened many countries and may have been involved in the kidnap and murder of several german nationals in northern yemen in 2009 .
in this respect , i think germany as a leading european country is as much at risk as france , the uk , or any other prominent european nation . "

"
while the high-profile cases coming out of yemen have certainly turned the world 's attention toward its situation , most experts consider other countries as regions more deserving of concern in relation to european security .

" ableton and native -lrb- instruments -rrb- seem to be two of the major players in this area at the moment , they keep development with djs in mind and keep the products coming fresh , " said mick wilson , the technology editor of dj magazine , in an interview with deutsche welle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the traktor kontrol s4 was released on monday native instrument 's traktor kontrol s4 was released on monday , and is an all-in-one approach to djing , allowing digital files to be performed and manipulated using a usb controller .
designed for portability , the controller allows for four different tracks to be loaded , sampled and mixed simultaneously .
similarly , ableton , in conjunction with the new zealand-based company serato , released its new software product , on september 22 .
" the bridge " integrates ableton live software , which allows djs to compose pieces , assemble tracks and play complete songs , with serato 's digital vinyl playback software .
this allows djs to manipulate all of these parts using specially produced vinyl records or cds .
both products are now making it easier for turntablists to hone their craft using entirely digital means .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ableton 's ceo called his company 's new product a " whole new level of excitement " berlin companies head in different directions while both ableton and native instruments claim to be innovators in the field of digital djing , they have chosen different directions to pursue .
" actually , this is just another piece to the puzzle of digital djing , but it 's the most outstanding piece because it 's the world 's first all-in-one computer based dj system , " said daniel haver , native instruments ' chief executive , in an interview with deutsche welle .
he added that native instruments ' " traktor kontrol s4 " also makes it far easier for djs to cut and loop segments of tracks , to essentially remix ‘ on the fly . '
" i can easily set a loop , shorten the loop , apply and effect and then drop it again , " explained constantin koehncke , a native instruments dj , as he demonstrated the product .
across town at ableton , the direction is integration but of a different kind .
" i think the bridge brings a whole new level of excitement to traditional djing , to be able to program your drum machines live , tweak you synthesizers live , that 's exciting , " said jeff milligan , of ableton .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bridge was released on september 22 competitors , but in different markets while both products have been in development for many years , taking many years in development , there should be no surprise that the two cross town rivals are keen to generate excitement about their products .
however , because both take different approaches to digital djing , it appears that they are not in direct competition .
" the two products are aimed at different areas of the market for different djs , it 's going to be both together not one or the other , " added mick wilson of dj magazine .
" i like them both , i like the idea of traktor and the new s4 controller looks really tasty as well .
i -lrb- also -rrb- like the idea of ' the bridge ' with ableton where you can play with an old school mentality but still incorporate modern production and remix capabilities . "

both schalke and werder lost last weekend , but they may have different approaches to european competition . the champions league is meant to separate the men from the boys .
football connoisseurs enjoy pointing out that it is superior in quality to the world cup , and no less an authority than real madrid coach jose mourinho has said it is the best competition in the world .
but then he would , seeing as how he ’ s won it twice .
but in the group stages at least , the gulf between europe 's rich and poor leagues often belies this claim , and germany 's representatives in this season 's champions league seem to be finding europe 's best of the best a lot easier to cope with than unglamorous mid-table sides like nuremberg .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : raul and schalke did n't find hapoel to be much of a challenge bayern munich , last season 's champion 's league finalists , have only just broken into the top half of the table , but they are three from three in their easy european group .
but it is schalke , led by veteran coach felix magath and spear-headed on the pitch by spanish star raul , who are best at showing up what a questionable test the champions league group stages really are .
schalke are second from bottom in the league , having scraped together six points from 10 games - the exact same total they have notched up in their three champions league matches , thanks to routine wins against portugal 's benfica and israel 's hapoel tel aviv .
another win in tel aviv on tuesday and they will be well on their way out of the group .
superficial glory but there are of course many other factors at play .
as magath never tires of pointing out , schalke are struggling with new signings and a new system , and somehow the glamour and much-mooted ' magic ' of europe seems to lift veterans like raul , the champions league ’ s all-time top scorer .
the short-term glory of a much-needed win in europe is a balm for many sorrows .
after raul put two past hapoel a couple of weeks ago , there was much optimistic talk of " transferring " that form to the league , but saturday 's 1-0 home defeat to local rivals leverkusen ended with the players being booed off the pitch , and now schalke face the real prospect of replacing their dead title dreams with a relegation battle .
that is not much fun for internationally experienced stars like manuel neuer , klaas-jan huntelaar and christoph metzelder , and magath sounded pessimistic after the game .
" we have players who are used to playing for the top .
that 's why they ca n't cope with the situation , " newspaper bild quoted magath as saying . " the performance didn ’ t match our current position in the standings .
we have to try to avoid a tight situation at the bottom of the table . "
mid-table struggle for werder bremen , the problem is more subtle .
their league form is not good either , and they also just lost at home , to a solid but average nuremberg .
but their attacking line-up featuring the likes of claudio pizarro , hugo almeida , and marko marin are always good for a few goals , and they have at least consolidated mid-table status .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nuremberg held off bremen and stole an away win in europe , though , they face a scrap .
tuesday sees them host dutch champions fc twente , and the match is pretty much a do-or-die tie for both teams - they are both on two points , behind second-placed tottenham hotspur , who have four .
a defeat would signify pretty much the end of the competition for werder , and a draw does neither team much good .
werder 's frame of mind going into the match is pessimistic .
" the only chance we still have is getting three points , " marin said after saturday 's game .
" but that will be difficult .
the mood in the dressing room is not good . "
team captain torsten frings was livid after the defeat on saturday .
" we 're just being too careless with the situation , " he said , after railing against his team-mates as the final whistle went .
but he does not see the champions league match as a distraction , but a chance .
" it ’ s a good opportunity to take a big step forward , " he said .
the combination of having a fight on their hands , along with the fact that they will have something to prove to the weserstadion faithful , means they may well pull off a win against twente .
werder have more european experience , and home advantage should see them get past the dutch side , whom they held to a 1-1 draw in the netherlands .
for schalke , meanwhile , the champions league needs to be an afterthought .

" it ’ s a good opportunity to take a big step forward , " he said .
the combination of having a fight on their hands , along with the fact that they will have something to prove to the weserstadion faithful , means they may well pull off a win against twente .
werder have more european experience , and home advantage should see them get past the dutch side , whom they held to a 1-1 draw in the netherlands .
for schalke , meanwhile , the champions league needs to be an afterthought .

the rules would force national nuclear authorities to draw up disposal plans to be vetted by the eu . europe 's energy chief said that the eu needed binding rules for the long-term storage of nuclear waste in europe , namely in deep underground bunkers that would be safe from accidents or sabotage .
" we have to make sure that we have the highest safety standards in the world to protect our citizens , " guenther oettinger said on wednesday in brussels .
" safety is indivisible .
if an accident happens in one country , it can have devastating effects also in others . " oettinger said the current situation within the eu , where most nuclear waste is stored in bunkers or warehouses until it cools down , is no longer acceptable .
the eu 's energy body says " deep geological repositories , " or caverns at depths of between 100 and 700 meters underground , are the best places to permanently store spent fuel rods , which can remain dangerous to humans for up to a million years .
the 50,000 cubic meters of waste generated by the eu annually is currently held in temporary above-ground facilities , although lower-grade nuclear waste , which includes such things as equipment from de-commissioned reactors , is permitted below ground .
oettinger is keen to change this because of surface storage facilities ' vulnerability to environmental damage and terrorist attacks . " the vast majority of experts agree that you need to have deep storage , in other words at least 300 meters below the earth 's surface , " he said .
the eu 's executive wants each of its member states to come up with a national plan for long-term storage within four years of new eu legislation .
those plans would then be vetted by oettinger 's team .
not so black and white bildunterschrift : where europe currently stores its waste but not everyone trusts the burial technique , which has never been put to the test due to the vast timeframes involved .
munich environmental institute board member christina hacker told deutsche welle that the problem is in the use of the word " safe " .
" who knows what is going to be safe for a million years ? " she asked .
" we have never had a depot like this before so it is impossible to guarantee its safety . "
proponents of the idea counter that rock provides a better natural barrier than any man-made constructions and that it is the best possible solution to a complex problem .
they say thirty years of research has established which geological structures are best for the job , and point to structures of clay in germany and granite in sweden .
but nuclear waste expert , stefan alt from the environmental research centre oeko-institut says there are some critical questions that need to be answered before any legislation can be signed off .
" storing waste deep under the ground is the most responsible way to go , " he told deutsche welle .
" but we still have to decide whether we will want access to it in the future or whether we want to seal it away forever . "
a bad precedent bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : burying nuclear waste has proved problematic in germany alt says the difficulties in predicting environmental changes over the next centuries and millennia make it impossible to foresee things like the condition of the containers five hundred years down the line .
furthermore , in light of revelations earlier this year that containers at the asse nuclear storage facility in germany had been damaged as a result of structural instability , he believes it could be wise to make waste accessible .
it 's an argument supported by local anti-nuclear campaigners .
udo dettmann , part of the asse ii community organization , told deutsche welle it would be a critical mistake to bury radioactive waste irreversibly .
" it if would stay deep under the ground that would be fine , but there is no proof that this will be the case over a period of one million years , " he said .
" the only way we have to correct mis-developments is to ensure access to the storage . "
he also said that there had been " insufficient " research into such sites , and that it would be irresponsible for the german government or the european commission to decide upon deep geological repositories without having thoroughly explored other options . politics versus security bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oettinger says current european rules for storing waste are unacceptable for the time being , though that the eu 's executive appears determined to find a long term , subterranean solution to the problem of dealing with nuclear waste .
in a recent article in a regional german newspaper , the badisches tagblatt , oettinger said he could foresee clusters of eu countries agreeing upon a collective waste-storage site .
he did not suggest which of the eu 's 27 member-states might prove suitable for such a facility , but stressed that he would not " tolerate the export of nuclear waste outside the european union . "
and while the idea of one country housing another country 's – or indeed several other countries ' – nuclear waste could itself prove politically tricky , stefan alt says that from a scientific point of view , it makes sense to find the best geological location possible .
" on this issue , security is more important than national boundaries , " he said .
" the alternative would mean that every country tried to locate sites which do n't even exist . "

no one was injured after a package from greece that contained explosive material arrived at the chancellery in berlin . there are still many questions about the mysterious package that arrived at chancellor angela merkel 's office in berlin on tuesday .
at least one thing is clear : the package did contain explosive materials .
that much was confirmed by interior minister thomas de maiziere on tuesday evening .
according to security sources in the capital , anyone who had opened the package would have been injured .
it did n't get that far , however , after the package was identified as suspicious during a routine mail inspection .
bomb defusing experts rendered the package harmless with a water cannon .
the chancellery was not evacuated as the mail room is in a separate building .
merkel was not in berlin during the incident as she is currently in belgium on an official visit .
she did say , however , that the recent series of package bombs from greece and yemen indicated a need for stricter controls on freight shipping in the european union , the united states , and around the globe .
" this is urgently about implementing stricter world-wide controls to prevent terror attacks , " merkel said in an interview with the passaue neue presse .
de maiziere points to greece bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : de maiziere confirmed the package was sent from greece de maiziere also confirmed that the package had been sent two days ago to berlin from greece , where several bombs addressed to foreign embassies have been intercepted and three have ignited .
the interior minister said , " today ’ s situation fits into that context . "
he confirmed media reports that the return address on the package was listed at the greek economics ministry .
greek authorities have suspended all international mail for 48 hours from tuesday as they conduct a further investigation .
bombs exploded at the swiss and russian embassies in athens on tuesday , while others addressed to the bulgarian , chilean and german embassies were discovered and detonated in controlled explosions .
greek police say they plan to detonate another two packages recently seized at athens airport .
on monday , authorities intercepted and defused several other packages with explosive material inside that were addressed to other embassies , as well as to french president nicolas sarkozy .
one package addressed to the mexican embassy ignited in delivery service office and burned the hands of an employee .
two men were arrested on monday in connection with the parcel bombs and greek police suspect far-left extremists are behind the attacks .
no connection with yemen initial theories about the incident included the possibility that the package could have been sent from yemen , the focus of recent security attention worldwide .
however , de maiziere said tuesday 's incident had nothing to do with yemen .
over the weekend two freight packages on their way to the us from yemen were intercepted in europe and dubai and found to contain bombs .
germany and other countries have responded by restricting both passenger and freight flights originating in yemen .

but with this unique ecosystem threatened by political unrest in the region , a series of projects aims to ensure they stay that way . the landscape around gisenyi in western rwanda , on the border to the democratic republic of the congo , is breathtakingly beautiful .
mount nyiragongo towers majestically over the city , which is contiguous with the city of goma across the border in drc .
but mount nyiragongo is an active volcano , known for its devastating eruptions .
eight years ago , goma was largely destroyed by lava .
time and again , locals here have rebuilt their devastated city in the aftermath of such eruptions , despite risks posed by the still-hot lava and the frequent earth tremors that occur in the wake of the eruption .
they see the volcano as both a blessing and a curse .
located inside the virunga national park north of goma and lake kivu , and just west of the border with rwanda , its fertile land has made it one of the most densely populated regions on the entire continent . it also boasts virgin forests that are home to some unique flora and fauna , as well as the world 's last remaining population of mountain gorillas .
alternatives to illegal logging after the 1994 genocide in rwanda , hundreds of thousands of refugees fled over the border to goma .
today , the city is home to many former victims and perpetrators who are seeking refuge here from rwandan justice .
what they have in common is the fact that they are all trying to " put down roots in an ecosystem that is not their native one , " as johannes kirchgatter from the world wide fund for nature , or wwf , in germany puts it . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nyungwe rainforest is home to rare mountain gorillas the flow of refugees has resulted in a major population increase in the region , which has proved to be a heavy burden on existing fuel-provision structures .
the roughly one million people who live here depend mainly on firewood and wood charcoal for cooking and heating .
much of the logging activity in the virunga national park for the sale of timber and charcoal is controlled by rebel militia groups , which earn an estimated $ 30 million a year .
in order to put a stop to this illegal exploitation of resources by the charcoal mafia , the public needs alternatives that are affordable and sustainable .
outside the protected areas of the national park , the wwf is therefore overseeing a project to establish , maintain and exploit legal plantations for the production of fuel wood .
it also subsidizes the manufacture of energy-efficient ovens that consume 30 percent less fuel than previous ovens used hitherto .
the organization also trains rangers who work to clamp down on illegal loggers .
the project is already proving constructive , and helping to financially weaken the militias by providing the public with an alternative source for their fuel needs .
an important wilderness bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in drc , militias fund their activities with illegal wood trade the funds are partially provided from the international climate initiative , and kirchgatter hopes they can be put to good use across the entire congo basin .
its tropical forests are a haven for elephants , gorillas and other rare wildlife .
according to the wwf , the congo basin home to one-quarter of the world 's tropical forests and a mosaic of ecosystems – rivers , forests , savanna , swamps and flooded forests – which are teeming with life .
these forests regulate local climate and the flow of water , protect and enrich soils , control diseases and safeguard water quality .
reaching all the way to the atlantic coast , they also make up one of the most important wilderness areas left on the planet .
the wwf is planning to join forces with nasa next year to establish the exact size of its surface area using an optical remote sensing technology known as lidar , which can detect subtle topographic features such as river terraces and river channel banks , and measure the land surface elevation beneath the vegetation canopy .
the technology will allow researchers to establish forest density and even the precise amount of chlorophyll contained in different tree species .
with data provided by lidar , researchers will also be able to divide the congo basin into zones , isolating which areas are made up of primary forest and are therefore most in need of protection , and which areas could best be exploited by local populations .
the ultimate goal is to identify 15 percent of the congo basin as a protected area and thereby help preserve the habitats of species such as forest elephants , bonobo apes and various types of rare flora .
another project , run by the world resources institute , is putting the systems in place to implement effective strategies to reduce emissions from deforestation and forest degradation -lrb- known as redd . -rrb-
it is spearheading an innovative new project aimed at quantifying degradation and the greenhouse gas emissions in the forests of the republic of congo , and developing new methods to measure and monitor forest degradation .
the region will also be able to earn carbon credits by engaging in green carbon sequestering activities .
ideally , redd could deliver millions of dollars to impoverished communities in the congo basin in carbon credits , providing a powerful incentive to protect this land of great value to the planet .
but given that drc is one of the most corrupt nations in the world , negotiations are far from straightforward .
prioritizing needs of people and nature bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : preserving natural habitats in the congo basin is of global benefit nonetheless , johannes kirchgatter can already point to some successes , such as wwf programs in the lac tumba region in the western congo basin , some 1500 kilometers away from the virunga national park .
the region harbors a rich assemblage of terrestrial and aquatic biodiversity , and is an important provider of vital ecosystem services , including carbon sequestration , freshwater supplies , flood mitigation , and non-timber products for both subsistence and commercial use .
in wwf projects , locals are taught about land use planning ; protected area management and species conservation ; community-based natural resource management ; and livelihood improvement . the wwf hopes that 14,000 square kilometers of local forest can be preserved as a protected area and a further 65,000 square kilometers farmed sustainably .
given that the population is set to double in the next two decades , such measures are crucial .
but these valuable ecosystems will only survive if environmental priorities can be reconciled with the needs of local populations .

but with this unique ecosystem threatened by political unrest in the region , a series of projects aims to ensure they stay that way . the landscape around gisenyi in western rwanda , on the border to the democratic republic of the congo , is breathtakingly beautiful .
mount nyiragongo towers majestically over the city , which is contiguous with the city of goma across the border in drc .
but mount nyiragongo is an active volcano , known for its devastating eruptions .
eight years ago , goma was largely destroyed by lava .
time and again , locals here have rebuilt their devastated city in the aftermath of such eruptions , despite risks posed by the still-hot lava and the frequent earth tremors that occur in the wake of the eruption .
they see the volcano as both a blessing and a curse .
located inside the virunga national park north of goma and lake kivu , and just west of the border with rwanda , its fertile land has made it one of the most densely populated regions on the entire continent . it also boasts virgin forests that are home to some unique flora and fauna , as well as the world 's last remaining population of mountain gorillas .
alternatives to illegal logging after the 1994 genocide in rwanda , hundreds of thousands of refugees fled over the border to goma .
today , the city is home to many former victims and perpetrators who are seeking refuge here from rwandan justice .
what they have in common is the fact that they are all trying to " put down roots in an ecosystem that is not their native one , " as johannes kirchgatter from the world wide fund for nature , or wwf , in germany puts it . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nyungwe rainforest is home to rare mountain gorillas the flow of refugees has resulted in a major population increase in the region , which has proved to be a heavy burden on existing fuel-provision structures .
the roughly one million people who live here depend mainly on firewood and wood charcoal for cooking and heating .
much of the logging activity in the virunga national park for the sale of timber and charcoal is controlled by rebel militia groups , which earn an estimated $ 30 million a year .
in order to put a stop to this illegal exploitation of resources by the charcoal mafia , the public needs alternatives that are affordable and sustainable .
outside the protected areas of the national park , the wwf is therefore overseeing a project to establish , maintain and exploit legal plantations for the production of fuel wood .
it also subsidizes the manufacture of energy-efficient ovens that consume 30 percent less fuel than previous ovens used hitherto .
the organization also trains rangers who work to clamp down on illegal loggers .
the project is already proving constructive , and helping to financially weaken the militias by providing the public with an alternative source for their fuel needs .
an important wilderness bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in drc , militias fund their activities with illegal wood trade the funds are partially provided from the international climate initiative , and kirchgatter hopes they can be put to good use across the entire congo basin .
its tropical forests are a haven for elephants , gorillas and other rare wildlife .
according to the wwf , the congo basin home to one-quarter of the world 's tropical forests and a mosaic of ecosystems – rivers , forests , savanna , swamps and flooded forests – which are teeming with life .
these forests regulate local climate and the flow of water , protect and enrich soils , control diseases and safeguard water quality .
reaching all the way to the atlantic coast , they also make up one of the most important wilderness areas left on the planet .
the wwf is planning to join forces with nasa next year to establish the exact size of its surface area using an optical remote sensing technology known as lidar , which can detect subtle topographic features such as river terraces and river channel banks , and measure the land surface elevation beneath the vegetation canopy .
the technology will allow researchers to establish forest density and even the precise amount of chlorophyll contained in different tree species .
with data provided by lidar , researchers will also be able to divide the congo basin into zones , isolating which areas are made up of primary forest and are therefore most in need of protection , and which areas could best be exploited by local populations .
the ultimate goal is to identify 15 percent of the congo basin as a protected area and thereby help preserve the habitats of species such as forest elephants , bonobo apes and various types of rare flora .
another project , run by the world resources institute , is putting the systems in place to implement effective strategies to reduce emissions from deforestation and forest degradation -lrb- known as redd . -rrb-
it is spearheading an innovative new project aimed at quantifying degradation and the greenhouse gas emissions in the forests of the republic of congo , and developing new methods to measure and monitor forest degradation .
the region will also be able to earn carbon credits by engaging in green carbon sequestering activities .
ideally , redd could deliver millions of dollars to impoverished communities in the congo basin in carbon credits , providing a powerful incentive to protect this land of great value to the planet .
but given that drc is one of the most corrupt nations in the world , negotiations are far from straightforward .
prioritizing needs of people and nature bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : preserving natural habitats in the congo basin is of global benefit nonetheless , johannes kirchgatter can already point to some successes , such as wwf programs in the lac tumba region in the western congo basin , some 1500 kilometers away from the virunga national park .
the region harbors a rich assemblage of terrestrial and aquatic biodiversity , and is an important provider of vital ecosystem services , including carbon sequestration , freshwater supplies , flood mitigation , and non-timber products for both subsistence and commercial use .
in wwf projects , locals are taught about land use planning ; protected area management and species conservation ; community-based natural resource management ; and livelihood improvement . the wwf hopes that 14,000 square kilometers of local forest can be preserved as a protected area and a further 65,000 square kilometers farmed sustainably .
given that the population is set to double in the next two decades , such measures are crucial .
but these valuable ecosystems will only survive if environmental priorities can be reconciled with the needs of local populations .

with the genre already well established , writers are free to experiment . in his autobiographical graphic novel , " vier augen " -lrb- " four eyes " -rrb- , sascha hommer depicts some memorable events from his youth in germany 's black forest region .
this includes smoking with friends , dating a girl with an eating disorder and discovering lsd . he manages to capture these moments in a surprisingly small number of simple , black-and-white drawings , evoking the worries , fears and hopes of a young person growing up in a rural area .
the drawings contain little text , as he believes that complex descriptions are not always necessary for expressing important thoughts . " people say that what really counts is a good story - that pictures are not so important , " said hommer .
" but this style also conveys messages - not just in my books but also in the books of many of my role models . " bildunterschrift : ' vier augen ' deals with youth issues serious and funny many of the newer comics and graphic novels in germany deal with very serious topics , like hommer 's book , broaching the trying experiences of adolescence .
he has observed , however , that some young authors are trying to steer away from this kind of weightiness .
" the young comic writers that are now making their debut on the german market are much more easy-going about it , " explained hommer .
" they are going to bring the humor back into the comic genre . " dirk rehm , a spokesman for reprodukt , the publishing company behind hommer 's books , believes that there is a good reason for new writers to have a more relaxed approach to their work . " the younger writers can indeed be a lot more easy-going because they no longer have to prove that comics can be more than smut and trash - this was already accomplished by the last generation , " rehm told deutsche welle .
" they can just do what they feel like . " although reprodukt does publish a lot of comics of autobiographical and biographical nature , rhem says that it is in no way short on humorous and adventure-themed material either .
in addition to this , he has observed yet another new trend emerging within the genre : historical topics . ' hybrid ' literature bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hommer believes comics can convey complex thoughts hommer , a slim , dark-haired man in his early 30s , sees comics as a hybrid genre .
he started reading them at a very young age , as well as drawing pictures of his own .
he later went on to study illustration at the hamburg university of applied sciences , mentored by german comic author anke feuchtenberger . an official comic-writing degree does not exist at german universities as yet . at the moment , comics and graphic novels are receiving increasing attention in cultural media , and , according to hommer , they are also selling relatively well . " compared to small publishing companies that publish debut novels by unknown authors , the small comic publishers are very successful , " said hommer . hommer 's next book is going to tackle a serious topic .
it presents the short stories of brigitte kronauer , winner of the georg buechner prize - germany 's most important literary prize - in comic form . " i find ms kronauer 's texts great , " said hommer .
" in my adaptations i 'm trying to convey the same amount of information as her writing . " and if a picture really is worth a thousand words , that could make for one short comic book . author : dirk schneider , eva wutke editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but in the group stages at least , the gulf between europe 's rich and poor leagues often belies this claim , and germany 's representatives in this season 's champions league seem to be finding europe 's best of the best a lot easier to cope with than unglamorous mid-table sides like nuremberg .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : raul and schalke did n't find hapoel to be much of a challenge bayern munich , last season 's champion 's league finalists , have only just broken into the top half of the table , but they are three from three in their easy european group .
but it is schalke , led by veteran coach felix magath and spear-headed on the pitch by spanish star raul , who are best at showing up what a questionable test the champions league group stages really are .
schalke are second from bottom in the league , having scraped together six points from 10 games - the exact same total they have notched up in their three champions league matches , thanks to routine wins against portugal 's benfica and israel 's hapoel tel aviv .
another win in tel aviv on tuesday and they will be well on their way out of the group .
superficial glory but there are of course many other factors at play .

the short-term glory of a much-needed win in europe is a balm for many sorrows .
after raul put two past hapoel a couple of weeks ago , there was much optimistic talk of " transferring " that form to the league , but saturday 's 1-0 home defeat to local rivals leverkusen ended with the players being booed off the pitch , and now schalke face the real prospect of replacing their dead title dreams with a relegation battle .
that is not much fun for internationally experienced stars like manuel neuer , klaas-jan huntelaar and christoph metzelder , and magath sounded pessimistic after the game .
" we have players who are used to playing for the top .
that 's why they ca n't cope with the situation , " newspaper bild quoted magath as saying . " the performance didn ’ t match our current position in the standings .
we have to try to avoid a tight situation at the bottom of the table . "
mid-table struggle for werder bremen , the problem is more subtle .
their league form is not good either , and they also just lost at home , to a solid but average nuremberg .
but their attacking line-up featuring the likes of claudio pizarro , hugo almeida , and marko marin are always good for a few goals , and they have at least consolidated mid-table status .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nuremberg held off bremen and stole an away win in europe , though , they face a scrap .
tuesday sees them host dutch champions fc twente , and the match is pretty much a do-or-die tie for both teams - they are both on two points , behind second-placed tottenham hotspur , who have four .
a defeat would signify pretty much the end of the competition for werder , and a draw does neither team much good .
werder 's frame of mind going into the match is pessimistic .
" the only chance we still have is getting three points , " marin said after saturday 's game .
" but that will be difficult .
the mood in the dressing room is not good . "
team captain torsten frings was livid after the defeat on saturday .
" we 're just being too careless with the situation , " he said , after railing against his team-mates as the final whistle went .
but he does not see the champions league match as a distraction , but a chance .
" it ’ s a good opportunity to take a big step forward , " he said .
the combination of having a fight on their hands , along with the fact that they will have something to prove to the weserstadion faithful , means they may well pull off a win against twente .
werder have more european experience , and home advantage should see them get past the dutch side , whom they held to a 1-1 draw in the netherlands .

werder 's frame of mind going into the match is pessimistic .
" the only chance we still have is getting three points , " marin said after saturday 's game .
" but that will be difficult .
the mood in the dressing room is not good . "
team captain torsten frings was livid after the defeat on saturday .
" we 're just being too careless with the situation , " he said , after railing against his team-mates as the final whistle went .
but he does not see the champions league match as a distraction , but a chance .
" it ’ s a good opportunity to take a big step forward , " he said .
the combination of having a fight on their hands , along with the fact that they will have something to prove to the weserstadion faithful , means they may well pull off a win against twente .
werder have more european experience , and home advantage should see them get past the dutch side , whom they held to a 1-1 draw in the netherlands .
for schalke , meanwhile , the champions league needs to be an afterthought .

experts who investigated the failed bombing of a us-bound plane in december 2009 , an attempted attack later claimed by aqap , said that if the toner bombs had been constructed by yemeni al-qaeda operatives then the group had achieved a level of expertise previously unseen .
" if al-qaeda indeed made them , " former cia agent robert baer told the washington times , " then they 've teamed up with true professionals . "
the sophistication of the bombs helped them to pass undetected through explosives scanners at hubs such as britain 's east midlands airport and cologne-bonn , a fact that prompted the german government - along with britain , france , canada and the united states - to ban airfreight from yemen and extend the restrictions to include passenger flights originating there .
terrorism experts initially suggested that the cargo planes were targeted for explosion over densely populated cities but when it was revealed that the bombs made the first part of the journey on commercial tourism flights , some experts were then forced to revise their theories to include a potential strike against airborne passengers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sophistication of the bombs have surprised experts despite foiling the bomb plots before any lives were lost , us intelligence agencies are concerned that yemen-based terrorist groups are becoming increasingly advanced in their planning .
they are quickly learning not to underestimate the threat coming out of yemen 's impoverished , tribal landscape and are reviewing their risk assessment of the group 's potential international reach .
given the sophistication of the devices , their route through germany and the discovery of one of the bombs at britain 's east midlands airport , the nightmare scenario of aqap extending its reach to europe has put the continent 's anti-terror authorities on alert .
however , jeremy binnie , terrorism and insurgency editor at jane 's defense , believes that aqap has had the opportunity to attack european targets but has so far maintained its focus on the united states .
aqap had opportunity to hit europe but did n't , say experts " the data points we have suggest that the us remains aqap 's primary target , " binnie told deutsche welle .
" they could have blown up the toner bombs anywhere over europe but chose not to which suggests their final destination would have been the united states with detonation taking place over a densely-populated area to maximise casualties .
as with the christmas day attempt last year , the bomb travelled through europe destined for chicago but again , the bomb was not detonated in europe suggesting the target was clearly the us . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aqap boss nasser al-wahaishi leads the yemen franchise " aqap are very ambitious , " he added .
" they want to hit the ' head of the snake ' as osama bin laden calls the us , not washington 's partners .
attacking the us is al-qaeda 's primary objective as it creates the maximum amount of coverage , increases international pressure on governments like yemen 's to confront islamist militants and in turn destabilizes these countries , making them even more vulnerable to al-qaeda 's influence . "
henry wilkinson , the associate director of janusian security risk management , agreed that the us was more likely to be a target for aqap but that europe 's association with the us also put it at a certain amount of risk .
" i do n't think europe is any higher a priority target than the united states , " he told deutsche welle .
" aqap has made threats against all the western powers it argues are causing harm to muslims - by gift of military deployments in afghanistan or iraq , support for israel , or perceived offences against islam such as banning the veil .
i suspect the united states is the most sought after target , but europe seems to be the focus of more plots - i suspect because it is a softer target by gift of border security and a greater preponderance of local sympathisers . "
european nations equally at risk should aqap switch focus when asked if the discovery of a toner bomb in britain or the fact that it passed through germany on its route suggested either country was under specific threat , wilkinson disagreed .
" i do n't think there is any merit in suggesting any one country is at particular risk , " he said .
" aqap has threatened many countries and may have been involved in the kidnap and murder of several german nationals in northern yemen in 2009 .
in this respect , i think germany as a leading european country is as much at risk as france , the uk , or any other prominent european nation . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bombs could have gone off in cologne or britain - but did n't " if aqap or any other groups were intent on mounting an attack in europe , they would take into account operational viability and target opportunity , as well as political significance of attacking the country . "
while the high-profile cases coming out of yemen have certainly turned the world 's attention toward its situation , most experts consider other countries as regions more deserving of concern in relation to european security .
" we have not seen much evidence that aqap has the capability to mount long-lead , multi-cell operations in europe , and its record of attempting such operations have mostly focused on saudi arabia , " wilkinson said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de champions league -pipe- 02.11.2010 schalke and bremen limp into champions league fixtures großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : magath has bigger problems at home than in europe two of germany 's champions league representatives are beginning to fray at the edges at home .
both schalke and werder lost last weekend , but they may have different approaches to european competition . the champions league is meant to separate the men from the boys .
football connoisseurs enjoy pointing out that it is superior in quality to the world cup , and no less an authority than real madrid coach jose mourinho has said it is the best competition in the world .
but then he would , seeing as how he ’ s won it twice .
but in the group stages at least , the gulf between europe 's rich and poor leagues often belies this claim , and germany 's representatives in this season 's champions league seem to be finding europe 's best of the best a lot easier to cope with than unglamorous mid-table sides like nuremberg .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : raul and schalke did n't find hapoel to be much of a challenge bayern munich , last season 's champion 's league finalists , have only just broken into the top half of the table , but they are three from three in their easy european group .
but it is schalke , led by veteran coach felix magath and spear-headed on the pitch by spanish star raul , who are best at showing up what a questionable test the champions league group stages really are .
schalke are second from bottom in the league , having scraped together six points from 10 games - the exact same total they have notched up in their three champions league matches , thanks to routine wins against portugal 's benfica and israel 's hapoel tel aviv .
another win in tel aviv on tuesday and they will be well on their way out of the group .
superficial glory but there are of course many other factors at play .
as magath never tires of pointing out , schalke are struggling with new signings and a new system , and somehow the glamour and much-mooted ' magic ' of europe seems to lift veterans like raul , the champions league ’ s all-time top scorer .
the short-term glory of a much-needed win in europe is a balm for many sorrows .
after raul put two past hapoel a couple of weeks ago , there was much optimistic talk of " transferring " that form to the league , but saturday 's 1-0 home defeat to local rivals leverkusen ended with the players being booed off the pitch , and now schalke face the real prospect of replacing their dead title dreams with a relegation battle .
that is not much fun for internationally experienced stars like manuel neuer , klaas-jan huntelaar and christoph metzelder , and magath sounded pessimistic after the game .
" we have players who are used to playing for the top .
that 's why they ca n't cope with the situation , " newspaper bild quoted magath as saying . " the performance didn ’ t match our current position in the standings .
we have to try to avoid a tight situation at the bottom of the table . "
mid-table struggle for werder bremen , the problem is more subtle .
their league form is not good either , and they also just lost at home , to a solid but average nuremberg .
but their attacking line-up featuring the likes of claudio pizarro , hugo almeida , and marko marin are always good for a few goals , and they have at least consolidated mid-table status .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nuremberg held off bremen and stole an away win in europe , though , they face a scrap .
tuesday sees them host dutch champions fc twente , and the match is pretty much a do-or-die tie for both teams - they are both on two points , behind second-placed tottenham hotspur , who have four .
a defeat would signify pretty much the end of the competition for werder , and a draw does neither team much good .
werder 's frame of mind going into the match is pessimistic .
" the only chance we still have is getting three points , " marin said after saturday 's game .
" but that will be difficult .
the mood in the dressing room is not good . "
team captain torsten frings was livid after the defeat on saturday .
" we 're just being too careless with the situation , " he said , after railing against his team-mates as the final whistle went .
but he does not see the champions league match as a distraction , but a chance .
" it ’ s a good opportunity to take a big step forward , " he said .
the combination of having a fight on their hands , along with the fact that they will have something to prove to the weserstadion faithful , means they may well pull off a win against twente .
werder have more european experience , and home advantage should see them get past the dutch side , whom they held to a 1-1 draw in the netherlands .
for schalke , meanwhile , the champions league needs to be an afterthought .

analysts say manufacturers ' emphasis on research and development is paying off . there 's no doubt that this has been a good year for german carmakers , and equally little doubt that that has much to do with china .
volkswagen , porsche , bmw and mercedes have all made their mark on the sprawling asian landmass and notched up sales figures that far outstripped their expectations .
in the first eight months of 2010 , the chinese car market almost doubled in size with german manufacturers securing a 53 percent increase on the sales of its cars .
in an interview in monday 's die welt newspaper , the president of the german association of the automotive industry -lrb- vda -rrb- , matthias wissmann , said that german manufacturers would have produced a total of 5.45 million passenger cars by the end of the year . the lion 's share will have gone to international markets .
bildunterschrift : destined for foreign roads : german cars enjoy a good reputation overseas " over the whole year , we are expecting exports to rise 21 percent , which equates to 4.15 million passenger cars , " wissmann said .

analysts say manufacturers ' emphasis on research and development is paying off . there 's no doubt that this has been a good year for german carmakers , and equally little doubt that that has much to do with china .
volkswagen , porsche , bmw and mercedes have all made their mark on the sprawling asian landmass and notched up sales figures that far outstripped their expectations .
in the first eight months of 2010 , the chinese car market almost doubled in size with german manufacturers securing a 53 percent increase on the sales of its cars .
in an interview in monday 's die welt newspaper , the president of the german association of the automotive industry -lrb- vda -rrb- , matthias wissmann , said that german manufacturers would have produced a total of 5.45 million passenger cars by the end of the year . the lion 's share will have gone to international markets .

over 10 days , six million census-takers will visit 400 million households to collect data about names , age and education . every day , hoards of people from the poorer provinces arrive in beijing and china 's other megacities to try their luck .
nobody exactly knows how many migrant workers there are in the country , but duan chengron , a migration expert at beijing 's people 's university , is willing to take a guess . " according to the official figures of 2005 , there are 147 million migrant workers , " he says .
" but many experts say this figure is too low .
i would say about 250 million .
but nobody knows .
that ’ s why we need the census . " difficult to get hold of migrant workers however , it is not easy to find the migrant workers and record their data .
many of them live in collective accommodation .
others share apartments where they often sleep in shifts ; some even sleeping on the floor . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : parents with unregistered children might be unwilling to answer questions for the census feng nailin from the national statistics bureau in beijing says the over six million census-takers are likely to encounter another headache : " citizens are far less cooperative than before and that ’ s a big problem .
maybe it ’ s because lifestyles have changed , things are much faster now and people value their private lives more . " under mao it was normal for the state to interfere in people ’ s private affairs but people are less and less willing to accept this now .
during pilot runs in the summer , some census-takers were met with closed doors . that 's why vice premier le keqiang recently called on the population to cooperate : " we hope that everybody will work together so that the census information is correct and complete .
together , we will make the sixth census a great success . " the census is going to cost well over a billion dollars . 8 , 18 or 45 questions to answer during the 10-day operation , 90 percent of those questioned have to answer 18 questions – about their names , their sex , their education and their ethnic background , as well as their household registration , their " hukou " , on which access to social services depends . but 10 percent have to answer 45 questions , with more detailed information about health , living conditions , whether an apartment is rented or owned , how many rooms it has .
foreigners , who are being counted for the first time this year , have to answer only eight questions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many migrant workers in china live in collective accommodation controversial questions such as religion or income have been left out of this year ’ s census . many people are happy to take part .
" i ’ m not worried , " says one woman .
" i ’ m not doing anything bad and i ’ m a good citizen .
in any case , information about our income and what we own is stored at the tax office .
such information can not be hidden .
i have nothing to hide .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de nuclear -pipe- 02.11.2010 europe plans binding rules for nuclear waste großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe wants to coordinate a long-term strategy for nuclear waste eu energy commissioner guenther oettinger presented proposals for the safe storage of nuclear waste on wednesday .
the rules would force national nuclear authorities to draw up disposal plans to be vetted by the eu . europe 's energy chief said that the eu needed binding rules for the long-term storage of nuclear waste in europe , namely in deep underground bunkers that would be safe from accidents or sabotage .
" we have to make sure that we have the highest safety standards in the world to protect our citizens , " guenther oettinger said on wednesday in brussels .
" safety is indivisible .
if an accident happens in one country , it can have devastating effects also in others . " oettinger said the current situation within the eu , where most nuclear waste is stored in bunkers or warehouses until it cools down , is no longer acceptable .
the eu 's energy body says " deep geological repositories , " or caverns at depths of between 100 and 700 meters underground , are the best places to permanently store spent fuel rods , which can remain dangerous to humans for up to a million years .
the 50,000 cubic meters of waste generated by the eu annually is currently held in temporary above-ground facilities , although lower-grade nuclear waste , which includes such things as equipment from de-commissioned reactors , is permitted below ground .
oettinger is keen to change this because of surface storage facilities ' vulnerability to environmental damage and terrorist attacks . " the vast majority of experts agree that you need to have deep storage , in other words at least 300 meters below the earth 's surface , " he said .
the eu 's executive wants each of its member states to come up with a national plan for long-term storage within four years of new eu legislation .
those plans would then be vetted by oettinger 's team .
not so black and white bildunterschrift : where europe currently stores its waste but not everyone trusts the burial technique , which has never been put to the test due to the vast timeframes involved .
munich environmental institute board member christina hacker told deutsche welle that the problem is in the use of the word " safe " .
" who knows what is going to be safe for a million years ? " she asked .
" we have never had a depot like this before so it is impossible to guarantee its safety . "
proponents of the idea counter that rock provides a better natural barrier than any man-made constructions and that it is the best possible solution to a complex problem .
they say thirty years of research has established which geological structures are best for the job , and point to structures of clay in germany and granite in sweden .
but nuclear waste expert , stefan alt from the environmental research centre oeko-institut says there are some critical questions that need to be answered before any legislation can be signed off .
" storing waste deep under the ground is the most responsible way to go , " he told deutsche welle .
" but we still have to decide whether we will want access to it in the future or whether we want to seal it away forever . "
a bad precedent bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : burying nuclear waste has proved problematic in germany alt says the difficulties in predicting environmental changes over the next centuries and millennia make it impossible to foresee things like the condition of the containers five hundred years down the line .
furthermore , in light of revelations earlier this year that containers at the asse nuclear storage facility in germany had been damaged as a result of structural instability , he believes it could be wise to make waste accessible .
it 's an argument supported by local anti-nuclear campaigners .
udo dettmann , part of the asse ii community organization , told deutsche welle it would be a critical mistake to bury radioactive waste irreversibly .
" it if would stay deep under the ground that would be fine , but there is no proof that this will be the case over a period of one million years , " he said .
" the only way we have to correct mis-developments is to ensure access to the storage . "
he also said that there had been " insufficient " research into such sites , and that it would be irresponsible for the german government or the european commission to decide upon deep geological repositories without having thoroughly explored other options . politics versus security bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oettinger says current european rules for storing waste are unacceptable for the time being , though that the eu 's executive appears determined to find a long term , subterranean solution to the problem of dealing with nuclear waste .
in a recent article in a regional german newspaper , the badisches tagblatt , oettinger said he could foresee clusters of eu countries agreeing upon a collective waste-storage site .
he did not suggest which of the eu 's 27 member-states might prove suitable for such a facility , but stressed that he would not " tolerate the export of nuclear waste outside the european union . "
and while the idea of one country housing another country 's – or indeed several other countries ' – nuclear waste could itself prove politically tricky , stefan alt says that from a scientific point of view , it makes sense to find the best geological location possible .
" on this issue , security is more important than national boundaries , " he said .
" the alternative would mean that every country tried to locate sites which do n't even exist . "

but with this unique ecosystem threatened by political unrest in the region , a series of projects aims to ensure they stay that way . the landscape around gisenyi in western rwanda , on the border to the democratic republic of the congo , is breathtakingly beautiful .
mount nyiragongo towers majestically over the city , which is contiguous with the city of goma across the border in drc .
but mount nyiragongo is an active volcano , known for its devastating eruptions .
eight years ago , goma was largely destroyed by lava .
time and again , locals here have rebuilt their devastated city in the aftermath of such eruptions , despite risks posed by the still-hot lava and the frequent earth tremors that occur in the wake of the eruption .
they see the volcano as both a blessing and a curse .
located inside the virunga national park north of goma and lake kivu , and just west of the border with rwanda , its fertile land has made it one of the most densely populated regions on the entire continent . it also boasts virgin forests that are home to some unique flora and fauna , as well as the world 's last remaining population of mountain gorillas .
alternatives to illegal logging after the 1994 genocide in rwanda , hundreds of thousands of refugees fled over the border to goma .
today , the city is home to many former victims and perpetrators who are seeking refuge here from rwandan justice .
what they have in common is the fact that they are all trying to " put down roots in an ecosystem that is not their native one , " as johannes kirchgatter from the world wide fund for nature , or wwf , in germany puts it . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nyungwe rainforest is home to rare mountain gorillas the flow of refugees has resulted in a major population increase in the region , which has proved to be a heavy burden on existing fuel-provision structures .
the roughly one million people who live here depend mainly on firewood and wood charcoal for cooking and heating .
much of the logging activity in the virunga national park for the sale of timber and charcoal is controlled by rebel militia groups , which earn an estimated $ 30 million a year .
in order to put a stop to this illegal exploitation of resources by the charcoal mafia , the public needs alternatives that are affordable and sustainable .
outside the protected areas of the national park , the wwf is therefore overseeing a project to establish , maintain and exploit legal plantations for the production of fuel wood .
it also subsidizes the manufacture of energy-efficient ovens that consume 30 percent less fuel than previous ovens used hitherto .
the organization also trains rangers who work to clamp down on illegal loggers .
the project is already proving constructive , and helping to financially weaken the militias by providing the public with an alternative source for their fuel needs .
an important wilderness bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in drc , militias fund their activities with illegal wood trade the funds are partially provided from the international climate initiative , and kirchgatter hopes they can be put to good use across the entire congo basin .
its tropical forests are a haven for elephants , gorillas and other rare wildlife .
according to the wwf , the congo basin home to one-quarter of the world 's tropical forests and a mosaic of ecosystems – rivers , forests , savanna , swamps and flooded forests – which are teeming with life .
these forests regulate local climate and the flow of water , protect and enrich soils , control diseases and safeguard water quality .
reaching all the way to the atlantic coast , they also make up one of the most important wilderness areas left on the planet .
the wwf is planning to join forces with nasa next year to establish the exact size of its surface area using an optical remote sensing technology known as lidar , which can detect subtle topographic features such as river terraces and river channel banks , and measure the land surface elevation beneath the vegetation canopy .
the technology will allow researchers to establish forest density and even the precise amount of chlorophyll contained in different tree species .
with data provided by lidar , researchers will also be able to divide the congo basin into zones , isolating which areas are made up of primary forest and are therefore most in need of protection , and which areas could best be exploited by local populations .
the ultimate goal is to identify 15 percent of the congo basin as a protected area and thereby help preserve the habitats of species such as forest elephants , bonobo apes and various types of rare flora .
another project , run by the world resources institute , is putting the systems in place to implement effective strategies to reduce emissions from deforestation and forest degradation -lrb- known as redd . -rrb-
it is spearheading an innovative new project aimed at quantifying degradation and the greenhouse gas emissions in the forests of the republic of congo , and developing new methods to measure and monitor forest degradation .
the region will also be able to earn carbon credits by engaging in green carbon sequestering activities .
ideally , redd could deliver millions of dollars to impoverished communities in the congo basin in carbon credits , providing a powerful incentive to protect this land of great value to the planet .
but given that drc is one of the most corrupt nations in the world , negotiations are far from straightforward .
prioritizing needs of people and nature bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : preserving natural habitats in the congo basin is of global benefit nonetheless , johannes kirchgatter can already point to some successes , such as wwf programs in the lac tumba region in the western congo basin , some 1500 kilometers away from the virunga national park .
the region harbors a rich assemblage of terrestrial and aquatic biodiversity , and is an important provider of vital ecosystem services , including carbon sequestration , freshwater supplies , flood mitigation , and non-timber products for both subsistence and commercial use .
in wwf projects , locals are taught about land use planning ; protected area management and species conservation ; community-based natural resource management ; and livelihood improvement . the wwf hopes that 14,000 square kilometers of local forest can be preserved as a protected area and a further 65,000 square kilometers farmed sustainably .
given that the population is set to double in the next two decades , such measures are crucial .
but these valuable ecosystems will only survive if environmental priorities can be reconciled with the needs of local populations .

the photos include streets in the southern german town of oberstaufen , public spaces and soccer stadiums around the country . early on tuesday morning , google unveiled its first street view photographs in germany , honoring the bavarian town of oberstaufen to include " selected streets " where the company had sent its vehicles .
oberstaufen had previously explicitly invited google to their town , and even went so far as to bake the silicon valley company a cake , citing the potential for a boost in tourism .
earlier this year , the company announced it would launch street view in germany 's 20 largest cities , including berlin , hamburg and cologne , by the end of the year .
other specific locations around germany that are also available include a public square surrounded by historical buildings in dresden called the theaterplatz and a number of football stadiums , including munich 's allianz arena .
google said that there had been no reaction from government officials to the launch , despite all the controversy generated by the company 's plans for the last 18 months .
" we have n't heard anything from politicians or -lsb- data protection authorities -rsb- , " said lena wagner , a google germany spokesperson , in an interview with deutsche welle .
after government authorities complained , including consumer affairs minister ilse aigner and foreign affairs minister guido westerwelle , google eventually acquiesced to public pressure , providing an eight-week window , which ended last month , for german citizens to remove themselves from the service .
after the deadline , the california company announced that around 244,000 people had chosen to opt-out of the service , or under three percent of the total number of residents of the 20 selected cities .

in an interview last month with deutsche welle , wagner noted that despite their complaints , germans actually like using street view in other countries where it already exists , saying that hundreds of thousands of germans use it every week .
" we also know that germany is the number one country in terms of street view in all countries where we have n't launched street view yet , " she said .
despite the launch of google street view , germany is continuing to investigate possible privacy violations as google admitted that it had captured some " payload data " while scanning open wifi networks during the course of taking photographs for street view .
in late october , the company admitted that it had captured some e-mails and passwords .
those revelations failed to surprise johannes caspar , hamburg 's commissioner for data protection and freedom of information , who is a leading authority in the german google investigation .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de champions league -pipe- 02.11.2010 schalke and bremen limp into champions league fixtures großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : magath has bigger problems at home than in europe two of germany 's champions league representatives are beginning to fray at the edges at home .
both schalke and werder lost last weekend , but they may have different approaches to european competition . the champions league is meant to separate the men from the boys .
football connoisseurs enjoy pointing out that it is superior in quality to the world cup , and no less an authority than real madrid coach jose mourinho has said it is the best competition in the world .
but then he would , seeing as how he ’ s won it twice .
but in the group stages at least , the gulf between europe 's rich and poor leagues often belies this claim , and germany 's representatives in this season 's champions league seem to be finding europe 's best of the best a lot easier to cope with than unglamorous mid-table sides like nuremberg .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : raul and schalke did n't find hapoel to be much of a challenge bayern munich , last season 's champion 's league finalists , have only just broken into the top half of the table , but they are three from three in their easy european group .
but it is schalke , led by veteran coach felix magath and spear-headed on the pitch by spanish star raul , who are best at showing up what a questionable test the champions league group stages really are .
schalke are second from bottom in the league , having scraped together six points from 10 games - the exact same total they have notched up in their three champions league matches , thanks to routine wins against portugal 's benfica and israel 's hapoel tel aviv .
another win in tel aviv on tuesday and they will be well on their way out of the group .
superficial glory but there are of course many other factors at play .
as magath never tires of pointing out , schalke are struggling with new signings and a new system , and somehow the glamour and much-mooted ' magic ' of europe seems to lift veterans like raul , the champions league ’ s all-time top scorer .
the short-term glory of a much-needed win in europe is a balm for many sorrows .
after raul put two past hapoel a couple of weeks ago , there was much optimistic talk of " transferring " that form to the league , but saturday 's 1-0 home defeat to local rivals leverkusen ended with the players being booed off the pitch , and now schalke face the real prospect of replacing their dead title dreams with a relegation battle .
that is not much fun for internationally experienced stars like manuel neuer , klaas-jan huntelaar and christoph metzelder , and magath sounded pessimistic after the game .
" we have players who are used to playing for the top .
that 's why they ca n't cope with the situation , " newspaper bild quoted magath as saying . " the performance didn ’ t match our current position in the standings .
we have to try to avoid a tight situation at the bottom of the table . "
mid-table struggle for werder bremen , the problem is more subtle .
their league form is not good either , and they also just lost at home , to a solid but average nuremberg .
but their attacking line-up featuring the likes of claudio pizarro , hugo almeida , and marko marin are always good for a few goals , and they have at least consolidated mid-table status .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nuremberg held off bremen and stole an away win in europe , though , they face a scrap .
tuesday sees them host dutch champions fc twente , and the match is pretty much a do-or-die tie for both teams - they are both on two points , behind second-placed tottenham hotspur , who have four .
a defeat would signify pretty much the end of the competition for werder , and a draw does neither team much good .
werder 's frame of mind going into the match is pessimistic .
" the only chance we still have is getting three points , " marin said after saturday 's game .
" but that will be difficult .
the mood in the dressing room is not good . "
team captain torsten frings was livid after the defeat on saturday .
" we 're just being too careless with the situation , " he said , after railing against his team-mates as the final whistle went .
but he does not see the champions league match as a distraction , but a chance .
" it ’ s a good opportunity to take a big step forward , " he said .
the combination of having a fight on their hands , along with the fact that they will have something to prove to the weserstadion faithful , means they may well pull off a win against twente .
werder have more european experience , and home advantage should see them get past the dutch side , whom they held to a 1-1 draw in the netherlands .
for schalke , meanwhile , the champions league needs to be an afterthought .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : raul and schalke did n't find hapoel to be much of a challenge bayern munich , last season 's champion 's league finalists , have only just broken into the top half of the table , but they are three from three in their easy european group .
but it is schalke , led by veteran coach felix magath and spear-headed on the pitch by spanish star raul , who are best at showing up what a questionable test the champions league group stages really are .
schalke are second from bottom in the league , having scraped together six points from 10 games - the exact same total they have notched up in their three champions league matches , thanks to routine wins against portugal 's benfica and israel 's hapoel tel aviv .
another win in tel aviv on tuesday and they will be well on their way out of the group .

that is not much fun for internationally experienced stars like manuel neuer , klaas-jan huntelaar and christoph metzelder , and magath sounded pessimistic after the game .

their league form is not good either , and they also just lost at home , to a solid but average nuremberg .

werder 's frame of mind going into the match is pessimistic .
" the only chance we still have is getting three points , " marin said after saturday 's game .
" but that will be difficult .
the mood in the dressing room is not good . "
team captain torsten frings was livid after the defeat on saturday .
" we 're just being too careless with the situation , " he said , after railing against his team-mates as the final whistle went .

" it ’ s a good opportunity to take a big step forward , " he said .
the combination of having a fight on their hands , along with the fact that they will have something to prove to the weserstadion faithful , means they may well pull off a win against twente .
werder have more european experience , and home advantage should see them get past the dutch side , whom they held to a 1-1 draw in the netherlands .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de diplomacy -pipe- 02.11.2010 german foreign minister calls for free elections in belarus großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : westerwelle -lrb- left -rrb- ended a two-day diplomatic trip in minsk guido westerwelle has visited to belarus , the first german foreign minister to visit the authoritarian country in 15 years .
the visit came as strained relations with russia may be turning belarus westward . germany and poland reached out to belarus on tuesday as the two countries ' foreign ministers arrived for an official visit to the authoritarian state , dubbed by human rights groups as " the last dictatorship in europe . "
german foreign minister guido westerwelle made the trip , along with his polish counterpart radoslaw sikorski , at the end of a two-day tour of eastern europe , visiting moscow on monday and vilnius , lithuania earlier on tuesday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : election results in 2006 gave lukashenko 83 percent of the vote the visit represented a shift in german relations with belarus , which has not hosted a german foreign minister in 15 years , and comes less than two months before new presidential elections in the former soviet state on december 19 .
westerwelle met with president alexander lukashenko , who has been in power since 1994 and won the last election with 83 percent , as well as opposition candidates for president , who he said should have free access to state media .
" from our view of things , the presidential elections will be a litmus test for your commitment to democracy , " westerwelle told lukashenko during the meeting .
the allowance of international observers was a " step in the right direction . "
' window of opportunity ' for eu ahead of his trip to belarus , westerwelle said that an approach to the european union by belarus could happen " only if legal standards are met . "
but according to stefan meister , eastern europe expert at the german council on foreign relations , belarus has shown no interest in joining the eu .
and despite the bloc 's attempts to become a greater player on the world stage , he said the eu 's interests remain internal .
" european union has no instruments for countries which have no interest in joining , " he told deutsche welle .
" there is no real functioning policy towards this country , and i think this is also the reason why europe is not really successful towards belarus . "
bildunterschrift : russia cut off gas supplies to belarus in june over a payment dispute still , there are signs that belarus is interested in closer cooperation with the west .
ties with russia , historically its closest ally , hit a new low earlier in the year when russia cut off gas supplies to belarus over a payment dispute .
and according to meister , this may be the time for germany and the eu to step in .
" there is maybe a window of opportunity to get more in contact with lukashenko and his regime , " he said .
" maybe there 's a chance for some reforms or the beginning of a new process between the european union and belarus . "
' diplomatic offensive ' the german visit to belarus continues on wednesday , when chancellor angela merkel 's chief of staff ronald pofalla is to give a speech at the minsk forum , an even created in 1997 to facilitate dialogue between the two countries .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel 's chief of staff ronald pofalla speaks at the minsk forum on wednesday organizers of the event said pofalla would make a " robust " appeal for democratic reforms in belarus , and that germany was launching a " diplomatic offensive . "
poland and germany are two of the few countries in the european union that have taken an interest in belarus , meister said .
but despite their efforts to push democratic reforms , nothing can be expected in the immediate future - and certainly not before next month 's elections .
" if we observe the developments in the last month , we can see that -lsb- lukashenko -rsb- has been pressuring the opposition , that he pressures the media , " he said .
" he still has the same instruments of the regime to make everything clear for the next election . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de defense -pipe- 02.11.2010 britain and france sign ' historic ' defense treaties in london großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : carriers will be retrofitted to service both countries ' planes prime minister david cameron and president nicolas sarkozy insist their countries ' sovereignty is not threatened .
but critics suggest the idea of troops regularly serving under foreign command could cause problems . david cameron and nicolas sarkozy put pen to paper on two treaties in london .
the agreements will see britain and france jointly testing nuclear warheads , coordinating aircraft carriers so there is always a british or french vessel available for joint operations , and creating a combined expeditionary force training troops to deploy together .
france will also be allowed to use british a400m fuelling aircraft when there is spare capacity and there will be joint work on drones , mine counter-measures and satellite communications .
both men were keen to reject claims the move will diminish british or french sovereignty in any way .
david cameron insisted : bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain and france want to get closer and save money too " this is not , as some have suggested , about weakening or pooling british or french sovereignty .
this is not about a european army .
this is not about sharing our nuclear deterrents .
let me say this plainly : britain and france are , and will always remain , sovereign nations , able to deploy our armed forces independently and in our national interest when we choose to do so . "
david cameron ‘ s defence secretary liam fox has pointed out that it is not unusual for british troops to serve under foreign command - it happens often in nato operations .
the prime minister also said that uk forces are deployed alongside those of its allies on a regular basis , saying that " the vast bulk of our military operations - bosnia , kosovo , afghanistan , amongst others , have been conducted together with our allies . "
he added that such operations were always about defending britain 's national interest , and that they were " about practical , hard-headed co-operation between sovereign countries . "
france and britain have disagreed , even fairly recently , on military intervention - for example , on the invasion of iraq in 2003 .
so president sarkozy and prime minister cameron were sure to point out that a ' political agreement ' would have to be reached for the joint taskforce to be deployed .
sarkozy maintained , however , that france and britain already cooperated on major military operations and would continue to do so .
" if you , my british friends , have to face a major crisis , " said sarkozy , " could you imagine france simply sitting there , its arms crossed , saying that it 's none of our business ? "
' unprecedented and historic ' sarkozy did say , however , that the pacts demonstrated that britain and france were especially close at the moment , and hailed the anglo-french relationship : " this is an unprecedented decision and it shows a level of trust and confidence between our two nations that is unequalled in history . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france and britain , historical enemies , have grown quite close the french president , also aware that some analysts had described the pact as a signal of an overall weakening of combined british and french military power , was quick to dispel that notion . " we consider that the security effort should not in any way be drawn down in an increasingly dangerous world , which is that in which we live . "
the two leaders do both hope , however , that co-operation can lead to savings in costs .
the uk has recently announced cuts in its defense budget as part of its austerity drive and wants greater pooling of resources with france to help it maintain its military might , while bringing down its expense .
' big questions ' britain 's shadow defense secretary jim murphy welcomed the emphasis on greater co-operation in military matters , saying that deepening ties is ' essential ' to modern defense policy among allies .
however , he warned that " interdependence is different from dependence , and binding legal treaties pose some big questions for the government . "
murphy also said the uk could be entering " an era where we are reliant on our allies to fill in the gaps in the government 's defense policy . "
maintaining global might bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france sends its soldiers far and wide , but could stand to save money france and britain 's defense budgets are among the largest in the world .
both countries punch above their weight militarily and do not want to surrender their strategic advantage in this area .
alastair cameron , european security expert at the royal united services institute in london , thinks that is in little danger of happening , despite austerity drives .
" one could clearly be tempted to say that , forced to recognize their diminished stature in the world , these two countries are trying to do more together to avoid being overtaken by others , " he said . but cameron also said the two countries were such significant military contributors to global military operations that it would be hard to see much diminishment of their ambition to play a part on the global strategic scene .
" the military is facing a squeeze , of course , " said cameron , " but there is no doubt that their capacity , even under austerity measures , maintains an edge over a good number or other countries . "

with the genre already well established , writers are free to experiment . in his autobiographical graphic novel , " vier augen " -lrb- " four eyes " -rrb- , sascha hommer depicts some memorable events from his youth in germany 's black forest region .
this includes smoking with friends , dating a girl with an eating disorder and discovering lsd . he manages to capture these moments in a surprisingly small number of simple , black-and-white drawings , evoking the worries , fears and hopes of a young person growing up in a rural area .
the drawings contain little text , as he believes that complex descriptions are not always necessary for expressing important thoughts . " people say that what really counts is a good story - that pictures are not so important , " said hommer .
" but this style also conveys messages - not just in my books but also in the books of many of my role models . " bildunterschrift : ' vier augen ' deals with youth issues serious and funny many of the newer comics and graphic novels in germany deal with very serious topics , like hommer 's book , broaching the trying experiences of adolescence .
he has observed , however , that some young authors are trying to steer away from this kind of weightiness .
" the young comic writers that are now making their debut on the german market are much more easy-going about it , " explained hommer .
" they are going to bring the humor back into the comic genre . " dirk rehm , a spokesman for reprodukt , the publishing company behind hommer 's books , believes that there is a good reason for new writers to have a more relaxed approach to their work . " the younger writers can indeed be a lot more easy-going because they no longer have to prove that comics can be more than smut and trash - this was already accomplished by the last generation , " rehm told deutsche welle .
" they can just do what they feel like . " although reprodukt does publish a lot of comics of autobiographical and biographical nature , rhem says that it is in no way short on humorous and adventure-themed material either .
in addition to this , he has observed yet another new trend emerging within the genre : historical topics . ' hybrid ' literature bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hommer believes comics can convey complex thoughts hommer , a slim , dark-haired man in his early 30s , sees comics as a hybrid genre .
he started reading them at a very young age , as well as drawing pictures of his own .
he later went on to study illustration at the hamburg university of applied sciences , mentored by german comic author anke feuchtenberger . an official comic-writing degree does not exist at german universities as yet . at the moment , comics and graphic novels are receiving increasing attention in cultural media , and , according to hommer , they are also selling relatively well . " compared to small publishing companies that publish debut novels by unknown authors , the small comic publishers are very successful , " said hommer . hommer 's next book is going to tackle a serious topic .
it presents the short stories of brigitte kronauer , winner of the georg buechner prize - germany 's most important literary prize - in comic form . " i find ms kronauer 's texts great , " said hommer .
" in my adaptations i 'm trying to convey the same amount of information as her writing . " and if a picture really is worth a thousand words , that could make for one short comic book . author : dirk schneider , eva wutke editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

potentially connected parcel bombs have been sent to chancellor angela merkel 's office and embassies in greece .
the attacks follow mail bombs addressed to french president nicolas sarkozy among others on monday . the package containing explosives that was delivered to german chancellor angela merkel 's office was marked as coming from the greek economics ministry .
the recent bomb discovery comes after five embassies in athens have been targeted in mail box attacks on tuesday . two of the bombs exploded in front of the swiss embassy and a russian embassy compound , but did not cause any injuries , police in greece said .
other parcel bombs sent to the embassies of germany , bulgaria and chile were destroyed in controlled explosions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor merkel 's office and embassies in greece are under attack .
german interior minister thomas de maiziere said the parcel which arrived at chancellor merkel ’ s office resembled the bombs in greece .
suspects linked to far-left group the parcel ’ s delivery follows the arrest of two greek mail bomb suspects on monday who were accused of trying to send at least four parcel bombs to french president nicolas sarkozy and the mexican , dutch and belgian embassies .
the two men have been linked to a far-left group .
deutsche welle 's athens correspondent christine pirovolakis said that greek police are concerned since there were so many bombs at once circulating around in the greek capital .
the bombs are said to be sophisticated , although not powerful enough to cause great harm .
security sources said the package that made it to berlin was a " fast " explosive device that would have released a flame and caused burns had it detonated .
apparently it had not been a pipe bomb , or any other type of bomb that is designed to maim or kill with shrapnel .
similar bomb attacks in the past " one group under investigation is the ' sect of revolutionaries , ' a group that has committed other types of bomb attacks in the past , " pirovolakis said .
" in about a month 's time , we are going to have the two-year anniversary of a police shooting of a teenager , so last year around this time there was also an increase of bomb attacks in athens and it looks like it is the same this year as well . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : similar parcel bombs had been sent out on monday .
the police are starting to crack down , she added , saying that they were checking all governmental buildings and are searching individual visitors to them more closely .
also , parcels coming in and out of buildings are being rigorously screened for further investigation .
major streets in athens were also cut off to traffic .
elections in greece coming up some assume the parcel bombings could be happening due to greece 's austerity measures that have been implemented by the government .
" certainly the ways of attacks have increased since the teenage shooting a few years ago and of course the recent months since the austerity measures have been announced by the socialist government , " pirovolakis said .
" it looks like things are escalating once again .
there are also elections this coming weekend here in greece , so it looks like the left-wing groups are trying to in a way speak on behalf of the public how fed up they are with the austerity measures . "

the visit came as strained relations with russia may be turning belarus westward . germany and poland reached out to belarus on tuesday as the two countries ' foreign ministers arrived for an official visit to the authoritarian state , dubbed by human rights groups as " the last dictatorship in europe . "
german foreign minister guido westerwelle made the trip , along with his polish counterpart radoslaw sikorski , at the end of a two-day tour of eastern europe , visiting moscow on monday and vilnius , lithuania earlier on tuesday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : election results in 2006 gave lukashenko 83 percent of the vote the visit represented a shift in german relations with belarus , which has not hosted a german foreign minister in 15 years , and comes less than two months before new presidential elections in the former soviet state on december 19 .
westerwelle met with president alexander lukashenko , who has been in power since 1994 and won the last election with 83 percent , as well as opposition candidates for president , who he said should have free access to state media .
" from our view of things , the presidential elections will be a litmus test for your commitment to democracy , " westerwelle told lukashenko during the meeting .
the allowance of international observers was a " step in the right direction . "
' window of opportunity ' for eu ahead of his trip to belarus , westerwelle said that an approach to the european union by belarus could happen " only if legal standards are met . "
but according to stefan meister , eastern europe expert at the german council on foreign relations , belarus has shown no interest in joining the eu .
and despite the bloc 's attempts to become a greater player on the world stage , he said the eu 's interests remain internal .
" european union has no instruments for countries which have no interest in joining , " he told deutsche welle .
" there is no real functioning policy towards this country , and i think this is also the reason why europe is not really successful towards belarus . "
bildunterschrift : russia cut off gas supplies to belarus in june over a payment dispute still , there are signs that belarus is interested in closer cooperation with the west .
ties with russia , historically its closest ally , hit a new low earlier in the year when russia cut off gas supplies to belarus over a payment dispute .
and according to meister , this may be the time for germany and the eu to step in .
" there is maybe a window of opportunity to get more in contact with lukashenko and his regime , " he said .
" maybe there 's a chance for some reforms or the beginning of a new process between the european union and belarus . "
' diplomatic offensive ' the german visit to belarus continues on wednesday , when chancellor angela merkel 's chief of staff ronald pofalla is to give a speech at the minsk forum , an even created in 1997 to facilitate dialogue between the two countries .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel 's chief of staff ronald pofalla speaks at the minsk forum on wednesday organizers of the event said pofalla would make a " robust " appeal for democratic reforms in belarus , and that germany was launching a " diplomatic offensive . "
poland and germany are two of the few countries in the european union that have taken an interest in belarus , meister said .
but despite their efforts to push democratic reforms , nothing can be expected in the immediate future - and certainly not before next month 's elections .
" if we observe the developments in the last month , we can see that -lsb- lukashenko -rsb- has been pressuring the opposition , that he pressures the media , " he said .
" he still has the same instruments of the regime to make everything clear for the next election . "

the rules would force national nuclear authorities to draw up disposal plans to be vetted by the eu . europe 's energy chief said that the eu needed binding rules for the long-term storage of nuclear waste in europe , namely in deep underground bunkers that would be safe from accidents or sabotage .
" we have to make sure that we have the highest safety standards in the world to protect our citizens , " guenther oettinger said on wednesday in brussels .
" safety is indivisible .
if an accident happens in one country , it can have devastating effects also in others . " oettinger said the current situation within the eu , where most nuclear waste is stored in bunkers or warehouses until it cools down , is no longer acceptable .
the eu 's energy body says " deep geological repositories , " or caverns at depths of between 100 and 700 meters underground , are the best places to permanently store spent fuel rods , which can remain dangerous to humans for up to a million years .
the 50,000 cubic meters of waste generated by the eu annually is currently held in temporary above-ground facilities , although lower-grade nuclear waste , which includes such things as equipment from de-commissioned reactors , is permitted below ground .
oettinger is keen to change this because of surface storage facilities ' vulnerability to environmental damage and terrorist attacks . " the vast majority of experts agree that you need to have deep storage , in other words at least 300 meters below the earth 's surface , " he said .
the eu 's executive wants each of its member states to come up with a national plan for long-term storage within four years of new eu legislation .
those plans would then be vetted by oettinger 's team .
not so black and white bildunterschrift : where europe currently stores its waste but not everyone trusts the burial technique , which has never been put to the test due to the vast timeframes involved .
munich environmental institute board member christina hacker told deutsche welle that the problem is in the use of the word " safe " .
" who knows what is going to be safe for a million years ? " she asked .
" we have never had a depot like this before so it is impossible to guarantee its safety . "
proponents of the idea counter that rock provides a better natural barrier than any man-made constructions and that it is the best possible solution to a complex problem .
they say thirty years of research has established which geological structures are best for the job , and point to structures of clay in germany and granite in sweden .
but nuclear waste expert , stefan alt from the environmental research centre oeko-institut says there are some critical questions that need to be answered before any legislation can be signed off .
" storing waste deep under the ground is the most responsible way to go , " he told deutsche welle .
" but we still have to decide whether we will want access to it in the future or whether we want to seal it away forever . "
a bad precedent bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : burying nuclear waste has proved problematic in germany alt says the difficulties in predicting environmental changes over the next centuries and millennia make it impossible to foresee things like the condition of the containers five hundred years down the line .
furthermore , in light of revelations earlier this year that containers at the asse nuclear storage facility in germany had been damaged as a result of structural instability , he believes it could be wise to make waste accessible .
it 's an argument supported by local anti-nuclear campaigners .
udo dettmann , part of the asse ii community organization , told deutsche welle it would be a critical mistake to bury radioactive waste irreversibly .
" it if would stay deep under the ground that would be fine , but there is no proof that this will be the case over a period of one million years , " he said .
" the only way we have to correct mis-developments is to ensure access to the storage . "
he also said that there had been " insufficient " research into such sites , and that it would be irresponsible for the german government or the european commission to decide upon deep geological repositories without having thoroughly explored other options . politics versus security bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oettinger says current european rules for storing waste are unacceptable for the time being , though that the eu 's executive appears determined to find a long term , subterranean solution to the problem of dealing with nuclear waste .
in a recent article in a regional german newspaper , the badisches tagblatt , oettinger said he could foresee clusters of eu countries agreeing upon a collective waste-storage site .
he did not suggest which of the eu 's 27 member-states might prove suitable for such a facility , but stressed that he would not " tolerate the export of nuclear waste outside the european union . "
and while the idea of one country housing another country 's – or indeed several other countries ' – nuclear waste could itself prove politically tricky , stefan alt says that from a scientific point of view , it makes sense to find the best geological location possible .
" on this issue , security is more important than national boundaries , " he said .
" the alternative would mean that every country tried to locate sites which do n't even exist . "

potentially connected parcel bombs have been sent to chancellor angela merkel 's office and embassies in greece .
the attacks follow mail bombs addressed to french president nicolas sarkozy among others on monday . the package containing explosives that was delivered to german chancellor angela merkel 's office was marked as coming from the greek economics ministry .
the recent bomb discovery comes after five embassies in athens have been targeted in mail box attacks on tuesday . two of the bombs exploded in front of the swiss embassy and a russian embassy compound , but did not cause any injuries , police in greece said .
other parcel bombs sent to the embassies of germany , bulgaria and chile were destroyed in controlled explosions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor merkel 's office and embassies in greece are under attack .
german interior minister thomas de maiziere said the parcel which arrived at chancellor merkel ’ s office resembled the bombs in greece .
suspects linked to far-left group the parcel ’ s delivery follows the arrest of two greek mail bomb suspects on monday who were accused of trying to send at least four parcel bombs to french president nicolas sarkozy and the mexican , dutch and belgian embassies .
the two men have been linked to a far-left group .
deutsche welle 's athens correspondent christine pirovolakis said that greek police are concerned since there were so many bombs at once circulating around in the greek capital .
the bombs are said to be sophisticated , although not powerful enough to cause great harm .
security sources said the package that made it to berlin was a " fast " explosive device that would have released a flame and caused burns had it detonated .
apparently it had not been a pipe bomb , or any other type of bomb that is designed to maim or kill with shrapnel .
similar bomb attacks in the past " one group under investigation is the ' sect of revolutionaries , ' a group that has committed other types of bomb attacks in the past , " pirovolakis said .
" in about a month 's time , we are going to have the two-year anniversary of a police shooting of a teenager , so last year around this time there was also an increase of bomb attacks in athens and it looks like it is the same this year as well . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : similar parcel bombs had been sent out on monday .
the police are starting to crack down , she added , saying that they were checking all governmental buildings and are searching individual visitors to them more closely .
also , parcels coming in and out of buildings are being rigorously screened for further investigation .
major streets in athens were also cut off to traffic .
elections in greece coming up some assume the parcel bombings could be happening due to greece 's austerity measures that have been implemented by the government .
" certainly the ways of attacks have increased since the teenage shooting a few years ago and of course the recent months since the austerity measures have been announced by the socialist government , " pirovolakis said .
" it looks like things are escalating once again .
there are also elections this coming weekend here in greece , so it looks like the left-wing groups are trying to in a way speak on behalf of the public how fed up they are with the austerity measures . "

he wants to close them through the introduction of coordinated , pan-european measures . german interior minister thomas de maiziere has called for security precautions on air cargo jets to be stepped up . the best way to do this , he says , is through closer cooperation between security agencies .
" air freight has been relatively under-monitored up to now , " de maiziere told reporters .
" evidently they recognized that and exploited it .
this means changes for the air freight business . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : package bombs got through security at cologne-bonn airport de maiziere plans to discuss the issue at a meeting of european interior ministers later this week .
his goal is to introduce coordinated security procedures on a european level .
de maiziere 's statement followed the discovery over the weekend that a package containing explosives had passed through cologne-bonn airport undetected before being found in england .
the package had been dispatched from yemen and was bound for the united states .
observers say those who planted the explosives likely exploited lax security in the country from where the aircraft began its journey .
" there are some countries in which there are security gaps , " elmar giemulla , who teaches the air transport law at the technical university of berlin , told the german press agency in an interview .
" there are rules , but whether they are properly observed is another matter , " he said .
stricter checks the international civil aviation organization -lrb- icao -rrb- sets standards for its 190 member nations .
when freight is sent from europe , or from the united states , it is either inspected or it has to be packed by a so-called ' known consignor , ' which is regulated by the state .
but elsewhere measures are n't so strictly observed .
" we need to check the reliability and control measures of third states , " de maiziere said on a visit to cologne-bonn airport on monday .
in response to the discovery of the explosives , berlin has stopped all freight and passenger flights from yemen from entering german airspace .
yemen has criticized germany 's decision to ban flights from its airports , saying it needs help to fight terrorism , not punishment .

the photos include streets in the southern german town of oberstaufen , public spaces and soccer stadiums around the country . early on tuesday morning , google unveiled its first street view photographs in germany , honoring the bavarian town of oberstaufen to include " selected streets " where the company had sent its vehicles .
oberstaufen had previously explicitly invited google to their town , and even went so far as to bake the silicon valley company a cake , citing the potential for a boost in tourism .
earlier this year , the company announced it would launch street view in germany 's 20 largest cities , including berlin , hamburg and cologne , by the end of the year .
other specific locations around germany that are also available include a public square surrounded by historical buildings in dresden called the theaterplatz and a number of football stadiums , including munich 's allianz arena .
google said that there had been no reaction from government officials to the launch , despite all the controversy generated by the company 's plans for the last 18 months .
" we have n't heard anything from politicians or -lsb- data protection authorities -rsb- , " said lena wagner , a google germany spokesperson , in an interview with deutsche welle .
after government authorities complained , including consumer affairs minister ilse aigner and foreign affairs minister guido westerwelle , google eventually acquiesced to public pressure , providing an eight-week window , which ended last month , for german citizens to remove themselves from the service .
after the deadline , the california company announced that around 244,000 people had chosen to opt-out of the service , or under three percent of the total number of residents of the 20 selected cities .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bavarian town had previously baked a cake for google some houses are blurred as google promised , the removed houses show up as a blurry , translucent image , such as the house next to the buecher edele bookstore at hugo-von-koenigsegg strasse 13 in oberstaufen .
in an interview last month with deutsche welle , wagner noted that despite their complaints , germans actually like using street view in other countries where it already exists , saying that hundreds of thousands of germans use it every week .
" we also know that germany is the number one country in terms of street view in all countries where we have n't launched street view yet , " she said .
despite the launch of google street view , germany is continuing to investigate possible privacy violations as google admitted that it had captured some " payload data " while scanning open wifi networks during the course of taking photographs for street view .
in late october , the company admitted that it had captured some e-mails and passwords .
those revelations failed to surprise johannes caspar , hamburg 's commissioner for data protection and freedom of information , who is a leading authority in the german google investigation .
" this just confirms what we expected , " he told deutsche welle at the time , adding that the company could yet face fines .

no one was injured after a package from greece that contained explosive material arrived at the chancellery in berlin . there are still many questions about the mysterious package that arrived at chancellor angela merkel 's office in berlin on tuesday .
at least one thing is clear : the package did contain explosive materials .
that much was confirmed by interior minister thomas de maiziere on tuesday evening .
according to security sources in the capital , anyone who had opened the package would have been injured .
it did n't get that far , however , after the package was identified as suspicious during a routine mail inspection .
bomb defusing experts rendered the package harmless with a water cannon .
the chancellery was not evacuated as the mail room is in a separate building .
merkel was not in berlin during the incident as she is currently in belgium on an official visit .
she did say , however , that the recent series of package bombs from greece and yemen indicated a need for stricter controls on freight shipping in the european union , the united states , and around the globe .
" this is urgently about implementing stricter world-wide controls to prevent terror attacks , " merkel said in an interview with the passaue neue presse .
de maiziere points to greece bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : de maiziere confirmed the package was sent from greece de maiziere also confirmed that the package had been sent two days ago to berlin from greece , where several bombs addressed to foreign embassies have been intercepted and three have ignited .
the interior minister said , " today ’ s situation fits into that context . "
he confirmed media reports that the return address on the package was listed at the greek economics ministry .
greek authorities have suspended all international mail for 48 hours from tuesday as they conduct a further investigation .
bombs exploded at the swiss and russian embassies in athens on tuesday , while others addressed to the bulgarian , chilean and german embassies were discovered and detonated in controlled explosions .
greek police say they plan to detonate another two packages recently seized at athens airport .
on monday , authorities intercepted and defused several other packages with explosive material inside that were addressed to other embassies , as well as to french president nicolas sarkozy .
one package addressed to the mexican embassy ignited in delivery service office and burned the hands of an employee .
two men were arrested on monday in connection with the parcel bombs and greek police suspect far-left extremists are behind the attacks .
no connection with yemen initial theories about the incident included the possibility that the package could have been sent from yemen , the focus of recent security attention worldwide .
however , de maiziere said tuesday 's incident had nothing to do with yemen .
over the weekend two freight packages on their way to the us from yemen were intercepted in europe and dubai and found to contain bombs .
germany and other countries have responded by restricting both passenger and freight flights originating in yemen .

no one was injured after a package from greece that contained explosive material arrived at the chancellery in berlin . there are still many questions about the mysterious package that arrived at chancellor angela merkel 's office in berlin on tuesday .
at least one thing is clear : the package did contain explosive materials .
that much was confirmed by interior minister thomas de maiziere on tuesday evening .
according to security sources in the capital , anyone who had opened the package would have been injured .
it did n't get that far , however , after the package was identified as suspicious during a routine mail inspection .
bomb defusing experts rendered the package harmless with a water cannon .
the chancellery was not evacuated as the mail room is in a separate building .
merkel was not in berlin during the incident as she is currently in belgium on an official visit .
she did say , however , that the recent series of package bombs from greece and yemen indicated a need for stricter controls on freight shipping in the european union , the united states , and around the globe .
" this is urgently about implementing stricter world-wide controls to prevent terror attacks , " merkel said in an interview with the passaue neue presse .
de maiziere points to greece bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : de maiziere confirmed the package was sent from greece de maiziere also confirmed that the package had been sent two days ago to berlin from greece , where several bombs addressed to foreign embassies have been intercepted and three have ignited .
the interior minister said , " today ’ s situation fits into that context . "
he confirmed media reports that the return address on the package was listed at the greek economics ministry .
greek authorities have suspended all international mail for 48 hours from tuesday as they conduct a further investigation .
bombs exploded at the swiss and russian embassies in athens on tuesday , while others addressed to the bulgarian , chilean and german embassies were discovered and detonated in controlled explosions .
greek police say they plan to detonate another two packages recently seized at athens airport .
on monday , authorities intercepted and defused several other packages with explosive material inside that were addressed to other embassies , as well as to french president nicolas sarkozy .
one package addressed to the mexican embassy ignited in delivery service office and burned the hands of an employee .
two men were arrested on monday in connection with the parcel bombs and greek police suspect far-left extremists are behind the attacks .
no connection with yemen initial theories about the incident included the possibility that the package could have been sent from yemen , the focus of recent security attention worldwide .
however , de maiziere said tuesday 's incident had nothing to do with yemen .
over the weekend two freight packages on their way to the us from yemen were intercepted in europe and dubai and found to contain bombs .
germany and other countries have responded by restricting both passenger and freight flights originating in yemen .

however , in clubs and on dance floors , digital formats are changing the nature of djing in major ways .
in recent weeks , two berlin companies , native instruments and ableton , which both have a long history in the emerging digital djing market , have released new products that industry experts say are enhancing djs performance capabilities .
" ableton and native -lrb- instruments -rrb- seem to be two of the major players in this area at the moment , they keep development with djs in mind and keep the products coming fresh , " said mick wilson , the technology editor of dj magazine , in an interview with deutsche welle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the traktor kontrol s4 was released on monday native instrument 's traktor kontrol s4 was released on monday , and is an all-in-one approach to djing , allowing digital files to be performed and manipulated using a usb controller .
designed for portability , the controller allows for four different tracks to be loaded , sampled and mixed simultaneously .
similarly , ableton , in conjunction with the new zealand-based company serato , released its new software product , on september 22 .
" the bridge " integrates ableton live software , which allows djs to compose pieces , assemble tracks and play complete songs , with serato 's digital vinyl playback software .
this allows djs to manipulate all of these parts using specially produced vinyl records or cds .
both products are now making it easier for turntablists to hone their craft using entirely digital means .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ableton 's ceo called his company 's new product a " whole new level of excitement " berlin companies head in different directions while both ableton and native instruments claim to be innovators in the field of digital djing , they have chosen different directions to pursue .
" actually , this is just another piece to the puzzle of digital djing , but it 's the most outstanding piece because it 's the world 's first all-in-one computer based dj system , " said daniel haver , native instruments ' chief executive , in an interview with deutsche welle .
he added that native instruments ' " traktor kontrol s4 " also makes it far easier for djs to cut and loop segments of tracks , to essentially remix ‘ on the fly . '
" i can easily set a loop , shorten the loop , apply and effect and then drop it again , " explained constantin koehncke , a native instruments dj , as he demonstrated the product .
across town at ableton , the direction is integration but of a different kind .
" i think the bridge brings a whole new level of excitement to traditional djing , to be able to program your drum machines live , tweak you synthesizers live , that 's exciting , " said jeff milligan , of ableton .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bridge was released on september 22 competitors , but in different markets while both products have been in development for many years , taking many years in development , there should be no surprise that the two cross town rivals are keen to generate excitement about their products .
however , because both take different approaches to digital djing , it appears that they are not in direct competition .
" the two products are aimed at different areas of the market for different djs , it 's going to be both together not one or the other , " added mick wilson of dj magazine .
" i like them both , i like the idea of traktor and the new s4 controller looks really tasty as well .
i -lrb- also -rrb- like the idea of ' the bridge ' with ableton where you can play with an old school mentality but still incorporate modern production and remix capabilities . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de terrorism -pipe- 02.11.2010 europe not the primary target for yemen-based terrorists , say experts großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us remains the main target for terrorists in yemen the recent discovery of two printer cartridges loaded with explosives aboard two us-bound cargo flights has once again turned the world 's attention to the potential international terror threat emanating from yemen . the bombs , which were traced to the impoverished country on the arabian peninsula after being found at airports in britain and dubai , were described by us security experts as showing a higher degree of professionalism and sophistication than any devices previously linked to yemen 's al-qaeda wing - al-qaeda in the arabian peninsula -lrb- aqap -rrb- .
experts who investigated the failed bombing of a us-bound plane in december 2009 , an attempted attack later claimed by aqap , said that if the toner bombs had been constructed by yemeni al-qaeda operatives then the group had achieved a level of expertise previously unseen .
" if al-qaeda indeed made them , " former cia agent robert baer told the washington times , " then they 've teamed up with true professionals . "
the sophistication of the bombs helped them to pass undetected through explosives scanners at hubs such as britain 's east midlands airport and cologne-bonn , a fact that prompted the german government - along with britain , france , canada and the united states - to ban airfreight from yemen and extend the restrictions to include passenger flights originating there .
terrorism experts initially suggested that the cargo planes were targeted for explosion over densely populated cities but when it was revealed that the bombs made the first part of the journey on commercial tourism flights , some experts were then forced to revise their theories to include a potential strike against airborne passengers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sophistication of the bombs have surprised experts despite foiling the bomb plots before any lives were lost , us intelligence agencies are concerned that yemen-based terrorist groups are becoming increasingly advanced in their planning .
they are quickly learning not to underestimate the threat coming out of yemen 's impoverished , tribal landscape and are reviewing their risk assessment of the group 's potential international reach .
given the sophistication of the devices , their route through germany and the discovery of one of the bombs at britain 's east midlands airport , the nightmare scenario of aqap extending its reach to europe has put the continent 's anti-terror authorities on alert .
however , jeremy binnie , terrorism and insurgency editor at jane 's defense , believes that aqap has had the opportunity to attack european targets but has so far maintained its focus on the united states .
aqap had opportunity to hit europe but did n't , say experts " the data points we have suggest that the us remains aqap 's primary target , " binnie told deutsche welle .
" they could have blown up the toner bombs anywhere over europe but chose not to which suggests their final destination would have been the united states with detonation taking place over a densely-populated area to maximise casualties .
as with the christmas day attempt last year , the bomb travelled through europe destined for chicago but again , the bomb was not detonated in europe suggesting the target was clearly the us . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aqap boss nasser al-wahaishi leads the yemen franchise " aqap are very ambitious , " he added .
" they want to hit the ' head of the snake ' as osama bin laden calls the us , not washington 's partners .
attacking the us is al-qaeda 's primary objective as it creates the maximum amount of coverage , increases international pressure on governments like yemen 's to confront islamist militants and in turn destabilizes these countries , making them even more vulnerable to al-qaeda 's influence . "
henry wilkinson , the associate director of janusian security risk management , agreed that the us was more likely to be a target for aqap but that europe 's association with the us also put it at a certain amount of risk .
" i do n't think europe is any higher a priority target than the united states , " he told deutsche welle .
" aqap has made threats against all the western powers it argues are causing harm to muslims - by gift of military deployments in afghanistan or iraq , support for israel , or perceived offences against islam such as banning the veil .
i suspect the united states is the most sought after target , but europe seems to be the focus of more plots - i suspect because it is a softer target by gift of border security and a greater preponderance of local sympathisers . "
european nations equally at risk should aqap switch focus when asked if the discovery of a toner bomb in britain or the fact that it passed through germany on its route suggested either country was under specific threat , wilkinson disagreed .
" i do n't think there is any merit in suggesting any one country is at particular risk , " he said .
" aqap has threatened many countries and may have been involved in the kidnap and murder of several german nationals in northern yemen in 2009 .
in this respect , i think germany as a leading european country is as much at risk as france , the uk , or any other prominent european nation . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bombs could have gone off in cologne or britain - but did n't " if aqap or any other groups were intent on mounting an attack in europe , they would take into account operational viability and target opportunity , as well as political significance of attacking the country . "
while the high-profile cases coming out of yemen have certainly turned the world 's attention toward its situation , most experts consider other countries as regions more deserving of concern in relation to european security .
" we have not seen much evidence that aqap has the capability to mount long-lead , multi-cell operations in europe , and its record of attempting such operations have mostly focused on saudi arabia , " wilkinson said .
" while i think this latest incident has focussed minds on the threat from yemen , the hierarchy of threat concerns for most european governments very likely remains , in order , afghanistan-pakistan , somalia and then yemen . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de terrorism -pipe- 02.11.2010 europe not the primary target for yemen-based terrorists , say experts großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us remains the main target for terrorists in yemen the recent discovery of two printer cartridges loaded with explosives aboard two us-bound cargo flights has once again turned the world 's attentions to the potential international terror threat emanating from yemen . the bombs , which were traced to the impoverished country on the arabian peninsula after being found at airports in britain and dubai , were described by us security experts as showing a higher degree of professionalism and sophistication than any devices previously linked to yemen 's al-qaeda wing - al-qaeda in the arabian peninsula -lrb- aqap -rrb- .
experts who investigated the failed bombing of a us-bound plane in december 2009 , an attempted attack later claimed by aqap , said that if the toner bombs had been constructed by yemeni al-qaeda operatives then the group had achieved a level of expertise previously unseen .
" if al-qaeda indeed made them , " former cia agent robert baer told the washington times , " then they 've teamed up with true professionals . "
the sophistication of the bombs helped them to pass undetected through explosives scanners at hubs such as britain 's east midlands airport and cologne-bonn , a fact that prompted the german government - along with britain , france , canada and the united states - to ban airfreight from yemen and extend the restrictions to include passenger flights originating there .
terrorism experts initially suggested that the cargo planes were targeted for explosion over densely populated cities but when it was revealed that the bombs made the first part of the journey on commercial tourism flights , some experts were then forced to revise their theories to include a potential strike against airborne passengers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sophistication of the bombs have surprised experts despite foiling the bomb plots before any lives were lost , us intelligence agencies are concerned that yemen-based terrorist groups are becoming increasingly advanced in their planning .
they are quickly learning not to underestimate the threat coming out of yemen 's impoverished , tribal landscape and are reviewing their risk assessment of the group 's potential international reach .
given the sophistication of the devices , their route through germany and the discovery of one of the bombs at britain 's east midlands airport , the nightmare scenario of aqap extending its reach to europe has put the continent 's anti-terror authorities on alert .
however , jeremy binnie , terrorism and insurgency editor at jane 's defense , believes that aqap has had the opportunity to attack european targets but has so far maintained its focus on the united states .
aqap had opportunity to hit europe but did n't , say experts " the data points we have suggest that the us remains aqap 's primary target , " binnie told deutsche welle .
" they could have blown up the toner bombs anywhere over europe but chose not to which suggests their final destination would have been the united states with detonation taking place over a densely-populated area to maximise casualties .
as with the christmas day attempt last year , the bomb travelled through europe destined for chicago but again , the bomb was not detonated in europe suggesting the target was clearly the us . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aqap boss nasser al-wahaishi leads the yemen franchise " aqap are very ambitious , " he added .
" they want to hit the ' head of the snake ' as osama bin laden calls the us , not washington 's partners .
attacking the us is al-qaeda 's primary objective as it creates the maximum amount of coverage , increases international pressure on governments like yemen 's to confront islamist militants and in turn destabilizes these countries , making them even more vulnerable to al-qaeda 's influence . "
henry wilkinson , the associate director of janusian security risk management , agreed that the us was more likely to be a target for aqap but that europe 's association with the us also put it at a certain amount of risk .
" i do n't think europe is any higher a priority target than the united states , " he told deutsche welle .
" aqap has made threats against all the western powers it argues are causing harm to muslims - by gift of military deployments in afghanistan or iraq , support for israel , or perceived offences against islam such as banning the veil .
i suspect the united states is the most sought after target , but europe seems to be the focus of more plots - i suspect because it is a softer target by gift of border security and a greater preponderance of local sympathisers . "
european nations equally at risk should aqap switch focus when asked if the discovery of a toner bomb in britain or the fact that it passed through germany on its route suggested either country was under specific threat , wilkinson disagreed .
" i do n't think there is any merit in suggesting any one country is at particular risk , " he said .
" aqap has threatened many countries and may have been involved in the kidnap and murder of several german nationals in northern yemen in 2009 .
in this respect , i think germany as a leading european country is as much at risk as france , the uk , or any other prominent european nation . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bombs could have gone off in cologne or britain - but did n't " if aqap or any other groups were intent on mounting an attack in europe , they would take into account operational viability and target opportunity , as well as political significance of attacking the country . "
while the high-profile cases coming out of yemen have certainly turned the world 's attention toward its situation , most experts consider other countries as regions more deserving of concern in relation to european security .
" we have not seen much evidence that aqap has the capability to mount long-lead , multi-cell operations in europe , and its record of attempting such operations have mostly focused on saudi arabia , " wilkinson said .
" while i think this latest incident has focussed minds on the threat from yemen , the hierarchy of threat concerns for most european governments very likely remains , in order , afghanistan-pakistan , somalia and then yemen . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de defense -pipe- 02.11.2010 britain and france sign ' historic ' defense treaties in london großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : carriers will be retrofitted to service both countries ' planes prime minister david cameron and president nicolas sarkozy insist their countries ' sovereignty is not threatened .
but critics suggest the idea of troops regularly serving under foreign command could cause problems . david cameron and nicolas sarkozy put pen to paper on two treaties in london .
the agreements will see britain and france jointly testing nuclear warheads , coordinating aircraft carriers so there is always a british or french vessel available for joint operations , and creating a combined expeditionary force training troops to deploy together .
france will also be allowed to use british a400m fuelling aircraft when there is spare capacity and there will be joint work on drones , mine counter-measures and satellite communications .
both men were keen to reject claims the move will diminish british or french sovereignty in any way .
david cameron insisted : bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain and france want to get closer and save money too " this is not , as some have suggested , about weakening or pooling british or french sovereignty .
this is not about a european army .
this is not about sharing our nuclear deterrents .
let me say this plainly : britain and france are , and will always remain , sovereign nations , able to deploy our armed forces independently and in our national interest when we choose to do so . "
david cameron ‘ s defence secretary liam fox has pointed out that it is not unusual for british troops to serve under foreign command - it happens often in nato operations .
the prime minister also said that uk forces are deployed alongside those of its allies on a regular basis , saying that " the vast bulk of our military operations - bosnia , kosovo , afghanistan , amongst others , have been conducted together with our allies . "
he added that such operations were always about defending britain 's national interest , and that they were " about practical , hard-headed co-operation between sovereign countries . "
france and britain have disagreed , even fairly recently , on military intervention - for example , on the invasion of iraq in 2003 .
so president sarkozy and prime minister cameron were sure to point out that a ' political agreement ' would have to be reached for the joint taskforce to be deployed .
sarkozy maintained , however , that france and britain already cooperated on major military operations and would continue to do so .
" if you , my british friends , have to face a major crisis , " said sarkozy , " could you imagine france simply sitting there , its arms crossed , saying that it 's none of our business ? "
' unprecedented and historic ' sarkozy did say , however , that the pacts demonstrated that britain and france were especially close at the moment , and hailed the anglo-french relationship : " this is an unprecedented decision and it shows a level of trust and confidence between our two nations that is unequalled in history . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france and britain , historical enemies , have grown quite close the french president , also aware that some analysts had described the pact as a signal of an overall weakening of combined british and french military power , was quick to dispel that notion . " we consider that the security effort should not in any way be drawn down in an increasingly dangerous world , which is that in which we live . "
the two leaders do both hope , however , that co-operation can lead to savings in costs .
the uk has recently announced cuts in its defense budget as part of its austerity drive and wants greater pooling of resources with france to help it maintain its military might , while bringing down its expense .
' big questions ' britain 's shadow defense secretary jim murphy welcomed the emphasis on greater co-operation in military matters , saying that deepening ties is ' essential ' to modern defense policy among allies .
however , he warned that " interdependence is different from dependence , and binding legal treaties pose some big questions for the government . "
murphy also said the uk could be entering " an era where we are reliant on our allies to fill in the gaps in the government 's defense policy . "
maintaining global might bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france sends its soldiers far and wide , but could stand to save money france and britain 's defense budgets are among the largest in the world .
both countries punch above their weight militarily and do not want to surrender their strategic advantage in this area .
alastair cameron , european security expert at the royal united services institute in london , thinks that is in little danger of happening , despite austerity drives .
" one could clearly be tempted to say that , forced to recognize their diminished stature in the world , these two countries are trying to do more together to avoid being overtaken by others , " he said . but cameron also said the two countries were such significant military contributors to global military operations that it would be hard to see much diminishment of their ambition to play a part on the global strategic scene .
" the military is facing a squeeze , of course , " said cameron , " but there is no doubt that their capacity , even under austerity measures , maintains an edge over a good number or other countries . "

but with this unique ecosystem threatened by political unrest in the region , a series of projects aims to ensure they stay that way . the landscape around gisenyi in western rwanda , on the border to the democratic republic of the congo , is breathtakingly beautiful .
mount nyiragongo towers majestically over the city , which is contiguous with the city of goma across the border in drc .
but mount nyiragongo is an active volcano , known for its devastating eruptions .
eight years ago , goma was largely destroyed by lava .
time and again , locals here have rebuilt their devastated city in the aftermath of such eruptions , despite risks posed by the still-hot lava and the frequent earth tremors that occur in the wake of the eruption .
they see the volcano as both a blessing and a curse .
located inside the virunga national park north of goma and lake kivu , and just west of the border with rwanda , its fertile land has made it one of the most densely populated regions on the entire continent . it also boasts virgin forests that are home to some unique flora and fauna , as well as the world 's last remaining population of mountain gorillas .
alternatives to illegal logging after the 1994 genocide in rwanda , hundreds of thousands of refugees fled over the border to goma .
today , the city is home to many former victims and perpetrators who are seeking refuge here from rwandan justice .
what they have in common is the fact that they are all trying to " put down roots in an ecosystem that is not their native one , " as johannes kirchgatter from the world wide fund for nature , or wwf , in germany puts it . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nyungwe rainforest is home to rare mountain gorillas the flow of refugees has resulted in a major population increase in the region , which has proved to be a heavy burden on existing fuel-provision structures .
the roughly one million people who live here depend mainly on firewood and wood charcoal for cooking and heating .
much of the logging activity in the virunga national park for the sale of timber and charcoal is controlled by rebel militia groups , which earn an estimated $ 30 million a year .
in order to put a stop to this illegal exploitation of resources by the charcoal mafia , the public needs alternatives that are affordable and sustainable .
outside the protected areas of the national park , the wwf is therefore overseeing a project to establish , maintain and exploit legal plantations for the production of fuel wood .
it also subsidizes the manufacture of energy-efficient ovens that consume 30 percent less fuel than previous ovens used hitherto .
the organization also trains rangers who work to clamp down on illegal loggers .
the project is already proving constructive , and helping to financially weaken the militias by providing the public with an alternative source for their fuel needs .
an important wilderness bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in drc , militias fund their activities with illegal wood trade the funds are partially provided from the international climate initiative , and kirchgatter hopes they can be put to good use across the entire congo basin .
its tropical forests are a haven for elephants , gorillas and other rare wildlife .
according to the wwf , the congo basin home to one-quarter of the world 's tropical forests and a mosaic of ecosystems – rivers , forests , savanna , swamps and flooded forests – which are teeming with life .
these forests regulate local climate and the flow of water , protect and enrich soils , control diseases and safeguard water quality .
reaching all the way to the atlantic coast , they also make up one of the most important wilderness areas left on the planet .
the wwf is planning to join forces with nasa next year to establish the exact size of its surface area using an optical remote sensing technology known as lidar , which can detect subtle topographic features such as river terraces and river channel banks , and measure the land surface elevation beneath the vegetation canopy .
the technology will allow researchers to establish forest density and even the precise amount of chlorophyll contained in different tree species .
with data provided by lidar , researchers will also be able to divide the congo basin into zones , isolating which areas are made up of primary forest and are therefore most in need of protection , and which areas could best be exploited by local populations .
the ultimate goal is to identify 15 percent of the congo basin as a protected area and thereby help preserve the habitats of species such as forest elephants , bonobo apes and various types of rare flora .
another project , run by the world resources institute , is putting the systems in place to implement effective strategies to reduce emissions from deforestation and forest degradation -lrb- known as redd . -rrb-
it is spearheading an innovative new project aimed at quantifying degradation and the greenhouse gas emissions in the forests of the republic of congo , and developing new methods to measure and monitor forest degradation .
the region will also be able to earn carbon credits by engaging in green carbon sequestering activities .
ideally , redd could deliver millions of dollars to impoverished communities in the congo basin in carbon credits , providing a powerful incentive to protect this land of great value to the planet .
but given that drc is one of the most corrupt nations in the world , negotiations are far from straightforward .
prioritizing needs of people and nature bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : preserving natural habitats in the congo basin is of global benefit nonetheless , johannes kirchgatter can already point to some successes , such as wwf programs in the lac tumba region in the western congo basin , some 1500 kilometers away from the virunga national park .
the region harbors a rich assemblage of terrestrial and aquatic biodiversity , and is an important provider of vital ecosystem services , including carbon sequestration , freshwater supplies , flood mitigation , and non-timber products for both subsistence and commercial use .
in wwf projects , locals are taught about land use planning ; protected area management and species conservation ; community-based natural resource management ; and livelihood improvement . the wwf hopes that 14,000 square kilometers of local forest can be preserved as a protected area and a further 65,000 square kilometers farmed sustainably .
given that the population is set to double in the next two decades , such measures are crucial .
but these valuable ecosystems will only survive if environmental priorities can be reconciled with the needs of local populations .

but with this unique ecosystem threatened by political unrest in the region , a series of projects aims to ensure they stay that way . the landscape around gisenyi in western rwanda , on the border to the democratic republic of the congo , is breathtakingly beautiful .
mount nyiragongo towers majestically over the city , which is contiguous with the city of goma across the border in drc .
but mount nyiragongo is an active volcano , known for its devastating eruptions .
eight years ago , goma was largely destroyed by lava .
time and again , locals here have rebuilt their devastated city in the aftermath of such eruptions , despite risks posed by the still-hot lava and the frequent earth tremors that occur in the wake of the eruption .
they see the volcano as both a blessing and a curse .
located inside the virunga national park north of goma and lake kivu , and just west of the border with rwanda , its fertile land has made it one of the most densely populated regions on the entire continent . it also boasts virgin forests that are home to some unique flora and fauna , as well as the world 's last remaining population of mountain gorillas .
alternatives to illegal logging after the 1994 genocide in rwanda , hundreds of thousands of refugees fled over the border to goma .
today , the city is home to many former victims and perpetrators who are seeking refuge here from rwandan justice .
what they have in common is the fact that they are all trying to " put down roots in an ecosystem that is not their native one , " as johannes kirchgatter from the world wide fund for nature , or wwf , in germany puts it . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nyungwe rainforest is home to rare mountain gorillas the flow of refugees has resulted in a major population increase in the region , which has proved to be a heavy burden on existing fuel-provision structures .
the roughly one million people who live here depend mainly on firewood and wood charcoal for cooking and heating .
much of the logging activity in the virunga national park for the sale of timber and charcoal is controlled by rebel militia groups , which earn an estimated $ 30 million a year .
in order to put a stop to this illegal exploitation of resources by the charcoal mafia , the public needs alternatives that are affordable and sustainable .
outside the protected areas of the national park , the wwf is therefore overseeing a project to establish , maintain and exploit legal plantations for the production of fuel wood .
it also subsidizes the manufacture of energy-efficient ovens that consume 30 percent less fuel than previous ovens used hitherto .
the organization also trains rangers who work to clamp down on illegal loggers .
the project is already proving constructive , and helping to financially weaken the militias by providing the public with an alternative source for their fuel needs .
an important wilderness bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in drc , militias fund their activities with illegal wood trade the funds are partially provided from the international climate initiative , and kirchgatter hopes they can be put to good use across the entire congo basin .
its tropical forests are a haven for elephants , gorillas and other rare wildlife .
according to the wwf , the congo basin home to one-quarter of the world 's tropical forests and a mosaic of ecosystems – rivers , forests , savanna , swamps and flooded forests – which are teeming with life .
these forests regulate local climate and the flow of water , protect and enrich soils , control diseases and safeguard water quality .
reaching all the way to the atlantic coast , they also make up one of the most important wilderness areas left on the planet .
the wwf is planning to join forces with nasa next year to establish the exact size of its surface area using an optical remote sensing technology known as lidar , which can detect subtle topographic features such as river terraces and river channel banks , and measure the land surface elevation beneath the vegetation canopy .
the technology will allow researchers to establish forest density and even the precise amount of chlorophyll contained in different tree species .
with data provided by lidar , researchers will also be able to divide the congo basin into zones , isolating which areas are made up of primary forest and are therefore most in need of protection , and which areas could best be exploited by local populations .
the ultimate goal is to identify 15 percent of the congo basin as a protected area and thereby help preserve the habitats of species such as forest elephants , bonobo apes and various types of rare flora .
another project , run by the world resources institute , is putting the systems in place to implement effective strategies to reduce emissions from deforestation and forest degradation -lrb- known as redd . -rrb-
it is spearheading an innovative new project aimed at quantifying degradation and the greenhouse gas emissions in the forests of the republic of congo , and developing new methods to measure and monitor forest degradation .
the region will also be able to earn carbon credits by engaging in green carbon sequestering activities .
ideally , redd could deliver millions of dollars to impoverished communities in the congo basin in carbon credits , providing a powerful incentive to protect this land of great value to the planet .
but given that drc is one of the most corrupt nations in the world , negotiations are far from straightforward .
prioritizing needs of people and nature bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : preserving natural habitats in the congo basin is of global benefit nonetheless , johannes kirchgatter can already point to some successes , such as wwf programs in the lac tumba region in the western congo basin , some 1500 kilometers away from the virunga national park .
the region harbors a rich assemblage of terrestrial and aquatic biodiversity , and is an important provider of vital ecosystem services , including carbon sequestration , freshwater supplies , flood mitigation , and non-timber products for both subsistence and commercial use .
in wwf projects , locals are taught about land use planning ; protected area management and species conservation ; community-based natural resource management ; and livelihood improvement . the wwf hopes that 14,000 square kilometers of local forest can be preserved as a protected area and a further 65,000 square kilometers farmed sustainably .
given that the population is set to double in the next two decades , such measures are crucial .
but these valuable ecosystems will only survive if environmental priorities can be reconciled with the needs of local populations .

analysts say manufacturers ' emphasis on research and development is paying off . there 's no doubt that this has been a good year for german carmakers , and equally little doubt that that has much to do with china .
volkswagen , porsche , bmw and mercedes have all made their mark on the sprawling asian landmass and notched up sales figures that far outstripped their expectations .
in the first eight months of 2010 , the chinese car market almost doubled in size with german manufacturers securing a 53 percent increase on the sales of its cars .
in an interview in monday 's die welt newspaper , the president of the german association of the automotive industry -lrb- vda -rrb- , matthias wissmann , said that german manufacturers would have produced a total of 5.45 million passenger cars by the end of the year . the lion 's share will have gone to international markets .
bildunterschrift : destined for foreign roads : german cars enjoy a good reputation overseas " over the whole year , we are expecting exports to rise 21 percent , which equates to 4.15 million passenger cars , " wissmann said .
" the strength of the asian market , especially in china , and also the recovery of the us market , have fuelled exports . "
so far this year , chinese consumers have bought 1.3 million german vehicles .
development paid off wissmann cited the decision not to cap but increase development budgets during the crisis as one of the main reasons for the surge in popularity of german cars in asian countries .
he said it had given german manufacturers a technologically competitive edge and enabled them to come up with the right range of cars .
the vda president added that the german domestic market also performed better than had been expected in 2010 .
there had been worries that demand would stagnate following the government 's decision not to extend its car scrapping subsidy scheme , whereby german car owners were paid 2,500 euros -lrb- $ 3,470 -rrb- if they traded in a vehicle that was at least nine years old and purchased a brand new one .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as company profits rise , auto workers want higher pay workers have responded to the flourishing market with calls for wage increases planned for 2011 to be introduced early .
audi and other parts of the volkswagen concern , whose operating profit had trebled by the end of the third quarter to 4.8 billion euros , have already agreed to an increase .
bmw , porsche and daimler have yet to make a decision .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 02.11.2010 google street view debuts in germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oberstaufen is the first to have street view photos after a several-month-long public row , google has published street-level images in germany .
the photos include streets in the southern german town of oberstaufen , public spaces and soccer stadiums around the country . early on tuesday morning , google unveiled its first street view photographs in germany , honoring the bavarian town of oberstaufen to include " selected streets " where the company had sent its vehicles .
oberstaufen had previously explicitly invited google to their town , and even went so far as to bake the silicon valley company a cake , citing the potential for a boost in tourism .
earlier this year , the company announced it would launch street view in germany 's 20 largest cities , including berlin , hamburg and cologne , by the end of the year .
other specific locations around germany that are also available include a public square surrounded by historical buildings in dresden called the theaterplatz and a number of football stadiums , including munich 's allianz arena .
google said that there had been no reaction from government officials to the launch , despite all the controversy generated by the company 's plans for the last 18 months .
" we have n't heard anything from politicians or -lsb- data protection authorities -rsb- , " said lena wagner , a google germany spokesperson , in an interview with deutsche welle .
after government authorities complained , including consumer affairs minister ilse aigner and foreign affairs minister guido westerwelle , google eventually acquiesced to public pressure , providing an eight-week window , which ended last month , for german citizens to remove themselves from the service .
after the deadline , the california company announced that around 244,000 people had chosen to opt-out of the service , or under three percent of the total number of residents of the 20 selected cities .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bavarian town had previously baked a cake for google some houses are blurred as google promised , the removed houses show up as a blurry , translucent image , such as the house next to the buecher edele bookstore at hugo-von-koenigsegg strasse 13 in oberstaufen .
in an interview last month with deutsche welle , wagner noted that despite their complaints , germans actually like using street view in other countries where it already exists , saying that hundreds of thousands of germans use it every week .
" we also know that germany is the number one country in terms of street view in all countries where we have n't launched street view yet , " she said .
despite the launch of google street view , germany is continuing to investigate possible privacy violations as google admitted that it had captured some " payload data " while scanning open wifi networks during the course of taking photographs for street view .
in late october , the company admitted that it had captured some e-mails and passwords .
those revelations failed to surprise johannes caspar , hamburg 's commissioner for data protection and freedom of information , who is a leading authority in the german google investigation .
" this just confirms what we expected , " he told deutsche welle at the time , adding that the company could yet face fines .

another bomb exploded at the russian embassy without injury .
earlier , a suspicious package was discovered at the bulgarian embassy , which was then cordoned off for a bomb squad to destroy the suspect package with a controlled blast .
one package addressed to the chilean embassy was detonated by police in a mail delivery van outside parliament in athens , while one addressed to the german embassy was discovered at the office of a courier company .
the blasts come a day after police foiled a parcel-bombing campaign in the city on monday .
authorities intercepted and defused several other packages with explosive material inside that were addressed to other embassies .
one bomb exploded at a delivery service , leaving a worker hospitalized with burns .

however , in clubs and on dance floors , digital formats are changing the nature of djing in major ways .
in recent weeks , two berlin companies , native instruments and ableton , which both have a long history in the emerging digital djing market , have released new products that industry experts say are enhancing djs performance capabilities .
" ableton and native -lrb- instruments -rrb- seem to be two of the major players in this area at the moment , they keep development with djs in mind and keep the products coming fresh , " said mick wilson , the technology editor of dj magazine , in an interview with deutsche welle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the traktor kontrol s4 was released on monday native instrument 's traktor kontrol s4 was released on monday , and is an all-in-one approach to djing , allowing digital files to be performed and manipulated using a usb controller .
designed for portability , the controller allows for four different tracks to be loaded , sampled and mixed simultaneously .
similarly , ableton , in conjunction with the new zealand-based company serato , released its new software product , on september 22 .
" the bridge " integrates ableton live software , which allows djs to compose pieces , assemble tracks and play complete songs , with serato 's digital vinyl playback software .
this allows djs to manipulate all of these parts using specially produced vinyl records or cds .
both products are now making it easier for turntablists to hone their craft using entirely digital means .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ableton 's ceo called his company 's new product a " whole new level of excitement " berlin companies head in different directions while both ableton and native instruments claim to be innovators in the field of digital djing , they have chosen different directions to pursue .
" actually , this is just another piece to the puzzle of digital djing , but it 's the most outstanding piece because it 's the world 's first all-in-one computer based dj system , " said daniel haver , native instruments ' chief executive , in an interview with deutsche welle .
he added that native instruments ' " traktor kontrol s4 " also makes it far easier for djs to cut and loop segments of tracks , to essentially remix ‘ on the fly . '
" i can easily set a loop , shorten the loop , apply and effect and then drop it again , " explained constantin koehncke , a native instruments dj , as he demonstrated the product .
across town at ableton , the direction is integration but of a different kind .
" i think the bridge brings a whole new level of excitement to traditional djing , to be able to program your drum machines live , tweak you synthesizers live , that 's exciting , " said jeff milligan , of ableton .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bridge was released on september 22 competitors , but in different markets while both products have been in development for many years , taking many years in development , there should be no surprise that the two cross town rivals are keen to generate excitement about their products .
however , because both take different approaches to digital djing , it appears that they are not in direct competition .
" the two products are aimed at different areas of the market for different djs , it 's going to be both together not one or the other , " added mick wilson of dj magazine .
" i like them both , i like the idea of traktor and the new s4 controller looks really tasty as well .
i -lrb- also -rrb- like the idea of ' the bridge ' with ableton where you can play with an old school mentality but still incorporate modern production and remix capabilities . "

he also called on nato to work more closely with china on the exchange of information about cyber attacks . zu guttenberg met with his chinese counterpart liang guanglie on tuesday , calling on beijing to do more to help stabilize afghanistan in the face of a growing insurgency and worsening violence .
however , he stressed there was no military role for the chinese to play there . " we have a shared interest when it comes to the question of at what time do we reach a stable , or at least an agreeably stable , afghanistan , with a state of security that we can accept , " zu guttenberg said in beijing . china is not involved in the war in afghanistan , but has economic interests there . zu guttenberg said training civil servants was one area in which china could step up its involvement . " when it comes to goals we can reach and we have to reach , i think , the neighbors can also play a significant role .
we have to look at the most important neighbors as well and china is one of them , " he said . mineral wealth china would benefit from a stable afghanistan because it would be easier for its firms to complete billion-dollar resource deals they have or are considering . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china is reluctant to get more involved in a war-torn afghanistan the us defense department estimated earlier this year afghanistan 's mineral resources could top $ 1 trillion -lrb- 0.7 trillion euros -rrb- . how to stabilize afghanistan will be a major issue at a nato summit in lisbon later this month and in us president barack obama 's strategy review in december . germany is the third-largest contributor to the nato-led force in afghanistan with about 4,600 troops and , like the united states , is looking at starting a partial withdrawal in 2011 . closer cooperation on cyber crime zu guttenberg has also been discussing bilateral relations , closer relations with nato , the fight against piracy and cyber security . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zu guttenberg wants better cooperation on cyber attacks with regards to the struggle against cyber attacks , zu guttenberg called for a better exchange of information between nato and china . " i can see a lot of room for improvement " , he said , adding that waging war with computers through the internet was now a " sad reality and of growing importance " . security policy cooperation between china and germany has been in place for years .
the german armed forces have trained more than 100 chinese officers and military leaders from both countries meet regularly for a strategic dialogue and security policy seminars . author : natalia dannenberg -lrb- dpa , reuters -rrb- editor : rob mudge send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but with this unique ecosystem threatened by political unrest in the region , a series of projects aims to ensure they stay that way . the landscape around gisenyi in western rwanda , on the border to the democratic republic of the congo , is breathtakingly beautiful .
mount nyiragongo towers majestically over the city , which is contiguous with the city of goma across the border in drc .
but mount nyiragongo is an active volcano , known for its devastating eruptions .
eight years ago , goma was largely destroyed by lava .
time and again , locals here have rebuilt their devastated city in the aftermath of such eruptions , despite risks posed by the still-hot lava and the frequent earth tremors that occur in the wake of the eruption .
they see the volcano as both a blessing and a curse .
located inside the virunga national park north of goma and lake kivu , and just west of the border with rwanda , its fertile land has made it one of the most densely populated regions on the entire continent . it also boasts virgin forests that are home to some unique flora and fauna , as well as the world 's last remaining population of mountain gorillas .
alternatives to illegal logging after the 1994 genocide in rwanda , hundreds of thousands of refugees fled over the border to goma .
today , the city is home to many former victims and perpetrators who are seeking refuge here from rwandan justice .
what they have in common is the fact that they are all trying to " put down roots in an ecosystem that is not their native one , " as johannes kirchgatter from the world wide fund for nature , or wwf , in germany puts it . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nyungwe rainforest is home to rare mountain gorillas the flow of refugees has resulted in a major population increase in the region , which has proved to be a heavy burden on existing fuel-provision structures .
the roughly one million people who live here depend mainly on firewood and wood charcoal for cooking and heating .
much of the logging activity in the virunga national park for the sale of timber and charcoal is controlled by rebel militia groups , which earn an estimated $ 30 million a year .
in order to put a stop to this illegal exploitation of resources by the charcoal mafia , the public needs alternatives that are affordable and sustainable .
outside the protected areas of the national park , the wwf is therefore overseeing a project to establish , maintain and exploit legal plantations for the production of fuel wood .
it also subsidizes the manufacture of energy-efficient ovens that consume 30 percent less fuel than previous ovens used hitherto .
the organization also trains rangers who work to clamp down on illegal loggers .
the project is already proving constructive , and helping to financially weaken the militias by providing the public with an alternative source for their fuel needs .
an important wilderness bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in drc , militias fund their activities with illegal wood trade the funds are partially provided from the international climate initiative , and kirchgatter hopes they can be put to good use across the entire congo basin .
its tropical forests are a haven for elephants , gorillas and other rare wildlife .
according to the wwf , the congo basin home to one-quarter of the world 's tropical forests and a mosaic of ecosystems – rivers , forests , savanna , swamps and flooded forests – which are teeming with life .
these forests regulate local climate and the flow of water , protect and enrich soils , control diseases and safeguard water quality .
reaching all the way to the atlantic coast , they also make up one of the most important wilderness areas left on the planet .
the wwf is planning to join forces with nasa next year to establish the exact size of its surface area using an optical remote sensing technology known as lidar , which can detect subtle topographic features such as river terraces and river channel banks , and measure the land surface elevation beneath the vegetation canopy .
the technology will allow researchers to establish forest density and even the precise amount of chlorophyll contained in different tree species .
with data provided by lidar , researchers will also be able to divide the congo basin into zones , isolating which areas are made up of primary forest and are therefore most in need of protection , and which areas could best be exploited by local populations .
the ultimate goal is to identify 15 percent of the congo basin as a protected area and thereby help preserve the habitats of species such as forest elephants , bonobo apes and various types of rare flora .
another project , run by the world resources institute , is putting the systems in place to implement effective strategies to reduce emissions from deforestation and forest degradation -lrb- known as redd . -rrb-
it is spearheading an innovative new project aimed at quantifying degradation and the greenhouse gas emissions in the forests of the republic of congo , and developing new methods to measure and monitor forest degradation .
the region will also be able to earn carbon credits by engaging in green carbon sequestering activities .
ideally , redd could deliver millions of dollars to impoverished communities in the congo basin in carbon credits , providing a powerful incentive to protect this land of great value to the planet .
but given that drc is one of the most corrupt nations in the world , negotiations are far from straightforward .
prioritizing needs of people and nature bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : preserving natural habitats in the congo basin is of global benefit nonetheless , johannes kirchgatter can already point to some successes , such as wwf programs in the lac tumba region in the western congo basin , some 1500 kilometers away from the virunga national park .
the region harbors a rich assemblage of terrestrial and aquatic biodiversity , and is an important provider of vital ecosystem services , including carbon sequestration , freshwater supplies , flood mitigation , and non-timber products for both subsistence and commercial use .
in wwf projects , locals are taught about land use planning ; protected area management and species conservation ; community-based natural resource management ; and livelihood improvement . the wwf hopes that 14,000 square kilometers of local forest can be preserved as a protected area and a further 65,000 square kilometers farmed sustainably .
given that the population is set to double in the next two decades , such measures are crucial .
but these valuable ecosystems will only survive if environmental priorities can be reconciled with the needs of local populations .

the region harbors a rich assemblage of terrestrial and aquatic biodiversity , and is an important provider of vital ecosystem services , including carbon sequestration , freshwater supplies , flood mitigation , and non-timber products for both subsistence and commercial use .
in wwf projects , locals are taught about land use planning ; protected area management and species conservation ; community-based natural resource management ; and livelihood improvement . the wwf hopes that 14,000 square kilometers of local forest can be preserved as a protected area and a further 65,000 square kilometers farmed sustainably .
given that the population is set to double in the next two decades , such measures are crucial .
but these valuable ecosystems will only survive if environmental priorities can be reconciled with the needs of local populations .

experts who investigated the failed bombing of a us-bound plane in december 2009 , an attempted attack later claimed by aqap , said that if the toner bombs had been constructed by yemeni al-qaeda operatives then the group had achieved a level of expertise previously unseen .
" if al-qaeda indeed made them , " former cia agent robert baer told the washington times , " then they 've teamed up with true professionals . "
the sophistication of the bombs helped them to pass undetected through explosives scanners at hubs such as britain 's east midlands airport and cologne-bonn , a fact that prompted the german government - along with britain , france , canada and the united states - to ban airfreight from yemen and extend the restrictions to include passenger flights originating there .
terrorism experts initially suggested that the cargo planes were targeted for explosion over densely populated cities but when it was revealed that the bombs made the first part of the journey on commercial tourism flights , some experts were then forced to revise their theories to include a potential strike against airborne passengers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sophistication of the bombs have surprised experts despite foiling the bomb plots before any lives were lost , us intelligence agencies are concerned that yemen-based terrorist groups are becoming increasingly advanced in their planning .
they are quickly learning not to underestimate the threat coming out of yemen 's impoverished , tribal landscape and are reviewing their risk assessment of the group 's potential international reach .
given the sophistication of the devices , their route through germany and the discovery of one of the bombs at britain 's east midlands airport , the nightmare scenario of aqap extending its reach to europe has put the continent 's anti-terror authorities on alert .
however , jeremy binnie , terrorism and insurgency editor at jane 's defense , believes that aqap has had the opportunity to attack european targets but has so far maintained its focus on the united states .
aqap had opportunity to hit europe but did n't , say experts " the data points we have suggest that the us remains aqap 's primary target , " binnie told deutsche welle .
" they could have blown up the toner bombs anywhere over europe but chose not to which suggests their final destination would have been the united states with detonation taking place over a densely-populated area to maximise casualties .
as with the christmas day attempt last year , the bomb travelled through europe destined for chicago but again , the bomb was not detonated in europe suggesting the target was clearly the us . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aqap boss nasser al-wahaishi leads the yemen franchise " aqap are very ambitious , " he added .
" they want to hit the ' head of the snake ' as osama bin laden calls the us , not washington 's partners .
attacking the us is al-qaeda 's primary objective as it creates the maximum amount of coverage , increases international pressure on governments like yemen 's to confront islamist militants and in turn destabilizes these countries , making them even more vulnerable to al-qaeda 's influence . "
henry wilkinson , the associate director of janusian security risk management , agreed that the us was more likely to be a target for aqap but that europe 's association with the us also put it at a certain amount of risk .
" i do n't think europe is any higher a priority target than the united states , " he told deutsche welle .
" aqap has made threats against all the western powers it argues are causing harm to muslims - by gift of military deployments in afghanistan or iraq , support for israel , or perceived offences against islam such as banning the veil .
i suspect the united states is the most sought after target , but europe seems to be the focus of more plots - i suspect because it is a softer target by gift of border security and a greater preponderance of local sympathisers . "
european nations equally at risk should aqap switch focus when asked if the discovery of a toner bomb in britain or the fact that it passed through germany on its route suggested either country was under specific threat , wilkinson disagreed .
" i do n't think there is any merit in suggesting any one country is at particular risk , " he said .
" aqap has threatened many countries and may have been involved in the kidnap and murder of several german nationals in northern yemen in 2009 .
in this respect , i think germany as a leading european country is as much at risk as france , the uk , or any other prominent european nation . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bombs could have gone off in cologne or britain - but did n't " if aqap or any other groups were intent on mounting an attack in europe , they would take into account operational viability and target opportunity , as well as political significance of attacking the country . "
while the high-profile cases coming out of yemen have certainly turned the world 's attention toward its situation , most experts consider other countries as regions more deserving of concern in relation to european security .
" we have not seen much evidence that aqap has the capability to mount long-lead , multi-cell operations in europe , and its record of attempting such operations have mostly focused on saudi arabia , " wilkinson said .
" while i think this latest incident has focussed minds on the threat from yemen , the hierarchy of threat concerns for most european governments very likely remains , in order , afghanistan-pakistan , somalia and then yemen . "

but with this unique ecosystem threatened by political unrest in the region , a series of projects aims to ensure they stay that way . the landscape around gisenyi in western rwanda , on the border to the democratic republic of the congo , is breathtakingly beautiful .
mount nyiragongo towers majestically over the city , which is contiguous with the city of goma across the border in drc .
but mount nyiragongo is an active volcano , known for its devastating eruptions .
eight years ago , goma was largely destroyed by lava .
time and again , locals here have rebuilt their devastated city in the aftermath of such eruptions , despite risks posed by the still-hot lava and the frequent earth tremors that occur in the wake of the eruption .
they see the volcano as both a blessing and a curse .
located inside the virunga national park north of goma and lake kivu , and just west of the border with rwanda , its fertile land has made it one of the most densely populated regions on the entire continent . it also boasts virgin forests that are home to some unique flora and fauna , as well as the world 's last remaining population of mountain gorillas .
alternatives to illegal logging after the 1994 genocide in rwanda , hundreds of thousands of refugees fled over the border to goma .
today , the city is home to many former victims and perpetrators who are seeking refuge here from rwandan justice .
what they have in common is the fact that they are all trying to " put down roots in an ecosystem that is not their native one , " as johannes kirchgatter from the world wide fund for nature , or wwf , in germany puts it . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nyungwe rainforest is home to rare mountain gorillas the flow of refugees has resulted in a major population increase in the region , which has proved to be a heavy burden on existing fuel-provision structures .
the roughly one million people who live here depend mainly on firewood and wood charcoal for cooking and heating .
much of the logging activity in the virunga national park for the sale of timber and charcoal is controlled by rebel militia groups , which earn an estimated $ 30 million a year .
in order to put a stop to this illegal exploitation of resources by the charcoal mafia , the public needs alternatives that are affordable and sustainable .
outside the protected areas of the national park , the wwf is therefore overseeing a project to establish , maintain and exploit legal plantations for the production of fuel wood .
it also subsidizes the manufacture of energy-efficient ovens that consume 30 percent less fuel than previous ovens used hitherto .
the organization also trains rangers who work to clamp down on illegal loggers .
the project is already proving constructive , and helping to financially weaken the militias by providing the public with an alternative source for their fuel needs .
an important wilderness bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in drc , militias fund their activities with illegal wood trade the funds are partially provided from the international climate initiative , and kirchgatter hopes they can be put to good use across the entire congo basin .
its tropical forests are a haven for elephants , gorillas and other rare wildlife .
according to the wwf , the congo basin home to one-quarter of the world 's tropical forests and a mosaic of ecosystems – rivers , forests , savanna , swamps and flooded forests – which are teeming with life .
these forests regulate local climate and the flow of water , protect and enrich soils , control diseases and safeguard water quality .
reaching all the way to the atlantic coast , they also make up one of the most important wilderness areas left on the planet .
the wwf is planning to join forces with nasa next year to establish the exact size of its surface area using an optical remote sensing technology known as lidar , which can detect subtle topographic features such as river terraces and river channel banks , and measure the land surface elevation beneath the vegetation canopy .
the technology will allow researchers to establish forest density and even the precise amount of chlorophyll contained in different tree species .
with data provided by lidar , researchers will also be able to divide the congo basin into zones , isolating which areas are made up of primary forest and are therefore most in need of protection , and which areas could best be exploited by local populations .
the ultimate goal is to identify 15 percent of the congo basin as a protected area and thereby help preserve the habitats of species such as forest elephants , bonobo apes and various types of rare flora .
another project , run by the world resources institute , is putting the systems in place to implement effective strategies to reduce emissions from deforestation and forest degradation -lrb- known as redd . -rrb-
it is spearheading an innovative new project aimed at quantifying degradation and the greenhouse gas emissions in the forests of the republic of congo , and developing new methods to measure and monitor forest degradation .
the region will also be able to earn carbon credits by engaging in green carbon sequestering activities .
ideally , redd could deliver millions of dollars to impoverished communities in the congo basin in carbon credits , providing a powerful incentive to protect this land of great value to the planet .
but given that drc is one of the most corrupt nations in the world , negotiations are far from straightforward .
prioritizing needs of people and nature bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : preserving natural habitats in the congo basin is of global benefit nonetheless , johannes kirchgatter can already point to some successes , such as wwf programs in the lac tumba region in the western congo basin , some 1500 kilometers away from the virunga national park .
the region harbors a rich assemblage of terrestrial and aquatic biodiversity , and is an important provider of vital ecosystem services , including carbon sequestration , freshwater supplies , flood mitigation , and non-timber products for both subsistence and commercial use .
in wwf projects , locals are taught about land use planning ; protected area management and species conservation ; community-based natural resource management ; and livelihood improvement . the wwf hopes that 14,000 square kilometers of local forest can be preserved as a protected area and a further 65,000 square kilometers farmed sustainably .
given that the population is set to double in the next two decades , such measures are crucial .
but these valuable ecosystems will only survive if environmental priorities can be reconciled with the needs of local populations .

but then he would , seeing as how he ’ s won it twice .
but in the group stages at least , the gulf between europe 's rich and poor leagues often belies this claim , and germany 's representatives in this season 's champions league seem to be finding europe 's best of the best a lot easier to cope with than unglamorous mid-table sides like nuremberg .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : raul and schalke did n't find hapoel to be much of a challenge bayern munich , last season 's champion 's league finalists , have only just broken into the top half of the table , but they are three from three in their easy european group .
but it is schalke , led by veteran coach felix magath and spear-headed on the pitch by spanish star raul , who are best at showing up what a questionable test the champions league group stages really are .
schalke are second from bottom in the league , having scraped together six points from 10 games - the exact same total they have notched up in their three champions league matches , thanks to routine wins against portugal 's benfica and israel 's hapoel tel aviv .
another win in tel aviv on tuesday and they will be well on their way out of the group .
superficial glory but there are of course many other factors at play .
as magath never tires of pointing out , schalke are struggling with new signings and a new system , and somehow the glamour and much-mooted ' magic ' of europe seems to lift veterans like raul , the champions league ’ s all-time top scorer .
the short-term glory of a much-needed win in europe is a balm for many sorrows .
after raul put two past hapoel a couple of weeks ago , there was much optimistic talk of " transferring " that form to the league , but saturday 's 1-0 home defeat to local rivals leverkusen ended with the players being booed off the pitch , and now schalke face the real prospect of replacing their dead title dreams with a relegation battle .
that is not much fun for internationally experienced stars like manuel neuer , klaas-jan huntelaar and christoph metzelder , and magath sounded pessimistic after the game .
" we have players who are used to playing for the top .
that 's why they ca n't cope with the situation , " newspaper bild quoted magath as saying . " the performance didn ’ t match our current position in the standings .
we have to try to avoid a tight situation at the bottom of the table . "
mid-table struggle for werder bremen , the problem is more subtle .
their league form is not good either , and they also just lost at home , to a solid but average nuremberg .
but their attacking line-up featuring the likes of claudio pizarro , hugo almeida , and marko marin are always good for a few goals , and they have at least consolidated mid-table status .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nuremberg held off bremen and stole an away win in europe , though , they face a scrap .
tuesday sees them host dutch champions fc twente , and the match is pretty much a do-or-die tie for both teams - they are both on two points , behind second-placed tottenham hotspur , who have four .
a defeat would signify pretty much the end of the competition for werder , and a draw does neither team much good .
werder 's frame of mind going into the match is pessimistic .
" the only chance we still have is getting three points , " marin said after saturday 's game .
" but that will be difficult .
the mood in the dressing room is not good . "
team captain torsten frings was livid after the defeat on saturday .
" we 're just being too careless with the situation , " he said , after railing against his team-mates as the final whistle went .
but he does not see the champions league match as a distraction , but a chance .
" it ’ s a good opportunity to take a big step forward , " he said .
the combination of having a fight on their hands , along with the fact that they will have something to prove to the weserstadion faithful , means they may well pull off a win against twente .
werder have more european experience , and home advantage should see them get past the dutch side , whom they held to a 1-1 draw in the netherlands .
for schalke , meanwhile , the champions league needs to be an afterthought .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de terrorism -pipe- 02.11.2010 europe not the primary target for yemen-based terrorists , say experts großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us remains the main target for terrorists in yemen the recent discovery of two printer cartridges loaded with explosives aboard two us-bound cargo flights has once again turned the world 's attention to the potential international terror threat emanating from yemen . the bombs , which were traced to the impoverished country on the arabian peninsula after being found at airports in britain and dubai , were described by us security experts as showing a higher degree of professionalism and sophistication than any devices previously linked to yemen 's al-qaeda wing - al-qaeda in the arabian peninsula -lrb- aqap -rrb- .
experts who investigated the failed bombing of a us-bound plane in december 2009 , an attempted attack later claimed by aqap , said that if the toner bombs had been constructed by yemeni al-qaeda operatives then the group had achieved a level of expertise previously unseen .
" if al-qaeda indeed made them , " former cia agent robert baer told the washington times , " then they 've teamed up with true professionals . "
the sophistication of the bombs helped them to pass undetected through explosives scanners at hubs such as britain 's east midlands airport and cologne-bonn , a fact that prompted the german government - along with britain , france , canada and the united states - to ban airfreight from yemen and extend the restrictions to include passenger flights originating there .
terrorism experts initially suggested that the cargo planes were targeted for explosion over densely populated cities but when it was revealed that the bombs made the first part of the journey on commercial tourism flights , some experts were then forced to revise their theories to include a potential strike against airborne passengers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sophistication of the bombs have surprised experts despite foiling the bomb plots before any lives were lost , us intelligence agencies are concerned that yemen-based terrorist groups are becoming increasingly advanced in their planning .
they are quickly learning not to underestimate the threat coming out of yemen 's impoverished , tribal landscape and are reviewing their risk assessment of the group 's potential international reach .
given the sophistication of the devices , their route through germany and the discovery of one of the bombs at britain 's east midlands airport , the nightmare scenario of aqap extending its reach to europe has put the continent 's anti-terror authorities on alert .
however , jeremy binnie , terrorism and insurgency editor at jane 's defense , believes that aqap has had the opportunity to attack european targets but has so far maintained its focus on the united states .
aqap had opportunity to hit europe but did n't , say experts " the data points we have suggest that the us remains aqap 's primary target , " binnie told deutsche welle .
" they could have blown up the toner bombs anywhere over europe but chose not to which suggests their final destination would have been the united states with detonation taking place over a densely-populated area to maximise casualties .
as with the christmas day attempt last year , the bomb travelled through europe destined for chicago but again , the bomb was not detonated in europe suggesting the target was clearly the us . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aqap boss nasser al-wahaishi leads the yemen franchise " aqap are very ambitious , " he added .
" they want to hit the ' head of the snake ' as osama bin laden calls the us , not washington 's partners .
attacking the us is al-qaeda 's primary objective as it creates the maximum amount of coverage , increases international pressure on governments like yemen 's to confront islamist militants and in turn destabilizes these countries , making them even more vulnerable to al-qaeda 's influence . "
henry wilkinson , the associate director of janusian security risk management , agreed that the us was more likely to be a target for aqap but that europe 's association with the us also put it at a certain amount of risk .
" i do n't think europe is any higher a priority target than the united states , " he told deutsche welle .
" aqap has made threats against all the western powers it argues are causing harm to muslims - by gift of military deployments in afghanistan or iraq , support for israel , or perceived offences against islam such as banning the veil .
i suspect the united states is the most sought after target , but europe seems to be the focus of more plots - i suspect because it is a softer target by gift of border security and a greater preponderance of local sympathisers . "
european nations equally at risk should aqap switch focus when asked if the discovery of a toner bomb in britain or the fact that it passed through germany on its route suggested either country was under specific threat , wilkinson disagreed .
" i do n't think there is any merit in suggesting any one country is at particular risk , " he said .
" aqap has threatened many countries and may have been involved in the kidnap and murder of several german nationals in northern yemen in 2009 .
in this respect , i think germany as a leading european country is as much at risk as france , the uk , or any other prominent european nation . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bombs could have gone off in cologne or britain - but did n't " if aqap or any other groups were intent on mounting an attack in europe , they would take into account operational viability and target opportunity , as well as political significance of attacking the country . "
while the high-profile cases coming out of yemen have certainly turned the world 's attention toward its situation , most experts consider other countries as regions more deserving of concern in relation to european security .
" we have not seen much evidence that aqap has the capability to mount long-lead , multi-cell operations in europe , and its record of attempting such operations have mostly focused on saudi arabia , " wilkinson said .
" while i think this latest incident has focussed minds on the threat from yemen , the hierarchy of threat concerns for most european governments very likely remains , in order , afghanistan-pakistan , somalia and then yemen . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de champions league -pipe- 02.11.2010 schalke and bremen limp into champions league fixtures großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : magath has bigger problems at home than in europe two of germany 's champions league representatives are beginning to fray at the edges at home .
both schalke and werder lost last weekend , but they may have different approaches to european competition . the champions league is meant to separate the men from the boys .
football connoisseurs enjoy pointing out that it is superior in quality to the world cup , and no less an authority than real madrid coach jose mourinho has said it is the best competition in the world .
but then he would , seeing as how he ’ s won it twice .
but in the group stages at least , the gulf between europe 's rich and poor leagues often belies this claim , and germany 's representatives in this season 's champions league seem to be finding europe 's best of the best a lot easier to cope with than unglamorous mid-table sides like nuremberg .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : raul and schalke did n't find hapoel to be much of a challenge bayern munich , last season 's champion 's league finalists , have only just broken into the top half of the table , but they are three from three in their easy european group .
but it is schalke , led by veteran coach felix magath and spear-headed on the pitch by spanish star raul , who are best at showing up what a questionable test the champions league group stages really are .
schalke are second from bottom in the league , having scraped together six points from 10 games - the exact same total they have notched up in their three champions league matches , thanks to routine wins against portugal 's benfica and israel 's hapoel tel aviv .
another win in tel aviv on tuesday and they will be well on their way out of the group .
superficial glory but there are of course many other factors at play .
as magath never tires of pointing out , schalke are struggling with new signings and a new system , and somehow the glamour and much-mooted ' magic ' of europe seems to lift veterans like raul , the champions league ’ s all-time top scorer .
the short-term glory of a much-needed win in europe is a balm for many sorrows .
after raul put two past hapoel a couple of weeks ago , there was much optimistic talk of " transferring " that form to the league , but saturday 's 1-0 home defeat to local rivals leverkusen ended with the players being booed off the pitch , and now schalke face the real prospect of replacing their dead title dreams with a relegation battle .
that is not much fun for internationally experienced stars like manuel neuer , klaas-jan huntelaar and christoph metzelder , and magath sounded pessimistic after the game .
" we have players who are used to playing for the top .
that 's why they ca n't cope with the situation , " newspaper bild quoted magath as saying . " the performance didn ’ t match our current position in the standings .
we have to try to avoid a tight situation at the bottom of the table . "
mid-table struggle for werder bremen , the problem is more subtle .
their league form is not good either , and they also just lost at home , to a solid but average nuremberg .
but their attacking line-up featuring the likes of claudio pizarro , hugo almeida , and marko marin are always good for a few goals , and they have at least consolidated mid-table status .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nuremberg held off bremen and stole an away win in europe , though , they face a scrap .
tuesday sees them host dutch champions fc twente , and the match is pretty much a do-or-die tie for both teams - they are both on two points , behind second-placed tottenham hotspur , who have four .
a defeat would signify pretty much the end of the competition for werder , and a draw does neither team much good .
werder 's frame of mind going into the match is pessimistic .
" the only chance we still have is getting three points , " marin said after saturday 's game .
" but that will be difficult .
the mood in the dressing room is not good . "
team captain torsten frings was livid after the defeat on saturday .
" we 're just being too careless with the situation , " he said , after railing against his team-mates as the final whistle went .
but he does not see the champions league match as a distraction , but a chance .
" it ’ s a good opportunity to take a big step forward , " he said .
the combination of having a fight on their hands , along with the fact that they will have something to prove to the weserstadion faithful , means they may well pull off a win against twente .
werder have more european experience , and home advantage should see them get past the dutch side , whom they held to a 1-1 draw in the netherlands .
for schalke , meanwhile , the champions league needs to be an afterthought .

experts who investigated the failed bombing of a us-bound plane in december 2009 , an attempted attack later claimed by aqap , said that if the toner bombs had been constructed by yemeni al-qaeda operatives then the group had achieved a level of expertise previously unseen .
" if al-qaeda indeed made them , " former cia agent robert baer told the washington times , " then they 've teamed up with true professionals . "
the sophistication of the bombs helped them to pass undetected through explosives scanners at hubs such as britain 's east midlands airport and cologne-bonn , a fact that prompted the german government - along with britain , france , canada and the united states - to ban airfreight from yemen and extend the restrictions to include passenger flights originating there .
terrorism experts initially suggested that the cargo planes were targeted for explosion over densely populated cities but when it was revealed that the bombs made the first part of the journey on commercial tourism flights , some experts were then forced to revise their theories to include a potential strike against airborne passengers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sophistication of the bombs have surprised experts despite foiling the bomb plots before any lives were lost , us intelligence agencies are concerned that yemen-based terrorist groups are becoming increasingly advanced in their planning .
they are quickly learning not to underestimate the threat coming out of yemen 's impoverished , tribal landscape and are reviewing their risk assessment of the group 's potential international reach .
given the sophistication of the devices , their route through germany and the discovery of one of the bombs at britain 's east midlands airport , the nightmare scenario of aqap extending its reach to europe has put the continent 's anti-terror authorities on alert .
however , jeremy binnie , terrorism and insurgency editor at jane 's defense , believes that aqap has had the opportunity to attack european targets but has so far maintained its focus on the united states .
aqap had opportunity to hit europe but did n't , say experts " the data points we have suggest that the us remains aqap 's primary target , " binnie told deutsche welle .
" they could have blown up the toner bombs anywhere over europe but chose not to which suggests their final destination would have been the united states with detonation taking place over a densely-populated area to maximise casualties .
as with the christmas day attempt last year , the bomb travelled through europe destined for chicago but again , the bomb was not detonated in europe suggesting the target was clearly the us . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aqap boss nasser al-wahaishi leads the yemen franchise " aqap are very ambitious , " he added .
" they want to hit the ' head of the snake ' as osama bin laden calls the us , not washington 's partners .
attacking the us is al-qaeda 's primary objective as it creates the maximum amount of coverage , increases international pressure on governments like yemen 's to confront islamist militants and in turn destabilizes these countries , making them even more vulnerable to al-qaeda 's influence . "
henry wilkinson , the associate director of janusian security risk management , agreed that the us was more likely to be a target for aqap but that europe 's association with the us also put it at a certain amount of risk .
" i do n't think europe is any higher a priority target than the united states , " he told deutsche welle .
" aqap has made threats against all the western powers it argues are causing harm to muslims - by gift of military deployments in afghanistan or iraq , support for israel , or perceived offences against islam such as banning the veil .
i suspect the united states is the most sought after target , but europe seems to be the focus of more plots - i suspect because it is a softer target by gift of border security and a greater preponderance of local sympathisers . "
european nations equally at risk should aqap switch focus when asked if the discovery of a toner bomb in britain or the fact that it passed through germany on its route suggested either country was under specific threat , wilkinson disagreed .
" i do n't think there is any merit in suggesting any one country is at particular risk , " he said .
" aqap has threatened many countries and may have been involved in the kidnap and murder of several german nationals in northern yemen in 2009 .
in this respect , i think germany as a leading european country is as much at risk as france , the uk , or any other prominent european nation . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bombs could have gone off in cologne or britain - but did n't " if aqap or any other groups were intent on mounting an attack in europe , they would take into account operational viability and target opportunity , as well as political significance of attacking the country . "
while the high-profile cases coming out of yemen have certainly turned the world 's attention toward its situation , most experts consider other countries as regions more deserving of concern in relation to european security .
" we have not seen much evidence that aqap has the capability to mount long-lead , multi-cell operations in europe , and its record of attempting such operations have mostly focused on saudi arabia , " wilkinson said .
" while i think this latest incident has focussed minds on the threat from yemen , the hierarchy of threat concerns for most european governments very likely remains , in order , afghanistan-pakistan , somalia and then yemen . "

deutsche welle has compiled a list of this month 's highlights . international highrise prize 2010 height is a status symbol , especially when it comes to skyscrapers .
company heads like to reserve the top floor for their offices and the most influential firms rise above the cityscape .
for years now , cities have competed for bragging rights when it comes to housing the world 's tallest building .
dubai recently topped its competitors with the burj khalifa tower at 828 meters -lrb- 2,717 feet -rrb- .
but height is n't everything it seems ; at least not for the international highrise award .
each year , frankfurt 's architecture museum honors a building with the prestigious award that includes 50,000 euros -lrb- $ 69,000 -rrb- for the edifice 's owner and a statue for its architect .
in selecting a winner , the jury considers the building technique , aesthetics , the structure 's connection with its surroundings and cost efficiency .
this year 's winning construction will be announced on november 5 .
the finalists include the aqua tower in chicago -lrb- usa -rrb- , the shanghai world finance center -lrb- china -rrb- and the burj khalifa tower in dubai .
the latter houses practically an entire city , including a hotel , various apartments and luxury residences , office space and an open air observatory - the world 's highest , needless to mention . bildunterschrift : skyscrapers in chicago , dubai and shanghai are finalists for the 2010 international highrise award momentous date in german history november 9 is bound up with events both wonderful and terrible from modern german history .
for one , the date marks the fall of the berlin wall in 1989 .
a space commemorating the events of november 9 , 1989 will be presented to the public this year along a section of the wall that still stands .
but looking back several decades before that turning point , november 9 was also the date of an infamous episode during the nazi era : the kristallnacht or night of broken glass .
in the night from november 8-9,1938 , nazis burned jewish institutions throughout the country .
synagogues were destroyed , while jewish citizens were murdered or sent to concentration camps .
now , the jewish community in germany marks this dark chapter in the country 's history each year with events like tours through synagogues or a silent march through the city , planned this year by school children in berlin . the " fantastic four " hit the road they brought hip hop to germany and their fans still love them for it : the band " die fantastischen vier " -lrb- " the fantastic four " -rrb- .
their songs have been staples in the german music charts for more than 20 years now .
when they got their start , hip hop was almost exclusively performed in english , but the school friends smudo , and .
ypsilon , michi beck and thomas d wanted to rap in german - with nonsensical lyrics that nevertheless raised some weighty themes .
after a creative break , the band is going back on tour starting november 9 with a total of 16 concerts in germany , austria and switzerland .
and their fans are ready and waiting - not just for the songs on their new album -lrb- titled " fuer dich immer noch fanta sie " in german -rrb- but also for the group 's new stage concept .
the band will perform on a round stage in each arena , surrounded on all sides by concert-goers . bildunterschrift : still fantastic after 20 years : die fantastischen vier carnival begins spring , summer , fall and winter - those are the four official seasons in germany .
but in some parts of the country , there 's at least one more .
in the rhineland in western germany , the carnival season begins on november 11 -lrb- that is , 11/11 -rrb- at 11:11 a.m.
there are any number of theories about why the number 11 plays such a big role in the festivities but the rhineland revelers do n't worry too much about them .
the main thing is to party , drink , dance and be crazy .
after the one-day opening festival , the party mostly vanishes from public view until the new year begins .
after all , the storefronts and city squares are bedecked with holiday decorations and attractions until then .
but once january hits , the carnival clowns and streamers will be out in full force .
behind the scenes , carnival associations prepare all year round for the event and some loyal fans who have left behind the chill of a german november even listen to carnival music on the beach . bildunterschrift : 11:11 on 11/11 can only mean one thing : the start of carnival in the rhineland in memory of a great musician during mid-month in berlin , though , things will be a bit more civilized as musicians from across the world meet to take part in the " grand prix emanuel feuermann " cello contest .
the event is named after a renowned 20th-century cellist who taught at the academy of music arts in berlin before being forced out of his position in 1933 for being jewish .
he died in 1942 in new york .
the first contest was organized in 2002 by berlin 's university of the arts and is held every four years to honor feuermann .
during the first session of the contest , feuermann 's youngest sister , then in her mid 90s , was a guest , despite having planned never to return to germany again after fleeing during the nazi period .
this year 's participants will also travel in from all over the world , including competitors from china , russia , canada , korea , france , england , germany and the czech republic .
the winner receives not just a prize of 15,000 euros but also support for a cd production and concert appearances and tours . bildunterschrift : young talents from across the world will take the stage at the grand prix emanuel feuermann ruhr 2010 : trash scavengers from istanbul on stage rimini-protokoll are three young men from berlin that present theater works - but not with actors .
instead , they use people they meet on the street - for instance , four trash scavengers from istanbul .
director daniel wetzel met them around a year ago when he was in the turkish capital looking for ideas .
he saw scavengers everywhere in the city : kurdish men and roma from villages in anatolia , who scrounge around for metal , plastic , tin and anything else that 's valuable from morning until night .
after talking to some of them , the result was " herr dagacar und die goldene tektonik des muells " -lrb- " mr. dagacar and the golden tectonics of trash " -rrb- .
the theater piece premiered in istanbul on october 15 and its german premiere will take place on november 26 as part of the ruhr region 's year as a european capital of culture .
the four men on stage talk about their lives , villages , families - and their survival strategies .
the entire show is in turkish and kurdish , but for those who do n't understand the language , there 's a screen above the stage displaying subtitles .
it 's an unusual format but one that 's already meant success for the young theater makers . bildunterschrift : searching for valuable : four scavengers from istanbul take the stage in the ruhr valley christmas market season opens by the end of november , it 's already christmas time in germany .
cookies and chocolate santas have already been in the stores since september .

there , guests will be greeted personally by a figure known in german as the christkind : a woman with long blond locks wearing a golden crown .
she hands out treats , accepts wish lists and reads to children.young women in nuremberg between 16 and 19 years old can apply to fill the role each year .

deutsche welle has compiled a list of this month 's highlights . international highrise prize 2010 height is a status symbol , especially when it comes to skyscrapers .
company heads like to reserve the top floor for their offices and the most influential firms rise above the cityscape .
for years now , cities have competed for bragging rights when it comes to housing the world 's tallest building .
dubai recently topped its competitors with the burj khalifa tower at 828 meters -lrb- 2,717 feet -rrb- .
but height is n't everything it seems ; at least not for the international highrise award .
each year , frankfurt 's architecture museum honors a building with the prestigious award that includes 50,000 euros -lrb- $ 69,000 -rrb- for the edifice 's owner and a statue for its architect .
in selecting a winner , the jury considers the building technique , aesthetics , the structure 's connection with its surroundings and cost efficiency .
this year 's winning construction will be announced on november 5 .
the finalists include the aqua tower in chicago -lrb- usa -rrb- , the shanghai world finance center -lrb- china -rrb- and the burj khalifa tower in dubai .
the latter houses practically an entire city , including a hotel , various apartments and luxury residences , office space and an open air observatory - the world 's highest , needless to mention . bildunterschrift : skyscrapers in chicago , dubai and shanghai are finalists for the 2010 international highrise award momentous date in german history november 9 is bound up with events both wonderful and terrible from modern german history .
for one , the date marks the fall of the berlin wall in 1989 .
a space commemorating the events of november 9 , 1989 will be presented to the public this year along a section of the wall that still stands .
but looking back several decades before that turning point , november 9 was also the date of an infamous episode during the nazi era : the kristallnacht or night of broken glass .
in the night from november 8-9,1938 , nazis burned jewish institutions throughout the country .
synagogues were destroyed , while jewish citizens were murdered or sent to concentration camps .
now , the jewish community in germany marks this dark chapter in the country 's history each year with events like tours through synagogues or a silent march through the city , planned this year by school children in berlin . the " fantastic four " hit the road they brought hip hop to germany and their fans still love them for it : the band " die fantastischen vier " -lrb- " the fantastic four " -rrb- .

the rules would force national nuclear authorities to draw up disposal plans to be vetted by the eu . europe 's energy chief said that the eu needed binding rules for the long-term storage of nuclear waste in europe , namely in deep underground bunkers that would be safe from accidents or sabotage .
" we have to make sure that we have the highest safety standards in the world to protect our citizens , " guenther oettinger said on wednesday in brussels .
" safety is indivisible .
if an accident happens in one country , it can have devastating effects also in others . " oettinger said the current situation within the eu , where most nuclear waste is stored in bunkers or warehouses until it cools down , is no longer acceptable .
the eu 's energy body says " deep geological repositories , " or caverns at depths of between 100 and 700 meters underground , are the best places to permanently store spent fuel rods , which can remain dangerous to humans for up to a million years .
the 50,000 cubic meters of waste generated by the eu annually is currently held in temporary above-ground facilities , although lower-grade nuclear waste , which includes such things as equipment from de-commissioned reactors , is permitted below ground .
oettinger is keen to change this because of surface storage facilities ' vulnerability to environmental damage and terrorist attacks . " the vast majority of experts agree that you need to have deep storage , in other words at least 300 meters below the earth 's surface , " he said .
the eu 's executive wants each of its member states to come up with a national plan for long-term storage within four years of new eu legislation .
those plans would then be vetted by oettinger 's team .
not so black and white bildunterschrift : where europe currently stores its waste but not everyone trusts the burial technique , which has never been put to the test due to the vast timeframes involved .

the rules would force national nuclear authorities to draw up disposal plans to be vetted by the eu . europe 's energy chief said that the eu needed binding rules for the long-term storage of nuclear waste in europe , namely in deep underground bunkers that would be safe from accidents or sabotage .
" we have to make sure that we have the highest safety standards in the world to protect our citizens , " guenther oettinger said on wednesday in brussels .
" safety is indivisible .
if an accident happens in one country , it can have devastating effects also in others . " oettinger said the current situation within the eu , where most nuclear waste is stored in bunkers or warehouses until it cools down , is no longer acceptable .
the eu 's energy body says " deep geological repositories , " or caverns at depths of between 100 and 700 meters underground , are the best places to permanently store spent fuel rods , which can remain dangerous to humans for up to a million years .
the 50,000 cubic meters of waste generated by the eu annually is currently held in temporary above-ground facilities , although lower-grade nuclear waste , which includes such things as equipment from de-commissioned reactors , is permitted below ground .
oettinger is keen to change this because of surface storage facilities ' vulnerability to environmental damage and terrorist attacks . " the vast majority of experts agree that you need to have deep storage , in other words at least 300 meters below the earth 's surface , " he said .
the eu 's executive wants each of its member states to come up with a national plan for long-term storage within four years of new eu legislation .
those plans would then be vetted by oettinger 's team .

potentially connected parcel bombs have been sent to chancellor angela merkel 's office and embassies in greece .
the attacks follow mail bombs addressed to french president nicolas sarkozy among others on monday . the package containing explosives that was delivered to german chancellor angela merkel 's office was marked as coming from the greek economics ministry .
the recent bomb discovery comes after five embassies in athens have been targeted in mail box attacks on tuesday . two of the bombs exploded in front of the swiss embassy and a russian embassy compound , but did not cause any injuries , police in greece said .
other parcel bombs sent to the embassies of germany , bulgaria and chile were destroyed in controlled explosions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor merkel 's office and embassies in greece are under attack .
german interior minister thomas de maiziere said the parcel which arrived at chancellor merkel ’ s office resembled the bombs in greece .
suspects linked to far-left group the parcel ’ s delivery follows the arrest of two greek mail bomb suspects on monday who were accused of trying to send at least four parcel bombs to french president nicolas sarkozy and the mexican , dutch and belgian embassies .
the two men have been linked to a far-left group .
deutsche welle 's athens correspondent christine pirovolakis said that greek police are concerned since there were so many bombs at once circulating around in the greek capital .
the bombs are said to be sophisticated , although not powerful enough to cause great harm .
security sources said the package that made it to berlin was a " fast " explosive device that would have released a flame and caused burns had it detonated .
apparently it had not been a pipe bomb , or any other type of bomb that is designed to maim or kill with shrapnel .
similar bomb attacks in the past " one group under investigation is the ' sect of revolutionaries , ' a group that has committed other types of bomb attacks in the past , " pirovolakis said .
" in about a month 's time , we are going to have the two-year anniversary of a police shooting of a teenager , so last year around this time there was also an increase of bomb attacks in athens and it looks like it is the same this year as well . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : similar parcel bombs had been sent out on monday .
the police are starting to crack down , she added , saying that they were checking all governmental buildings and are searching individual visitors to them more closely .
also , parcels coming in and out of buildings are being rigorously screened for further investigation .
major streets in athens were also cut off to traffic .
elections in greece coming up some assume the parcel bombings could be happening due to greece 's austerity measures that have been implemented by the government .
" certainly the ways of attacks have increased since the teenage shooting a few years ago and of course the recent months since the austerity measures have been announced by the socialist government , " pirovolakis said .
" it looks like things are escalating once again .
there are also elections this coming weekend here in greece , so it looks like the left-wing groups are trying to in a way speak on behalf of the public how fed up they are with the austerity measures . "

no one was injured after a package from greece that contained explosive material arrived at the chancellery in berlin . there are still many questions about the mysterious package that arrived at chancellor angela merkel 's office in berlin on tuesday .
at least one thing is clear : the package did contain explosive materials .
that much was confirmed by interior minister thomas de maiziere on tuesday evening .
according to security sources in the capital , anyone who had opened the package would have been injured .
it did n't get that far , however , after the package was identified as suspicious during a routine mail inspection .
bomb defusing experts rendered the package harmless with a water cannon .
the chancellery was not evacuated as the mail room is in a separate building .
merkel was not in berlin during the incident as she is currently in belgium on an official visit .
she did say , however , that the recent series of package bombs from greece and yemen indicated a need for stricter controls on freight shipping in the european union , the united states , and around the globe .
" this is urgently about implementing stricter world-wide controls to prevent terror attacks , " merkel said in an interview with the passaue neue presse .

greek police say they plan to detonate another two packages recently seized at athens airport .
on monday , authorities intercepted and defused several other packages with explosive material inside that were addressed to other embassies , as well as to french president nicolas sarkozy .

he wants to close them through the introduction of coordinated , pan-european measures . german interior minister thomas de maiziere has called for security precautions on air cargo jets to be stepped up . the best way to do this , he says , is through closer cooperation between security agencies .

his goal is to introduce coordinated security procedures on a european level .
de maiziere 's statement followed the discovery over the weekend that a package containing explosives had passed through cologne-bonn airport undetected before being found in england .
the package had been dispatched from yemen and was bound for the united states .
observers say those who planted the explosives likely exploited lax security in the country from where the aircraft began its journey .

in response to the discovery of the explosives , berlin has stopped all freight and passenger flights from yemen from entering german airspace .

the photos include streets in the southern german town of oberstaufen , public spaces and soccer stadiums around the country . early on tuesday morning , google unveiled its first street view photographs in germany , honoring the bavarian town of oberstaufen to include " selected streets " where the company had sent its vehicles .
oberstaufen had previously explicitly invited google to their town , and even went so far as to bake the silicon valley company a cake , citing the potential for a boost in tourism .
earlier this year , the company announced it would launch street view in germany 's 20 largest cities , including berlin , hamburg and cologne , by the end of the year .
other specific locations around germany that are also available include a public square surrounded by historical buildings in dresden called the theaterplatz and a number of football stadiums , including munich 's allianz arena .
google said that there had been no reaction from government officials to the launch , despite all the controversy generated by the company 's plans for the last 18 months .
" we have n't heard anything from politicians or -lsb- data protection authorities -rsb- , " said lena wagner , a google germany spokesperson , in an interview with deutsche welle .
after government authorities complained , including consumer affairs minister ilse aigner and foreign affairs minister guido westerwelle , google eventually acquiesced to public pressure , providing an eight-week window , which ended last month , for german citizens to remove themselves from the service .
after the deadline , the california company announced that around 244,000 people had chosen to opt-out of the service , or under three percent of the total number of residents of the 20 selected cities .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bavarian town had previously baked a cake for google some houses are blurred as google promised , the removed houses show up as a blurry , translucent image , such as the house next to the buecher edele bookstore at hugo-von-koenigsegg strasse 13 in oberstaufen .
in an interview last month with deutsche welle , wagner noted that despite their complaints , germans actually like using street view in other countries where it already exists , saying that hundreds of thousands of germans use it every week .
" we also know that germany is the number one country in terms of street view in all countries where we have n't launched street view yet , " she said .
despite the launch of google street view , germany is continuing to investigate possible privacy violations as google admitted that it had captured some " payload data " while scanning open wifi networks during the course of taking photographs for street view .
in late october , the company admitted that it had captured some e-mails and passwords .
those revelations failed to surprise johannes caspar , hamburg 's commissioner for data protection and freedom of information , who is a leading authority in the german google investigation .
" this just confirms what we expected , " he told deutsche welle at the time , adding that the company could yet face fines .

the photos include streets in the southern german town of oberstaufen , public spaces and soccer stadiums around the country . early on tuesday morning , google unveiled its first street view photographs in germany , honoring the bavarian town of oberstaufen to include " selected streets " where the company had sent its vehicles .
oberstaufen had previously explicitly invited google to their town , and even went so far as to bake the silicon valley company a cake , citing the potential for a boost in tourism .
earlier this year , the company announced it would launch street view in germany 's 20 largest cities , including berlin , hamburg and cologne , by the end of the year .
other specific locations around germany that are also available include a public square surrounded by historical buildings in dresden called the theaterplatz and a number of football stadiums , including munich 's allianz arena .
google said that there had been no reaction from government officials to the launch , despite all the controversy generated by the company 's plans for the last 18 months .
" we have n't heard anything from politicians or -lsb- data protection authorities -rsb- , " said lena wagner , a google germany spokesperson , in an interview with deutsche welle .
after government authorities complained , including consumer affairs minister ilse aigner and foreign affairs minister guido westerwelle , google eventually acquiesced to public pressure , providing an eight-week window , which ended last month , for german citizens to remove themselves from the service .
after the deadline , the california company announced that around 244,000 people had chosen to opt-out of the service , or under three percent of the total number of residents of the 20 selected cities .

in an interview last month with deutsche welle , wagner noted that despite their complaints , germans actually like using street view in other countries where it already exists , saying that hundreds of thousands of germans use it every week .
" we also know that germany is the number one country in terms of street view in all countries where we have n't launched street view yet , " she said .
despite the launch of google street view , germany is continuing to investigate possible privacy violations as google admitted that it had captured some " payload data " while scanning open wifi networks during the course of taking photographs for street view .
in late october , the company admitted that it had captured some e-mails and passwords .
those revelations failed to surprise johannes caspar , hamburg 's commissioner for data protection and freedom of information , who is a leading authority in the german google investigation .
" this just confirms what we expected , " he told deutsche welle at the time , adding that the company could yet face fines .

however , in clubs and on dance floors , digital formats are changing the nature of djing in major ways .
in recent weeks , two berlin companies , native instruments and ableton , which both have a long history in the emerging digital djing market , have released new products that industry experts say are enhancing djs performance capabilities .
" ableton and native -lrb- instruments -rrb- seem to be two of the major players in this area at the moment , they keep development with djs in mind and keep the products coming fresh , " said mick wilson , the technology editor of dj magazine , in an interview with deutsche welle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the traktor kontrol s4 was released on monday native instrument 's traktor kontrol s4 was released on monday , and is an all-in-one approach to djing , allowing digital files to be performed and manipulated using a usb controller .
designed for portability , the controller allows for four different tracks to be loaded , sampled and mixed simultaneously .
similarly , ableton , in conjunction with the new zealand-based company serato , released its new software product , on september 22 .
" the bridge " integrates ableton live software , which allows djs to compose pieces , assemble tracks and play complete songs , with serato 's digital vinyl playback software .
this allows djs to manipulate all of these parts using specially produced vinyl records or cds .
both products are now making it easier for turntablists to hone their craft using entirely digital means .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ableton 's ceo called his company 's new product a " whole new level of excitement " berlin companies head in different directions while both ableton and native instruments claim to be innovators in the field of digital djing , they have chosen different directions to pursue .
" actually , this is just another piece to the puzzle of digital djing , but it 's the most outstanding piece because it 's the world 's first all-in-one computer based dj system , " said daniel haver , native instruments ' chief executive , in an interview with deutsche welle .
he added that native instruments ' " traktor kontrol s4 " also makes it far easier for djs to cut and loop segments of tracks , to essentially remix ‘ on the fly . '
" i can easily set a loop , shorten the loop , apply and effect and then drop it again , " explained constantin koehncke , a native instruments dj , as he demonstrated the product .
across town at ableton , the direction is integration but of a different kind .
" i think the bridge brings a whole new level of excitement to traditional djing , to be able to program your drum machines live , tweak you synthesizers live , that 's exciting , " said jeff milligan , of ableton .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bridge was released on september 22 competitors , but in different markets while both products have been in development for many years , taking many years in development , there should be no surprise that the two cross town rivals are keen to generate excitement about their products .
however , because both take different approaches to digital djing , it appears that they are not in direct competition .
" the two products are aimed at different areas of the market for different djs , it 's going to be both together not one or the other , " added mick wilson of dj magazine .
" i like them both , i like the idea of traktor and the new s4 controller looks really tasty as well .
i -lrb- also -rrb- like the idea of ' the bridge ' with ableton where you can play with an old school mentality but still incorporate modern production and remix capabilities . "

the photos include streets in the southern german town of oberstaufen , public spaces and soccer stadiums around the country . early on tuesday morning , google unveiled its first street view photographs in germany , honoring the bavarian town of oberstaufen to include " selected streets " where the company had sent its vehicles .
oberstaufen had previously explicitly invited google to their town , and even went so far as to bake the silicon valley company a cake , citing the potential for a boost in tourism .
earlier this year , the company announced it would launch street view in germany 's 20 largest cities , including berlin , hamburg and cologne , by the end of the year .
other specific locations around germany that are also available include a public square surrounded by historical buildings in dresden called the theaterplatz and a number of football stadiums , including munich 's allianz arena .
google said that there had been no reaction from government officials to the launch , despite all the controversy generated by the company 's plans for the last 18 months .
" we have n't heard anything from politicians or -lsb- data protection authorities -rsb- , " said lena wagner , a google germany spokesperson , in an interview with deutsche welle .
after government authorities complained , including consumer affairs minister ilse aigner and foreign affairs minister guido westerwelle , google eventually acquiesced to public pressure , providing an eight-week window , which ended last month , for german citizens to remove themselves from the service .
after the deadline , the california company announced that around 244,000 people had chosen to opt-out of the service , or under three percent of the total number of residents of the 20 selected cities .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bavarian town had previously baked a cake for google some houses are blurred as google promised , the removed houses show up as a blurry , translucent image , such as the house next to the buecher edele bookstore at hugo-von-koenigsegg strasse 13 in oberstaufen .
in an interview last month with deutsche welle , wagner noted that despite their complaints , germans actually like using street view in other countries where it already exists , saying that hundreds of thousands of germans use it every week .
" we also know that germany is the number one country in terms of street view in all countries where we have n't launched street view yet , " she said .
despite the launch of google street view , germany is continuing to investigate possible privacy violations as google admitted that it had captured some " payload data " while scanning open wifi networks during the course of taking photographs for street view .
in late october , the company admitted that it had captured some e-mails and passwords .
those revelations failed to surprise johannes caspar , hamburg 's commissioner for data protection and freedom of information , who is a leading authority in the german google investigation .
" this just confirms what we expected , " he told deutsche welle at the time , adding that the company could yet face fines .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de champions league -pipe- 02.11.2010 schalke and bremen limp into champions league fixtures großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : magath has bigger problems at home than in europe two of germany 's champions league representatives are beginning to fray at the edges at home .
both schalke and werder lost last weekend , but they may have different approaches to european competition . the champions league is meant to separate the men from the boys .
football connoisseurs enjoy pointing out that it is superior in quality to the world cup , and no less an authority than real madrid coach jose mourinho has said it is the best competition in the world .
but then he would , seeing as how he ’ s won it twice .
but in the group stages at least , the gulf between europe 's rich and poor leagues often belies this claim , and germany 's representatives in this season 's champions league seem to be finding europe 's best of the best a lot easier to cope with than unglamorous mid-table sides like nuremberg .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : raul and schalke did n't find hapoel to be much of a challenge bayern munich , last season 's champion 's league finalists , have only just broken into the top half of the table , but they are three from three in their easy european group .
but it is schalke , led by veteran coach felix magath and spear-headed on the pitch by spanish star raul , who are best at showing up what a questionable test the champions league group stages really are .
schalke are second from bottom in the league , having scraped together six points from 10 games - the exact same total they have notched up in their three champions league matches , thanks to routine wins against portugal 's benfica and israel 's hapoel tel aviv .
another win in tel aviv on tuesday and they will be well on their way out of the group .
superficial glory but there are of course many other factors at play .
as magath never tires of pointing out , schalke are struggling with new signings and a new system , and somehow the glamour and much-mooted ' magic ' of europe seems to lift veterans like raul , the champions league ’ s all-time top scorer .
the short-term glory of a much-needed win in europe is a balm for many sorrows .
after raul put two past hapoel a couple of weeks ago , there was much optimistic talk of " transferring " that form to the league , but saturday 's 1-0 home defeat to local rivals leverkusen ended with the players being booed off the pitch , and now schalke face the real prospect of replacing their dead title dreams with a relegation battle .
that is not much fun for internationally experienced stars like manuel neuer , klaas-jan huntelaar and christoph metzelder , and magath sounded pessimistic after the game .
" we have players who are used to playing for the top .
that 's why they ca n't cope with the situation , " newspaper bild quoted magath as saying . " the performance didn ’ t match our current position in the standings .
we have to try to avoid a tight situation at the bottom of the table . "
mid-table struggle for werder bremen , the problem is more subtle .
their league form is not good either , and they also just lost at home , to a solid but average nuremberg .
but their attacking line-up featuring the likes of claudio pizarro , hugo almeida , and marko marin are always good for a few goals , and they have at least consolidated mid-table status .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nuremberg held off bremen and stole an away win in europe , though , they face a scrap .
tuesday sees them host dutch champions fc twente , and the match is pretty much a do-or-die tie for both teams - they are both on two points , behind second-placed tottenham hotspur , who have four .
a defeat would signify pretty much the end of the competition for werder , and a draw does neither team much good .
werder 's frame of mind going into the match is pessimistic .
" the only chance we still have is getting three points , " marin said after saturday 's game .
" but that will be difficult .
the mood in the dressing room is not good . "
team captain torsten frings was livid after the defeat on saturday .
" we 're just being too careless with the situation , " he said , after railing against his team-mates as the final whistle went .
but he does not see the champions league match as a distraction , but a chance .
" it ’ s a good opportunity to take a big step forward , " he said .
the combination of having a fight on their hands , along with the fact that they will have something to prove to the weserstadion faithful , means they may well pull off a win against twente .
werder have more european experience , and home advantage should see them get past the dutch side , whom they held to a 1-1 draw in the netherlands .
for schalke , meanwhile , the champions league needs to be an afterthought .

but with this unique ecosystem threatened by political unrest in the region , a series of projects aims to ensure they stay that way . the landscape around gisenyi in western rwanda , on the border to the democratic republic of the congo , is breathtakingly beautiful .
mount nyiragongo towers majestically over the city , which is contiguous with the city of goma across the border in drc .
but mount nyiragongo is an active volcano , known for its devastating eruptions .
eight years ago , goma was largely destroyed by lava .
time and again , locals here have rebuilt their devastated city in the aftermath of such eruptions , despite risks posed by the still-hot lava and the frequent earth tremors that occur in the wake of the eruption .
they see the volcano as both a blessing and a curse .
located inside the virunga national park north of goma and lake kivu , and just west of the border with rwanda , its fertile land has made it one of the most densely populated regions on the entire continent . it also boasts virgin forests that are home to some unique flora and fauna , as well as the world 's last remaining population of mountain gorillas .
alternatives to illegal logging after the 1994 genocide in rwanda , hundreds of thousands of refugees fled over the border to goma .
today , the city is home to many former victims and perpetrators who are seeking refuge here from rwandan justice .
what they have in common is the fact that they are all trying to " put down roots in an ecosystem that is not their native one , " as johannes kirchgatter from the world wide fund for nature , or wwf , in germany puts it . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nyungwe rainforest is home to rare mountain gorillas the flow of refugees has resulted in a major population increase in the region , which has proved to be a heavy burden on existing fuel-provision structures .
the roughly one million people who live here depend mainly on firewood and wood charcoal for cooking and heating .
much of the logging activity in the virunga national park for the sale of timber and charcoal is controlled by rebel militia groups , which earn an estimated $ 30 million a year .
in order to put a stop to this illegal exploitation of resources by the charcoal mafia , the public needs alternatives that are affordable and sustainable .
outside the protected areas of the national park , the wwf is therefore overseeing a project to establish , maintain and exploit legal plantations for the production of fuel wood .
it also subsidizes the manufacture of energy-efficient ovens that consume 30 percent less fuel than previous ovens used hitherto .
the organization also trains rangers who work to clamp down on illegal loggers .
the project is already proving constructive , and helping to financially weaken the militias by providing the public with an alternative source for their fuel needs .
an important wilderness bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in drc , militias fund their activities with illegal wood trade the funds are partially provided from the international climate initiative , and kirchgatter hopes they can be put to good use across the entire congo basin .
its tropical forests are a haven for elephants , gorillas and other rare wildlife .
according to the wwf , the congo basin home to one-quarter of the world 's tropical forests and a mosaic of ecosystems – rivers , forests , savanna , swamps and flooded forests – which are teeming with life .
these forests regulate local climate and the flow of water , protect and enrich soils , control diseases and safeguard water quality .
reaching all the way to the atlantic coast , they also make up one of the most important wilderness areas left on the planet .
the wwf is planning to join forces with nasa next year to establish the exact size of its surface area using an optical remote sensing technology known as lidar , which can detect subtle topographic features such as river terraces and river channel banks , and measure the land surface elevation beneath the vegetation canopy .
the technology will allow researchers to establish forest density and even the precise amount of chlorophyll contained in different tree species .
with data provided by lidar , researchers will also be able to divide the congo basin into zones , isolating which areas are made up of primary forest and are therefore most in need of protection , and which areas could best be exploited by local populations .
the ultimate goal is to identify 15 percent of the congo basin as a protected area and thereby help preserve the habitats of species such as forest elephants , bonobo apes and various types of rare flora .
another project , run by the world resources institute , is putting the systems in place to implement effective strategies to reduce emissions from deforestation and forest degradation -lrb- known as redd . -rrb-
it is spearheading an innovative new project aimed at quantifying degradation and the greenhouse gas emissions in the forests of the republic of congo , and developing new methods to measure and monitor forest degradation .
the region will also be able to earn carbon credits by engaging in green carbon sequestering activities .
ideally , redd could deliver millions of dollars to impoverished communities in the congo basin in carbon credits , providing a powerful incentive to protect this land of great value to the planet .
but given that drc is one of the most corrupt nations in the world , negotiations are far from straightforward .
prioritizing needs of people and nature bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : preserving natural habitats in the congo basin is of global benefit nonetheless , johannes kirchgatter can already point to some successes , such as wwf programs in the lac tumba region in the western congo basin , some 1500 kilometers away from the virunga national park .
the region harbors a rich assemblage of terrestrial and aquatic biodiversity , and is an important provider of vital ecosystem services , including carbon sequestration , freshwater supplies , flood mitigation , and non-timber products for both subsistence and commercial use .
in wwf projects , locals are taught about land use planning ; protected area management and species conservation ; community-based natural resource management ; and livelihood improvement . the wwf hopes that 14,000 square kilometers of local forest can be preserved as a protected area and a further 65,000 square kilometers farmed sustainably .
given that the population is set to double in the next two decades , such measures are crucial .
but these valuable ecosystems will only survive if environmental priorities can be reconciled with the needs of local populations .

however , in clubs and on dance floors , digital formats are changing the nature of djing in major ways .
in recent weeks , two berlin companies , native instruments and ableton , which both have a long history in the emerging digital djing market , have released new products that industry experts say are enhancing djs performance capabilities .
" ableton and native -lrb- instruments -rrb- seem to be two of the major players in this area at the moment , they keep development with djs in mind and keep the products coming fresh , " said mick wilson , the technology editor of dj magazine , in an interview with deutsche welle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the traktor kontrol s4 was released on monday native instrument 's traktor kontrol s4 was released on monday , and is an all-in-one approach to djing , allowing digital files to be performed and manipulated using a usb controller .
designed for portability , the controller allows for four different tracks to be loaded , sampled and mixed simultaneously .
similarly , ableton , in conjunction with the new zealand-based company serato , released its new software product , on september 22 .
" the bridge " integrates ableton live software , which allows djs to compose pieces , assemble tracks and play complete songs , with serato 's digital vinyl playback software .
this allows djs to manipulate all of these parts using specially produced vinyl records or cds .
both products are now making it easier for turntablists to hone their craft using entirely digital means .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ableton 's ceo called his company 's new product a " whole new level of excitement " berlin companies head in different directions while both ableton and native instruments claim to be innovators in the field of digital djing , they have chosen different directions to pursue .
" actually , this is just another piece to the puzzle of digital djing , but it 's the most outstanding piece because it 's the world 's first all-in-one computer based dj system , " said daniel haver , native instruments ' chief executive , in an interview with deutsche welle .
he added that native instruments ' " traktor kontrol s4 " also makes it far easier for djs to cut and loop segments of tracks , to essentially remix ‘ on the fly . '
" i can easily set a loop , shorten the loop , apply and effect and then drop it again , " explained constantin koehncke , a native instruments dj , as he demonstrated the product .
across town at ableton , the direction is integration but of a different kind .
" i think the bridge brings a whole new level of excitement to traditional djing , to be able to program your drum machines live , tweak you synthesizers live , that 's exciting , " said jeff milligan , of ableton .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bridge was released on september 22 competitors , but in different markets while both products have been in development for many years , taking many years in development , there should be no surprise that the two cross town rivals are keen to generate excitement about their products .
however , because both take different approaches to digital djing , it appears that they are not in direct competition .
" the two products are aimed at different areas of the market for different djs , it 's going to be both together not one or the other , " added mick wilson of dj magazine .
" i like them both , i like the idea of traktor and the new s4 controller looks really tasty as well .
i -lrb- also -rrb- like the idea of ' the bridge ' with ableton where you can play with an old school mentality but still incorporate modern production and remix capabilities . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : focus : osama bin laden and the future of al qaeda some see rift as al qaeda reportedly appoints interim leader bin laden 's killing is not death knell for al qaeda europe must work harder at becoming a smart power high cost , little gain : the us war on terror is short on dividends terrorism -pipe- 02.11.2010 europe not the primary target for yemen-based terrorists , say experts großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us remains the main target for terrorists in yemen the recent discovery of two printer cartridges loaded with explosives aboard two us-bound cargo flights has once again turned the world 's attention to the potential international terror threat emanating from yemen . the bombs , which were traced to the impoverished country on the arabian peninsula after being found at airports in britain and dubai , were described by us security experts as showing a higher degree of professionalism and sophistication than any devices previously linked to yemen 's al-qaeda wing - al-qaeda in the arabian peninsula -lrb- aqap -rrb- .
experts who investigated the failed bombing of a us-bound plane in december 2009 , an attempted attack later claimed by aqap , said that if the toner bombs had been constructed by yemeni al-qaeda operatives then the group had achieved a level of expertise previously unseen .
" if al-qaeda indeed made them , " former cia agent robert baer told the washington times , " then they 've teamed up with true professionals . "
the sophistication of the bombs helped them to pass undetected through explosives scanners at hubs such as britain 's east midlands airport and cologne-bonn , a fact that prompted the german government - along with britain , france , canada and the united states - to ban airfreight from yemen and extend the restrictions to include passenger flights originating there .
terrorism experts initially suggested that the cargo planes were targeted for explosion over densely populated cities but when it was revealed that the bombs made the first part of the journey on commercial tourism flights , some experts were then forced to revise their theories to include a potential strike against airborne passengers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sophistication of the bombs have surprised experts despite foiling the bomb plots before any lives were lost , us intelligence agencies are concerned that yemen-based terrorist groups are becoming increasingly advanced in their planning .
they are quickly learning not to underestimate the threat coming out of yemen 's impoverished , tribal landscape and are reviewing their risk assessment of the group 's potential international reach .
given the sophistication of the devices , their route through germany and the discovery of one of the bombs at britain 's east midlands airport , the nightmare scenario of aqap extending its reach to europe has put the continent 's anti-terror authorities on alert .
however , jeremy binnie , terrorism and insurgency editor at jane 's defense , believes that aqap has had the opportunity to attack european targets but has so far maintained its focus on the united states .
aqap had opportunity to hit europe but did n't , say experts " the data points we have suggest that the us remains aqap 's primary target , " binnie told deutsche welle .
" they could have blown up the toner bombs anywhere over europe but chose not to which suggests their final destination would have been the united states with detonation taking place over a densely-populated area to maximise casualties .
as with the christmas day attempt last year , the bomb travelled through europe destined for chicago but again , the bomb was not detonated in europe suggesting the target was clearly the us . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aqap boss nasser al-wahaishi leads the yemen franchise " aqap are very ambitious , " he added .
" they want to hit the ' head of the snake ' as osama bin laden calls the us , not washington 's partners .
attacking the us is al-qaeda 's primary objective as it creates the maximum amount of coverage , increases international pressure on governments like yemen 's to confront islamist militants and in turn destabilizes these countries , making them even more vulnerable to al-qaeda 's influence . "
henry wilkinson , the associate director of janusian security risk management , agreed that the us was more likely to be a target for aqap but that europe 's association with the us also put it at a certain amount of risk .
" i do n't think europe is any higher a priority target than the united states , " he told deutsche welle .
" aqap has made threats against all the western powers it argues are causing harm to muslims - by gift of military deployments in afghanistan or iraq , support for israel , or perceived offences against islam such as banning the veil .
i suspect the united states is the most sought after target , but europe seems to be the focus of more plots - i suspect because it is a softer target by gift of border security and a greater preponderance of local sympathisers . "
european nations equally at risk should aqap switch focus when asked if the discovery of a toner bomb in britain or the fact that it passed through germany on its route suggested either country was under specific threat , wilkinson disagreed .
" i do n't think there is any merit in suggesting any one country is at particular risk , " he said .
" aqap has threatened many countries and may have been involved in the kidnap and murder of several german nationals in northern yemen in 2009 .
in this respect , i think germany as a leading european country is as much at risk as france , the uk , or any other prominent european nation . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bombs could have gone off in cologne or britain - but did n't " if aqap or any other groups were intent on mounting an attack in europe , they would take into account operational viability and target opportunity , as well as political significance of attacking the country . "
while the high-profile cases coming out of yemen have certainly turned the world 's attention toward its situation , most experts consider other countries as regions more deserving of concern in relation to european security .
" we have not seen much evidence that aqap has the capability to mount long-lead , multi-cell operations in europe , and its record of attempting such operations have mostly focused on saudi arabia , " wilkinson said .
" while i think this latest incident has focussed minds on the threat from yemen , the hierarchy of threat concerns for most european governments very likely remains , in order , afghanistan-pakistan , somalia and then yemen . "

the rules would force national nuclear authorities to draw up disposal plans to be vetted by the eu . europe 's energy chief said that the eu needed binding rules for the long-term storage of nuclear waste in europe , namely in deep underground bunkers that would be safe from accidents or sabotage .
" we have to make sure that we have the highest safety standards in the world to protect our citizens , " guenther oettinger said on wednesday in brussels .
" safety is indivisible .
if an accident happens in one country , it can have devastating effects also in others . " oettinger said the current situation within the eu , where most nuclear waste is stored in bunkers or warehouses until it cools down , is no longer acceptable .
the eu 's energy body says " deep geological repositories , " or caverns at depths of between 100 and 700 meters underground , are the best places to permanently store spent fuel rods , which can remain dangerous to humans for up to a million years .
the 50,000 cubic meters of waste generated by the eu annually is currently held in temporary above-ground facilities , although lower-grade nuclear waste , which includes such things as equipment from de-commissioned reactors , is permitted below ground .
oettinger is keen to change this because of surface storage facilities ' vulnerability to environmental damage and terrorist attacks . " the vast majority of experts agree that you need to have deep storage , in other words at least 300 meters below the earth 's surface , " he said .
the eu 's executive wants each of its member states to come up with a national plan for long-term storage within four years of new eu legislation .
those plans would then be vetted by oettinger 's team .
not so black and white bildunterschrift : where europe currently stores its waste but not everyone trusts the burial technique , which has never been put to the test due to the vast timeframes involved .
munich environmental institute board member christina hacker told deutsche welle that the problem is in the use of the word " safe " .
" who knows what is going to be safe for a million years ? " she asked .
" we have never had a depot like this before so it is impossible to guarantee its safety . "
proponents of the idea counter that rock provides a better natural barrier than any man-made constructions and that it is the best possible solution to a complex problem .
they say thirty years of research has established which geological structures are best for the job , and point to structures of clay in germany and granite in sweden .
but nuclear waste expert , stefan alt from the environmental research centre oeko-institut says there are some critical questions that need to be answered before any legislation can be signed off .
" storing waste deep under the ground is the most responsible way to go , " he told deutsche welle .
" but we still have to decide whether we will want access to it in the future or whether we want to seal it away forever . "
a bad precedent bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : burying nuclear waste has proved problematic in germany alt says the difficulties in predicting environmental changes over the next centuries and millennia make it impossible to foresee things like the condition of the containers five hundred years down the line .
furthermore , in light of revelations earlier this year that containers at the asse nuclear storage facility in germany had been damaged as a result of structural instability , he believes it could be wise to make waste accessible .
it 's an argument supported by local anti-nuclear campaigners .
udo dettmann , part of the asse ii community organization , told deutsche welle it would be a critical mistake to bury radioactive waste irreversibly .
" it if would stay deep under the ground that would be fine , but there is no proof that this will be the case over a period of one million years , " he said .
" the only way we have to correct mis-developments is to ensure access to the storage . "
he also said that there had been " insufficient " research into such sites , and that it would be irresponsible for the german government or the european commission to decide upon deep geological repositories without having thoroughly explored other options . politics versus security bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oettinger says current european rules for storing waste are unacceptable for the time being , though that the eu 's executive appears determined to find a long term , subterranean solution to the problem of dealing with nuclear waste .
in a recent article in a regional german newspaper , the badisches tagblatt , oettinger said he could foresee clusters of eu countries agreeing upon a collective waste-storage site .
he did not suggest which of the eu 's 27 member-states might prove suitable for such a facility , but stressed that he would not " tolerate the export of nuclear waste outside the european union . "
and while the idea of one country housing another country 's – or indeed several other countries ' – nuclear waste could itself prove politically tricky , stefan alt says that from a scientific point of view , it makes sense to find the best geological location possible .
" on this issue , security is more important than national boundaries , " he said .
" the alternative would mean that every country tried to locate sites which do n't even exist . "

the rules would force national nuclear authorities to draw up disposal plans to be vetted by the eu . europe 's energy chief said that the eu needed binding rules for the long-term storage of nuclear waste in europe , namely in deep underground bunkers that would be safe from accidents or sabotage .
" we have to make sure that we have the highest safety standards in the world to protect our citizens , " guenther oettinger said on wednesday in brussels .
" safety is indivisible .
if an accident happens in one country , it can have devastating effects also in others . " oettinger said the current situation within the eu , where most nuclear waste is stored in bunkers or warehouses until it cools down , is no longer acceptable .
the eu 's energy body says " deep geological repositories , " or caverns at depths of between 100 and 700 meters underground , are the best places to permanently store spent fuel rods , which can remain dangerous to humans for up to a million years .
the 50,000 cubic meters of waste generated by the eu annually is currently held in temporary above-ground facilities , although lower-grade nuclear waste , which includes such things as equipment from de-commissioned reactors , is permitted below ground .
oettinger is keen to change this because of surface storage facilities ' vulnerability to environmental damage and terrorist attacks . " the vast majority of experts agree that you need to have deep storage , in other words at least 300 meters below the earth 's surface , " he said .
the eu 's executive wants each of its member states to come up with a national plan for long-term storage within four years of new eu legislation .
those plans would then be vetted by oettinger 's team .
not so black and white bildunterschrift : where europe currently stores its waste but not everyone trusts the burial technique , which has never been put to the test due to the vast timeframes involved .
munich environmental institute board member christina hacker told deutsche welle that the problem is in the use of the word " safe " .
" who knows what is going to be safe for a million years ? " she asked .
" we have never had a depot like this before so it is impossible to guarantee its safety . "
proponents of the idea counter that rock provides a better natural barrier than any man-made constructions and that it is the best possible solution to a complex problem .
they say thirty years of research has established which geological structures are best for the job , and point to structures of clay in germany and granite in sweden .
but nuclear waste expert , stefan alt from the environmental research centre oeko-institut says there are some critical questions that need to be answered before any legislation can be signed off .
" storing waste deep under the ground is the most responsible way to go , " he told deutsche welle .
" but we still have to decide whether we will want access to it in the future or whether we want to seal it away forever . "
a bad precedent bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : burying nuclear waste has proved problematic in germany alt says the difficulties in predicting environmental changes over the next centuries and millennia make it impossible to foresee things like the condition of the containers five hundred years down the line .
furthermore , in light of revelations earlier this year that containers at the asse nuclear storage facility in germany had been damaged as a result of structural instability , he believes it could be wise to make waste accessible .
it 's an argument supported by local anti-nuclear campaigners .
udo dettmann , part of the asse ii community organization , told deutsche welle it would be a critical mistake to bury radioactive waste irreversibly .
" it if would stay deep under the ground that would be fine , but there is no proof that this will be the case over a period of one million years , " he said .
" the only way we have to correct mis-developments is to ensure access to the storage . "

but critics suggest the idea of troops regularly serving under foreign command could cause problems . david cameron and nicolas sarkozy put pen to paper on two treaties in london .
the agreements will see britain and france jointly testing nuclear warheads , coordinating aircraft carriers so there is always a british or french vessel available for joint operations , and creating a combined expeditionary force training troops to deploy together .
france will also be allowed to use british a400m fuelling aircraft when there is spare capacity and there will be joint work on drones , mine counter-measures and satellite communications .
both men were keen to reject claims the move will diminish british or french sovereignty in any way .
david cameron insisted : bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain and france want to get closer and save money too " this is not , as some have suggested , about weakening or pooling british or french sovereignty .
this is not about a european army .
this is not about sharing our nuclear deterrents .
let me say this plainly : britain and france are , and will always remain , sovereign nations , able to deploy our armed forces independently and in our national interest when we choose to do so . "
david cameron ‘ s defence secretary liam fox has pointed out that it is not unusual for british troops to serve under foreign command - it happens often in nato operations .
the prime minister also said that uk forces are deployed alongside those of its allies on a regular basis , saying that " the vast bulk of our military operations - bosnia , kosovo , afghanistan , amongst others , have been conducted together with our allies . "
he added that such operations were always about defending britain 's national interest , and that they were " about practical , hard-headed co-operation between sovereign countries . "
france and britain have disagreed , even fairly recently , on military intervention - for example , on the invasion of iraq in 2003 .
so president sarkozy and prime minister cameron were sure to point out that a ' political agreement ' would have to be reached for the joint taskforce to be deployed .

but with this unique ecosystem threatened by political unrest in the region , a series of projects aims to ensure they stay that way . the landscape around gisenyi in western rwanda , on the border to the democratic republic of the congo , is breathtakingly beautiful .
mount nyiragongo towers majestically over the city , which is contiguous with the city of goma across the border in drc .
but mount nyiragongo is an active volcano , known for its devastating eruptions .
eight years ago , goma was largely destroyed by lava .
time and again , locals here have rebuilt their devastated city in the aftermath of such eruptions , despite risks posed by the still-hot lava and the frequent earth tremors that occur in the wake of the eruption .
they see the volcano as both a blessing and a curse .
located inside the virunga national park north of goma and lake kivu , and just west of the border with rwanda , its fertile land has made it one of the most densely populated regions on the entire continent . it also boasts virgin forests that are home to some unique flora and fauna , as well as the world 's last remaining population of mountain gorillas .
alternatives to illegal logging after the 1994 genocide in rwanda , hundreds of thousands of refugees fled over the border to goma .
today , the city is home to many former victims and perpetrators who are seeking refuge here from rwandan justice .
what they have in common is the fact that they are all trying to " put down roots in an ecosystem that is not their native one , " as johannes kirchgatter from the world wide fund for nature , or wwf , in germany puts it . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nyungwe rainforest is home to rare mountain gorillas the flow of refugees has resulted in a major population increase in the region , which has proved to be a heavy burden on existing fuel-provision structures .
the roughly one million people who live here depend mainly on firewood and wood charcoal for cooking and heating .
much of the logging activity in the virunga national park for the sale of timber and charcoal is controlled by rebel militia groups , which earn an estimated $ 30 million a year .
in order to put a stop to this illegal exploitation of resources by the charcoal mafia , the public needs alternatives that are affordable and sustainable .
outside the protected areas of the national park , the wwf is therefore overseeing a project to establish , maintain and exploit legal plantations for the production of fuel wood .
it also subsidizes the manufacture of energy-efficient ovens that consume 30 percent less fuel than previous ovens used hitherto .
the organization also trains rangers who work to clamp down on illegal loggers .
the project is already proving constructive , and helping to financially weaken the militias by providing the public with an alternative source for their fuel needs .
an important wilderness bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in drc , militias fund their activities with illegal wood trade the funds are partially provided from the international climate initiative , and kirchgatter hopes they can be put to good use across the entire congo basin .
its tropical forests are a haven for elephants , gorillas and other rare wildlife .
according to the wwf , the congo basin home to one-quarter of the world 's tropical forests and a mosaic of ecosystems – rivers , forests , savanna , swamps and flooded forests – which are teeming with life .
these forests regulate local climate and the flow of water , protect and enrich soils , control diseases and safeguard water quality .
reaching all the way to the atlantic coast , they also make up one of the most important wilderness areas left on the planet .
the wwf is planning to join forces with nasa next year to establish the exact size of its surface area using an optical remote sensing technology known as lidar , which can detect subtle topographic features such as river terraces and river channel banks , and measure the land surface elevation beneath the vegetation canopy .
the technology will allow researchers to establish forest density and even the precise amount of chlorophyll contained in different tree species .
with data provided by lidar , researchers will also be able to divide the congo basin into zones , isolating which areas are made up of primary forest and are therefore most in need of protection , and which areas could best be exploited by local populations .
the ultimate goal is to identify 15 percent of the congo basin as a protected area and thereby help preserve the habitats of species such as forest elephants , bonobo apes and various types of rare flora .
another project , run by the world resources institute , is putting the systems in place to implement effective strategies to reduce emissions from deforestation and forest degradation -lrb- known as redd . -rrb-
it is spearheading an innovative new project aimed at quantifying degradation and the greenhouse gas emissions in the forests of the republic of congo , and developing new methods to measure and monitor forest degradation .
the region will also be able to earn carbon credits by engaging in green carbon sequestering activities .
ideally , redd could deliver millions of dollars to impoverished communities in the congo basin in carbon credits , providing a powerful incentive to protect this land of great value to the planet .
but given that drc is one of the most corrupt nations in the world , negotiations are far from straightforward .
prioritizing needs of people and nature bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : preserving natural habitats in the congo basin is of global benefit nonetheless , johannes kirchgatter can already point to some successes , such as wwf programs in the lac tumba region in the western congo basin , some 1500 kilometers away from the virunga national park .
the region harbors a rich assemblage of terrestrial and aquatic biodiversity , and is an important provider of vital ecosystem services , including carbon sequestration , freshwater supplies , flood mitigation , and non-timber products for both subsistence and commercial use .
in wwf projects , locals are taught about land use planning ; protected area management and species conservation ; community-based natural resource management ; and livelihood improvement . the wwf hopes that 14,000 square kilometers of local forest can be preserved as a protected area and a further 65,000 square kilometers farmed sustainably .
given that the population is set to double in the next two decades , such measures are crucial .
but these valuable ecosystems will only survive if environmental priorities can be reconciled with the needs of local populations .

but with this unique ecosystem threatened by political unrest in the region , a series of projects aims to ensure they stay that way . the landscape around gisenyi in western rwanda , on the border to the democratic republic of the congo , is breathtakingly beautiful .
mount nyiragongo towers majestically over the city , which is contiguous with the city of goma across the border in drc .
but mount nyiragongo is an active volcano , known for its devastating eruptions .
eight years ago , goma was largely destroyed by lava .
time and again , locals here have rebuilt their devastated city in the aftermath of such eruptions , despite risks posed by the still-hot lava and the frequent earth tremors that occur in the wake of the eruption .
they see the volcano as both a blessing and a curse .
located inside the virunga national park north of goma and lake kivu , and just west of the border with rwanda , its fertile land has made it one of the most densely populated regions on the entire continent . it also boasts virgin forests that are home to some unique flora and fauna , as well as the world 's last remaining population of mountain gorillas .
alternatives to illegal logging after the 1994 genocide in rwanda , hundreds of thousands of refugees fled over the border to goma .
today , the city is home to many former victims and perpetrators who are seeking refuge here from rwandan justice .
what they have in common is the fact that they are all trying to " put down roots in an ecosystem that is not their native one , " as johannes kirchgatter from the world wide fund for nature , or wwf , in germany puts it . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nyungwe rainforest is home to rare mountain gorillas the flow of refugees has resulted in a major population increase in the region , which has proved to be a heavy burden on existing fuel-provision structures .
the roughly one million people who live here depend mainly on firewood and wood charcoal for cooking and heating .
much of the logging activity in the virunga national park for the sale of timber and charcoal is controlled by rebel militia groups , which earn an estimated $ 30 million a year .
in order to put a stop to this illegal exploitation of resources by the charcoal mafia , the public needs alternatives that are affordable and sustainable .
outside the protected areas of the national park , the wwf is therefore overseeing a project to establish , maintain and exploit legal plantations for the production of fuel wood .
it also subsidizes the manufacture of energy-efficient ovens that consume 30 percent less fuel than previous ovens used hitherto .
the organization also trains rangers who work to clamp down on illegal loggers .
the project is already proving constructive , and helping to financially weaken the militias by providing the public with an alternative source for their fuel needs .
an important wilderness bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in drc , militias fund their activities with illegal wood trade the funds are partially provided from the international climate initiative , and kirchgatter hopes they can be put to good use across the entire congo basin .
its tropical forests are a haven for elephants , gorillas and other rare wildlife .
according to the wwf , the congo basin home to one-quarter of the world 's tropical forests and a mosaic of ecosystems – rivers , forests , savanna , swamps and flooded forests – which are teeming with life .
these forests regulate local climate and the flow of water , protect and enrich soils , control diseases and safeguard water quality .
reaching all the way to the atlantic coast , they also make up one of the most important wilderness areas left on the planet .
the wwf is planning to join forces with nasa next year to establish the exact size of its surface area using an optical remote sensing technology known as lidar , which can detect subtle topographic features such as river terraces and river channel banks , and measure the land surface elevation beneath the vegetation canopy .
the technology will allow researchers to establish forest density and even the precise amount of chlorophyll contained in different tree species .
with data provided by lidar , researchers will also be able to divide the congo basin into zones , isolating which areas are made up of primary forest and are therefore most in need of protection , and which areas could best be exploited by local populations .
the ultimate goal is to identify 15 percent of the congo basin as a protected area and thereby help preserve the habitats of species such as forest elephants , bonobo apes and various types of rare flora .
another project , run by the world resources institute , is putting the systems in place to implement effective strategies to reduce emissions from deforestation and forest degradation -lrb- known as redd . -rrb-
it is spearheading an innovative new project aimed at quantifying degradation and the greenhouse gas emissions in the forests of the republic of congo , and developing new methods to measure and monitor forest degradation .
the region will also be able to earn carbon credits by engaging in green carbon sequestering activities .
ideally , redd could deliver millions of dollars to impoverished communities in the congo basin in carbon credits , providing a powerful incentive to protect this land of great value to the planet .
but given that drc is one of the most corrupt nations in the world , negotiations are far from straightforward .
prioritizing needs of people and nature bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : preserving natural habitats in the congo basin is of global benefit nonetheless , johannes kirchgatter can already point to some successes , such as wwf programs in the lac tumba region in the western congo basin , some 1500 kilometers away from the virunga national park .
the region harbors a rich assemblage of terrestrial and aquatic biodiversity , and is an important provider of vital ecosystem services , including carbon sequestration , freshwater supplies , flood mitigation , and non-timber products for both subsistence and commercial use .
in wwf projects , locals are taught about land use planning ; protected area management and species conservation ; community-based natural resource management ; and livelihood improvement . the wwf hopes that 14,000 square kilometers of local forest can be preserved as a protected area and a further 65,000 square kilometers farmed sustainably .
given that the population is set to double in the next two decades , such measures are crucial .
but these valuable ecosystems will only survive if environmental priorities can be reconciled with the needs of local populations .

in the first eight months of 2010 , the chinese car market almost doubled in size with german manufacturers securing a 53 percent increase on the sales of its cars .
in an interview in monday 's die welt newspaper , the president of the german association of the automotive industry -lrb- vda -rrb- , matthias wissmann , said that german manufacturers would have produced a total of 5.45 million passenger cars by the end of the year . the lion 's share will have gone to international markets .
bildunterschrift : destined for foreign roads : german cars enjoy a good reputation overseas " over the whole year , we are expecting exports to rise 21 percent , which equates to 4.15 million passenger cars , " wissmann said .
" the strength of the asian market , especially in china , and also the recovery of the us market , have fuelled exports . "
so far this year , chinese consumers have bought 1.3 million german vehicles .
development paid off wissmann cited the decision not to cap but increase development budgets during the crisis as one of the main reasons for the surge in popularity of german cars in asian countries .
he said it had given german manufacturers a technologically competitive edge and enabled them to come up with the right range of cars .
the vda president added that the german domestic market also performed better than had been expected in 2010 .
there had been worries that demand would stagnate following the government 's decision not to extend its car scrapping subsidy scheme , whereby german car owners were paid 2,500 euros -lrb- $ 3,470 -rrb- if they traded in a vehicle that was at least nine years old and purchased a brand new one .

audi and other parts of the volkswagen concern , whose operating profit had trebled by the end of the third quarter to 4.8 billion euros , have already agreed to an increase .
bmw , porsche and daimler have yet to make a decision .

both schalke and werder lost last weekend , but they may have different approaches to european competition . the champions league is meant to separate the men from the boys .
football connoisseurs enjoy pointing out that it is superior in quality to the world cup , and no less an authority than real madrid coach jose mourinho has said it is the best competition in the world .
but then he would , seeing as how he ’ s won it twice .
but in the group stages at least , the gulf between europe 's rich and poor leagues often belies this claim , and germany 's representatives in this season 's champions league seem to be finding europe 's best of the best a lot easier to cope with than unglamorous mid-table sides like nuremberg .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : raul and schalke did n't find hapoel to be much of a challenge bayern munich , last season 's champion 's league finalists , have only just broken into the top half of the table , but they are three from three in their easy european group .
but it is schalke , led by veteran coach felix magath and spear-headed on the pitch by spanish star raul , who are best at showing up what a questionable test the champions league group stages really are .
schalke are second from bottom in the league , having scraped together six points from 10 games - the exact same total they have notched up in their three champions league matches , thanks to routine wins against portugal 's benfica and israel 's hapoel tel aviv .
another win in tel aviv on tuesday and they will be well on their way out of the group .
superficial glory but there are of course many other factors at play .
as magath never tires of pointing out , schalke are struggling with new signings and a new system , and somehow the glamour and much-mooted ' magic ' of europe seems to lift veterans like raul , the champions league ’ s all-time top scorer .
the short-term glory of a much-needed win in europe is a balm for many sorrows .
after raul put two past hapoel a couple of weeks ago , there was much optimistic talk of " transferring " that form to the league , but saturday 's 1-0 home defeat to local rivals leverkusen ended with the players being booed off the pitch , and now schalke face the real prospect of replacing their dead title dreams with a relegation battle .
that is not much fun for internationally experienced stars like manuel neuer , klaas-jan huntelaar and christoph metzelder , and magath sounded pessimistic after the game .
" we have players who are used to playing for the top .
that 's why they ca n't cope with the situation , " newspaper bild quoted magath as saying . " the performance didn ’ t match our current position in the standings .
we have to try to avoid a tight situation at the bottom of the table . "
mid-table struggle for werder bremen , the problem is more subtle .
their league form is not good either , and they also just lost at home , to a solid but average nuremberg .
but their attacking line-up featuring the likes of claudio pizarro , hugo almeida , and marko marin are always good for a few goals , and they have at least consolidated mid-table status .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nuremberg held off bremen and stole an away win in europe , though , they face a scrap .
tuesday sees them host dutch champions fc twente , and the match is pretty much a do-or-die tie for both teams - they are both on two points , behind second-placed tottenham hotspur , who have four .
a defeat would signify pretty much the end of the competition for werder , and a draw does neither team much good .
werder 's frame of mind going into the match is pessimistic .
" the only chance we still have is getting three points , " marin said after saturday 's game .
" but that will be difficult .
the mood in the dressing room is not good . "
team captain torsten frings was livid after the defeat on saturday .
" we 're just being too careless with the situation , " he said , after railing against his team-mates as the final whistle went .
but he does not see the champions league match as a distraction , but a chance .
" it ’ s a good opportunity to take a big step forward , " he said .
the combination of having a fight on their hands , along with the fact that they will have something to prove to the weserstadion faithful , means they may well pull off a win against twente .
werder have more european experience , and home advantage should see them get past the dutch side , whom they held to a 1-1 draw in the netherlands .
for schalke , meanwhile , the champions league needs to be an afterthought .

he also called on nato to work more closely with china on the exchange of information about cyber attacks . zu guttenberg met with his chinese counterpart liang guanglie on tuesday , calling on beijing to do more to help stabilize afghanistan in the face of a growing insurgency and worsening violence .
however , he stressed there was no military role for the chinese to play there . " we have a shared interest when it comes to the question of at what time do we reach a stable , or at least an agreeably stable , afghanistan , with a state of security that we can accept , " zu guttenberg said in beijing . china is not involved in the war in afghanistan , but has economic interests there . zu guttenberg said training civil servants was one area in which china could step up its involvement . " when it comes to goals we can reach and we have to reach , i think , the neighbors can also play a significant role .
we have to look at the most important neighbors as well and china is one of them , " he said . mineral wealth china would benefit from a stable afghanistan because it would be easier for its firms to complete billion-dollar resource deals they have or are considering . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china is reluctant to get more involved in a war-torn afghanistan the us defense department estimated earlier this year afghanistan 's mineral resources could top $ 1 trillion -lrb- 0.7 trillion euros -rrb- . how to stabilize afghanistan will be a major issue at a nato summit in lisbon later this month and in us president barack obama 's strategy review in december . germany is the third-largest contributor to the nato-led force in afghanistan with about 4,600 troops and , like the united states , is looking at starting a partial withdrawal in 2011 . closer cooperation on cyber crime zu guttenberg has also been discussing bilateral relations , closer relations with nato , the fight against piracy and cyber security . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zu guttenberg wants better cooperation on cyber attacks with regards to the struggle against cyber attacks , zu guttenberg called for a better exchange of information between nato and china . " i can see a lot of room for improvement " , he said , adding that waging war with computers through the internet was now a " sad reality and of growing importance " . security policy cooperation between china and germany has been in place for years .

the photos include streets in the southern german town of oberstaufen , public spaces and soccer stadiums around the country . early on tuesday morning , google unveiled its first street view photographs in germany , honoring the bavarian town of oberstaufen to include " selected streets " where the company had sent its vehicles .
oberstaufen had previously explicitly invited google to their town , and even went so far as to bake the silicon valley company a cake , citing the potential for a boost in tourism .
earlier this year , the company announced it would launch street view in germany 's 20 largest cities , including berlin , hamburg and cologne , by the end of the year .
other specific locations around germany that are also available include a public square surrounded by historical buildings in dresden called the theaterplatz and a number of football stadiums , including munich 's allianz arena .
google said that there had been no reaction from government officials to the launch , despite all the controversy generated by the company 's plans for the last 18 months .
" we have n't heard anything from politicians or -lsb- data protection authorities -rsb- , " said lena wagner , a google germany spokesperson , in an interview with deutsche welle .
after government authorities complained , including consumer affairs minister ilse aigner and foreign affairs minister guido westerwelle , google eventually acquiesced to public pressure , providing an eight-week window , which ended last month , for german citizens to remove themselves from the service .
after the deadline , the california company announced that around 244,000 people had chosen to opt-out of the service , or under three percent of the total number of residents of the 20 selected cities .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bavarian town had previously baked a cake for google some houses are blurred as google promised , the removed houses show up as a blurry , translucent image , such as the house next to the buecher edele bookstore at hugo-von-koenigsegg strasse 13 in oberstaufen .
in an interview last month with deutsche welle , wagner noted that despite their complaints , germans actually like using street view in other countries where it already exists , saying that hundreds of thousands of germans use it every week .
" we also know that germany is the number one country in terms of street view in all countries where we have n't launched street view yet , " she said .
despite the launch of google street view , germany is continuing to investigate possible privacy violations as google admitted that it had captured some " payload data " while scanning open wifi networks during the course of taking photographs for street view .
in late october , the company admitted that it had captured some e-mails and passwords .
those revelations failed to surprise johannes caspar , hamburg 's commissioner for data protection and freedom of information , who is a leading authority in the german google investigation .
" this just confirms what we expected , " he told deutsche welle at the time , adding that the company could yet face fines .

the photos include streets in the southern german town of oberstaufen , public spaces and soccer stadiums around the country . early on tuesday morning , google unveiled its first street view photographs in germany , honoring the bavarian town of oberstaufen to include " selected streets " where the company had sent its vehicles .
oberstaufen had previously explicitly invited google to their town , and even went so far as to bake the silicon valley company a cake , citing the potential for a boost in tourism .
earlier this year , the company announced it would launch street view in germany 's 20 largest cities , including berlin , hamburg and cologne , by the end of the year .
other specific locations around germany that are also available include a public square surrounded by historical buildings in dresden called the theaterplatz and a number of football stadiums , including munich 's allianz arena .
google said that there had been no reaction from government officials to the launch , despite all the controversy generated by the company 's plans for the last 18 months .
" we have n't heard anything from politicians or -lsb- data protection authorities -rsb- , " said lena wagner , a google germany spokesperson , in an interview with deutsche welle .
after government authorities complained , including consumer affairs minister ilse aigner and foreign affairs minister guido westerwelle , google eventually acquiesced to public pressure , providing an eight-week window , which ended last month , for german citizens to remove themselves from the service .
after the deadline , the california company announced that around 244,000 people had chosen to opt-out of the service , or under three percent of the total number of residents of the 20 selected cities .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bavarian town had previously baked a cake for google some houses are blurred as google promised , the removed houses show up as a blurry , translucent image , such as the house next to the buecher edele bookstore at hugo-von-koenigsegg strasse 13 in oberstaufen .
in an interview last month with deutsche welle , wagner noted that despite their complaints , germans actually like using street view in other countries where it already exists , saying that hundreds of thousands of germans use it every week .
" we also know that germany is the number one country in terms of street view in all countries where we have n't launched street view yet , " she said .
despite the launch of google street view , germany is continuing to investigate possible privacy violations as google admitted that it had captured some " payload data " while scanning open wifi networks during the course of taking photographs for street view .
in late october , the company admitted that it had captured some e-mails and passwords .
those revelations failed to surprise johannes caspar , hamburg 's commissioner for data protection and freedom of information , who is a leading authority in the german google investigation .
" this just confirms what we expected , " he told deutsche welle at the time , adding that the company could yet face fines .

deutsche welle has compiled a list of this month 's highlights . international highrise prize 2010 height is a status symbol , especially when it comes to skyscrapers .
company heads like to reserve the top floor for their offices and the most influential firms rise above the cityscape .
for years now , cities have competed for bragging rights when it comes to housing the world 's tallest building .
dubai recently topped its competitors with the burj khalifa tower at 828 meters -lrb- 2,717 feet -rrb- .
but height is n't everything it seems ; at least not for the international highrise award .
each year , frankfurt 's architecture museum honors a building with the prestigious award that includes 50,000 euros -lrb- $ 69,000 -rrb- for the edifice 's owner and a statue for its architect .
in selecting a winner , the jury considers the building technique , aesthetics , the structure 's connection with its surroundings and cost efficiency .
this year 's winning construction will be announced on november 5 .
the finalists include the aqua tower in chicago -lrb- usa -rrb- , the shanghai world finance center -lrb- china -rrb- and the burj khalifa tower in dubai .
the latter houses practically an entire city , including a hotel , various apartments and luxury residences , office space and an open air observatory - the world 's highest , needless to mention . bildunterschrift : skyscrapers in chicago , dubai and shanghai are finalists for the 2010 international highrise award momentous date in german history november 9 is bound up with events both wonderful and terrible from modern german history .
for one , the date marks the fall of the berlin wall in 1989 .
a space commemorating the events of november 9 , 1989 will be presented to the public this year along a section of the wall that still stands .
but looking back several decades before that turning point , november 9 was also the date of an infamous episode during the nazi era : the kristallnacht or night of broken glass .
in the night from november 8-9,1938 , nazis burned jewish institutions throughout the country .
synagogues were destroyed , while jewish citizens were murdered or sent to concentration camps .
now , the jewish community in germany marks this dark chapter in the country 's history each year with events like tours through synagogues or a silent march through the city , planned this year by school children in berlin . the " fantastic four " hit the road they brought hip hop to germany and their fans still love them for it : the band " die fantastischen vier " -lrb- " the fantastic four " -rrb- .
their songs have been staples in the german music charts for more than 20 years now .
when they got their start , hip hop was almost exclusively performed in english , but the school friends smudo , and .
ypsilon , michi beck and thomas d wanted to rap in german - with nonsensical lyrics that nevertheless raised some weighty themes .
after a creative break , the band is going back on tour starting november 9 with a total of 16 concerts in germany , austria and switzerland .
and their fans are ready and waiting - not just for the songs on their new album -lrb- titled " fuer dich immer noch fanta sie " in german -rrb- but also for the group 's new stage concept .
the band will perform on a round stage in each arena , surrounded on all sides by concert-goers . bildunterschrift : still fantastic after 20 years : die fantastischen vier carnival begins spring , summer , fall and winter - those are the four official seasons in germany .
but in some parts of the country , there 's at least one more .
in the rhineland in western germany , the carnival season begins on november 11 -lrb- that is , 11/11 -rrb- at 11:11 a.m.
there are any number of theories about why the number 11 plays such a big role in the festivities but the rhineland revelers do n't worry too much about them .
the main thing is to party , drink , dance and be crazy .
after the one-day opening festival , the party mostly vanishes from public view until the new year begins .
after all , the storefronts and city squares are bedecked with holiday decorations and attractions until then .
but once january hits , the carnival clowns and streamers will be out in full force .
behind the scenes , carnival associations prepare all year round for the event and some loyal fans who have left behind the chill of a german november even listen to carnival music on the beach . bildunterschrift : 11:11 on 11/11 can only mean one thing : the start of carnival in the rhineland in memory of a great musician during mid-month in berlin , though , things will be a bit more civilized as musicians from across the world meet to take part in the " grand prix emanuel feuermann " cello contest .
the event is named after a renowned 20th-century cellist who taught at the academy of music arts in berlin before being forced out of his position in 1933 for being jewish .
he died in 1942 in new york .
the first contest was organized in 2002 by berlin 's university of the arts and is held every four years to honor feuermann .
during the first session of the contest , feuermann 's youngest sister , then in her mid 90s , was a guest , despite having planned never to return to germany again after fleeing during the nazi period .
this year 's participants will also travel in from all over the world , including competitors from china , russia , canada , korea , france , england , germany and the czech republic .
the winner receives not just a prize of 15,000 euros but also support for a cd production and concert appearances and tours . bildunterschrift : young talents from across the world will take the stage at the grand prix emanuel feuermann ruhr 2010 : trash scavengers from istanbul on stage rimini-protokoll are three young men from berlin that present theater works - but not with actors .
instead , they use people they meet on the street - for instance , four trash scavengers from istanbul .
director daniel wetzel met them around a year ago when he was in the turkish capital looking for ideas .
he saw scavengers everywhere in the city : kurdish men and roma from villages in anatolia , who scrounge around for metal , plastic , tin and anything else that 's valuable from morning until night .
after talking to some of them , the result was " herr dagacar und die goldene tektonik des muells " -lrb- " mr. dagacar and the golden tectonics of trash " -rrb- .
the theater piece premiered in istanbul on october 15 and its german premiere will take place on november 26 as part of the ruhr region 's year as a european capital of culture .
the four men on stage talk about their lives , villages , families - and their survival strategies .
the entire show is in turkish and kurdish , but for those who do n't understand the language , there 's a screen above the stage displaying subtitles .
it 's an unusual format but one that 's already meant success for the young theater makers . bildunterschrift : searching for valuable : four scavengers from istanbul take the stage in the ruhr valley christmas market season opens by the end of november , it 's already christmas time in germany .
cookies and chocolate santas have already been in the stores since september .
but the end of the month marks the official opening for many of germany 's christmas markets , including the most famous market in nuremberg on november 26 .
there , guests will be greeted personally by a figure known in german as the christkind : a woman with long blond locks wearing a golden crown .
she hands out treats , accepts wish lists and reads to children.young women in nuremberg between 16 and 19 years old can apply to fill the role each year .
around two million guests visit the market every year and many travel all the way from the us or japan just for the event .
these days , the atmosphere is so international that it 's no surprise to hear the sounds of " silent night " sung in japanese wafting from some of the stands . bildunterschrift : the " christkind " opens the festivities each year at nuremberg 's world-famous christmas market author : petra lambeck , anggatira golmer -lrb- gsw -rrb- editor : gavin blackburn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in the night from november 8-9,1938 , nazis burned jewish institutions throughout the country .
synagogues were destroyed , while jewish citizens were murdered or sent to concentration camps .
now , the jewish community in germany marks this dark chapter in the country 's history each year with events like tours through synagogues or a silent march through the city , planned this year by school children in berlin . the " fantastic four " hit the road they brought hip hop to germany and their fans still love them for it : the band " die fantastischen vier " -lrb- " the fantastic four " -rrb- .

in the rhineland in western germany , the carnival season begins on november 11 -lrb- that is , 11/11 -rrb- at 11:11 a.m.
there are any number of theories about why the number 11 plays such a big role in the festivities but the rhineland revelers do n't worry too much about them .
the main thing is to party , drink , dance and be crazy .
after the one-day opening festival , the party mostly vanishes from public view until the new year begins .
after all , the storefronts and city squares are bedecked with holiday decorations and attractions until then .

the first contest was organized in 2002 by berlin 's university of the arts and is held every four years to honor feuermann .
during the first session of the contest , feuermann 's youngest sister , then in her mid 90s , was a guest , despite having planned never to return to germany again after fleeing during the nazi period .
this year 's participants will also travel in from all over the world , including competitors from china , russia , canada , korea , france , england , germany and the czech republic .

synagogues were destroyed , while jewish citizens were murdered or sent to concentration camps .
now , the jewish community in germany marks this dark chapter in the country 's history each year with events like tours through synagogues or a silent march through the city , planned this year by school children in berlin . the " fantastic four " hit the road they brought hip hop to germany and their fans still love them for it : the band " die fantastischen vier " -lrb- " the fantastic four " -rrb- .
their songs have been staples in the german music charts for more than 20 years now .
when they got their start , hip hop was almost exclusively performed in english , but the school friends smudo , and .
ypsilon , michi beck and thomas d wanted to rap in german - with nonsensical lyrics that nevertheless raised some weighty themes .
after a creative break , the band is going back on tour starting november 9 with a total of 16 concerts in germany , austria and switzerland .
and their fans are ready and waiting - not just for the songs on their new album -lrb- titled " fuer dich immer noch fanta sie " in german -rrb- but also for the group 's new stage concept .
the band will perform on a round stage in each arena , surrounded on all sides by concert-goers . bildunterschrift : still fantastic after 20 years : die fantastischen vier carnival begins spring , summer , fall and winter - those are the four official seasons in germany .
but in some parts of the country , there 's at least one more .
in the rhineland in western germany , the carnival season begins on november 11 -lrb- that is , 11/11 -rrb- at 11:11 a.m.
there are any number of theories about why the number 11 plays such a big role in the festivities but the rhineland revelers do n't worry too much about them .
the main thing is to party , drink , dance and be crazy .
after the one-day opening festival , the party mostly vanishes from public view until the new year begins .
after all , the storefronts and city squares are bedecked with holiday decorations and attractions until then .
but once january hits , the carnival clowns and streamers will be out in full force .
behind the scenes , carnival associations prepare all year round for the event and some loyal fans who have left behind the chill of a german november even listen to carnival music on the beach . bildunterschrift : 11:11 on 11/11 can only mean one thing : the start of carnival in the rhineland in memory of a great musician during mid-month in berlin , though , things will be a bit more civilized as musicians from across the world meet to take part in the " grand prix emanuel feuermann " cello contest .
the event is named after a renowned 20th-century cellist who taught at the academy of music arts in berlin before being forced out of his position in 1933 for being jewish .
he died in 1942 in new york .
the first contest was organized in 2002 by berlin 's university of the arts and is held every four years to honor feuermann .
during the first session of the contest , feuermann 's youngest sister , then in her mid 90s , was a guest , despite having planned never to return to germany again after fleeing during the nazi period .
this year 's participants will also travel in from all over the world , including competitors from china , russia , canada , korea , france , england , germany and the czech republic .
the winner receives not just a prize of 15,000 euros but also support for a cd production and concert appearances and tours . bildunterschrift : young talents from across the world will take the stage at the grand prix emanuel feuermann ruhr 2010 : trash scavengers from istanbul on stage rimini-protokoll are three young men from berlin that present theater works - but not with actors .
instead , they use people they meet on the street - for instance , four trash scavengers from istanbul .
director daniel wetzel met them around a year ago when he was in the turkish capital looking for ideas .
he saw scavengers everywhere in the city : kurdish men and roma from villages in anatolia , who scrounge around for metal , plastic , tin and anything else that 's valuable from morning until night .
after talking to some of them , the result was " herr dagacar und die goldene tektonik des muells " -lrb- " mr. dagacar and the golden tectonics of trash " -rrb- .
the theater piece premiered in istanbul on october 15 and its german premiere will take place on november 26 as part of the ruhr region 's year as a european capital of culture .
the four men on stage talk about their lives , villages , families - and their survival strategies .
the entire show is in turkish and kurdish , but for those who do n't understand the language , there 's a screen above the stage displaying subtitles .
it 's an unusual format but one that 's already meant success for the young theater makers . bildunterschrift : searching for valuable : four scavengers from istanbul take the stage in the ruhr valley christmas market season opens by the end of november , it 's already christmas time in germany .
cookies and chocolate santas have already been in the stores since september .
but the end of the month marks the official opening for many of germany 's christmas markets , including the most famous market in nuremberg on november 26 .
there , guests will be greeted personally by a figure known in german as the christkind : a woman with long blond locks wearing a golden crown .
she hands out treats , accepts wish lists and reads to children.young women in nuremberg between 16 and 19 years old can apply to fill the role each year .
around two million guests visit the market every year and many travel all the way from the us or japan just for the event .
these days , the atmosphere is so international that it 's no surprise to hear the sounds of " silent night " sung in japanese wafting from some of the stands . bildunterschrift : the " christkind " opens the festivities each year at nuremberg 's world-famous christmas market author : petra lambeck , anggatira golmer -lrb- gsw -rrb- editor : neale lytollis send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

deutsche welle has compiled a list of this month 's highlights . international highrise prize 2010 height is a status symbol , especially when it comes to skyscrapers .

for years now , cities have competed for bragging rights when it comes to housing the world 's tallest building .
dubai recently topped its competitors with the burj khalifa tower at 828 meters -lrb- 2,717 feet -rrb- .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de champions league -pipe- 02.11.2010 schalke and bremen limp into champions league fixtures großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : magath has bigger problems at home than in europe two of germany 's champions league representatives are beginning to fray at the edges at home .
both schalke and werder lost last weekend , but they may have different approaches to european competition . the champions league is meant to separate the men from the boys .
football connoisseurs enjoy pointing out that it is superior in quality to the world cup , and no less an authority than real madrid coach jose mourinho has said it is the best competition in the world .
but then he would , seeing as how he ’ s won it twice .
but in the group stages at least , the gulf between europe 's rich and poor leagues often belies this claim , and germany 's representatives in this season 's champions league seem to be finding europe 's best of the best a lot easier to cope with than unglamorous mid-table sides like nuremberg .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : raul and schalke did n't find hapoel to be much of a challenge bayern munich , last season 's champion 's league finalists , have only just broken into the top half of the table , but they are three from three in their easy european group .
but it is schalke , led by veteran coach felix magath and spear-headed on the pitch by spanish star raul , who are best at showing up what a questionable test the champions league group stages really are .
schalke are second from bottom in the league , having scraped together six points from 10 games - the exact same total they have notched up in their three champions league matches , thanks to routine wins against portugal 's benfica and israel 's hapoel tel aviv .
another win in tel aviv on tuesday and they will be well on their way out of the group .
superficial glory but there are of course many other factors at play .
as magath never tires of pointing out , schalke are struggling with new signings and a new system , and somehow the glamour and much-mooted ' magic ' of europe seems to lift veterans like raul , the champions league ’ s all-time top scorer .
the short-term glory of a much-needed win in europe is a balm for many sorrows .
after raul put two past hapoel a couple of weeks ago , there was much optimistic talk of " transferring " that form to the league , but saturday 's 1-0 home defeat to local rivals leverkusen ended with the players being booed off the pitch , and now schalke face the real prospect of replacing their dead title dreams with a relegation battle .
that is not much fun for internationally experienced stars like manuel neuer , klaas-jan huntelaar and christoph metzelder , and magath sounded pessimistic after the game .
" we have players who are used to playing for the top .
that 's why they ca n't cope with the situation , " newspaper bild quoted magath as saying . " the performance didn ’ t match our current position in the standings .
we have to try to avoid a tight situation at the bottom of the table . "
mid-table struggle for werder bremen , the problem is more subtle .
their league form is not good either , and they also just lost at home , to a solid but average nuremberg .
but their attacking line-up featuring the likes of claudio pizarro , hugo almeida , and marko marin are always good for a few goals , and they have at least consolidated mid-table status .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nuremberg held off bremen and stole an away win in europe , though , they face a scrap .
tuesday sees them host dutch champions fc twente , and the match is pretty much a do-or-die tie for both teams - they are both on two points , behind second-placed tottenham hotspur , who have four .
a defeat would signify pretty much the end of the competition for werder , and a draw does neither team much good .
werder 's frame of mind going into the match is pessimistic .
" the only chance we still have is getting three points , " marin said after saturday 's game .
" but that will be difficult .
the mood in the dressing room is not good . "
team captain torsten frings was livid after the defeat on saturday .
" we 're just being too careless with the situation , " he said , after railing against his team-mates as the final whistle went .
but he does not see the champions league match as a distraction , but a chance .
" it ’ s a good opportunity to take a big step forward , " he said .
the combination of having a fight on their hands , along with the fact that they will have something to prove to the weserstadion faithful , means they may well pull off a win against twente .
werder have more european experience , and home advantage should see them get past the dutch side , whom they held to a 1-1 draw in the netherlands .
for schalke , meanwhile , the champions league needs to be an afterthought .

but critics suggest the idea of troops regularly serving under foreign command could cause problems . david cameron and nicolas sarkozy put pen to paper on two treaties in london .
the agreements will see britain and france jointly testing nuclear warheads , coordinating aircraft carriers so there is always a british or french vessel available for joint operations , and creating a combined expeditionary force training troops to deploy together .
france will also be allowed to use british a400m fuelling aircraft when there is spare capacity and there will be joint work on drones , mine counter-measures and satellite communications .
both men were keen to reject claims the move will diminish british or french sovereignty in any way .
david cameron insisted : bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain and france want to get closer and save money too " this is not , as some have suggested , about weakening or pooling british or french sovereignty .
this is not about a european army .
this is not about sharing our nuclear deterrents .
let me say this plainly : britain and france are , and will always remain , sovereign nations , able to deploy our armed forces independently and in our national interest when we choose to do so . "
david cameron ‘ s defence secretary liam fox has pointed out that it is not unusual for british troops to serve under foreign command - it happens often in nato operations .
the prime minister also said that uk forces are deployed alongside those of its allies on a regular basis , saying that " the vast bulk of our military operations - bosnia , kosovo , afghanistan , amongst others , have been conducted together with our allies . "
he added that such operations were always about defending britain 's national interest , and that they were " about practical , hard-headed co-operation between sovereign countries . "
france and britain have disagreed , even fairly recently , on military intervention - for example , on the invasion of iraq in 2003 .
so president sarkozy and prime minister cameron were sure to point out that a ' political agreement ' would have to be reached for the joint taskforce to be deployed .
sarkozy maintained , however , that france and britain already cooperated on major military operations and would continue to do so .
" if you , my british friends , have to face a major crisis , " said sarkozy , " could you imagine france simply sitting there , its arms crossed , saying that it 's none of our business ? "
' unprecedented and historic ' sarkozy did say , however , that the pacts demonstrated that britain and france were especially close at the moment , and hailed the anglo-french relationship : " this is an unprecedented decision and it shows a level of trust and confidence between our two nations that is unequalled in history . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france and britain , historical enemies , have grown quite close the french president , also aware that some analysts had described the pact as a signal of an overall weakening of combined british and french military power , was quick to dispel that notion . " we consider that the security effort should not in any way be drawn down in an increasingly dangerous world , which is that in which we live . "
the two leaders do both hope , however , that co-operation can lead to savings in costs .
the uk has recently announced cuts in its defense budget as part of its austerity drive and wants greater pooling of resources with france to help it maintain its military might , while bringing down its expense .
' big questions ' britain 's shadow defense secretary jim murphy welcomed the emphasis on greater co-operation in military matters , saying that deepening ties is ' essential ' to modern defense policy among allies .
however , he warned that " interdependence is different from dependence , and binding legal treaties pose some big questions for the government . "
murphy also said the uk could be entering " an era where we are reliant on our allies to fill in the gaps in the government 's defense policy . "
maintaining global might bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france sends its soldiers far and wide , but could stand to save money france and britain 's defense budgets are among the largest in the world .
both countries punch above their weight militarily and do not want to surrender their strategic advantage in this area .
alastair cameron , european security expert at the royal united services institute in london , thinks that is in little danger of happening , despite austerity drives .
" one could clearly be tempted to say that , forced to recognize their diminished stature in the world , these two countries are trying to do more together to avoid being overtaken by others , " he said . but cameron also said the two countries were such significant military contributors to global military operations that it would be hard to see much diminishment of their ambition to play a part on the global strategic scene .
" the military is facing a squeeze , of course , " said cameron , " but there is no doubt that their capacity , even under austerity measures , maintains an edge over a good number or other countries . "

he also called on nato to work more closely with china on the exchange of information about cyber attacks . zu guttenberg met with his chinese counterpart liang guanglie on tuesday , calling on beijing to do more to help stabilize afghanistan in the face of a growing insurgency and worsening violence .
however , he stressed there was no military role for the chinese to play there . " we have a shared interest when it comes to the question of at what time do we reach a stable , or at least an agreeably stable , afghanistan , with a state of security that we can accept , " zu guttenberg said in beijing . china is not involved in the war in afghanistan , but has economic interests there . zu guttenberg said training civil servants was one area in which china could step up its involvement . " when it comes to goals we can reach and we have to reach , i think , the neighbors can also play a significant role .
we have to look at the most important neighbors as well and china is one of them , " he said . mineral wealth china would benefit from a stable afghanistan because it would be easier for its firms to complete billion-dollar resource deals they have or are considering . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china is reluctant to get more involved in a war-torn afghanistan the us defense department estimated earlier this year afghanistan 's mineral resources could top $ 1 trillion -lrb- 0.7 trillion euros -rrb- . how to stabilize afghanistan will be a major issue at a nato summit in lisbon later this month and in us president barack obama 's strategy review in december . germany is the third-largest contributor to the nato-led force in afghanistan with about 4,600 troops and , like the united states , is looking at starting a partial withdrawal in 2011 . closer cooperation on cyber crime zu guttenberg has also been discussing bilateral relations , closer relations with nato , the fight against piracy and cyber security . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zu guttenberg wants better cooperation on cyber attacks with regards to the struggle against cyber attacks , zu guttenberg called for a better exchange of information between nato and china . " i can see a lot of room for improvement " , he said , adding that waging war with computers through the internet was now a " sad reality and of growing importance " . security policy cooperation between china and germany has been in place for years .

three have exploded , injuring a delivery worker , and police have destroyed others with controlled blasts . a string of letter bombs targeted embassies in athens on tuesday and police suspect far-left domestic groups of planning the attacks .
police spokesman athanassios kokalakis said an individual on a motorbike threw an explosive device into the swiss embassy courtyard in athens .
the object detonated with a " deafening blast " but no injuries were reported .
another bomb exploded at the russian embassy without injury .
earlier , a suspicious package was discovered at the bulgarian embassy , which was then cordoned off for a bomb squad to destroy the suspect package with a controlled blast .
one package addressed to the chilean embassy was detonated by police in a mail delivery van outside parliament in athens , while one addressed to the german embassy was discovered at the office of a courier company .
the blasts come a day after police foiled a parcel-bombing campaign in the city on monday .
authorities intercepted and defused several other packages with explosive material inside that were addressed to other embassies .
one bomb exploded at a delivery service , leaving a worker hospitalized with burns .
that bomb was addressed to the mexican embassy , according to greek officials .

experts who investigated the failed bombing of a us-bound plane in december 2009 , an attempted attack later claimed by aqap , said that if the toner bombs had been constructed by yemeni al-qaeda operatives then the group had achieved a level of expertise previously unseen .
" if al-qaeda indeed made them , " former cia agent robert baer told the washington times , " then they 've teamed up with true professionals . "
the sophistication of the bombs helped them to pass undetected through explosives scanners at hubs such as britain 's east midlands airport and cologne-bonn , a fact that prompted the german government - along with britain , france , canada and the united states - to ban airfreight from yemen and extend the restrictions to include passenger flights originating there .
terrorism experts initially suggested that the cargo planes were targeted for explosion over densely populated cities but when it was revealed that the bombs made the first part of the journey on commercial tourism flights , some experts were then forced to revise their theories to include a potential strike against airborne passengers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sophistication of the bombs have surprised experts despite foiling the bomb plots before any lives were lost , us intelligence agencies are concerned that yemen-based terrorist groups are becoming increasingly advanced in their planning .
they are quickly learning not to underestimate the threat coming out of yemen 's impoverished , tribal landscape and are reviewing their risk assessment of the group 's potential international reach .
given the sophistication of the devices , their route through germany and the discovery of one of the bombs at britain 's east midlands airport , the nightmare scenario of aqap extending its reach to europe has put the continent 's anti-terror authorities on alert .
however , jeremy binnie , terrorism and insurgency editor at jane 's defense , believes that aqap has had the opportunity to attack european targets but has so far maintained its focus on the united states .
aqap had opportunity to hit europe but did n't , say experts " the data points we have suggest that the us remains aqap 's primary target , " binnie told deutsche welle .
" they could have blown up the toner bombs anywhere over europe but chose not to which suggests their final destination would have been the united states with detonation taking place over a densely-populated area to maximise casualties .
as with the christmas day attempt last year , the bomb travelled through europe destined for chicago but again , the bomb was not detonated in europe suggesting the target was clearly the us . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aqap boss nasser al-wahaishi leads the yemen franchise " aqap are very ambitious , " he added .
" they want to hit the ' head of the snake ' as osama bin laden calls the us , not washington 's partners .
attacking the us is al-qaeda 's primary objective as it creates the maximum amount of coverage , increases international pressure on governments like yemen 's to confront islamist militants and in turn destabilizes these countries , making them even more vulnerable to al-qaeda 's influence . "
henry wilkinson , the associate director of janusian security risk management , agreed that the us was more likely to be a target for aqap but that europe 's association with the us also put it at a certain amount of risk .
" i do n't think europe is any higher a priority target than the united states , " he told deutsche welle .
" aqap has made threats against all the western powers it argues are causing harm to muslims - by gift of military deployments in afghanistan or iraq , support for israel , or perceived offences against islam such as banning the veil .
i suspect the united states is the most sought after target , but europe seems to be the focus of more plots - i suspect because it is a softer target by gift of border security and a greater preponderance of local sympathisers . "
european nations equally at risk should aqap switch focus when asked if the discovery of a toner bomb in britain or the fact that it passed through germany on its route suggested either country was under specific threat , wilkinson disagreed .
" i do n't think there is any merit in suggesting any one country is at particular risk , " he said .
" aqap has threatened many countries and may have been involved in the kidnap and murder of several german nationals in northern yemen in 2009 .
in this respect , i think germany as a leading european country is as much at risk as france , the uk , or any other prominent european nation . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bombs could have gone off in cologne or britain - but did n't " if aqap or any other groups were intent on mounting an attack in europe , they would take into account operational viability and target opportunity , as well as political significance of attacking the country . "
while the high-profile cases coming out of yemen have certainly turned the world 's attention toward its situation , most experts consider other countries as regions more deserving of concern in relation to european security .
" we have not seen much evidence that aqap has the capability to mount long-lead , multi-cell operations in europe , and its record of attempting such operations have mostly focused on saudi arabia , " wilkinson said .
" while i think this latest incident has focussed minds on the threat from yemen , the hierarchy of threat concerns for most european governments very likely remains , in order , afghanistan-pakistan , somalia and then yemen . "

but critics suggest the idea of troops regularly serving under foreign command could cause problems . david cameron and nicolas sarkozy put pen to paper on two treaties in london .
the agreements will see britain and france jointly testing nuclear warheads , coordinating aircraft carriers so there is always a british or french vessel available for joint operations , and creating a combined expeditionary force training troops to deploy together .
france will also be allowed to use british a400m fuelling aircraft when there is spare capacity and there will be joint work on drones , mine counter-measures and satellite communications .
both men were keen to reject claims the move will diminish british or french sovereignty in any way .
david cameron insisted : bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain and france want to get closer and save money too " this is not , as some have suggested , about weakening or pooling british or french sovereignty .
this is not about a european army .
this is not about sharing our nuclear deterrents .
let me say this plainly : britain and france are , and will always remain , sovereign nations , able to deploy our armed forces independently and in our national interest when we choose to do so . "
david cameron ‘ s defence secretary liam fox has pointed out that it is not unusual for british troops to serve under foreign command - it happens often in nato operations .
the prime minister also said that uk forces are deployed alongside those of its allies on a regular basis , saying that " the vast bulk of our military operations - bosnia , kosovo , afghanistan , amongst others , have been conducted together with our allies . "
he added that such operations were always about defending britain 's national interest , and that they were " about practical , hard-headed co-operation between sovereign countries . "
france and britain have disagreed , even fairly recently , on military intervention - for example , on the invasion of iraq in 2003 .
so president sarkozy and prime minister cameron were sure to point out that a ' political agreement ' would have to be reached for the joint taskforce to be deployed .
sarkozy maintained , however , that france and britain already cooperated on major military operations and would continue to do so .
" if you , my british friends , have to face a major crisis , " said sarkozy , " could you imagine france simply sitting there , its arms crossed , saying that it 's none of our business ? "
' unprecedented and historic ' sarkozy did say , however , that the pacts demonstrated that britain and france were especially close at the moment , and hailed the anglo-french relationship : " this is an unprecedented decision and it shows a level of trust and confidence between our two nations that is unequalled in history . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france and britain , historical enemies , have grown quite close the french president , also aware that some analysts had described the pact as a signal of an overall weakening of combined british and french military power , was quick to dispel that notion . " we consider that the security effort should not in any way be drawn down in an increasingly dangerous world , which is that in which we live . "
the two leaders do both hope , however , that co-operation can lead to savings in costs .
the uk has recently announced cuts in its defense budget as part of its austerity drive and wants greater pooling of resources with france to help it maintain its military might , while bringing down its expense .
' big questions ' britain 's shadow defense secretary jim murphy welcomed the emphasis on greater co-operation in military matters , saying that deepening ties is ' essential ' to modern defense policy among allies .
however , he warned that " interdependence is different from dependence , and binding legal treaties pose some big questions for the government . "
murphy also said the uk could be entering " an era where we are reliant on our allies to fill in the gaps in the government 's defense policy . "
maintaining global might bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france sends its soldiers far and wide , but could stand to save money france and britain 's defense budgets are among the largest in the world .
both countries punch above their weight militarily and do not want to surrender their strategic advantage in this area .
alastair cameron , european security expert at the royal united services institute in london , thinks that is in little danger of happening , despite austerity drives .
" one could clearly be tempted to say that , forced to recognize their diminished stature in the world , these two countries are trying to do more together to avoid being overtaken by others , " he said . but cameron also said the two countries were such significant military contributors to global military operations that it would be hard to see much diminishment of their ambition to play a part on the global strategic scene .
" the military is facing a squeeze , of course , " said cameron , " but there is no doubt that their capacity , even under austerity measures , maintains an edge over a good number or other countries . "

with the genre already well established , writers are free to experiment . in his autobiographical graphic novel , " vier augen " -lrb- " four eyes " -rrb- , sascha hommer depicts some memorable events from his youth in germany 's black forest region .
this includes smoking with friends , dating a girl with an eating disorder and discovering lsd . he manages to capture these moments in a surprisingly small number of simple , black-and-white drawings , evoking the worries , fears and hopes of a young person growing up in a rural area .
the drawings contain little text , as he believes that complex descriptions are not always necessary for expressing important thoughts . " people say that what really counts is a good story - that pictures are not so important , " said hommer .
" but this style also conveys messages - not just in my books but also in the books of many of my role models . " bildunterschrift : ' vier augen ' deals with youth issues serious and funny many of the newer comics and graphic novels in germany deal with very serious topics , like hommer 's book , broaching the trying experiences of adolescence .
he has observed , however , that some young authors are trying to steer away from this kind of weightiness .
" the young comic writers that are now making their debut on the german market are much more easy-going about it , " explained hommer .
" they are going to bring the humor back into the comic genre . " dirk rehm , a spokesman for reprodukt , the publishing company behind hommer 's books , believes that there is a good reason for new writers to have a more relaxed approach to their work . " the younger writers can indeed be a lot more easy-going because they no longer have to prove that comics can be more than smut and trash - this was already accomplished by the last generation , " rehm told deutsche welle .
" they can just do what they feel like . " although reprodukt does publish a lot of comics of autobiographical and biographical nature , rhem says that it is in no way short on humorous and adventure-themed material either .
in addition to this , he has observed yet another new trend emerging within the genre : historical topics . ' hybrid ' literature bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hommer believes comics can convey complex thoughts hommer , a slim , dark-haired man in his early 30s , sees comics as a hybrid genre .
he started reading them at a very young age , as well as drawing pictures of his own .
he later went on to study illustration at the hamburg university of applied sciences , mentored by german comic author anke feuchtenberger . an official comic-writing degree does not exist at german universities as yet . at the moment , comics and graphic novels are receiving increasing attention in cultural media , and , according to hommer , they are also selling relatively well . " compared to small publishing companies that publish debut novels by unknown authors , the small comic publishers are very successful , " said hommer . hommer 's next book is going to tackle a serious topic .
it presents the short stories of brigitte kronauer , winner of the georg buechner prize - germany 's most important literary prize - in comic form . " i find ms kronauer 's texts great , " said hommer .
" in my adaptations i 'm trying to convey the same amount of information as her writing . " and if a picture really is worth a thousand words , that could make for one short comic book . author : dirk schneider , eva wutke editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

deutsche welle has compiled a list of this month 's highlights . international highrise prize 2010 height is a status symbol , especially when it comes to skyscrapers .
company heads like to reserve the top floor for their offices and the most influential firms rise above the cityscape .
for years now , cities have competed for bragging rights when it comes to housing the world 's tallest building .
dubai recently topped its competitors with the burj khalifa tower at 828 meters -lrb- 2,717 feet -rrb- .
but height is n't everything it seems ; at least not for the international highrise award .
each year , frankfurt 's architecture museum honors a building with the prestigious award that includes 50,000 euros -lrb- $ 69,000 -rrb- for the edifice 's owner and a statue for its architect .
in selecting a winner , the jury considers the building technique , aesthetics , the structure 's connection with its surroundings and cost efficiency .
this year 's winning construction will be announced on november 5 .
the finalists include the aqua tower in chicago -lrb- usa -rrb- , the shanghai world finance center -lrb- china -rrb- and the burj khalifa tower in dubai .
the latter houses practically an entire city , including a hotel , various apartments and luxury residences , office space and an open air observatory - the world 's highest , needless to mention . bildunterschrift : skyscrapers in chicago , dubai and shanghai are finalists for the 2010 international highrise award momentous date in german history november 9 is bound up with events both wonderful and terrible from modern german history .
for one , the date marks the fall of the berlin wall in 1989 .
a space commemorating the events of november 9 , 1989 will be presented to the public this year along a section of the wall that still stands .
but looking back several decades before that turning point , november 9 was also the date of an infamous episode during the nazi era : the kristallnacht or night of broken glass .
in the night from november 8-9,1938 , nazis burned jewish institutions throughout the country .
synagogues were destroyed , while jewish citizens were murdered or sent to concentration camps .
now , the jewish community in germany marks this dark chapter in the country 's history each year with events like tours through synagogues or a silent march through the city , planned this year by school children in berlin . the " fantastic four " hit the road they brought hip hop to germany and their fans still love them for it : the band " die fantastischen vier " -lrb- " the fantastic four " -rrb- .
their songs have been staples in the german music charts for more than 20 years now .
when they got their start , hip hop was almost exclusively performed in english , but the school friends smudo , and .
ypsilon , michi beck and thomas d wanted to rap in german - with nonsensical lyrics that nevertheless raised some weighty themes .
after a creative break , the band is going back on tour starting november 9 with a total of 16 concerts in germany , austria and switzerland .
and their fans are ready and waiting - not just for the songs on their new album -lrb- titled " fuer dich immer noch fanta sie " in german -rrb- but also for the group 's new stage concept .
the band will perform on a round stage in each arena , surrounded on all sides by concert-goers . bildunterschrift : still fantastic after 20 years : die fantastischen vier carnival begins spring , summer , fall and winter - those are the four official seasons in germany .
but in some parts of the country , there 's at least one more .
in the rhineland in western germany , the carnival season begins on november 11 -lrb- that is , 11/11 -rrb- at 11:11 a.m.
there are any number of theories about why the number 11 plays such a big role in the festivities but the rhineland revelers do n't worry too much about them .
the main thing is to party , drink , dance and be crazy .
after the one-day opening festival , the party mostly vanishes from public view until the new year begins .
after all , the storefronts and city squares are bedecked with holiday decorations and attractions until then .
but once january hits , the carnival clowns and streamers will be out in full force .
behind the scenes , carnival associations prepare all year round for the event and some loyal fans who have left behind the chill of a german november even listen to carnival music on the beach . bildunterschrift : 11:11 on 11/11 can only mean one thing : the start of carnival in the rhineland in memory of a great musician during mid-month in berlin , though , things will be a bit more civilized as musicians from across the world meet to take part in the " grand prix emanuel feuermann " cello contest .
the event is named after a renowned 20th-century cellist who taught at the academy of music arts in berlin before being forced out of his position in 1933 for being jewish .
he died in 1942 in new york .
the first contest was organized in 2002 by berlin 's university of the arts and is held every four years to honor feuermann .
during the first session of the contest , feuermann 's youngest sister , then in her mid 90s , was a guest , despite having planned never to return to germany again after fleeing during the nazi period .
this year 's participants will also travel in from all over the world , including competitors from china , russia , canada , korea , france , england , germany and the czech republic .
the winner receives not just a prize of 15,000 euros but also support for a cd production and concert appearances and tours . bildunterschrift : young talents from across the world will take the stage at the grand prix emanuel feuermann ruhr 2010 : trash scavengers from istanbul on stage rimini-protokoll are three young men from berlin that present theater works - but not with actors .
instead , they use people they meet on the street - for instance , four trash scavengers from istanbul .
director daniel wetzel met them around a year ago when he was in the turkish capital looking for ideas .
he saw scavengers everywhere in the city : kurdish men and roma from villages in anatolia , who scrounge around for metal , plastic , tin and anything else that 's valuable from morning until night .
after talking to some of them , the result was " herr dagacar und die goldene tektonik des muells " -lrb- " mr. dagacar and the golden tectonics of trash " -rrb- .
the theater piece premiered in istanbul on october 15 and its german premiere will take place on november 26 as part of the ruhr region 's year as a european capital of culture .
the four men on stage talk about their lives , villages , families - and their survival strategies .
the entire show is in turkish and kurdish , but for those who do n't understand the language , there 's a screen above the stage displaying subtitles .
it 's an unusual format but one that 's already meant success for the young theater makers . bildunterschrift : searching for valuable : four scavengers from istanbul take the stage in the ruhr valley christmas market season opens by the end of november , it 's already christmas time in germany .
cookies and chocolate santas have already been in the stores since september .
but the end of the month marks the official opening for many of germany 's christmas markets , including the most famous market in nuremberg on november 26 .
there , guests will be greeted personally by a figure known in german as the christkind : a woman with long blond locks wearing a golden crown .
she hands out treats , accepts wish lists and reads to children.young women in nuremberg between 16 and 19 years old can apply to fill the role each year .
around two million guests visit the market every year and many travel all the way from the us or japan just for the event .
these days , the atmosphere is so international that it 's no surprise to hear the sounds of " silent night " sung in japanese wafting from some of the stands . bildunterschrift : the " christkind " opens the festivities each year at nuremberg 's world-famous christmas market author : petra lambeck , anggatira golmer -lrb- gsw -rrb- editor : neale lytollis send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de music -pipe- 02.11.2010 digital djs push limits with new german tech großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more and more djs are moving to digital spinning two berlin companies have released new products allowing djs to incorporate live elements and enhance their ability to remix live . online piracy of digital music is causing major problems for the music industry , as record companies continue to suffer declining sales .
however , in clubs and on dance floors , digital formats are changing the nature of djing in major ways .
in recent weeks , two berlin companies , native instruments and ableton , which both have a long history in the emerging digital djing market , have released new products that industry experts say are enhancing djs performance capabilities .
" ableton and native -lrb- instruments -rrb- seem to be two of the major players in this area at the moment , they keep development with djs in mind and keep the products coming fresh , " said mick wilson , the technology editor of dj magazine , in an interview with deutsche welle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the traktor kontrol s4 was released on monday native instrument 's traktor kontrol s4 was released on monday , and is an all-in-one approach to djing , allowing digital files to be performed and manipulated using a usb controller .
designed for portability , the controller allows for four different tracks to be loaded , sampled and mixed simultaneously .
similarly , ableton , in conjunction with the new zealand-based company serato , released its new software product , on september 22 .
" the bridge " integrates ableton live software , which allows djs to compose pieces , assemble tracks and play complete songs , with serato 's digital vinyl playback software .
this allows djs to manipulate all of these parts using specially produced vinyl records or cds .
both products are now making it easier for turntablists to hone their craft using entirely digital means .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ableton 's ceo called his company 's new product a " whole new level of excitement " berlin companies head in different directions while both ableton and native instruments claim to be innovators in the field of digital djing , they have chosen different directions to pursue .
" actually , this is just another piece to the puzzle of digital djing , but it 's the most outstanding piece because it 's the world 's first all-in-one computer based dj system , " said daniel haver , native instruments ' chief executive , in an interview with deutsche welle .
he added that native instruments ' " traktor kontrol s4 " also makes it far easier for djs to cut and loop segments of tracks , to essentially remix ‘ on the fly . '
" i can easily set a loop , shorten the loop , apply and effect and then drop it again , " explained constantin koehncke , a native instruments dj , as he demonstrated the product .
across town at ableton , the direction is integration but of a different kind .
" i think the bridge brings a whole new level of excitement to traditional djing , to be able to program your drum machines live , tweak you synthesizers live , that 's exciting , " said jeff milligan , of ableton .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bridge was released on september 22 competitors , but in different markets while both products have been in development for many years , taking many years in development , there should be no surprise that the two cross town rivals are keen to generate excitement about their products .
however , because both take different approaches to digital djing , it appears that they are not in direct competition .
" the two products are aimed at different areas of the market for different djs , it 's going to be both together not one or the other , " added mick wilson of dj magazine .
" i like them both , i like the idea of traktor and the new s4 controller looks really tasty as well .
i -lrb- also -rrb- like the idea of ' the bridge ' with ableton where you can play with an old school mentality but still incorporate modern production and remix capabilities . "

" it does not at all account for the problems that we expect to have , like surveillance , profiling , identity theft .
the fact that you have all the data in one central registry could lead to a lot of problems and a changing relationship between the state and the people , " says usha ramanatham , a prominent legal expert . however , economic analyst m. k venu says the project ’ s foremost priority is to identify target groups for various government programmes : " the uid essentially is aimed at providing identities to the very poor , which number about 600 million . " the government spends over $ 100 billion annually in delivering various social welfare programmes for them .
and it is very important that these people have an identity .
the primary importance of the uid in india is to bring 600 million people out of poverty , by targeting them in a transparent manner . " technology will tag everybody and everything ramanathan is still not convinced and says " technology has brought all these problems in .
uids will tag every person , the gps system will tag every place and a public information and infrastructure system will tag every institution .

suspects linked to far-left group the parcel ’ s delivery follows the arrest of two greek mail bomb suspects on monday who were accused of trying to send at least four parcel bombs to french president nicolas sarkozy and the mexican , dutch and belgian embassies .
the two men have been linked to a far-left group .
deutsche welle 's athens correspondent christine pirovolakis said that greek police are concerned since there were so many bombs at once circulating around in the greek capital .
the bombs are said to be sophisticated , although not powerful enough to cause great harm .
security sources said the package that made it to berlin was a " fast " explosive device that would have released a flame and caused burns had it detonated .
apparently it had not been a pipe bomb , or any other type of bomb that is designed to maim or kill with shrapnel .
similar bomb attacks in the past " one group under investigation is the ' sect of revolutionaries , ' a group that has committed other types of bomb attacks in the past , " pirovolakis said .
" in about a month 's time , we are going to have the two-year anniversary of a police shooting of a teenager , so last year around this time there was also an increase of bomb attacks in athens and it looks like it is the same this year as well . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : similar parcel bombs had been sent out on monday .
the police are starting to crack down , she added , saying that they were checking all governmental buildings and are searching individual visitors to them more closely .
also , parcels coming in and out of buildings are being rigorously screened for further investigation .
major streets in athens were also cut off to traffic .
elections in greece coming up some assume the parcel bombings could be happening due to greece 's austerity measures that have been implemented by the government .
" certainly the ways of attacks have increased since the teenage shooting a few years ago and of course the recent months since the austerity measures have been announced by the socialist government , " pirovolakis said .
" it looks like things are escalating once again .
there are also elections this coming weekend here in greece , so it looks like the left-wing groups are trying to in a way speak on behalf of the public how fed up they are with the austerity measures . "

he wants to close them through the introduction of coordinated , pan-european measures . german interior minister thomas de maiziere has called for security precautions on air cargo jets to be stepped up . the best way to do this , he says , is through closer cooperation between security agencies .
" air freight has been relatively under-monitored up to now , " de maiziere told reporters .
" evidently they recognized that and exploited it .
this means changes for the air freight business . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : package bombs got through security at cologne-bonn airport de maiziere plans to discuss the issue at a meeting of european interior ministers later this week .
his goal is to introduce coordinated security procedures on a european level .
de maiziere 's statement followed the discovery over the weekend that a package containing explosives had passed through cologne-bonn airport undetected before being found in england .
the package had been dispatched from yemen and was bound for the united states .
observers say those who planted the explosives likely exploited lax security in the country from where the aircraft began its journey .
" there are some countries in which there are security gaps , " elmar giemulla , who teaches the air transport law at the technical university of berlin , told the german press agency in an interview .
" there are rules , but whether they are properly observed is another matter , " he said .
stricter checks the international civil aviation organization -lrb- icao -rrb- sets standards for its 190 member nations .
when freight is sent from europe , or from the united states , it is either inspected or it has to be packed by a so-called ' known consignor , ' which is regulated by the state .
but elsewhere measures are n't so strictly observed .
" we need to check the reliability and control measures of third states , " de maiziere said on a visit to cologne-bonn airport on monday .
in response to the discovery of the explosives , berlin has stopped all freight and passenger flights from yemen from entering german airspace .
yemen has criticized germany 's decision to ban flights from its airports , saying it needs help to fight terrorism , not punishment .

analysts say manufacturers ' emphasis on research and development is paying off . there 's no doubt that this has been a good year for german carmakers , and equally little doubt that that has much to do with china .
volkswagen , porsche , bmw and mercedes have all made their mark on the sprawling asian landmass and notched up sales figures that far outstripped their expectations .
in the first eight months of 2010 , the chinese car market almost doubled in size with german manufacturers securing a 53 percent increase on the sales of its cars .
in an interview in monday 's die welt newspaper , the president of the german association of the automotive industry -lrb- vda -rrb- , matthias wissmann , said that german manufacturers would have produced a total of 5.45 million passenger cars by the end of the year . the lion 's share will have gone to international markets .
bildunterschrift : destined for foreign roads : german cars enjoy a good reputation overseas " over the whole year , we are expecting exports to rise 21 percent , which equates to 4.15 million passenger cars , " wissmann said .
" the strength of the asian market , especially in china , and also the recovery of the us market , have fuelled exports . "
so far this year , chinese consumers have bought 1.3 million german vehicles .
development paid off wissmann cited the decision not to cap but increase development budgets during the crisis as one of the main reasons for the surge in popularity of german cars in asian countries .
he said it had given german manufacturers a technologically competitive edge and enabled them to come up with the right range of cars .
the vda president added that the german domestic market also performed better than had been expected in 2010 .
there had been worries that demand would stagnate following the government 's decision not to extend its car scrapping subsidy scheme , whereby german car owners were paid 2,500 euros -lrb- $ 3,470 -rrb- if they traded in a vehicle that was at least nine years old and purchased a brand new one .

audi and other parts of the volkswagen concern , whose operating profit had trebled by the end of the third quarter to 4.8 billion euros , have already agreed to an increase .
bmw , porsche and daimler have yet to make a decision .

but with this unique ecosystem threatened by political unrest in the region , a series of projects aims to ensure they stay that way . the landscape around gisenyi in western rwanda , on the border to the democratic republic of the congo , is breathtakingly beautiful .
mount nyiragongo towers majestically over the city , which is contiguous with the city of goma across the border in drc .
but mount nyiragongo is an active volcano , known for its devastating eruptions .
eight years ago , goma was largely destroyed by lava .
time and again , locals here have rebuilt their devastated city in the aftermath of such eruptions , despite risks posed by the still-hot lava and the frequent earth tremors that occur in the wake of the eruption .
they see the volcano as both a blessing and a curse .
located inside the virunga national park north of goma and lake kivu , and just west of the border with rwanda , its fertile land has made it one of the most densely populated regions on the entire continent . it also boasts virgin forests that are home to some unique flora and fauna , as well as the world 's last remaining population of mountain gorillas .
alternatives to illegal logging after the 1994 genocide in rwanda , hundreds of thousands of refugees fled over the border to goma .
today , the city is home to many former victims and perpetrators who are seeking refuge here from rwandan justice .
what they have in common is the fact that they are all trying to " put down roots in an ecosystem that is not their native one , " as johannes kirchgatter from the world wide fund for nature , or wwf , in germany puts it . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nyungwe rainforest is home to rare mountain gorillas the flow of refugees has resulted in a major population increase in the region , which has proved to be a heavy burden on existing fuel-provision structures .
the roughly one million people who live here depend mainly on firewood and wood charcoal for cooking and heating .
much of the logging activity in the virunga national park for the sale of timber and charcoal is controlled by rebel militia groups , which earn an estimated $ 30 million a year .
in order to put a stop to this illegal exploitation of resources by the charcoal mafia , the public needs alternatives that are affordable and sustainable .
outside the protected areas of the national park , the wwf is therefore overseeing a project to establish , maintain and exploit legal plantations for the production of fuel wood .
it also subsidizes the manufacture of energy-efficient ovens that consume 30 percent less fuel than previous ovens used hitherto .
the organization also trains rangers who work to clamp down on illegal loggers .
the project is already proving constructive , and helping to financially weaken the militias by providing the public with an alternative source for their fuel needs .
an important wilderness bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in drc , militias fund their activities with illegal wood trade the funds are partially provided from the international climate initiative , and kirchgatter hopes they can be put to good use across the entire congo basin .
its tropical forests are a haven for elephants , gorillas and other rare wildlife .
according to the wwf , the congo basin home to one-quarter of the world 's tropical forests and a mosaic of ecosystems – rivers , forests , savanna , swamps and flooded forests – which are teeming with life .
these forests regulate local climate and the flow of water , protect and enrich soils , control diseases and safeguard water quality .
reaching all the way to the atlantic coast , they also make up one of the most important wilderness areas left on the planet .
the wwf is planning to join forces with nasa next year to establish the exact size of its surface area using an optical remote sensing technology known as lidar , which can detect subtle topographic features such as river terraces and river channel banks , and measure the land surface elevation beneath the vegetation canopy .
the technology will allow researchers to establish forest density and even the precise amount of chlorophyll contained in different tree species .
with data provided by lidar , researchers will also be able to divide the congo basin into zones , isolating which areas are made up of primary forest and are therefore most in need of protection , and which areas could best be exploited by local populations .
the ultimate goal is to identify 15 percent of the congo basin as a protected area and thereby help preserve the habitats of species such as forest elephants , bonobo apes and various types of rare flora .
another project , run by the world resources institute , is putting the systems in place to implement effective strategies to reduce emissions from deforestation and forest degradation -lrb- known as redd . -rrb-
it is spearheading an innovative new project aimed at quantifying degradation and the greenhouse gas emissions in the forests of the republic of congo , and developing new methods to measure and monitor forest degradation .
the region will also be able to earn carbon credits by engaging in green carbon sequestering activities .
ideally , redd could deliver millions of dollars to impoverished communities in the congo basin in carbon credits , providing a powerful incentive to protect this land of great value to the planet .
but given that drc is one of the most corrupt nations in the world , negotiations are far from straightforward .
prioritizing needs of people and nature bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : preserving natural habitats in the congo basin is of global benefit nonetheless , johannes kirchgatter can already point to some successes , such as wwf programs in the lac tumba region in the western congo basin , some 1500 kilometers away from the virunga national park .
the region harbors a rich assemblage of terrestrial and aquatic biodiversity , and is an important provider of vital ecosystem services , including carbon sequestration , freshwater supplies , flood mitigation , and non-timber products for both subsistence and commercial use .
in wwf projects , locals are taught about land use planning ; protected area management and species conservation ; community-based natural resource management ; and livelihood improvement . the wwf hopes that 14,000 square kilometers of local forest can be preserved as a protected area and a further 65,000 square kilometers farmed sustainably .
given that the population is set to double in the next two decades , such measures are crucial .
but these valuable ecosystems will only survive if environmental priorities can be reconciled with the needs of local populations .

he wants to close them through the introduction of coordinated , pan-european measures . german interior minister thomas de maiziere has called for security precautions on air cargo jets to be stepped up . the best way to do this , he says , is through closer cooperation between security agencies .
" air freight has been relatively under-monitored up to now , " de maiziere told reporters .
" evidently they recognized that and exploited it .
this means changes for the air freight business . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : package bombs got through security at cologne-bonn airport de maiziere plans to discuss the issue at a meeting of european interior ministers later this week .
his goal is to introduce coordinated security procedures on a european level .
de maiziere 's statement followed the discovery over the weekend that a package containing explosives had passed through cologne-bonn airport undetected before being found in england .
the package had been dispatched from yemen and was bound for the united states .
observers say those who planted the explosives likely exploited lax security in the country from where the aircraft began its journey .
" there are some countries in which there are security gaps , " elmar giemulla , who teaches the air transport law at the technical university of berlin , told the german press agency in an interview .
" there are rules , but whether they are properly observed is another matter , " he said .
stricter checks the international civil aviation organization -lrb- icao -rrb- sets standards for its 190 member nations .
when freight is sent from europe , or from the united states , it is either inspected or it has to be packed by a so-called ' known consignor , ' which is regulated by the state .
but elsewhere measures are n't so strictly observed .
" we need to check the reliability and control measures of third states , " de maiziere said on a visit to cologne-bonn airport on monday .
in response to the discovery of the explosives , berlin has stopped all freight and passenger flights from yemen from entering german airspace .
yemen has criticized germany 's decision to ban flights from its airports , saying it needs help to fight terrorism , not punishment .

the rules would force national nuclear authorities to draw up disposal plans to be vetted by the eu . europe 's energy chief said that the eu needed binding rules for the long-term storage of nuclear waste in europe , namely in deep underground bunkers that would be safe from accidents or sabotage .
" we have to make sure that we have the highest safety standards in the world to protect our citizens , " guenther oettinger said on wednesday in brussels .
" safety is indivisible .
if an accident happens in one country , it can have devastating effects also in others . " oettinger said the current situation within the eu , where most nuclear waste is stored in bunkers or warehouses until it cools down , is no longer acceptable .
the eu 's energy body says " deep geological repositories , " or caverns at depths of between 100 and 700 meters underground , are the best places to permanently store spent fuel rods , which can remain dangerous to humans for up to a million years .
the 50,000 cubic meters of waste generated by the eu annually is currently held in temporary above-ground facilities , although lower-grade nuclear waste , which includes such things as equipment from de-commissioned reactors , is permitted below ground .
oettinger is keen to change this because of surface storage facilities ' vulnerability to environmental damage and terrorist attacks . " the vast majority of experts agree that you need to have deep storage , in other words at least 300 meters below the earth 's surface , " he said .
the eu 's executive wants each of its member states to come up with a national plan for long-term storage within four years of new eu legislation .
those plans would then be vetted by oettinger 's team .
not so black and white bildunterschrift : where europe currently stores its waste but not everyone trusts the burial technique , which has never been put to the test due to the vast timeframes involved .
munich environmental institute board member christina hacker told deutsche welle that the problem is in the use of the word " safe " .
" who knows what is going to be safe for a million years ? " she asked .
" we have never had a depot like this before so it is impossible to guarantee its safety . "
proponents of the idea counter that rock provides a better natural barrier than any man-made constructions and that it is the best possible solution to a complex problem .
they say thirty years of research has established which geological structures are best for the job , and point to structures of clay in germany and granite in sweden .
but nuclear waste expert , stefan alt from the environmental research centre oeko-institut says there are some critical questions that need to be answered before any legislation can be signed off .
" storing waste deep under the ground is the most responsible way to go , " he told deutsche welle .
" but we still have to decide whether we will want access to it in the future or whether we want to seal it away forever . "
a bad precedent bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : burying nuclear waste has proved problematic in germany alt says the difficulties in predicting environmental changes over the next centuries and millennia make it impossible to foresee things like the condition of the containers five hundred years down the line .
furthermore , in light of revelations earlier this year that containers at the asse nuclear storage facility in germany had been damaged as a result of structural instability , he believes it could be wise to make waste accessible .
it 's an argument supported by local anti-nuclear campaigners .
udo dettmann , part of the asse ii community organization , told deutsche welle it would be a critical mistake to bury radioactive waste irreversibly .
" it if would stay deep under the ground that would be fine , but there is no proof that this will be the case over a period of one million years , " he said .
" the only way we have to correct mis-developments is to ensure access to the storage . "
he also said that there had been " insufficient " research into such sites , and that it would be irresponsible for the german government or the european commission to decide upon deep geological repositories without having thoroughly explored other options . politics versus security bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oettinger says current european rules for storing waste are unacceptable for the time being , though that the eu 's executive appears determined to find a long term , subterranean solution to the problem of dealing with nuclear waste .
in a recent article in a regional german newspaper , the badisches tagblatt , oettinger said he could foresee clusters of eu countries agreeing upon a collective waste-storage site .
he did not suggest which of the eu 's 27 member-states might prove suitable for such a facility , but stressed that he would not " tolerate the export of nuclear waste outside the european union . "
and while the idea of one country housing another country 's – or indeed several other countries ' – nuclear waste could itself prove politically tricky , stefan alt says that from a scientific point of view , it makes sense to find the best geological location possible .
" on this issue , security is more important than national boundaries , " he said .
" the alternative would mean that every country tried to locate sites which do n't even exist . "

but with this unique ecosystem threatened by political unrest in the region , a series of projects aims to ensure they stay that way . the landscape around gisenyi in western rwanda , on the border to the democratic republic of the congo , is breathtakingly beautiful .
mount nyiragongo towers majestically over the city , which is contiguous with the city of goma across the border in drc .
but mount nyiragongo is an active volcano , known for its devastating eruptions .
eight years ago , goma was largely destroyed by lava .
time and again , locals here have rebuilt their devastated city in the aftermath of such eruptions , despite risks posed by the still-hot lava and the frequent earth tremors that occur in the wake of the eruption .
they see the volcano as both a blessing and a curse .
located inside the virunga national park north of goma and lake kivu , and just west of the border with rwanda , its fertile land has made it one of the most densely populated regions on the entire continent . it also boasts virgin forests that are home to some unique flora and fauna , as well as the world 's last remaining population of mountain gorillas .
alternatives to illegal logging after the 1994 genocide in rwanda , hundreds of thousands of refugees fled over the border to goma .
today , the city is home to many former victims and perpetrators who are seeking refuge here from rwandan justice .
what they have in common is the fact that they are all trying to " put down roots in an ecosystem that is not their native one , " as johannes kirchgatter from the world wide fund for nature , or wwf , in germany puts it . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nyungwe rainforest is home to rare mountain gorillas the flow of refugees has resulted in a major population increase in the region , which has proved to be a heavy burden on existing fuel-provision structures .
the roughly one million people who live here depend mainly on firewood and wood charcoal for cooking and heating .
much of the logging activity in the virunga national park for the sale of timber and charcoal is controlled by rebel militia groups , which earn an estimated $ 30 million a year .
in order to put a stop to this illegal exploitation of resources by the charcoal mafia , the public needs alternatives that are affordable and sustainable .
outside the protected areas of the national park , the wwf is therefore overseeing a project to establish , maintain and exploit legal plantations for the production of fuel wood .
it also subsidizes the manufacture of energy-efficient ovens that consume 30 percent less fuel than previous ovens used hitherto .
the organization also trains rangers who work to clamp down on illegal loggers .
the project is already proving constructive , and helping to financially weaken the militias by providing the public with an alternative source for their fuel needs .
an important wilderness bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in drc , militias fund their activities with illegal wood trade the funds are partially provided from the international climate initiative , and kirchgatter hopes they can be put to good use across the entire congo basin .
its tropical forests are a haven for elephants , gorillas and other rare wildlife .
according to the wwf , the congo basin home to one-quarter of the world 's tropical forests and a mosaic of ecosystems – rivers , forests , savanna , swamps and flooded forests – which are teeming with life .
these forests regulate local climate and the flow of water , protect and enrich soils , control diseases and safeguard water quality .
reaching all the way to the atlantic coast , they also make up one of the most important wilderness areas left on the planet .
the wwf is planning to join forces with nasa next year to establish the exact size of its surface area using an optical remote sensing technology known as lidar , which can detect subtle topographic features such as river terraces and river channel banks , and measure the land surface elevation beneath the vegetation canopy .
the technology will allow researchers to establish forest density and even the precise amount of chlorophyll contained in different tree species .
with data provided by lidar , researchers will also be able to divide the congo basin into zones , isolating which areas are made up of primary forest and are therefore most in need of protection , and which areas could best be exploited by local populations .
the ultimate goal is to identify 15 percent of the congo basin as a protected area and thereby help preserve the habitats of species such as forest elephants , bonobo apes and various types of rare flora .
another project , run by the world resources institute , is putting the systems in place to implement effective strategies to reduce emissions from deforestation and forest degradation -lrb- known as redd . -rrb-
it is spearheading an innovative new project aimed at quantifying degradation and the greenhouse gas emissions in the forests of the republic of congo , and developing new methods to measure and monitor forest degradation .
the region will also be able to earn carbon credits by engaging in green carbon sequestering activities .
ideally , redd could deliver millions of dollars to impoverished communities in the congo basin in carbon credits , providing a powerful incentive to protect this land of great value to the planet .
but given that drc is one of the most corrupt nations in the world , negotiations are far from straightforward .

but with this unique ecosystem threatened by political unrest in the region , a series of projects aims to ensure they stay that way . the landscape around gisenyi in western rwanda , on the border to the democratic republic of the congo , is breathtakingly beautiful .
mount nyiragongo towers majestically over the city , which is contiguous with the city of goma across the border in drc .
but mount nyiragongo is an active volcano , known for its devastating eruptions .
eight years ago , goma was largely destroyed by lava .
time and again , locals here have rebuilt their devastated city in the aftermath of such eruptions , despite risks posed by the still-hot lava and the frequent earth tremors that occur in the wake of the eruption .
they see the volcano as both a blessing and a curse .
located inside the virunga national park north of goma and lake kivu , and just west of the border with rwanda , its fertile land has made it one of the most densely populated regions on the entire continent . it also boasts virgin forests that are home to some unique flora and fauna , as well as the world 's last remaining population of mountain gorillas .
alternatives to illegal logging after the 1994 genocide in rwanda , hundreds of thousands of refugees fled over the border to goma .
today , the city is home to many former victims and perpetrators who are seeking refuge here from rwandan justice .
what they have in common is the fact that they are all trying to " put down roots in an ecosystem that is not their native one , " as johannes kirchgatter from the world wide fund for nature , or wwf , in germany puts it . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nyungwe rainforest is home to rare mountain gorillas the flow of refugees has resulted in a major population increase in the region , which has proved to be a heavy burden on existing fuel-provision structures .
the roughly one million people who live here depend mainly on firewood and wood charcoal for cooking and heating .
much of the logging activity in the virunga national park for the sale of timber and charcoal is controlled by rebel militia groups , which earn an estimated $ 30 million a year .
in order to put a stop to this illegal exploitation of resources by the charcoal mafia , the public needs alternatives that are affordable and sustainable .
outside the protected areas of the national park , the wwf is therefore overseeing a project to establish , maintain and exploit legal plantations for the production of fuel wood .
it also subsidizes the manufacture of energy-efficient ovens that consume 30 percent less fuel than previous ovens used hitherto .
the organization also trains rangers who work to clamp down on illegal loggers .
the project is already proving constructive , and helping to financially weaken the militias by providing the public with an alternative source for their fuel needs .
an important wilderness bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in drc , militias fund their activities with illegal wood trade the funds are partially provided from the international climate initiative , and kirchgatter hopes they can be put to good use across the entire congo basin .
its tropical forests are a haven for elephants , gorillas and other rare wildlife .
according to the wwf , the congo basin home to one-quarter of the world 's tropical forests and a mosaic of ecosystems – rivers , forests , savanna , swamps and flooded forests – which are teeming with life .
these forests regulate local climate and the flow of water , protect and enrich soils , control diseases and safeguard water quality .
reaching all the way to the atlantic coast , they also make up one of the most important wilderness areas left on the planet .
the wwf is planning to join forces with nasa next year to establish the exact size of its surface area using an optical remote sensing technology known as lidar , which can detect subtle topographic features such as river terraces and river channel banks , and measure the land surface elevation beneath the vegetation canopy .
the technology will allow researchers to establish forest density and even the precise amount of chlorophyll contained in different tree species .
with data provided by lidar , researchers will also be able to divide the congo basin into zones , isolating which areas are made up of primary forest and are therefore most in need of protection , and which areas could best be exploited by local populations .
the ultimate goal is to identify 15 percent of the congo basin as a protected area and thereby help preserve the habitats of species such as forest elephants , bonobo apes and various types of rare flora .
another project , run by the world resources institute , is putting the systems in place to implement effective strategies to reduce emissions from deforestation and forest degradation -lrb- known as redd . -rrb-
it is spearheading an innovative new project aimed at quantifying degradation and the greenhouse gas emissions in the forests of the republic of congo , and developing new methods to measure and monitor forest degradation .
the region will also be able to earn carbon credits by engaging in green carbon sequestering activities .
ideally , redd could deliver millions of dollars to impoverished communities in the congo basin in carbon credits , providing a powerful incentive to protect this land of great value to the planet .
but given that drc is one of the most corrupt nations in the world , negotiations are far from straightforward .
prioritizing needs of people and nature bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : preserving natural habitats in the congo basin is of global benefit nonetheless , johannes kirchgatter can already point to some successes , such as wwf programs in the lac tumba region in the western congo basin , some 1500 kilometers away from the virunga national park .

the rules would force national nuclear authorities to draw up disposal plans to be vetted by the eu . europe 's energy chief said that the eu needed binding rules for the long-term storage of nuclear waste in europe , namely in deep underground bunkers that would be safe from accidents or sabotage .
" we have to make sure that we have the highest safety standards in the world to protect our citizens , " guenther oettinger said on wednesday in brussels .
" safety is indivisible .
if an accident happens in one country , it can have devastating effects also in others . " oettinger said the current situation within the eu , where most nuclear waste is stored in bunkers or warehouses until it cools down , is no longer acceptable .
the eu 's energy body says " deep geological repositories , " or caverns at depths of between 100 and 700 meters underground , are the best places to permanently store spent fuel rods , which can remain dangerous to humans for up to a million years .
the 50,000 cubic meters of waste generated by the eu annually is currently held in temporary above-ground facilities , although lower-grade nuclear waste , which includes such things as equipment from de-commissioned reactors , is permitted below ground .
oettinger is keen to change this because of surface storage facilities ' vulnerability to environmental damage and terrorist attacks . " the vast majority of experts agree that you need to have deep storage , in other words at least 300 meters below the earth 's surface , " he said .
the eu 's executive wants each of its member states to come up with a national plan for long-term storage within four years of new eu legislation .
those plans would then be vetted by oettinger 's team .
not so black and white bildunterschrift : where europe currently stores its waste but not everyone trusts the burial technique , which has never been put to the test due to the vast timeframes involved .
munich environmental institute board member christina hacker told deutsche welle that the problem is in the use of the word " safe " .
" who knows what is going to be safe for a million years ? " she asked .
" we have never had a depot like this before so it is impossible to guarantee its safety . "
proponents of the idea counter that rock provides a better natural barrier than any man-made constructions and that it is the best possible solution to a complex problem .
they say thirty years of research has established which geological structures are best for the job , and point to structures of clay in germany and granite in sweden .
but nuclear waste expert , stefan alt from the environmental research centre oeko-institut says there are some critical questions that need to be answered before any legislation can be signed off .
" storing waste deep under the ground is the most responsible way to go , " he told deutsche welle .
" but we still have to decide whether we will want access to it in the future or whether we want to seal it away forever . "
a bad precedent bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : burying nuclear waste has proved problematic in germany alt says the difficulties in predicting environmental changes over the next centuries and millennia make it impossible to foresee things like the condition of the containers five hundred years down the line .
furthermore , in light of revelations earlier this year that containers at the asse nuclear storage facility in germany had been damaged as a result of structural instability , he believes it could be wise to make waste accessible .
it 's an argument supported by local anti-nuclear campaigners .
udo dettmann , part of the asse ii community organization , told deutsche welle it would be a critical mistake to bury radioactive waste irreversibly .
" it if would stay deep under the ground that would be fine , but there is no proof that this will be the case over a period of one million years , " he said .
" the only way we have to correct mis-developments is to ensure access to the storage . "
he also said that there had been " insufficient " research into such sites , and that it would be irresponsible for the german government or the european commission to decide upon deep geological repositories without having thoroughly explored other options . politics versus security bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oettinger says current european rules for storing waste are unacceptable for the time being , though that the eu 's executive appears determined to find a long term , subterranean solution to the problem of dealing with nuclear waste .
in a recent article in a regional german newspaper , the badisches tagblatt , oettinger said he could foresee clusters of eu countries agreeing upon a collective waste-storage site .
he did not suggest which of the eu 's 27 member-states might prove suitable for such a facility , but stressed that he would not " tolerate the export of nuclear waste outside the european union . "
and while the idea of one country housing another country 's – or indeed several other countries ' – nuclear waste could itself prove politically tricky , stefan alt says that from a scientific point of view , it makes sense to find the best geological location possible .
" on this issue , security is more important than national boundaries , " he said .
" the alternative would mean that every country tried to locate sites which do n't even exist . "

the photos include streets in the southern german town of oberstaufen , public spaces and soccer stadiums around the country . early on tuesday morning , google unveiled its first street view photographs in germany , honoring the bavarian town of oberstaufen to include " selected streets " where the company had sent its vehicles .
oberstaufen had previously explicitly invited google to their town , and even went so far as to bake the silicon valley company a cake , citing the potential for a boost in tourism .
earlier this year , the company announced it would launch street view in germany 's 20 largest cities , including berlin , hamburg and cologne , by the end of the year .
other specific locations around germany that are also available include a public square surrounded by historical buildings in dresden called the theaterplatz and a number of football stadiums , including munich 's allianz arena .
google said that there had been no reaction from government officials to the launch , despite all the controversy generated by the company 's plans for the last 18 months .
" we have n't heard anything from politicians or -lsb- data protection authorities -rsb- , " said lena wagner , a google germany spokesperson , in an interview with deutsche welle .
after government authorities complained , including consumer affairs minister ilse aigner and foreign affairs minister guido westerwelle , google eventually acquiesced to public pressure , providing an eight-week window , which ended last month , for german citizens to remove themselves from the service .
after the deadline , the california company announced that around 244,000 people had chosen to opt-out of the service , or under three percent of the total number of residents of the 20 selected cities .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bavarian town had previously baked a cake for google some houses are blurred as google promised , the removed houses show up as a blurry , translucent image , such as the house next to the buecher edele bookstore at hugo-von-koenigsegg strasse 13 in oberstaufen .
in an interview last month with deutsche welle , wagner noted that despite their complaints , germans actually like using street view in other countries where it already exists , saying that hundreds of thousands of germans use it every week .
" we also know that germany is the number one country in terms of street view in all countries where we have n't launched street view yet , " she said .
despite the launch of google street view , germany is continuing to investigate possible privacy violations as google admitted that it had captured some " payload data " while scanning open wifi networks during the course of taking photographs for street view .
in late october , the company admitted that it had captured some e-mails and passwords .
those revelations failed to surprise johannes caspar , hamburg 's commissioner for data protection and freedom of information , who is a leading authority in the german google investigation .
" this just confirms what we expected , " he told deutsche welle at the time , adding that the company could yet face fines .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de nuclear -pipe- 02.11.2010 europe plans binding rules for nuclear waste großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe wants to coordinate a long-term strategy for nuclear waste eu energy commissioner guenther oettinger presented proposals for the safe storage of nuclear waste on wednesday .
the rules would force national nuclear authorities to draw up disposal plans to be vetted by the eu . europe 's energy chief said that the eu needed binding rules for the long-term storage of nuclear waste in europe , namely in deep underground bunkers that would be safe from accidents or sabotage .
" we have to make sure that we have the highest safety standards in the world to protect our citizens , " guenther oettinger said on wednesday in brussels .
" safety is indivisible .
if an accident happens in one country , it can have devastating effects also in others . " oettinger said the current situation within the eu , where most nuclear waste is stored in bunkers or warehouses until it cools down , is no longer acceptable .
the eu 's energy body says " deep geological repositories , " or caverns at depths of between 100 and 700 meters underground , are the best places to permanently store spent fuel rods , which can remain dangerous to humans for up to a million years .
the 50,000 cubic meters of waste generated by the eu annually is currently held in temporary above-ground facilities , although lower-grade nuclear waste , which includes such things as equipment from de-commissioned reactors , is permitted below ground .
oettinger is keen to change this because of surface storage facilities ' vulnerability to environmental damage and terrorist attacks . " the vast majority of experts agree that you need to have deep storage , in other words at least 300 meters below the earth 's surface , " he said .
the eu 's executive wants each of its member states to come up with a national plan for long-term storage within four years of new eu legislation .
those plans would then be vetted by oettinger 's team .
not so black and white bildunterschrift : where europe currently stores its waste but not everyone trusts the burial technique , which has never been put to the test due to the vast timeframes involved .
munich environmental institute board member christina hacker told deutsche welle that the problem is in the use of the word " safe " .
" who knows what is going to be safe for a million years ? " she asked .
" we have never had a depot like this before so it is impossible to guarantee its safety . "
proponents of the idea counter that rock provides a better natural barrier than any man-made constructions and that it is the best possible solution to a complex problem .
they say thirty years of research has established which geological structures are best for the job , and point to structures of clay in germany and granite in sweden .
but nuclear waste expert , stefan alt from the environmental research centre oeko-institut says there are some critical questions that need to be answered before any legislation can be signed off .
" storing waste deep under the ground is the most responsible way to go , " he told deutsche welle .
" but we still have to decide whether we will want access to it in the future or whether we want to seal it away forever . "
a bad precedent bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : burying nuclear waste has proved problematic in germany alt says the difficulties in predicting environmental changes over the next centuries and millennia make it impossible to foresee things like the condition of the containers five hundred years down the line .
furthermore , in light of revelations earlier this year that containers at the asse nuclear storage facility in germany had been damaged as a result of structural instability , he believes it could be wise to make waste accessible .
it 's an argument supported by local anti-nuclear campaigners .
udo dettmann , part of the asse ii community organization , told deutsche welle it would be a critical mistake to bury radioactive waste irreversibly .
" it if would stay deep under the ground that would be fine , but there is no proof that this will be the case over a period of one million years , " he said .
" the only way we have to correct mis-developments is to ensure access to the storage . "
he also said that there had been " insufficient " research into such sites , and that it would be irresponsible for the german government or the european commission to decide upon deep geological repositories without having thoroughly explored other options . politics versus security bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oettinger says current european rules for storing waste are unacceptable for the time being , though that the eu 's executive appears determined to find a long term , subterranean solution to the problem of dealing with nuclear waste .
in a recent article in a regional german newspaper , the badisches tagblatt , oettinger said he could foresee clusters of eu countries agreeing upon a collective waste-storage site .
he did not suggest which of the eu 's 27 member-states might prove suitable for such a facility , but stressed that he would not " tolerate the export of nuclear waste outside the european union . "
and while the idea of one country housing another country 's – or indeed several other countries ' – nuclear waste could itself prove politically tricky , stefan alt says that from a scientific point of view , it makes sense to find the best geological location possible .
" on this issue , security is more important than national boundaries , " he said .
" the alternative would mean that every country tried to locate sites which do n't even exist . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de terrorism -pipe- 02.11.2010 europe not the primary target for yemen-based terrorists , say experts großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us remains the main target for terrorists in yemen the recent discovery of two printer cartridges loaded with explosives aboard two us-bound cargo flights has once again turned the world 's attention to the potential international terror threat emanating from yemen . the bombs , which were traced to the impoverished country on the arabian peninsula after being found at airports in britain and dubai , were described by us security experts as showing a higher degree of professionalism and sophistication than any devices previously linked to yemen 's al-qaeda wing - al-qaeda in the arabian peninsula -lrb- aqap -rrb- .
experts who investigated the failed bombing of a us-bound plane in december 2009 , an attempted attack later claimed by aqap , said that if the toner bombs had been constructed by yemeni al-qaeda operatives then the group had achieved a level of expertise previously unseen .
" if al-qaeda indeed made them , " former cia agent robert baer told the washington times , " then they 've teamed up with true professionals . "
the sophistication of the bombs helped them to pass undetected through explosives scanners at hubs such as britain 's east midlands airport and cologne-bonn , a fact that prompted the german government - along with britain , france , canada and the united states - to ban airfreight from yemen and extend the restrictions to include passenger flights originating there .
terrorism experts initially suggested that the cargo planes were targeted for explosion over densely populated cities but when it was revealed that the bombs made the first part of the journey on commercial tourism flights , some experts were then forced to revise their theories to include a potential strike against airborne passengers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sophistication of the bombs have surprised experts despite foiling the bomb plots before any lives were lost , us intelligence agencies are concerned that yemen-based terrorist groups are becoming increasingly advanced in their planning .
they are quickly learning not to underestimate the threat coming out of yemen 's impoverished , tribal landscape and are reviewing their risk assessment of the group 's potential international reach .
given the sophistication of the devices , their route through germany and the discovery of one of the bombs at britain 's east midlands airport , the nightmare scenario of aqap extending its reach to europe has put the continent 's anti-terror authorities on alert .
however , jeremy binnie , terrorism and insurgency editor at jane 's defense , believes that aqap has had the opportunity to attack european targets but has so far maintained its focus on the united states .
aqap had opportunity to hit europe but did n't , say experts " the data points we have suggest that the us remains aqap 's primary target , " binnie told deutsche welle .
" they could have blown up the toner bombs anywhere over europe but chose not to which suggests their final destination would have been the united states with detonation taking place over a densely-populated area to maximise casualties .
as with the christmas day attempt last year , the bomb travelled through europe destined for chicago but again , the bomb was not detonated in europe suggesting the target was clearly the us . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aqap boss nasser al-wahaishi leads the yemen franchise " aqap are very ambitious , " he added .
" they want to hit the ' head of the snake ' as osama bin laden calls the us , not washington 's partners .
attacking the us is al-qaeda 's primary objective as it creates the maximum amount of coverage , increases international pressure on governments like yemen 's to confront islamist militants and in turn destabilizes these countries , making them even more vulnerable to al-qaeda 's influence . "
henry wilkinson , the associate director of janusian security risk management , agreed that the us was more likely to be a target for aqap but that europe 's association with the us also put it at a certain amount of risk .
" i do n't think europe is any higher a priority target than the united states , " he told deutsche welle .
" aqap has made threats against all the western powers it argues are causing harm to muslims - by gift of military deployments in afghanistan or iraq , support for israel , or perceived offences against islam such as banning the veil .
i suspect the united states is the most sought after target , but europe seems to be the focus of more plots - i suspect because it is a softer target by gift of border security and a greater preponderance of local sympathisers . "
european nations equally at risk should aqap switch focus when asked if the discovery of a toner bomb in britain or the fact that it passed through germany on its route suggested either country was under specific threat , wilkinson disagreed .
" i do n't think there is any merit in suggesting any one country is at particular risk , " he said .
" aqap has threatened many countries and may have been involved in the kidnap and murder of several german nationals in northern yemen in 2009 .
in this respect , i think germany as a leading european country is as much at risk as france , the uk , or any other prominent european nation . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bombs could have gone off in cologne or britain - but did n't " if aqap or any other groups were intent on mounting an attack in europe , they would take into account operational viability and target opportunity , as well as political significance of attacking the country . "
while the high-profile cases coming out of yemen have certainly turned the world 's attention toward its situation , most experts consider other countries as regions more deserving of concern in relation to european security .
" we have not seen much evidence that aqap has the capability to mount long-lead , multi-cell operations in europe , and its record of attempting such operations have mostly focused on saudi arabia , " wilkinson said .
" while i think this latest incident has focussed minds on the threat from yemen , the hierarchy of threat concerns for most european governments very likely remains , in order , afghanistan-pakistan , somalia and then yemen . "

the photos include streets in the southern german town of oberstaufen , public spaces and soccer stadiums around the country . early on tuesday morning , google unveiled its first street view photographs in germany , honoring the bavarian town of oberstaufen to include " selected streets " where the company had sent its vehicles .
oberstaufen had previously explicitly invited google to their town , and even went so far as to bake the silicon valley company a cake , citing the potential for a boost in tourism .
earlier this year , the company announced it would launch street view in germany 's 20 largest cities , including berlin , hamburg and cologne , by the end of the year .
other specific locations around germany that are also available include a public square surrounded by historical buildings in dresden called the theaterplatz and a number of football stadiums , including munich 's allianz arena .
google said that there had been no reaction from government officials to the launch , despite all the controversy generated by the company 's plans for the last 18 months .
" we have n't heard anything from politicians or -lsb- data protection authorities -rsb- , " said lena wagner , a google germany spokesperson , in an interview with deutsche welle .
after government authorities complained , including consumer affairs minister ilse aigner and foreign affairs minister guido westerwelle , google eventually acquiesced to public pressure , providing an eight-week window , which ended last month , for german citizens to remove themselves from the service .
after the deadline , the california company announced that around 244,000 people had chosen to opt-out of the service , or under three percent of the total number of residents of the 20 selected cities .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bavarian town had previously baked a cake for google some houses are blurred as google promised , the removed houses show up as a blurry , translucent image , such as the house next to the buecher edele bookstore at hugo-von-koenigsegg strasse 13 in oberstaufen .
in an interview last month with deutsche welle , wagner noted that despite their complaints , germans actually like using street view in other countries where it already exists , saying that hundreds of thousands of germans use it every week .
" we also know that germany is the number one country in terms of street view in all countries where we have n't launched street view yet , " she said .
despite the launch of google street view , germany is continuing to investigate possible privacy violations as google admitted that it had captured some " payload data " while scanning open wifi networks during the course of taking photographs for street view .
in late october , the company admitted that it had captured some e-mails and passwords .
those revelations failed to surprise johannes caspar , hamburg 's commissioner for data protection and freedom of information , who is a leading authority in the german google investigation .
" this just confirms what we expected , " he told deutsche welle at the time , adding that the company could yet face fines .

deutsche welle has compiled a list of this month 's highlights . international highrise prize 2010 height is a status symbol , especially when it comes to skyscrapers .
company heads like to reserve the top floor for their offices and the most influential firms rise above the cityscape .
for years now , cities have competed for bragging rights when it comes to housing the world 's tallest building .
dubai recently topped its competitors with the burj khalifa tower at 828 meters -lrb- 2,717 feet -rrb- .
but height is n't everything it seems ; at least not for the international highrise award .
each year , frankfurt 's architecture museum honors a building with the prestigious award that includes 50,000 euros -lrb- $ 69,000 -rrb- for the edifice 's owner and a statue for its architect .
in selecting a winner , the jury considers the building technique , aesthetics , the structure 's connection with its surroundings and cost efficiency .
this year 's winning construction will be announced on november 5 .
the finalists include the aqua tower in chicago -lrb- usa -rrb- , the shanghai world finance center -lrb- china -rrb- and the burj khalifa tower in dubai .
the latter houses practically an entire city , including a hotel , various apartments and luxury residences , office space and an open air observatory - the world 's highest , needless to mention . bildunterschrift : skyscrapers in chicago , dubai and shanghai are finalists for the 2010 international highrise award momentous date in german history november 9 is bound up with events both wonderful and terrible from modern german history .
for one , the date marks the fall of the berlin wall in 1989 .
a space commemorating the events of november 9 , 1989 will be presented to the public this year along a section of the wall that still stands .
but looking back several decades before that turning point , november 9 was also the date of an infamous episode during the nazi era : the kristallnacht or night of broken glass .
in the night from november 8-9,1938 , nazis burned jewish institutions throughout the country .
synagogues were destroyed , while jewish citizens were murdered or sent to concentration camps .
now , the jewish community in germany marks this dark chapter in the country 's history each year with events like tours through synagogues or a silent march through the city , planned this year by school children in berlin . the " fantastic four " hit the road they brought hip hop to germany and their fans still love them for it : the band " die fantastischen vier " -lrb- " the fantastic four " -rrb- .
their songs have been staples in the german music charts for more than 20 years now .
when they got their start , hip hop was almost exclusively performed in english , but the school friends smudo , and .
ypsilon , michi beck and thomas d wanted to rap in german - with nonsensical lyrics that nevertheless raised some weighty themes .
after a creative break , the band is going back on tour starting november 9 with a total of 16 concerts in germany , austria and switzerland .
and their fans are ready and waiting - not just for the songs on their new album -lrb- titled " fuer dich immer noch fanta sie " in german -rrb- but also for the group 's new stage concept .
the band will perform on a round stage in each arena , surrounded on all sides by concert-goers . bildunterschrift : still fantastic after 20 years : die fantastischen vier carnival begins spring , summer , fall and winter - those are the four official seasons in germany .
but in some parts of the country , there 's at least one more .
in the rhineland in western germany , the carnival season begins on november 11 -lrb- that is , 11/11 -rrb- at 11:11 a.m.
there are any number of theories about why the number 11 plays such a big role in the festivities but the rhineland revelers do n't worry too much about them .
the main thing is to party , drink , dance and be crazy .
after the one-day opening festival , the party mostly vanishes from public view until the new year begins .
after all , the storefronts and city squares are bedecked with holiday decorations and attractions until then .
but once january hits , the carnival clowns and streamers will be out in full force .
behind the scenes , carnival associations prepare all year round for the event and some loyal fans who have left behind the chill of a german november even listen to carnival music on the beach . bildunterschrift : 11:11 on 11/11 can only mean one thing : the start of carnival in the rhineland in memory of a great musician during mid-month in berlin , though , things will be a bit more civilized as musicians from across the world meet to take part in the " grand prix emanuel feuermann " cello contest .
the event is named after a renowned 20th-century cellist who taught at the academy of music arts in berlin before being forced out of his position in 1933 for being jewish .
he died in 1942 in new york .
the first contest was organized in 2002 by berlin 's university of the arts and is held every four years to honor feuermann .
during the first session of the contest , feuermann 's youngest sister , then in her mid 90s , was a guest , despite having planned never to return to germany again after fleeing during the nazi period .
this year 's participants will also travel in from all over the world , including competitors from china , russia , canada , korea , france , england , germany and the czech republic .
the winner receives not just a prize of 15,000 euros but also support for a cd production and concert appearances and tours . bildunterschrift : young talents from across the world will take the stage at the grand prix emanuel feuermann ruhr 2010 : trash scavengers from istanbul on stage rimini-protokoll are three young men from berlin that present theater works - but not with actors .
instead , they use people they meet on the street - for instance , four trash scavengers from istanbul .
director daniel wetzel met them around a year ago when he was in the turkish capital looking for ideas .
he saw scavengers everywhere in the city : kurdish men and roma from villages in anatolia , who scrounge around for metal , plastic , tin and anything else that 's valuable from morning until night .
after talking to some of them , the result was " herr dagacar und die goldene tektonik des muells " -lrb- " mr. dagacar and the golden tectonics of trash " -rrb- .
the theater piece premiered in istanbul on october 15 and its german premiere will take place on november 26 as part of the ruhr region 's year as a european capital of culture .
the four men on stage talk about their lives , villages , families - and their survival strategies .
the entire show is in turkish and kurdish , but for those who do n't understand the language , there 's a screen above the stage displaying subtitles .
it 's an unusual format but one that 's already meant success for the young theater makers . bildunterschrift : searching for valuable : four scavengers from istanbul take the stage in the ruhr valley christmas market season opens by the end of november , it 's already christmas time in germany .
cookies and chocolate santas have already been in the stores since september .
but the end of the month marks the official opening for many of germany 's christmas markets , including the most famous market in nuremberg on november 26 .
there , guests will be greeted personally by a figure known in german as the christkind : a woman with long blond locks wearing a golden crown .
she hands out treats , accepts wish lists and reads to children.young women in nuremberg between 16 and 19 years old can apply to fill the role each year .
around two million guests visit the market every year and many travel all the way from the us or japan just for the event .
these days , the atmosphere is so international that it 's no surprise to hear the sounds of " silent night " sung in japanese wafting from some of the stands . bildunterschrift : the " christkind " opens the festivities each year at nuremberg 's world-famous christmas market author : petra lambeck , anggatira golmer -lrb- gsw -rrb- editor : neale lytollis send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

experts who investigated the failed bombing of a us-bound plane in december 2009 , an attempted attack later claimed by aqap , said that if the toner bombs had been constructed by yemeni al-qaeda operatives then the group had achieved a level of expertise previously unseen .
" if al-qaeda indeed made them , " former cia agent robert baer told the washington times , " then they 've teamed up with true professionals . "
the sophistication of the bombs helped them to pass undetected through explosives scanners at hubs such as britain 's east midlands airport and cologne-bonn , a fact that prompted the german government - along with britain , france , canada and the united states - to ban airfreight from yemen and extend the restrictions to include passenger flights originating there .
terrorism experts initially suggested that the cargo planes were targeted for explosion over densely populated cities but when it was revealed that the bombs made the first part of the journey on commercial tourism flights , some experts were then forced to revise their theories to include a potential strike against airborne passengers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sophistication of the bombs have surprised experts despite foiling the bomb plots before any lives were lost , us intelligence agencies are concerned that yemen-based terrorist groups are becoming increasingly advanced in their planning .
they are quickly learning not to underestimate the threat coming out of yemen 's impoverished , tribal landscape and are reviewing their risk assessment of the group 's potential international reach .
given the sophistication of the devices , their route through germany and the discovery of one of the bombs at britain 's east midlands airport , the nightmare scenario of aqap extending its reach to europe has put the continent 's anti-terror authorities on alert .
however , jeremy binnie , terrorism and insurgency editor at jane 's defense , believes that aqap has had the opportunity to attack european targets but has so far maintained its focus on the united states .
aqap had opportunity to hit europe but did n't , say experts " the data points we have suggest that the us remains aqap 's primary target , " binnie told deutsche welle .
" they could have blown up the toner bombs anywhere over europe but chose not to which suggests their final destination would have been the united states with detonation taking place over a densely-populated area to maximise casualties .
as with the christmas day attempt last year , the bomb travelled through europe destined for chicago but again , the bomb was not detonated in europe suggesting the target was clearly the us . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aqap boss nasser al-wahaishi leads the yemen franchise " aqap are very ambitious , " he added .
" they want to hit the ' head of the snake ' as osama bin laden calls the us , not washington 's partners .
attacking the us is al-qaeda 's primary objective as it creates the maximum amount of coverage , increases international pressure on governments like yemen 's to confront islamist militants and in turn destabilizes these countries , making them even more vulnerable to al-qaeda 's influence . "
henry wilkinson , the associate director of janusian security risk management , agreed that the us was more likely to be a target for aqap but that europe 's association with the us also put it at a certain amount of risk .
" i do n't think europe is any higher a priority target than the united states , " he told deutsche welle .
" aqap has made threats against all the western powers it argues are causing harm to muslims - by gift of military deployments in afghanistan or iraq , support for israel , or perceived offences against islam such as banning the veil .
i suspect the united states is the most sought after target , but europe seems to be the focus of more plots - i suspect because it is a softer target by gift of border security and a greater preponderance of local sympathisers . "
european nations equally at risk should aqap switch focus when asked if the discovery of a toner bomb in britain or the fact that it passed through germany on its route suggested either country was under specific threat , wilkinson disagreed .
" i do n't think there is any merit in suggesting any one country is at particular risk , " he said .
" aqap has threatened many countries and may have been involved in the kidnap and murder of several german nationals in northern yemen in 2009 .
in this respect , i think germany as a leading european country is as much at risk as france , the uk , or any other prominent european nation . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bombs could have gone off in cologne or britain - but did n't " if aqap or any other groups were intent on mounting an attack in europe , they would take into account operational viability and target opportunity , as well as political significance of attacking the country . "
while the high-profile cases coming out of yemen have certainly turned the world 's attention toward its situation , most experts consider other countries as regions more deserving of concern in relation to european security .
" we have not seen much evidence that aqap has the capability to mount long-lead , multi-cell operations in europe , and its record of attempting such operations have mostly focused on saudi arabia , " wilkinson said .
" while i think this latest incident has focussed minds on the threat from yemen , the hierarchy of threat concerns for most european governments very likely remains , in order , afghanistan-pakistan , somalia and then yemen . "

he wants to close them through the introduction of coordinated , pan-european measures . german interior minister thomas de maiziere has called for security precautions on air cargo jets to be stepped up . the best way to do this , he says , is through closer cooperation between security agencies .
" air freight has been relatively under-monitored up to now , " de maiziere told reporters .
" evidently they recognized that and exploited it .
this means changes for the air freight business . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : package bombs got through security at cologne-bonn airport de maiziere plans to discuss the issue at a meeting of european interior ministers later this week .
his goal is to introduce coordinated security procedures on a european level .
de maiziere 's statement followed the discovery over the weekend that a package containing explosives had passed through cologne-bonn airport undetected before being found in england .
the package had been dispatched from yemen and was bound for the united states .
observers say those who planted the explosives likely exploited lax security in the country from where the aircraft began its journey .
" there are some countries in which there are security gaps , " elmar giemulla , who teaches the air transport law at the technical university of berlin , told the german press agency in an interview .
" there are rules , but whether they are properly observed is another matter , " he said .
stricter checks the international civil aviation organization -lrb- icao -rrb- sets standards for its 190 member nations .
when freight is sent from europe , or from the united states , it is either inspected or it has to be packed by a so-called ' known consignor , ' which is regulated by the state .
but elsewhere measures are n't so strictly observed .
" we need to check the reliability and control measures of third states , " de maiziere said on a visit to cologne-bonn airport on monday .
in response to the discovery of the explosives , berlin has stopped all freight and passenger flights from yemen from entering german airspace .
yemen has criticized germany 's decision to ban flights from its airports , saying it needs help to fight terrorism , not punishment .

deutsche welle has compiled a list of this month 's highlights . international highrise prize 2010 height is a status symbol , especially when it comes to skyscrapers .
company heads like to reserve the top floor for their offices and the most influential firms rise above the cityscape .
for years now , cities have competed for bragging rights when it comes to housing the world 's tallest building .
dubai recently topped its competitors with the burj khalifa tower at 828 meters -lrb- 2,717 feet -rrb- .
but height is n't everything it seems ; at least not for the international highrise award .
each year , frankfurt 's architecture museum honors a building with the prestigious award that includes 50,000 euros -lrb- $ 69,000 -rrb- for the edifice 's owner and a statue for its architect .
in selecting a winner , the jury considers the building technique , aesthetics , the structure 's connection with its surroundings and cost efficiency .
this year 's winning construction will be announced on november 5 .
the finalists include the aqua tower in chicago -lrb- usa -rrb- , the shanghai world finance center -lrb- china -rrb- and the burj khalifa tower in dubai .
the latter houses practically an entire city , including a hotel , various apartments and luxury residences , office space and an open air observatory - the world 's highest , needless to mention . bildunterschrift : skyscrapers in chicago , dubai and shanghai are finalists for the 2010 international highrise award momentous date in german history november 9 is bound up with events both wonderful and terrible from modern german history .
for one , the date marks the fall of the berlin wall in 1989 .
a space commemorating the events of november 9 , 1989 will be presented to the public this year along a section of the wall that still stands .
but looking back several decades before that turning point , november 9 was also the date of an infamous episode during the nazi era : the kristallnacht or night of broken glass .
in the night from november 8-9,1938 , nazis burned jewish institutions throughout the country .
synagogues were destroyed , while jewish citizens were murdered or sent to concentration camps .
now , the jewish community in germany marks this dark chapter in the country 's history each year with events like tours through synagogues or a silent march through the city , planned this year by school children in berlin . the " fantastic four " hit the road they brought hip hop to germany and their fans still love them for it : the band " die fantastischen vier " -lrb- " the fantastic four " -rrb- .
their songs have been staples in the german music charts for more than 20 years now .
when they got their start , hip hop was almost exclusively performed in english , but the school friends smudo , and .
ypsilon , michi beck and thomas d wanted to rap in german - with nonsensical lyrics that nevertheless raised some weighty themes .
after a creative break , the band is going back on tour starting november 9 with a total of 16 concerts in germany , austria and switzerland .
and their fans are ready and waiting - not just for the songs on their new album -lrb- titled " fuer dich immer noch fanta sie " in german -rrb- but also for the group 's new stage concept .
the band will perform on a round stage in each arena , surrounded on all sides by concert-goers . bildunterschrift : still fantastic after 20 years : die fantastischen vier carnival begins spring , summer , fall and winter - those are the four official seasons in germany .
but in some parts of the country , there 's at least one more .
in the rhineland in western germany , the carnival season begins on november 11 -lrb- that is , 11/11 -rrb- at 11:11 a.m.
there are any number of theories about why the number 11 plays such a big role in the festivities but the rhineland revelers do n't worry too much about them .
the main thing is to party , drink , dance and be crazy .
after the one-day opening festival , the party mostly vanishes from public view until the new year begins .
after all , the storefronts and city squares are bedecked with holiday decorations and attractions until then .
but once january hits , the carnival clowns and streamers will be out in full force .
behind the scenes , carnival associations prepare all year round for the event and some loyal fans who have left behind the chill of a german november even listen to carnival music on the beach . bildunterschrift : 11:11 on 11/11 can only mean one thing : the start of carnival in the rhineland in memory of a great musician during mid-month in berlin , though , things will be a bit more civilized as musicians from across the world meet to take part in the " grand prix emanuel feuermann " cello contest .
the event is named after a renowned 20th-century cellist who taught at the academy of music arts in berlin before being forced out of his position in 1933 for being jewish .
he died in 1942 in new york .
the first contest was organized in 2002 by berlin 's university of the arts and is held every four years to honor feuermann .
during the first session of the contest , feuermann 's youngest sister , then in her mid 90s , was a guest , despite having planned never to return to germany again after fleeing during the nazi period .
this year 's participants will also travel in from all over the world , including competitors from china , russia , canada , korea , france , england , germany and the czech republic .
the winner receives not just a prize of 15,000 euros but also support for a cd production and concert appearances and tours . bildunterschrift : young talents from across the world will take the stage at the grand prix emanuel feuermann ruhr 2010 : trash scavengers from istanbul on stage rimini-protokoll are three young men from berlin that present theater works - but not with actors .
instead , they use people they meet on the street - for instance , four trash scavengers from istanbul .
director daniel wetzel met them around a year ago when he was in the turkish capital looking for ideas .
he saw scavengers everywhere in the city : kurdish men and roma from villages in anatolia , who scrounge around for metal , plastic , tin and anything else that 's valuable from morning until night .
after talking to some of them , the result was " herr dagacar und die goldene tektonik des muells " -lrb- " mr. dagacar and the golden tectonics of trash " -rrb- .
the theater piece premiered in istanbul on october 15 and its german premiere will take place on november 26 as part of the ruhr region 's year as a european capital of culture .
the four men on stage talk about their lives , villages , families - and their survival strategies .
the entire show is in turkish and kurdish , but for those who do n't understand the language , there 's a screen above the stage displaying subtitles .
it 's an unusual format but one that 's already meant success for the young theater makers . bildunterschrift : searching for valuable : four scavengers from istanbul take the stage in the ruhr valley christmas market season opens by the end of november , it 's already christmas time in germany .
cookies and chocolate santas have already been in the stores since september .
but the end of the month marks the official opening for many of germany 's christmas markets , including the most famous market in nuremberg on november 26 .
there , guests will be greeted personally by a figure known in german as the christkind : a woman with long blond locks wearing a golden crown .
she hands out treats , accepts wish lists and reads to children.young women in nuremberg between 16 and 19 years old can apply to fill the role each year .
around two million guests visit the market every year and many travel all the way from the us or japan just for the event .
these days , the atmosphere is so international that it 's no surprise to hear the sounds of " silent night " sung in japanese wafting from some of the stands . bildunterschrift : the " christkind " opens the festivities each year at nuremberg 's world-famous christmas market author : petra lambeck , anggatira golmer -lrb- gsw -rrb- editor : gavin blackburn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but it is schalke , led by veteran coach felix magath and spear-headed on the pitch by spanish star raul , who are best at showing up what a questionable test the champions league group stages really are .
schalke are second from bottom in the league , having scraped together six points from 10 games - the exact same total they have notched up in their three champions league matches , thanks to routine wins against portugal 's benfica and israel 's hapoel tel aviv .

after raul put two past hapoel a couple of weeks ago , there was much optimistic talk of " transferring " that form to the league , but saturday 's 1-0 home defeat to local rivals leverkusen ended with the players being booed off the pitch , and now schalke face the real prospect of replacing their dead title dreams with a relegation battle .

their league form is not good either , and they also just lost at home , to a solid but average nuremberg .

a defeat would signify pretty much the end of the competition for werder , and a draw does neither team much good .
werder 's frame of mind going into the match is pessimistic .

the combination of having a fight on their hands , along with the fact that they will have something to prove to the weserstadion faithful , means they may well pull off a win against twente .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de music -pipe- 02.11.2010 digital djs push limits with new german tech großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more and more djs are moving to digital spinning two berlin companies have released new products allowing djs to incorporate live elements and enhance their ability to remix live . online piracy of digital music is causing major problems for the music industry , as record companies continue to suffer declining sales .
however , in clubs and on dance floors , digital formats are changing the nature of djing in major ways .
in recent weeks , two berlin companies , native instruments and ableton , which both have a long history in the emerging digital djing market , have released new products that industry experts say are enhancing djs performance capabilities .
" ableton and native -lrb- instruments -rrb- seem to be two of the major players in this area at the moment , they keep development with djs in mind and keep the products coming fresh , " said mick wilson , the technology editor of dj magazine , in an interview with deutsche welle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the traktor kontrol s4 was released on monday native instrument 's traktor kontrol s4 was released on monday , and is an all-in-one approach to djing , allowing digital files to be performed and manipulated using a usb controller .
designed for portability , the controller allows for four different tracks to be loaded , sampled and mixed simultaneously .
similarly , ableton , in conjunction with the new zealand-based company serato , released its new software product , on september 22 .
" the bridge " integrates ableton live software , which allows djs to compose pieces , assemble tracks and play complete songs , with serato 's digital vinyl playback software .
this allows djs to manipulate all of these parts using specially produced vinyl records or cds .
both products are now making it easier for turntablists to hone their craft using entirely digital means .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ableton 's ceo called his company 's new product a " whole new level of excitement " berlin companies head in different directions while both ableton and native instruments claim to be innovators in the field of digital djing , they have chosen different directions to pursue .
" actually , this is just another piece to the puzzle of digital djing , but it 's the most outstanding piece because it 's the world 's first all-in-one computer based dj system , " said daniel haver , native instruments ' chief executive , in an interview with deutsche welle .
he added that native instruments ' " traktor kontrol s4 " also makes it far easier for djs to cut and loop segments of tracks , to essentially remix ‘ on the fly . '
" i can easily set a loop , shorten the loop , apply and effect and then drop it again , " explained constantin koehncke , a native instruments dj , as he demonstrated the product .
across town at ableton , the direction is integration but of a different kind .
" i think the bridge brings a whole new level of excitement to traditional djing , to be able to program your drum machines live , tweak you synthesizers live , that 's exciting , " said jeff milligan , of ableton .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bridge was released on september 22 competitors , but in different markets while both products have been in development for many years , taking many years in development , there should be no surprise that the two cross town rivals are keen to generate excitement about their products .
however , because both take different approaches to digital djing , it appears that they are not in direct competition .
" the two products are aimed at different areas of the market for different djs , it 's going to be both together not one or the other , " added mick wilson of dj magazine .
" i like them both , i like the idea of traktor and the new s4 controller looks really tasty as well .
i -lrb- also -rrb- like the idea of ' the bridge ' with ableton where you can play with an old school mentality but still incorporate modern production and remix capabilities . "

experts who investigated the failed bombing of a us-bound plane in december 2009 , an attempted attack later claimed by aqap , said that if the toner bombs had been constructed by yemeni al-qaeda operatives then the group had achieved a level of expertise previously unseen .
" if al-qaeda indeed made them , " former cia agent robert baer told the washington times , " then they 've teamed up with true professionals . "
the sophistication of the bombs helped them to pass undetected through explosives scanners at hubs such as britain 's east midlands airport and cologne-bonn , a fact that prompted the german government - along with britain , france , canada and the united states - to ban airfreight from yemen and extend the restrictions to include passenger flights originating there .
terrorism experts initially suggested that the cargo planes were targeted for explosion over densely populated cities but when it was revealed that the bombs made the first part of the journey on commercial tourism flights , some experts were then forced to revise their theories to include a potential strike against airborne passengers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sophistication of the bombs have surprised experts despite foiling the bomb plots before any lives were lost , us intelligence agencies are concerned that yemen-based terrorist groups are becoming increasingly advanced in their planning .
they are quickly learning not to underestimate the threat coming out of yemen 's impoverished , tribal landscape and are reviewing their risk assessment of the group 's potential international reach .
given the sophistication of the devices , their route through germany and the discovery of one of the bombs at britain 's east midlands airport , the nightmare scenario of aqap extending its reach to europe has put the continent 's anti-terror authorities on alert .
however , jeremy binnie , terrorism and insurgency editor at jane 's defense , believes that aqap has had the opportunity to attack european targets but has so far maintained its focus on the united states .
aqap had opportunity to hit europe but did n't , say experts " the data points we have suggest that the us remains aqap 's primary target , " binnie told deutsche welle .
" they could have blown up the toner bombs anywhere over europe but chose not to which suggests their final destination would have been the united states with detonation taking place over a densely-populated area to maximise casualties .
as with the christmas day attempt last year , the bomb travelled through europe destined for chicago but again , the bomb was not detonated in europe suggesting the target was clearly the us . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aqap boss nasser al-wahaishi leads the yemen franchise " aqap are very ambitious , " he added .
" they want to hit the ' head of the snake ' as osama bin laden calls the us , not washington 's partners .
attacking the us is al-qaeda 's primary objective as it creates the maximum amount of coverage , increases international pressure on governments like yemen 's to confront islamist militants and in turn destabilizes these countries , making them even more vulnerable to al-qaeda 's influence . "
henry wilkinson , the associate director of janusian security risk management , agreed that the us was more likely to be a target for aqap but that europe 's association with the us also put it at a certain amount of risk .
" i do n't think europe is any higher a priority target than the united states , " he told deutsche welle .
" aqap has made threats against all the western powers it argues are causing harm to muslims - by gift of military deployments in afghanistan or iraq , support for israel , or perceived offences against islam such as banning the veil .
i suspect the united states is the most sought after target , but europe seems to be the focus of more plots - i suspect because it is a softer target by gift of border security and a greater preponderance of local sympathisers . "
european nations equally at risk should aqap switch focus when asked if the discovery of a toner bomb in britain or the fact that it passed through germany on its route suggested either country was under specific threat , wilkinson disagreed .
" i do n't think there is any merit in suggesting any one country is at particular risk , " he said .
" aqap has threatened many countries and may have been involved in the kidnap and murder of several german nationals in northern yemen in 2009 .
in this respect , i think germany as a leading european country is as much at risk as france , the uk , or any other prominent european nation . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bombs could have gone off in cologne or britain - but did n't " if aqap or any other groups were intent on mounting an attack in europe , they would take into account operational viability and target opportunity , as well as political significance of attacking the country . "
while the high-profile cases coming out of yemen have certainly turned the world 's attention toward its situation , most experts consider other countries as regions more deserving of concern in relation to european security .
" we have not seen much evidence that aqap has the capability to mount long-lead , multi-cell operations in europe , and its record of attempting such operations have mostly focused on saudi arabia , " wilkinson said .
" while i think this latest incident has focussed minds on the threat from yemen , the hierarchy of threat concerns for most european governments very likely remains , in order , afghanistan-pakistan , somalia and then yemen . "

experts who investigated the failed bombing of a us-bound plane in december 2009 , an attempted attack later claimed by aqap , said that if the toner bombs had been constructed by yemeni al-qaeda operatives then the group had achieved a level of expertise previously unseen .
" if al-qaeda indeed made them , " former cia agent robert baer told the washington times , " then they 've teamed up with true professionals . "
the sophistication of the bombs helped them to pass undetected through explosives scanners at hubs such as britain 's east midlands airport and cologne-bonn , a fact that prompted the german government - along with britain , france , canada and the united states - to ban airfreight from yemen and extend the restrictions to include passenger flights originating there .
terrorism experts initially suggested that the cargo planes were targeted for explosion over densely populated cities but when it was revealed that the bombs made the first part of the journey on commercial tourism flights , some experts were then forced to revise their theories to include a potential strike against airborne passengers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sophistication of the bombs have surprised experts despite foiling the bomb plots before any lives were lost , us intelligence agencies are concerned that yemen-based terrorist groups are becoming increasingly advanced in their planning .
they are quickly learning not to underestimate the threat coming out of yemen 's impoverished , tribal landscape and are reviewing their risk assessment of the group 's potential international reach .
given the sophistication of the devices , their route through germany and the discovery of one of the bombs at britain 's east midlands airport , the nightmare scenario of aqap extending its reach to europe has put the continent 's anti-terror authorities on alert .
however , jeremy binnie , terrorism and insurgency editor at jane 's defense , believes that aqap has had the opportunity to attack european targets but has so far maintained its focus on the united states .
aqap had opportunity to hit europe but did n't , say experts " the data points we have suggest that the us remains aqap 's primary target , " binnie told deutsche welle .
" they could have blown up the toner bombs anywhere over europe but chose not to which suggests their final destination would have been the united states with detonation taking place over a densely-populated area to maximise casualties .
as with the christmas day attempt last year , the bomb travelled through europe destined for chicago but again , the bomb was not detonated in europe suggesting the target was clearly the us . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aqap boss nasser al-wahaishi leads the yemen franchise " aqap are very ambitious , " he added .
" they want to hit the ' head of the snake ' as osama bin laden calls the us , not washington 's partners .
attacking the us is al-qaeda 's primary objective as it creates the maximum amount of coverage , increases international pressure on governments like yemen 's to confront islamist militants and in turn destabilizes these countries , making them even more vulnerable to al-qaeda 's influence . "
henry wilkinson , the associate director of janusian security risk management , agreed that the us was more likely to be a target for aqap but that europe 's association with the us also put it at a certain amount of risk .
" i do n't think europe is any higher a priority target than the united states , " he told deutsche welle .
" aqap has made threats against all the western powers it argues are causing harm to muslims - by gift of military deployments in afghanistan or iraq , support for israel , or perceived offences against islam such as banning the veil .
i suspect the united states is the most sought after target , but europe seems to be the focus of more plots - i suspect because it is a softer target by gift of border security and a greater preponderance of local sympathisers . "
european nations equally at risk should aqap switch focus when asked if the discovery of a toner bomb in britain or the fact that it passed through germany on its route suggested either country was under specific threat , wilkinson disagreed .

but with this unique ecosystem threatened by political unrest in the region , a series of projects aims to ensure they stay that way . the landscape around gisenyi in western rwanda , on the border to the democratic republic of the congo , is breathtakingly beautiful .
mount nyiragongo towers majestically over the city , which is contiguous with the city of goma across the border in drc .
but mount nyiragongo is an active volcano , known for its devastating eruptions .
eight years ago , goma was largely destroyed by lava .
time and again , locals here have rebuilt their devastated city in the aftermath of such eruptions , despite risks posed by the still-hot lava and the frequent earth tremors that occur in the wake of the eruption .
they see the volcano as both a blessing and a curse .
located inside the virunga national park north of goma and lake kivu , and just west of the border with rwanda , its fertile land has made it one of the most densely populated regions on the entire continent . it also boasts virgin forests that are home to some unique flora and fauna , as well as the world 's last remaining population of mountain gorillas .
alternatives to illegal logging after the 1994 genocide in rwanda , hundreds of thousands of refugees fled over the border to goma .
today , the city is home to many former victims and perpetrators who are seeking refuge here from rwandan justice .
what they have in common is the fact that they are all trying to " put down roots in an ecosystem that is not their native one , " as johannes kirchgatter from the world wide fund for nature , or wwf , in germany puts it . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nyungwe rainforest is home to rare mountain gorillas the flow of refugees has resulted in a major population increase in the region , which has proved to be a heavy burden on existing fuel-provision structures .
the roughly one million people who live here depend mainly on firewood and wood charcoal for cooking and heating .
much of the logging activity in the virunga national park for the sale of timber and charcoal is controlled by rebel militia groups , which earn an estimated $ 30 million a year .
in order to put a stop to this illegal exploitation of resources by the charcoal mafia , the public needs alternatives that are affordable and sustainable .
outside the protected areas of the national park , the wwf is therefore overseeing a project to establish , maintain and exploit legal plantations for the production of fuel wood .
it also subsidizes the manufacture of energy-efficient ovens that consume 30 percent less fuel than previous ovens used hitherto .
the organization also trains rangers who work to clamp down on illegal loggers .
the project is already proving constructive , and helping to financially weaken the militias by providing the public with an alternative source for their fuel needs .
an important wilderness bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in drc , militias fund their activities with illegal wood trade the funds are partially provided from the international climate initiative , and kirchgatter hopes they can be put to good use across the entire congo basin .
its tropical forests are a haven for elephants , gorillas and other rare wildlife .
according to the wwf , the congo basin home to one-quarter of the world 's tropical forests and a mosaic of ecosystems – rivers , forests , savanna , swamps and flooded forests – which are teeming with life .
these forests regulate local climate and the flow of water , protect and enrich soils , control diseases and safeguard water quality .
reaching all the way to the atlantic coast , they also make up one of the most important wilderness areas left on the planet .
the wwf is planning to join forces with nasa next year to establish the exact size of its surface area using an optical remote sensing technology known as lidar , which can detect subtle topographic features such as river terraces and river channel banks , and measure the land surface elevation beneath the vegetation canopy .
the technology will allow researchers to establish forest density and even the precise amount of chlorophyll contained in different tree species .
with data provided by lidar , researchers will also be able to divide the congo basin into zones , isolating which areas are made up of primary forest and are therefore most in need of protection , and which areas could best be exploited by local populations .
the ultimate goal is to identify 15 percent of the congo basin as a protected area and thereby help preserve the habitats of species such as forest elephants , bonobo apes and various types of rare flora .
another project , run by the world resources institute , is putting the systems in place to implement effective strategies to reduce emissions from deforestation and forest degradation -lrb- known as redd . -rrb-
it is spearheading an innovative new project aimed at quantifying degradation and the greenhouse gas emissions in the forests of the republic of congo , and developing new methods to measure and monitor forest degradation .
the region will also be able to earn carbon credits by engaging in green carbon sequestering activities .
ideally , redd could deliver millions of dollars to impoverished communities in the congo basin in carbon credits , providing a powerful incentive to protect this land of great value to the planet .
but given that drc is one of the most corrupt nations in the world , negotiations are far from straightforward .
prioritizing needs of people and nature bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : preserving natural habitats in the congo basin is of global benefit nonetheless , johannes kirchgatter can already point to some successes , such as wwf programs in the lac tumba region in the western congo basin , some 1500 kilometers away from the virunga national park .
the region harbors a rich assemblage of terrestrial and aquatic biodiversity , and is an important provider of vital ecosystem services , including carbon sequestration , freshwater supplies , flood mitigation , and non-timber products for both subsistence and commercial use .
in wwf projects , locals are taught about land use planning ; protected area management and species conservation ; community-based natural resource management ; and livelihood improvement . the wwf hopes that 14,000 square kilometers of local forest can be preserved as a protected area and a further 65,000 square kilometers farmed sustainably .
given that the population is set to double in the next two decades , such measures are crucial .
but these valuable ecosystems will only survive if environmental priorities can be reconciled with the needs of local populations .

but with this unique ecosystem threatened by political unrest in the region , a series of projects aims to ensure they stay that way . the landscape around gisenyi in western rwanda , on the border to the democratic republic of the congo , is breathtakingly beautiful .
mount nyiragongo towers majestically over the city , which is contiguous with the city of goma across the border in drc .
but mount nyiragongo is an active volcano , known for its devastating eruptions .
eight years ago , goma was largely destroyed by lava .
time and again , locals here have rebuilt their devastated city in the aftermath of such eruptions , despite risks posed by the still-hot lava and the frequent earth tremors that occur in the wake of the eruption .
they see the volcano as both a blessing and a curse .
located inside the virunga national park north of goma and lake kivu , and just west of the border with rwanda , its fertile land has made it one of the most densely populated regions on the entire continent . it also boasts virgin forests that are home to some unique flora and fauna , as well as the world 's last remaining population of mountain gorillas .
alternatives to illegal logging after the 1994 genocide in rwanda , hundreds of thousands of refugees fled over the border to goma .
today , the city is home to many former victims and perpetrators who are seeking refuge here from rwandan justice .
what they have in common is the fact that they are all trying to " put down roots in an ecosystem that is not their native one , " as johannes kirchgatter from the world wide fund for nature , or wwf , in germany puts it . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nyungwe rainforest is home to rare mountain gorillas the flow of refugees has resulted in a major population increase in the region , which has proved to be a heavy burden on existing fuel-provision structures .
the roughly one million people who live here depend mainly on firewood and wood charcoal for cooking and heating .
much of the logging activity in the virunga national park for the sale of timber and charcoal is controlled by rebel militia groups , which earn an estimated $ 30 million a year .
in order to put a stop to this illegal exploitation of resources by the charcoal mafia , the public needs alternatives that are affordable and sustainable .
outside the protected areas of the national park , the wwf is therefore overseeing a project to establish , maintain and exploit legal plantations for the production of fuel wood .
it also subsidizes the manufacture of energy-efficient ovens that consume 30 percent less fuel than previous ovens used hitherto .
the organization also trains rangers who work to clamp down on illegal loggers .
the project is already proving constructive , and helping to financially weaken the militias by providing the public with an alternative source for their fuel needs .
an important wilderness bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in drc , militias fund their activities with illegal wood trade the funds are partially provided from the international climate initiative , and kirchgatter hopes they can be put to good use across the entire congo basin .
its tropical forests are a haven for elephants , gorillas and other rare wildlife .
according to the wwf , the congo basin home to one-quarter of the world 's tropical forests and a mosaic of ecosystems – rivers , forests , savanna , swamps and flooded forests – which are teeming with life .
these forests regulate local climate and the flow of water , protect and enrich soils , control diseases and safeguard water quality .
reaching all the way to the atlantic coast , they also make up one of the most important wilderness areas left on the planet .
the wwf is planning to join forces with nasa next year to establish the exact size of its surface area using an optical remote sensing technology known as lidar , which can detect subtle topographic features such as river terraces and river channel banks , and measure the land surface elevation beneath the vegetation canopy .
the technology will allow researchers to establish forest density and even the precise amount of chlorophyll contained in different tree species .
with data provided by lidar , researchers will also be able to divide the congo basin into zones , isolating which areas are made up of primary forest and are therefore most in need of protection , and which areas could best be exploited by local populations .
the ultimate goal is to identify 15 percent of the congo basin as a protected area and thereby help preserve the habitats of species such as forest elephants , bonobo apes and various types of rare flora .
another project , run by the world resources institute , is putting the systems in place to implement effective strategies to reduce emissions from deforestation and forest degradation -lrb- known as redd . -rrb-
it is spearheading an innovative new project aimed at quantifying degradation and the greenhouse gas emissions in the forests of the republic of congo , and developing new methods to measure and monitor forest degradation .
the region will also be able to earn carbon credits by engaging in green carbon sequestering activities .
ideally , redd could deliver millions of dollars to impoverished communities in the congo basin in carbon credits , providing a powerful incentive to protect this land of great value to the planet .
but given that drc is one of the most corrupt nations in the world , negotiations are far from straightforward .
prioritizing needs of people and nature bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : preserving natural habitats in the congo basin is of global benefit nonetheless , johannes kirchgatter can already point to some successes , such as wwf programs in the lac tumba region in the western congo basin , some 1500 kilometers away from the virunga national park .
the region harbors a rich assemblage of terrestrial and aquatic biodiversity , and is an important provider of vital ecosystem services , including carbon sequestration , freshwater supplies , flood mitigation , and non-timber products for both subsistence and commercial use .
in wwf projects , locals are taught about land use planning ; protected area management and species conservation ; community-based natural resource management ; and livelihood improvement . the wwf hopes that 14,000 square kilometers of local forest can be preserved as a protected area and a further 65,000 square kilometers farmed sustainably .
given that the population is set to double in the next two decades , such measures are crucial .
but these valuable ecosystems will only survive if environmental priorities can be reconciled with the needs of local populations .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de auto industry -pipe- 02.11.2010 asian demand drives german auto industry growth großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the auto industry is one of germany 's biggest exporters the german auto industry is predicting a 21 percent increase in exports for 2010 thanks to high demand in asia and the united states .
analysts say manufacturers ' emphasis on research and development is paying off . there 's no doubt that this has been a good year for german carmakers , and equally little doubt that that has much to do with china .
volkswagen , porsche , bmw and mercedes have all made their mark on the sprawling asian landmass and notched up sales figures that far outstripped their expectations .
in the first eight months of 2010 , the chinese car market almost doubled in size with german manufacturers securing a 53 percent increase on the sales of its cars .
in an interview in monday 's die welt newspaper , the president of the german association of the automotive industry -lrb- vda -rrb- , matthias wissmann , said that german manufacturers would have produced a total of 5.45 million passenger cars by the end of the year . the lion 's share will have gone to international markets .
bildunterschrift : destined for foreign roads : german cars enjoy a good reputation overseas " over the whole year , we are expecting exports to rise 21 percent , which equates to 4.15 million passenger cars , " wissmann said .
" the strength of the asian market , especially in china , and also the recovery of the us market , have fuelled exports . "
so far this year , chinese consumers have bought 1.3 million german vehicles .
development paid off wissmann cited the decision not to cap but increase development budgets during the crisis as one of the main reasons for the surge in popularity of german cars in asian countries .
he said it had given german manufacturers a technologically competitive edge and enabled them to come up with the right range of cars .
the vda president added that the german domestic market also performed better than had been expected in 2010 .
there had been worries that demand would stagnate following the government 's decision not to extend its car scrapping subsidy scheme , whereby german car owners were paid 2,500 euros -lrb- $ 3,470 -rrb- if they traded in a vehicle that was at least nine years old and purchased a brand new one .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as company profits rise , auto workers want higher pay workers have responded to the flourishing market with calls for wage increases planned for 2011 to be introduced early .
audi and other parts of the volkswagen concern , whose operating profit had trebled by the end of the third quarter to 4.8 billion euros , have already agreed to an increase .
bmw , porsche and daimler have yet to make a decision .

both schalke and werder lost last weekend , but they may have different approaches to european competition . the champions league is meant to separate the men from the boys .
football connoisseurs enjoy pointing out that it is superior in quality to the world cup , and no less an authority than real madrid coach jose mourinho has said it is the best competition in the world .
but then he would , seeing as how he ’ s won it twice .
but in the group stages at least , the gulf between europe 's rich and poor leagues often belies this claim , and germany 's representatives in this season 's champions league seem to be finding europe 's best of the best a lot easier to cope with than unglamorous mid-table sides like nuremberg .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : raul and schalke did n't find hapoel to be much of a challenge bayern munich , last season 's champion 's league finalists , have only just broken into the top half of the table , but they are three from three in their easy european group .
but it is schalke , led by veteran coach felix magath and spear-headed on the pitch by spanish star raul , who are best at showing up what a questionable test the champions league group stages really are .
schalke are second from bottom in the league , having scraped together six points from 10 games - the exact same total they have notched up in their three champions league matches , thanks to routine wins against portugal 's benfica and israel 's hapoel tel aviv .
another win in tel aviv on tuesday and they will be well on their way out of the group .
superficial glory but there are of course many other factors at play .
as magath never tires of pointing out , schalke are struggling with new signings and a new system , and somehow the glamour and much-mooted ' magic ' of europe seems to lift veterans like raul , the champions league ’ s all-time top scorer .
the short-term glory of a much-needed win in europe is a balm for many sorrows .
after raul put two past hapoel a couple of weeks ago , there was much optimistic talk of " transferring " that form to the league , but saturday 's 1-0 home defeat to local rivals leverkusen ended with the players being booed off the pitch , and now schalke face the real prospect of replacing their dead title dreams with a relegation battle .
that is not much fun for internationally experienced stars like manuel neuer , klaas-jan huntelaar and christoph metzelder , and magath sounded pessimistic after the game .
" we have players who are used to playing for the top .
that 's why they ca n't cope with the situation , " newspaper bild quoted magath as saying . " the performance didn ’ t match our current position in the standings .
we have to try to avoid a tight situation at the bottom of the table . "
mid-table struggle for werder bremen , the problem is more subtle .
their league form is not good either , and they also just lost at home , to a solid but average nuremberg .
but their attacking line-up featuring the likes of claudio pizarro , hugo almeida , and marko marin are always good for a few goals , and they have at least consolidated mid-table status .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nuremberg held off bremen and stole an away win in europe , though , they face a scrap .
tuesday sees them host dutch champions fc twente , and the match is pretty much a do-or-die tie for both teams - they are both on two points , behind second-placed tottenham hotspur , who have four .
a defeat would signify pretty much the end of the competition for werder , and a draw does neither team much good .
werder 's frame of mind going into the match is pessimistic .
" the only chance we still have is getting three points , " marin said after saturday 's game .
" but that will be difficult .
the mood in the dressing room is not good . "
team captain torsten frings was livid after the defeat on saturday .
" we 're just being too careless with the situation , " he said , after railing against his team-mates as the final whistle went .
but he does not see the champions league match as a distraction , but a chance .
" it ’ s a good opportunity to take a big step forward , " he said .
the combination of having a fight on their hands , along with the fact that they will have something to prove to the weserstadion faithful , means they may well pull off a win against twente .
werder have more european experience , and home advantage should see them get past the dutch side , whom they held to a 1-1 draw in the netherlands .
for schalke , meanwhile , the champions league needs to be an afterthought .

the combination of having a fight on their hands , along with the fact that they will have something to prove to the weserstadion faithful , means they may well pull off a win against twente .
werder have more european experience , and home advantage should see them get past the dutch side , whom they held to a 1-1 draw in the netherlands .
for schalke , meanwhile , the champions league needs to be an afterthought .

no one was injured after a package from greece that contained explosive material arrived at the chancellery in berlin . there are still many questions about the mysterious package that arrived at chancellor angela merkel 's office in berlin on tuesday .
at least one thing is clear : the package did contain explosive materials .
that much was confirmed by interior minister thomas de maiziere on tuesday evening .
according to security sources in the capital , anyone who had opened the package would have been injured .
it did n't get that far , however , after the package was identified as suspicious during a routine mail inspection .
bomb defusing experts rendered the package harmless with a water cannon .
the chancellery was not evacuated as the mail room is in a separate building .
merkel was not in berlin during the incident as she is currently in belgium on an official visit .
she did say , however , that the recent series of package bombs from greece and yemen indicated a need for stricter controls on freight shipping in the european union , the united states , and around the globe .
" this is urgently about implementing stricter world-wide controls to prevent terror attacks , " merkel said in an interview with the passaue neue presse .
de maiziere points to greece bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : de maiziere confirmed the package was sent from greece de maiziere also confirmed that the package had been sent two days ago to berlin from greece , where several bombs addressed to foreign embassies have been intercepted and three have ignited .
the interior minister said , " today ’ s situation fits into that context . "
he confirmed media reports that the return address on the package was listed at the greek economics ministry .
greek authorities have suspended all international mail for 48 hours from tuesday as they conduct a further investigation .
bombs exploded at the swiss and russian embassies in athens on tuesday , while others addressed to the bulgarian , chilean and german embassies were discovered and detonated in controlled explosions .
greek police say they plan to detonate another two packages recently seized at athens airport .
on monday , authorities intercepted and defused several other packages with explosive material inside that were addressed to other embassies , as well as to french president nicolas sarkozy .
one package addressed to the mexican embassy ignited in delivery service office and burned the hands of an employee .
two men were arrested on monday in connection with the parcel bombs and greek police suspect far-left extremists are behind the attacks .
no connection with yemen initial theories about the incident included the possibility that the package could have been sent from yemen , the focus of recent security attention worldwide .
however , de maiziere said tuesday 's incident had nothing to do with yemen .
over the weekend two freight packages on their way to the us from yemen were intercepted in europe and dubai and found to contain bombs .
germany and other countries have responded by restricting both passenger and freight flights originating in yemen .

but critics suggest the idea of troops regularly serving under foreign command could cause problems . david cameron and nicolas sarkozy put pen to paper on two treaties in london .
the agreements will see britain and france jointly testing nuclear warheads , coordinating aircraft carriers so there is always a british or french vessel available for joint operations , and creating a combined expeditionary force training troops to deploy together .
france will also be allowed to use british a400m fuelling aircraft when there is spare capacity and there will be joint work on drones , mine counter-measures and satellite communications .
both men were keen to reject claims the move will diminish british or french sovereignty in any way .
david cameron insisted : bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain and france want to get closer and save money too " this is not , as some have suggested , about weakening or pooling british or french sovereignty .
this is not about a european army .
this is not about sharing our nuclear deterrents .
let me say this plainly : britain and france are , and will always remain , sovereign nations , able to deploy our armed forces independently and in our national interest when we choose to do so . "
david cameron ‘ s defence secretary liam fox has pointed out that it is not unusual for british troops to serve under foreign command - it happens often in nato operations .
the prime minister also said that uk forces are deployed alongside those of its allies on a regular basis , saying that " the vast bulk of our military operations - bosnia , kosovo , afghanistan , amongst others , have been conducted together with our allies . "
he added that such operations were always about defending britain 's national interest , and that they were " about practical , hard-headed co-operation between sovereign countries . "
france and britain have disagreed , even fairly recently , on military intervention - for example , on the invasion of iraq in 2003 .
so president sarkozy and prime minister cameron were sure to point out that a ' political agreement ' would have to be reached for the joint taskforce to be deployed .
sarkozy maintained , however , that france and britain already cooperated on major military operations and would continue to do so .
" if you , my british friends , have to face a major crisis , " said sarkozy , " could you imagine france simply sitting there , its arms crossed , saying that it 's none of our business ? "
' unprecedented and historic ' sarkozy did say , however , that the pacts demonstrated that britain and france were especially close at the moment , and hailed the anglo-french relationship : " this is an unprecedented decision and it shows a level of trust and confidence between our two nations that is unequalled in history . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france and britain , historical enemies , have grown quite close the french president , also aware that some analysts had described the pact as a signal of an overall weakening of combined british and french military power , was quick to dispel that notion . " we consider that the security effort should not in any way be drawn down in an increasingly dangerous world , which is that in which we live . "
the two leaders do both hope , however , that co-operation can lead to savings in costs .
the uk has recently announced cuts in its defense budget as part of its austerity drive and wants greater pooling of resources with france to help it maintain its military might , while bringing down its expense .
' big questions ' britain 's shadow defense secretary jim murphy welcomed the emphasis on greater co-operation in military matters , saying that deepening ties is ' essential ' to modern defense policy among allies .
however , he warned that " interdependence is different from dependence , and binding legal treaties pose some big questions for the government . "
murphy also said the uk could be entering " an era where we are reliant on our allies to fill in the gaps in the government 's defense policy . "
maintaining global might bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france sends its soldiers far and wide , but could stand to save money france and britain 's defense budgets are among the largest in the world .
both countries punch above their weight militarily and do not want to surrender their strategic advantage in this area .
alastair cameron , european security expert at the royal united services institute in london , thinks that is in little danger of happening , despite austerity drives .
" one could clearly be tempted to say that , forced to recognize their diminished stature in the world , these two countries are trying to do more together to avoid being overtaken by others , " he said . but cameron also said the two countries were such significant military contributors to global military operations that it would be hard to see much diminishment of their ambition to play a part on the global strategic scene .
" the military is facing a squeeze , of course , " said cameron , " but there is no doubt that their capacity , even under austerity measures , maintains an edge over a good number or other countries . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de defense -pipe- 02.11.2010 britain and france sign ' historic ' defense treaties in london großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : carriers will be retrofitted to service both countries ' planes prime minister david cameron and president nicolas sarkozy insist their countries ' sovereignty is not threatened .
but critics suggest the idea of troops regularly serving under foreign command could cause problems . david cameron and nicolas sarkozy put pen to paper on two treaties in london .
the agreements will see britain and france jointly testing nuclear warheads , coordinating aircraft carriers so there is always a british or french vessel available for joint operations , and creating a combined expeditionary force training troops to deploy together .
france will also be allowed to use british a400m fuelling aircraft when there is spare capacity and there will be joint work on drones , mine counter-measures and satellite communications .
both men were keen to reject claims the move will diminish british or french sovereignty in any way .
david cameron insisted : bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain and france want to get closer and save money too " this is not , as some have suggested , about weakening or pooling british or french sovereignty .
this is not about a european army .
this is not about sharing our nuclear deterrents .
let me say this plainly : britain and france are , and will always remain , sovereign nations , able to deploy our armed forces independently and in our national interest when we choose to do so . "
david cameron ‘ s defence secretary liam fox has pointed out that it is not unusual for british troops to serve under foreign command - it happens often in nato operations .
the prime minister also said that uk forces are deployed alongside those of its allies on a regular basis , saying that " the vast bulk of our military operations - bosnia , kosovo , afghanistan , amongst others , have been conducted together with our allies . "
he added that such operations were always about defending britain 's national interest , and that they were " about practical , hard-headed co-operation between sovereign countries . "
france and britain have disagreed , even fairly recently , on military intervention - for example , on the invasion of iraq in 2003 .
so president sarkozy and prime minister cameron were sure to point out that a ' political agreement ' would have to be reached for the joint taskforce to be deployed .
sarkozy maintained , however , that france and britain already cooperated on major military operations and would continue to do so .
" if you , my british friends , have to face a major crisis , " said sarkozy , " could you imagine france simply sitting there , its arms crossed , saying that it 's none of our business ? "
' unprecedented and historic ' sarkozy did say , however , that the pacts demonstrated that britain and france were especially close at the moment , and hailed the anglo-french relationship : " this is an unprecedented decision and it shows a level of trust and confidence between our two nations that is unequalled in history . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france and britain , historical enemies , have grown quite close the french president , also aware that some analysts had described the pact as a signal of an overall weakening of combined british and french military power , was quick to dispel that notion . " we consider that the security effort should not in any way be drawn down in an increasingly dangerous world , which is that in which we live . "
the two leaders do both hope , however , that co-operation can lead to savings in costs .
the uk has recently announced cuts in its defense budget as part of its austerity drive and wants greater pooling of resources with france to help it maintain its military might , while bringing down its expense .
' big questions ' britain 's shadow defense secretary jim murphy welcomed the emphasis on greater co-operation in military matters , saying that deepening ties is ' essential ' to modern defense policy among allies .
however , he warned that " interdependence is different from dependence , and binding legal treaties pose some big questions for the government . "
murphy also said the uk could be entering " an era where we are reliant on our allies to fill in the gaps in the government 's defense policy . "
maintaining global might bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france sends its soldiers far and wide , but could stand to save money france and britain 's defense budgets are among the largest in the world .
both countries punch above their weight militarily and do not want to surrender their strategic advantage in this area .
alastair cameron , european security expert at the royal united services institute in london , thinks that is in little danger of happening , despite austerity drives .
" one could clearly be tempted to say that , forced to recognize their diminished stature in the world , these two countries are trying to do more together to avoid being overtaken by others , " he said . but cameron also said the two countries were such significant military contributors to global military operations that it would be hard to see much diminishment of their ambition to play a part on the global strategic scene .
" the military is facing a squeeze , of course , " said cameron , " but there is no doubt that their capacity , even under austerity measures , maintains an edge over a good number or other countries . "

he also called on nato to work more closely with china on the exchange of information about cyber attacks . zu guttenberg met with his chinese counterpart liang guanglie on tuesday , calling on beijing to do more to help stabilize afghanistan in the face of a growing insurgency and worsening violence .
however , he stressed there was no military role for the chinese to play there . " we have a shared interest when it comes to the question of at what time do we reach a stable , or at least an agreeably stable , afghanistan , with a state of security that we can accept , " zu guttenberg said in beijing . china is not involved in the war in afghanistan , but has economic interests there . zu guttenberg said training civil servants was one area in which china could step up its involvement . " when it comes to goals we can reach and we have to reach , i think , the neighbors can also play a significant role .
we have to look at the most important neighbors as well and china is one of them , " he said . mineral wealth china would benefit from a stable afghanistan because it would be easier for its firms to complete billion-dollar resource deals they have or are considering . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china is reluctant to get more involved in a war-torn afghanistan the us defense department estimated earlier this year afghanistan 's mineral resources could top $ 1 trillion -lrb- 0.7 trillion euros -rrb- . how to stabilize afghanistan will be a major issue at a nato summit in lisbon later this month and in us president barack obama 's strategy review in december . germany is the third-largest contributor to the nato-led force in afghanistan with about 4,600 troops and , like the united states , is looking at starting a partial withdrawal in 2011 . closer cooperation on cyber crime zu guttenberg has also been discussing bilateral relations , closer relations with nato , the fight against piracy and cyber security . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zu guttenberg wants better cooperation on cyber attacks with regards to the struggle against cyber attacks , zu guttenberg called for a better exchange of information between nato and china .

the photos include streets in the southern german town of oberstaufen , public spaces and soccer stadiums around the country . early on tuesday morning , google unveiled its first street view photographs in germany , honoring the bavarian town of oberstaufen to include " selected streets " where the company had sent its vehicles .

potentially connected parcel bombs have been sent to chancellor angela merkel 's office and embassies in greece .
the attacks follow mail bombs addressed to french president nicolas sarkozy among others on monday . the package containing explosives that was delivered to german chancellor angela merkel 's office was marked as coming from the greek economics ministry .
the recent bomb discovery comes after five embassies in athens have been targeted in mail box attacks on tuesday . two of the bombs exploded in front of the swiss embassy and a russian embassy compound , but did not cause any injuries , police in greece said .
other parcel bombs sent to the embassies of germany , bulgaria and chile were destroyed in controlled explosions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor merkel 's office and embassies in greece are under attack .
german interior minister thomas de maiziere said the parcel which arrived at chancellor merkel ’ s office resembled the bombs in greece .
suspects linked to far-left group the parcel ’ s delivery follows the arrest of two greek mail bomb suspects on monday who were accused of trying to send at least four parcel bombs to french president nicolas sarkozy and the mexican , dutch and belgian embassies .
the two men have been linked to a far-left group .
deutsche welle 's athens correspondent christine pirovolakis said that greek police are concerned since there were so many bombs at once circulating around in the greek capital .
the bombs are said to be sophisticated , although not powerful enough to cause great harm .
security sources said the package that made it to berlin was a " fast " explosive device that would have released a flame and caused burns had it detonated .
apparently it had not been a pipe bomb , or any other type of bomb that is designed to maim or kill with shrapnel .
similar bomb attacks in the past " one group under investigation is the ' sect of revolutionaries , ' a group that has committed other types of bomb attacks in the past , " pirovolakis said .
" in about a month 's time , we are going to have the two-year anniversary of a police shooting of a teenager , so last year around this time there was also an increase of bomb attacks in athens and it looks like it is the same this year as well . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : similar parcel bombs had been sent out on monday .
the police are starting to crack down , she added , saying that they were checking all governmental buildings and are searching individual visitors to them more closely .
also , parcels coming in and out of buildings are being rigorously screened for further investigation .
major streets in athens were also cut off to traffic .
elections in greece coming up some assume the parcel bombings could be happening due to greece 's austerity measures that have been implemented by the government .
" certainly the ways of attacks have increased since the teenage shooting a few years ago and of course the recent months since the austerity measures have been announced by the socialist government , " pirovolakis said .
" it looks like things are escalating once again .
there are also elections this coming weekend here in greece , so it looks like the left-wing groups are trying to in a way speak on behalf of the public how fed up they are with the austerity measures . "

the visit came as strained relations with russia may be turning belarus westward . germany and poland reached out to belarus on tuesday as the two countries ' foreign ministers arrived for an official visit to the authoritarian state , dubbed by human rights groups as " the last dictatorship in europe . "
german foreign minister guido westerwelle made the trip , along with his polish counterpart radoslaw sikorski , at the end of a two-day tour of eastern europe , visiting moscow on monday and vilnius , lithuania earlier on tuesday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : election results in 2006 gave lukashenko 83 percent of the vote the visit represented a shift in german relations with belarus , which has not hosted a german foreign minister in 15 years , and comes less than two months before new presidential elections in the former soviet state on december 19 .
westerwelle met with president alexander lukashenko , who has been in power since 1994 and won the last election with 83 percent , as well as opposition candidates for president , who he said should have free access to state media .
" from our view of things , the presidential elections will be a litmus test for your commitment to democracy , " westerwelle told lukashenko during the meeting .
the allowance of international observers was a " step in the right direction . "
' window of opportunity ' for eu ahead of his trip to belarus , westerwelle said that an approach to the european union by belarus could happen " only if legal standards are met . "
but according to stefan meister , eastern europe expert at the german council on foreign relations , belarus has shown no interest in joining the eu .
and despite the bloc 's attempts to become a greater player on the world stage , he said the eu 's interests remain internal .
" european union has no instruments for countries which have no interest in joining , " he told deutsche welle .
" there is no real functioning policy towards this country , and i think this is also the reason why europe is not really successful towards belarus . "
bildunterschrift : russia cut off gas supplies to belarus in june over a payment dispute still , there are signs that belarus is interested in closer cooperation with the west .
ties with russia , historically its closest ally , hit a new low earlier in the year when russia cut off gas supplies to belarus over a payment dispute .
and according to meister , this may be the time for germany and the eu to step in .
" there is maybe a window of opportunity to get more in contact with lukashenko and his regime , " he said .
" maybe there 's a chance for some reforms or the beginning of a new process between the european union and belarus . "
' diplomatic offensive ' the german visit to belarus continues on wednesday , when chancellor angela merkel 's chief of staff ronald pofalla is to give a speech at the minsk forum , an even created in 1997 to facilitate dialogue between the two countries .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel 's chief of staff ronald pofalla speaks at the minsk forum on wednesday organizers of the event said pofalla would make a " robust " appeal for democratic reforms in belarus , and that germany was launching a " diplomatic offensive . "
poland and germany are two of the few countries in the european union that have taken an interest in belarus , meister said .
but despite their efforts to push democratic reforms , nothing can be expected in the immediate future - and certainly not before next month 's elections .
" if we observe the developments in the last month , we can see that -lsb- lukashenko -rsb- has been pressuring the opposition , that he pressures the media , " he said .
" he still has the same instruments of the regime to make everything clear for the next election . "

the rules would force national nuclear authorities to draw up disposal plans to be vetted by the eu . europe 's energy chief said that the eu needed binding rules for the long-term storage of nuclear waste in europe , namely in deep underground bunkers that would be safe from accidents or sabotage .
" we have to make sure that we have the highest safety standards in the world to protect our citizens , " guenther oettinger said on wednesday in brussels .
" safety is indivisible .
if an accident happens in one country , it can have devastating effects also in others . " oettinger said the current situation within the eu , where most nuclear waste is stored in bunkers or warehouses until it cools down , is no longer acceptable .
the eu 's energy body says " deep geological repositories , " or caverns at depths of between 100 and 700 meters underground , are the best places to permanently store spent fuel rods , which can remain dangerous to humans for up to a million years .
the 50,000 cubic meters of waste generated by the eu annually is currently held in temporary above-ground facilities , although lower-grade nuclear waste , which includes such things as equipment from de-commissioned reactors , is permitted below ground .
oettinger is keen to change this because of surface storage facilities ' vulnerability to environmental damage and terrorist attacks . " the vast majority of experts agree that you need to have deep storage , in other words at least 300 meters below the earth 's surface , " he said .
the eu 's executive wants each of its member states to come up with a national plan for long-term storage within four years of new eu legislation .
those plans would then be vetted by oettinger 's team .
not so black and white bildunterschrift : where europe currently stores its waste but not everyone trusts the burial technique , which has never been put to the test due to the vast timeframes involved .
munich environmental institute board member christina hacker told deutsche welle that the problem is in the use of the word " safe " .
" who knows what is going to be safe for a million years ? " she asked .
" we have never had a depot like this before so it is impossible to guarantee its safety . "
proponents of the idea counter that rock provides a better natural barrier than any man-made constructions and that it is the best possible solution to a complex problem .
they say thirty years of research has established which geological structures are best for the job , and point to structures of clay in germany and granite in sweden .
but nuclear waste expert , stefan alt from the environmental research centre oeko-institut says there are some critical questions that need to be answered before any legislation can be signed off .
" storing waste deep under the ground is the most responsible way to go , " he told deutsche welle .
" but we still have to decide whether we will want access to it in the future or whether we want to seal it away forever . "
a bad precedent bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : burying nuclear waste has proved problematic in germany alt says the difficulties in predicting environmental changes over the next centuries and millennia make it impossible to foresee things like the condition of the containers five hundred years down the line .
furthermore , in light of revelations earlier this year that containers at the asse nuclear storage facility in germany had been damaged as a result of structural instability , he believes it could be wise to make waste accessible .
it 's an argument supported by local anti-nuclear campaigners .
udo dettmann , part of the asse ii community organization , told deutsche welle it would be a critical mistake to bury radioactive waste irreversibly .
" it if would stay deep under the ground that would be fine , but there is no proof that this will be the case over a period of one million years , " he said .
" the only way we have to correct mis-developments is to ensure access to the storage . "
he also said that there had been " insufficient " research into such sites , and that it would be irresponsible for the german government or the european commission to decide upon deep geological repositories without having thoroughly explored other options . politics versus security bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oettinger says current european rules for storing waste are unacceptable for the time being , though that the eu 's executive appears determined to find a long term , subterranean solution to the problem of dealing with nuclear waste .
in a recent article in a regional german newspaper , the badisches tagblatt , oettinger said he could foresee clusters of eu countries agreeing upon a collective waste-storage site .
he did not suggest which of the eu 's 27 member-states might prove suitable for such a facility , but stressed that he would not " tolerate the export of nuclear waste outside the european union . "
and while the idea of one country housing another country 's – or indeed several other countries ' – nuclear waste could itself prove politically tricky , stefan alt says that from a scientific point of view , it makes sense to find the best geological location possible .
" on this issue , security is more important than national boundaries , " he said .
" the alternative would mean that every country tried to locate sites which do n't even exist . "

" it does not at all account for the problems that we expect to have , like surveillance , profiling , identity theft .
the fact that you have all the data in one central registry could lead to a lot of problems and a changing relationship between the state and the people , " says usha ramanatham , a prominent legal expert . however , economic analyst m. k venu says the project ’ s foremost priority is to identify target groups for various government programmes : " the uid essentially is aimed at providing identities to the very poor , which number about 600 million . " the government spends over $ 100 billion annually in delivering various social welfare programmes for them .
and it is very important that these people have an identity .
the primary importance of the uid in india is to bring 600 million people out of poverty , by targeting them in a transparent manner . " technology will tag everybody and everything ramanathan is still not convinced and says " technology has brought all these problems in .
uids will tag every person , the gps system will tag every place and a public information and infrastructure system will tag every institution .
that ’ s the kind of invasion of privacy that we are actually being told will happen . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nandan nilekani is the chairman of the unique identification authority the head of the unique identification project is nandan nilekani , a former ceo of infosys technologies , the flagship of india 's information technology sector .
in 2009 , he was listed by time magazine among the world 's 100 most influential people . " this concern is limited to the well-off class in india for whom this is a privacy issue , " argues venu .
" whereas for the 600-700 million people who do not have enough to eat , who do not have shelter , who do not have clothing , this is not a privacy issue at all .
they want to be recognized by the state for the delivery of these social welfare programmes .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de china -pipe- 02.11.2010 world 's most expensive census underway in china großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the figures for migrant workers in china vary this year 's count is based on where people live rather than where they are registered .
over 10 days , six million census-takers will visit 400 million households to collect data about names , age and education . every day , hoards of people from the poorer provinces arrive in beijing and china 's other megacities to try their luck .
nobody exactly knows how many migrant workers there are in the country , but duan chengron , a migration expert at beijing 's people 's university , is willing to take a guess . " according to the official figures of 2005 , there are 147 million migrant workers , " he says .
" but many experts say this figure is too low .
i would say about 250 million .
but nobody knows .
that ’ s why we need the census . " difficult to get hold of migrant workers however , it is not easy to find the migrant workers and record their data .
many of them live in collective accommodation .
others share apartments where they often sleep in shifts ; some even sleeping on the floor . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : parents with unregistered children might be unwilling to answer questions for the census feng nailin from the national statistics bureau in beijing says the over six million census-takers are likely to encounter another headache : " citizens are far less cooperative than before and that ’ s a big problem .
maybe it ’ s because lifestyles have changed , things are much faster now and people value their private lives more . " under mao it was normal for the state to interfere in people ’ s private affairs but people are less and less willing to accept this now .
during pilot runs in the summer , some census-takers were met with closed doors . that 's why vice premier le keqiang recently called on the population to cooperate : " we hope that everybody will work together so that the census information is correct and complete .

however , in clubs and on dance floors , digital formats are changing the nature of djing in major ways .
in recent weeks , two berlin companies , native instruments and ableton , which both have a long history in the emerging digital djing market , have released new products that industry experts say are enhancing djs performance capabilities .
" ableton and native -lrb- instruments -rrb- seem to be two of the major players in this area at the moment , they keep development with djs in mind and keep the products coming fresh , " said mick wilson , the technology editor of dj magazine , in an interview with deutsche welle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the traktor kontrol s4 was released on monday native instrument 's traktor kontrol s4 was released on monday , and is an all-in-one approach to djing , allowing digital files to be performed and manipulated using a usb controller .
designed for portability , the controller allows for four different tracks to be loaded , sampled and mixed simultaneously .
similarly , ableton , in conjunction with the new zealand-based company serato , released its new software product , on september 22 .
" the bridge " integrates ableton live software , which allows djs to compose pieces , assemble tracks and play complete songs , with serato 's digital vinyl playback software .
this allows djs to manipulate all of these parts using specially produced vinyl records or cds .
both products are now making it easier for turntablists to hone their craft using entirely digital means .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ableton 's ceo called his company 's new product a " whole new level of excitement " berlin companies head in different directions while both ableton and native instruments claim to be innovators in the field of digital djing , they have chosen different directions to pursue .
" actually , this is just another piece to the puzzle of digital djing , but it 's the most outstanding piece because it 's the world 's first all-in-one computer based dj system , " said daniel haver , native instruments ' chief executive , in an interview with deutsche welle .
he added that native instruments ' " traktor kontrol s4 " also makes it far easier for djs to cut and loop segments of tracks , to essentially remix ‘ on the fly . '
" i can easily set a loop , shorten the loop , apply and effect and then drop it again , " explained constantin koehncke , a native instruments dj , as he demonstrated the product .
across town at ableton , the direction is integration but of a different kind .
" i think the bridge brings a whole new level of excitement to traditional djing , to be able to program your drum machines live , tweak you synthesizers live , that 's exciting , " said jeff milligan , of ableton .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bridge was released on september 22 competitors , but in different markets while both products have been in development for many years , taking many years in development , there should be no surprise that the two cross town rivals are keen to generate excitement about their products .
however , because both take different approaches to digital djing , it appears that they are not in direct competition .
" the two products are aimed at different areas of the market for different djs , it 's going to be both together not one or the other , " added mick wilson of dj magazine .

analysts say manufacturers ' emphasis on research and development is paying off . there 's no doubt that this has been a good year for german carmakers , and equally little doubt that that has much to do with china .
volkswagen , porsche , bmw and mercedes have all made their mark on the sprawling asian landmass and notched up sales figures that far outstripped their expectations .
in the first eight months of 2010 , the chinese car market almost doubled in size with german manufacturers securing a 53 percent increase on the sales of its cars .
in an interview in monday 's die welt newspaper , the president of the german association of the automotive industry -lrb- vda -rrb- , matthias wissmann , said that german manufacturers would have produced a total of 5.45 million passenger cars by the end of the year . the lion 's share will have gone to international markets .
bildunterschrift : destined for foreign roads : german cars enjoy a good reputation overseas " over the whole year , we are expecting exports to rise 21 percent , which equates to 4.15 million passenger cars , " wissmann said .
" the strength of the asian market , especially in china , and also the recovery of the us market , have fuelled exports . "
so far this year , chinese consumers have bought 1.3 million german vehicles .
development paid off wissmann cited the decision not to cap but increase development budgets during the crisis as one of the main reasons for the surge in popularity of german cars in asian countries .
he said it had given german manufacturers a technologically competitive edge and enabled them to come up with the right range of cars .
the vda president added that the german domestic market also performed better than had been expected in 2010 .
there had been worries that demand would stagnate following the government 's decision not to extend its car scrapping subsidy scheme , whereby german car owners were paid 2,500 euros -lrb- $ 3,470 -rrb- if they traded in a vehicle that was at least nine years old and purchased a brand new one .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as company profits rise , auto workers want higher pay workers have responded to the flourishing market with calls for wage increases planned for 2011 to be introduced early .
audi and other parts of the volkswagen concern , whose operating profit had trebled by the end of the third quarter to 4.8 billion euros , have already agreed to an increase .
bmw , porsche and daimler have yet to make a decision .

he wants to close them through the introduction of coordinated , pan-european measures . german interior minister thomas de maiziere has called for security precautions on air cargo jets to be stepped up . the best way to do this , he says , is through closer cooperation between security agencies .
" air freight has been relatively under-monitored up to now , " de maiziere told reporters .
" evidently they recognized that and exploited it .
this means changes for the air freight business . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : package bombs got through security at cologne-bonn airport de maiziere plans to discuss the issue at a meeting of european interior ministers later this week .
his goal is to introduce coordinated security procedures on a european level .
de maiziere 's statement followed the discovery over the weekend that a package containing explosives had passed through cologne-bonn airport undetected before being found in england .
the package had been dispatched from yemen and was bound for the united states .
observers say those who planted the explosives likely exploited lax security in the country from where the aircraft began its journey .
" there are some countries in which there are security gaps , " elmar giemulla , who teaches the air transport law at the technical university of berlin , told the german press agency in an interview .
" there are rules , but whether they are properly observed is another matter , " he said .
stricter checks the international civil aviation organization -lrb- icao -rrb- sets standards for its 190 member nations .
when freight is sent from europe , or from the united states , it is either inspected or it has to be packed by a so-called ' known consignor , ' which is regulated by the state .
but elsewhere measures are n't so strictly observed .
" we need to check the reliability and control measures of third states , " de maiziere said on a visit to cologne-bonn airport on monday .
in response to the discovery of the explosives , berlin has stopped all freight and passenger flights from yemen from entering german airspace .
yemen has criticized germany 's decision to ban flights from its airports , saying it needs help to fight terrorism , not punishment .

the photos include streets in the southern german town of oberstaufen , public spaces and soccer stadiums around the country . early on tuesday morning , google unveiled its first street view photographs in germany , honoring the bavarian town of oberstaufen to include " selected streets " where the company had sent its vehicles .
oberstaufen had previously explicitly invited google to their town , and even went so far as to bake the silicon valley company a cake , citing the potential for a boost in tourism .
earlier this year , the company announced it would launch street view in germany 's 20 largest cities , including berlin , hamburg and cologne , by the end of the year .
other specific locations around germany that are also available include a public square surrounded by historical buildings in dresden called the theaterplatz and a number of football stadiums , including munich 's allianz arena .
google said that there had been no reaction from government officials to the launch , despite all the controversy generated by the company 's plans for the last 18 months .
" we have n't heard anything from politicians or -lsb- data protection authorities -rsb- , " said lena wagner , a google germany spokesperson , in an interview with deutsche welle .
after government authorities complained , including consumer affairs minister ilse aigner and foreign affairs minister guido westerwelle , google eventually acquiesced to public pressure , providing an eight-week window , which ended last month , for german citizens to remove themselves from the service .
after the deadline , the california company announced that around 244,000 people had chosen to opt-out of the service , or under three percent of the total number of residents of the 20 selected cities .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bavarian town had previously baked a cake for google some houses are blurred as google promised , the removed houses show up as a blurry , translucent image , such as the house next to the buecher edele bookstore at hugo-von-koenigsegg strasse 13 in oberstaufen .
in an interview last month with deutsche welle , wagner noted that despite their complaints , germans actually like using street view in other countries where it already exists , saying that hundreds of thousands of germans use it every week .
" we also know that germany is the number one country in terms of street view in all countries where we have n't launched street view yet , " she said .
despite the launch of google street view , germany is continuing to investigate possible privacy violations as google admitted that it had captured some " payload data " while scanning open wifi networks during the course of taking photographs for street view .
in late october , the company admitted that it had captured some e-mails and passwords .
those revelations failed to surprise johannes caspar , hamburg 's commissioner for data protection and freedom of information , who is a leading authority in the german google investigation .
" this just confirms what we expected , " he told deutsche welle at the time , adding that the company could yet face fines .

he wants to close them through the introduction of coordinated , pan-european measures . german interior minister thomas de maiziere has called for security precautions on air cargo jets to be stepped up . the best way to do this , he says , is through closer cooperation between security agencies .
" air freight has been relatively under-monitored up to now , " de maiziere told reporters .
" evidently they recognized that and exploited it .
this means changes for the air freight business . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : package bombs got through security at cologne-bonn airport de maiziere plans to discuss the issue at a meeting of european interior ministers later this week .
his goal is to introduce coordinated security procedures on a european level .
de maiziere 's statement followed the discovery over the weekend that a package containing explosives had passed through cologne-bonn airport undetected before being found in england .
the package had been dispatched from yemen and was bound for the united states .
observers say those who planted the explosives likely exploited lax security in the country from where the aircraft began its journey .
" there are some countries in which there are security gaps , " elmar giemulla , who teaches the air transport law at the technical university of berlin , told the german press agency in an interview .
" there are rules , but whether they are properly observed is another matter , " he said .
stricter checks the international civil aviation organization -lrb- icao -rrb- sets standards for its 190 member nations .
when freight is sent from europe , or from the united states , it is either inspected or it has to be packed by a so-called ' known consignor , ' which is regulated by the state .
but elsewhere measures are n't so strictly observed .
" we need to check the reliability and control measures of third states , " de maiziere said on a visit to cologne-bonn airport on monday .
in response to the discovery of the explosives , berlin has stopped all freight and passenger flights from yemen from entering german airspace .
yemen has criticized germany 's decision to ban flights from its airports , saying it needs help to fight terrorism , not punishment .

analysts say manufacturers ' emphasis on research and development is paying off . there 's no doubt that this has been a good year for german carmakers , and equally little doubt that that has much to do with china .
volkswagen , porsche , bmw and mercedes have all made their mark on the sprawling asian landmass and notched up sales figures that far outstripped their expectations .
in the first eight months of 2010 , the chinese car market almost doubled in size with german manufacturers securing a 53 percent increase on the sales of its cars .
in an interview in monday 's die welt newspaper , the president of the german association of the automotive industry -lrb- vda -rrb- , matthias wissmann , said that german manufacturers would have produced a total of 5.45 million passenger cars by the end of the year . the lion 's share will have gone to international markets .
bildunterschrift : destined for foreign roads : german cars enjoy a good reputation overseas " over the whole year , we are expecting exports to rise 21 percent , which equates to 4.15 million passenger cars , " wissmann said .
" the strength of the asian market , especially in china , and also the recovery of the us market , have fuelled exports . "
so far this year , chinese consumers have bought 1.3 million german vehicles .
development paid off wissmann cited the decision not to cap but increase development budgets during the crisis as one of the main reasons for the surge in popularity of german cars in asian countries .
he said it had given german manufacturers a technologically competitive edge and enabled them to come up with the right range of cars .
the vda president added that the german domestic market also performed better than had been expected in 2010 .
there had been worries that demand would stagnate following the government 's decision not to extend its car scrapping subsidy scheme , whereby german car owners were paid 2,500 euros -lrb- $ 3,470 -rrb- if they traded in a vehicle that was at least nine years old and purchased a brand new one .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as company profits rise , auto workers want higher pay workers have responded to the flourishing market with calls for wage increases planned for 2011 to be introduced early .
audi and other parts of the volkswagen concern , whose operating profit had trebled by the end of the third quarter to 4.8 billion euros , have already agreed to an increase .
bmw , porsche and daimler have yet to make a decision .

but critics suggest the idea of troops regularly serving under foreign command could cause problems . david cameron and nicolas sarkozy put pen to paper on two treaties in london .
the agreements will see britain and france jointly testing nuclear warheads , coordinating aircraft carriers so there is always a british or french vessel available for joint operations , and creating a combined expeditionary force training troops to deploy together .
france will also be allowed to use british a400m fuelling aircraft when there is spare capacity and there will be joint work on drones , mine counter-measures and satellite communications .
both men were keen to reject claims the move will diminish british or french sovereignty in any way .
david cameron insisted : bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain and france want to get closer and save money too " this is not , as some have suggested , about weakening or pooling british or french sovereignty .
this is not about a european army .
this is not about sharing our nuclear deterrents .
let me say this plainly : britain and france are , and will always remain , sovereign nations , able to deploy our armed forces independently and in our national interest when we choose to do so . "
david cameron ‘ s defence secretary liam fox has pointed out that it is not unusual for british troops to serve under foreign command - it happens often in nato operations .
the prime minister also said that uk forces are deployed alongside those of its allies on a regular basis , saying that " the vast bulk of our military operations - bosnia , kosovo , afghanistan , amongst others , have been conducted together with our allies . "
he added that such operations were always about defending britain 's national interest , and that they were " about practical , hard-headed co-operation between sovereign countries . "
france and britain have disagreed , even fairly recently , on military intervention - for example , on the invasion of iraq in 2003 .
so president sarkozy and prime minister cameron were sure to point out that a ' political agreement ' would have to be reached for the joint taskforce to be deployed .
sarkozy maintained , however , that france and britain already cooperated on major military operations and would continue to do so .
" if you , my british friends , have to face a major crisis , " said sarkozy , " could you imagine france simply sitting there , its arms crossed , saying that it 's none of our business ? "
' unprecedented and historic ' sarkozy did say , however , that the pacts demonstrated that britain and france were especially close at the moment , and hailed the anglo-french relationship : " this is an unprecedented decision and it shows a level of trust and confidence between our two nations that is unequalled in history . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france and britain , historical enemies , have grown quite close the french president , also aware that some analysts had described the pact as a signal of an overall weakening of combined british and french military power , was quick to dispel that notion . " we consider that the security effort should not in any way be drawn down in an increasingly dangerous world , which is that in which we live . "
the two leaders do both hope , however , that co-operation can lead to savings in costs .
the uk has recently announced cuts in its defense budget as part of its austerity drive and wants greater pooling of resources with france to help it maintain its military might , while bringing down its expense .
' big questions ' britain 's shadow defense secretary jim murphy welcomed the emphasis on greater co-operation in military matters , saying that deepening ties is ' essential ' to modern defense policy among allies .
however , he warned that " interdependence is different from dependence , and binding legal treaties pose some big questions for the government . "
murphy also said the uk could be entering " an era where we are reliant on our allies to fill in the gaps in the government 's defense policy . "
maintaining global might bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france sends its soldiers far and wide , but could stand to save money france and britain 's defense budgets are among the largest in the world .
both countries punch above their weight militarily and do not want to surrender their strategic advantage in this area .
alastair cameron , european security expert at the royal united services institute in london , thinks that is in little danger of happening , despite austerity drives .
" one could clearly be tempted to say that , forced to recognize their diminished stature in the world , these two countries are trying to do more together to avoid being overtaken by others , " he said . but cameron also said the two countries were such significant military contributors to global military operations that it would be hard to see much diminishment of their ambition to play a part on the global strategic scene .
" the military is facing a squeeze , of course , " said cameron , " but there is no doubt that their capacity , even under austerity measures , maintains an edge over a good number or other countries . "

both schalke and werder lost last weekend , but they may have different approaches to european competition . the champions league is meant to separate the men from the boys .
football connoisseurs enjoy pointing out that it is superior in quality to the world cup , and no less an authority than real madrid coach jose mourinho has said it is the best competition in the world .
but then he would , seeing as how he ’ s won it twice .
but in the group stages at least , the gulf between europe 's rich and poor leagues often belies this claim , and germany 's representatives in this season 's champions league seem to be finding europe 's best of the best a lot easier to cope with than unglamorous mid-table sides like nuremberg .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : raul and schalke did n't find hapoel to be much of a challenge bayern munich , last season 's champion 's league finalists , have only just broken into the top half of the table , but they are three from three in their easy european group .
but it is schalke , led by veteran coach felix magath and spear-headed on the pitch by spanish star raul , who are best at showing up what a questionable test the champions league group stages really are .
schalke are second from bottom in the league , having scraped together six points from 10 games - the exact same total they have notched up in their three champions league matches , thanks to routine wins against portugal 's benfica and israel 's hapoel tel aviv .
another win in tel aviv on tuesday and they will be well on their way out of the group .
superficial glory but there are of course many other factors at play .
as magath never tires of pointing out , schalke are struggling with new signings and a new system , and somehow the glamour and much-mooted ' magic ' of europe seems to lift veterans like raul , the champions league ’ s all-time top scorer .
the short-term glory of a much-needed win in europe is a balm for many sorrows .
after raul put two past hapoel a couple of weeks ago , there was much optimistic talk of " transferring " that form to the league , but saturday 's 1-0 home defeat to local rivals leverkusen ended with the players being booed off the pitch , and now schalke face the real prospect of replacing their dead title dreams with a relegation battle .
that is not much fun for internationally experienced stars like manuel neuer , klaas-jan huntelaar and christoph metzelder , and magath sounded pessimistic after the game .
" we have players who are used to playing for the top .
that 's why they ca n't cope with the situation , " newspaper bild quoted magath as saying . " the performance didn ’ t match our current position in the standings .
we have to try to avoid a tight situation at the bottom of the table . "
mid-table struggle for werder bremen , the problem is more subtle .
their league form is not good either , and they also just lost at home , to a solid but average nuremberg .
but their attacking line-up featuring the likes of claudio pizarro , hugo almeida , and marko marin are always good for a few goals , and they have at least consolidated mid-table status .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nuremberg held off bremen and stole an away win in europe , though , they face a scrap .
tuesday sees them host dutch champions fc twente , and the match is pretty much a do-or-die tie for both teams - they are both on two points , behind second-placed tottenham hotspur , who have four .
a defeat would signify pretty much the end of the competition for werder , and a draw does neither team much good .
werder 's frame of mind going into the match is pessimistic .
" the only chance we still have is getting three points , " marin said after saturday 's game .
" but that will be difficult .
the mood in the dressing room is not good . "
team captain torsten frings was livid after the defeat on saturday .
" we 're just being too careless with the situation , " he said , after railing against his team-mates as the final whistle went .
but he does not see the champions league match as a distraction , but a chance .
" it ’ s a good opportunity to take a big step forward , " he said .
the combination of having a fight on their hands , along with the fact that they will have something to prove to the weserstadion faithful , means they may well pull off a win against twente .
werder have more european experience , and home advantage should see them get past the dutch side , whom they held to a 1-1 draw in the netherlands .
for schalke , meanwhile , the champions league needs to be an afterthought .

the up-and-coming talents had been accepted for one of the following areas : camera , scripting , directing , editing , production , production design and sound design .

“ i ’ ve never attended a directing workshop because we don ’ t have anything like this at home , ” said the budding kenyan director jim chuchu .

the rules would force national nuclear authorities to draw up disposal plans to be vetted by the eu . europe 's energy chief said that the eu needed binding rules for the long-term storage of nuclear waste in europe , namely in deep underground bunkers that would be safe from accidents or sabotage .
" we have to make sure that we have the highest safety standards in the world to protect our citizens , " guenther oettinger said on wednesday in brussels .
" safety is indivisible .
if an accident happens in one country , it can have devastating effects also in others . " oettinger said the current situation within the eu , where most nuclear waste is stored in bunkers or warehouses until it cools down , is no longer acceptable .
the eu 's energy body says " deep geological repositories , " or caverns at depths of between 100 and 700 meters underground , are the best places to permanently store spent fuel rods , which can remain dangerous to humans for up to a million years .
the 50,000 cubic meters of waste generated by the eu annually is currently held in temporary above-ground facilities , although lower-grade nuclear waste , which includes such things as equipment from de-commissioned reactors , is permitted below ground .
oettinger is keen to change this because of surface storage facilities ' vulnerability to environmental damage and terrorist attacks . " the vast majority of experts agree that you need to have deep storage , in other words at least 300 meters below the earth 's surface , " he said .
the eu 's executive wants each of its member states to come up with a national plan for long-term storage within four years of new eu legislation .

he did not suggest which of the eu 's 27 member-states might prove suitable for such a facility , but stressed that he would not " tolerate the export of nuclear waste outside the european union . "
and while the idea of one country housing another country 's – or indeed several other countries ' – nuclear waste could itself prove politically tricky , stefan alt says that from a scientific point of view , it makes sense to find the best geological location possible .
" on this issue , security is more important than national boundaries , " he said .
" the alternative would mean that every country tried to locate sites which do n't even exist . "

but with this unique ecosystem threatened by political unrest in the region , a series of projects aims to ensure they stay that way . the landscape around gisenyi in western rwanda , on the border to the democratic republic of the congo , is breathtakingly beautiful .
mount nyiragongo towers majestically over the city , which is contiguous with the city of goma across the border in drc .
but mount nyiragongo is an active volcano , known for its devastating eruptions .
eight years ago , goma was largely destroyed by lava .
time and again , locals here have rebuilt their devastated city in the aftermath of such eruptions , despite risks posed by the still-hot lava and the frequent earth tremors that occur in the wake of the eruption .
they see the volcano as both a blessing and a curse .
located inside the virunga national park north of goma and lake kivu , and just west of the border with rwanda , its fertile land has made it one of the most densely populated regions on the entire continent . it also boasts virgin forests that are home to some unique flora and fauna , as well as the world 's last remaining population of mountain gorillas .
alternatives to illegal logging after the 1994 genocide in rwanda , hundreds of thousands of refugees fled over the border to goma .
today , the city is home to many former victims and perpetrators who are seeking refuge here from rwandan justice .
what they have in common is the fact that they are all trying to " put down roots in an ecosystem that is not their native one , " as johannes kirchgatter from the world wide fund for nature , or wwf , in germany puts it . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nyungwe rainforest is home to rare mountain gorillas the flow of refugees has resulted in a major population increase in the region , which has proved to be a heavy burden on existing fuel-provision structures .
the roughly one million people who live here depend mainly on firewood and wood charcoal for cooking and heating .
much of the logging activity in the virunga national park for the sale of timber and charcoal is controlled by rebel militia groups , which earn an estimated $ 30 million a year .
in order to put a stop to this illegal exploitation of resources by the charcoal mafia , the public needs alternatives that are affordable and sustainable .
outside the protected areas of the national park , the wwf is therefore overseeing a project to establish , maintain and exploit legal plantations for the production of fuel wood .
it also subsidizes the manufacture of energy-efficient ovens that consume 30 percent less fuel than previous ovens used hitherto .
the organization also trains rangers who work to clamp down on illegal loggers .
the project is already proving constructive , and helping to financially weaken the militias by providing the public with an alternative source for their fuel needs .
an important wilderness bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in drc , militias fund their activities with illegal wood trade the funds are partially provided from the international climate initiative , and kirchgatter hopes they can be put to good use across the entire congo basin .
its tropical forests are a haven for elephants , gorillas and other rare wildlife .
according to the wwf , the congo basin home to one-quarter of the world 's tropical forests and a mosaic of ecosystems – rivers , forests , savanna , swamps and flooded forests – which are teeming with life .
these forests regulate local climate and the flow of water , protect and enrich soils , control diseases and safeguard water quality .
reaching all the way to the atlantic coast , they also make up one of the most important wilderness areas left on the planet .
the wwf is planning to join forces with nasa next year to establish the exact size of its surface area using an optical remote sensing technology known as lidar , which can detect subtle topographic features such as river terraces and river channel banks , and measure the land surface elevation beneath the vegetation canopy .
the technology will allow researchers to establish forest density and even the precise amount of chlorophyll contained in different tree species .
with data provided by lidar , researchers will also be able to divide the congo basin into zones , isolating which areas are made up of primary forest and are therefore most in need of protection , and which areas could best be exploited by local populations .
the ultimate goal is to identify 15 percent of the congo basin as a protected area and thereby help preserve the habitats of species such as forest elephants , bonobo apes and various types of rare flora .
another project , run by the world resources institute , is putting the systems in place to implement effective strategies to reduce emissions from deforestation and forest degradation -lrb- known as redd . -rrb-
it is spearheading an innovative new project aimed at quantifying degradation and the greenhouse gas emissions in the forests of the republic of congo , and developing new methods to measure and monitor forest degradation .
the region will also be able to earn carbon credits by engaging in green carbon sequestering activities .
ideally , redd could deliver millions of dollars to impoverished communities in the congo basin in carbon credits , providing a powerful incentive to protect this land of great value to the planet .
but given that drc is one of the most corrupt nations in the world , negotiations are far from straightforward .
prioritizing needs of people and nature bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : preserving natural habitats in the congo basin is of global benefit nonetheless , johannes kirchgatter can already point to some successes , such as wwf programs in the lac tumba region in the western congo basin , some 1500 kilometers away from the virunga national park .
the region harbors a rich assemblage of terrestrial and aquatic biodiversity , and is an important provider of vital ecosystem services , including carbon sequestration , freshwater supplies , flood mitigation , and non-timber products for both subsistence and commercial use .
in wwf projects , locals are taught about land use planning ; protected area management and species conservation ; community-based natural resource management ; and livelihood improvement . the wwf hopes that 14,000 square kilometers of local forest can be preserved as a protected area and a further 65,000 square kilometers farmed sustainably .
given that the population is set to double in the next two decades , such measures are crucial .
but these valuable ecosystems will only survive if environmental priorities can be reconciled with the needs of local populations .

but with this unique ecosystem threatened by political unrest in the region , a series of projects aims to ensure they stay that way . the landscape around gisenyi in western rwanda , on the border to the democratic republic of the congo , is breathtakingly beautiful .
mount nyiragongo towers majestically over the city , which is contiguous with the city of goma across the border in drc .
but mount nyiragongo is an active volcano , known for its devastating eruptions .
eight years ago , goma was largely destroyed by lava .
time and again , locals here have rebuilt their devastated city in the aftermath of such eruptions , despite risks posed by the still-hot lava and the frequent earth tremors that occur in the wake of the eruption .
they see the volcano as both a blessing and a curse .
located inside the virunga national park north of goma and lake kivu , and just west of the border with rwanda , its fertile land has made it one of the most densely populated regions on the entire continent . it also boasts virgin forests that are home to some unique flora and fauna , as well as the world 's last remaining population of mountain gorillas .
alternatives to illegal logging after the 1994 genocide in rwanda , hundreds of thousands of refugees fled over the border to goma .
today , the city is home to many former victims and perpetrators who are seeking refuge here from rwandan justice .
what they have in common is the fact that they are all trying to " put down roots in an ecosystem that is not their native one , " as johannes kirchgatter from the world wide fund for nature , or wwf , in germany puts it . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nyungwe rainforest is home to rare mountain gorillas the flow of refugees has resulted in a major population increase in the region , which has proved to be a heavy burden on existing fuel-provision structures .
the roughly one million people who live here depend mainly on firewood and wood charcoal for cooking and heating .
much of the logging activity in the virunga national park for the sale of timber and charcoal is controlled by rebel militia groups , which earn an estimated $ 30 million a year .
in order to put a stop to this illegal exploitation of resources by the charcoal mafia , the public needs alternatives that are affordable and sustainable .
outside the protected areas of the national park , the wwf is therefore overseeing a project to establish , maintain and exploit legal plantations for the production of fuel wood .
it also subsidizes the manufacture of energy-efficient ovens that consume 30 percent less fuel than previous ovens used hitherto .
the organization also trains rangers who work to clamp down on illegal loggers .
the project is already proving constructive , and helping to financially weaken the militias by providing the public with an alternative source for their fuel needs .
an important wilderness bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in drc , militias fund their activities with illegal wood trade the funds are partially provided from the international climate initiative , and kirchgatter hopes they can be put to good use across the entire congo basin .
its tropical forests are a haven for elephants , gorillas and other rare wildlife .
according to the wwf , the congo basin home to one-quarter of the world 's tropical forests and a mosaic of ecosystems – rivers , forests , savanna , swamps and flooded forests – which are teeming with life .
these forests regulate local climate and the flow of water , protect and enrich soils , control diseases and safeguard water quality .
reaching all the way to the atlantic coast , they also make up one of the most important wilderness areas left on the planet .
the wwf is planning to join forces with nasa next year to establish the exact size of its surface area using an optical remote sensing technology known as lidar , which can detect subtle topographic features such as river terraces and river channel banks , and measure the land surface elevation beneath the vegetation canopy .
the technology will allow researchers to establish forest density and even the precise amount of chlorophyll contained in different tree species .
with data provided by lidar , researchers will also be able to divide the congo basin into zones , isolating which areas are made up of primary forest and are therefore most in need of protection , and which areas could best be exploited by local populations .
the ultimate goal is to identify 15 percent of the congo basin as a protected area and thereby help preserve the habitats of species such as forest elephants , bonobo apes and various types of rare flora .
another project , run by the world resources institute , is putting the systems in place to implement effective strategies to reduce emissions from deforestation and forest degradation -lrb- known as redd . -rrb-
it is spearheading an innovative new project aimed at quantifying degradation and the greenhouse gas emissions in the forests of the republic of congo , and developing new methods to measure and monitor forest degradation .
the region will also be able to earn carbon credits by engaging in green carbon sequestering activities .
ideally , redd could deliver millions of dollars to impoverished communities in the congo basin in carbon credits , providing a powerful incentive to protect this land of great value to the planet .
but given that drc is one of the most corrupt nations in the world , negotiations are far from straightforward .
prioritizing needs of people and nature bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : preserving natural habitats in the congo basin is of global benefit nonetheless , johannes kirchgatter can already point to some successes , such as wwf programs in the lac tumba region in the western congo basin , some 1500 kilometers away from the virunga national park .
the region harbors a rich assemblage of terrestrial and aquatic biodiversity , and is an important provider of vital ecosystem services , including carbon sequestration , freshwater supplies , flood mitigation , and non-timber products for both subsistence and commercial use .
in wwf projects , locals are taught about land use planning ; protected area management and species conservation ; community-based natural resource management ; and livelihood improvement . the wwf hopes that 14,000 square kilometers of local forest can be preserved as a protected area and a further 65,000 square kilometers farmed sustainably .
given that the population is set to double in the next two decades , such measures are crucial .
but these valuable ecosystems will only survive if environmental priorities can be reconciled with the needs of local populations .

but in the group stages at least , the gulf between europe 's rich and poor leagues often belies this claim , and germany 's representatives in this season 's champions league seem to be finding europe 's best of the best a lot easier to cope with than unglamorous mid-table sides like nuremberg .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : raul and schalke did n't find hapoel to be much of a challenge bayern munich , last season 's champion 's league finalists , have only just broken into the top half of the table , but they are three from three in their easy european group .
but it is schalke , led by veteran coach felix magath and spear-headed on the pitch by spanish star raul , who are best at showing up what a questionable test the champions league group stages really are .
schalke are second from bottom in the league , having scraped together six points from 10 games - the exact same total they have notched up in their three champions league matches , thanks to routine wins against portugal 's benfica and israel 's hapoel tel aviv .
another win in tel aviv on tuesday and they will be well on their way out of the group .
superficial glory but there are of course many other factors at play .

the short-term glory of a much-needed win in europe is a balm for many sorrows .
after raul put two past hapoel a couple of weeks ago , there was much optimistic talk of " transferring " that form to the league , but saturday 's 1-0 home defeat to local rivals leverkusen ended with the players being booed off the pitch , and now schalke face the real prospect of replacing their dead title dreams with a relegation battle .
that is not much fun for internationally experienced stars like manuel neuer , klaas-jan huntelaar and christoph metzelder , and magath sounded pessimistic after the game .
" we have players who are used to playing for the top .
that 's why they ca n't cope with the situation , " newspaper bild quoted magath as saying . " the performance didn ’ t match our current position in the standings .
we have to try to avoid a tight situation at the bottom of the table . "
mid-table struggle for werder bremen , the problem is more subtle .
their league form is not good either , and they also just lost at home , to a solid but average nuremberg .
but their attacking line-up featuring the likes of claudio pizarro , hugo almeida , and marko marin are always good for a few goals , and they have at least consolidated mid-table status .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nuremberg held off bremen and stole an away win in europe , though , they face a scrap .
tuesday sees them host dutch champions fc twente , and the match is pretty much a do-or-die tie for both teams - they are both on two points , behind second-placed tottenham hotspur , who have four .
a defeat would signify pretty much the end of the competition for werder , and a draw does neither team much good .
werder 's frame of mind going into the match is pessimistic .
" the only chance we still have is getting three points , " marin said after saturday 's game .
" but that will be difficult .
the mood in the dressing room is not good . "
team captain torsten frings was livid after the defeat on saturday .
" we 're just being too careless with the situation , " he said , after railing against his team-mates as the final whistle went .
but he does not see the champions league match as a distraction , but a chance .
" it ’ s a good opportunity to take a big step forward , " he said .
the combination of having a fight on their hands , along with the fact that they will have something to prove to the weserstadion faithful , means they may well pull off a win against twente .
werder have more european experience , and home advantage should see them get past the dutch side , whom they held to a 1-1 draw in the netherlands .
for schalke , meanwhile , the champions league needs to be an afterthought .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de terrorism -pipe- 02.11.2010 europe not the primary target for yemen-based terrorists , say experts großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us remains the main target for terrorists in yemen the recent discovery of two printer cartridges loaded with explosives aboard two us-bound cargo flights has once again turned the world 's attention to the potential international terror threat emanating from yemen . the bombs , which were traced to the impoverished country on the arabian peninsula after being found at airports in britain and dubai , were described by us security experts as showing a higher degree of professionalism and sophistication than any devices previously linked to yemen 's al-qaeda wing - al-qaeda in the arabian peninsula -lrb- aqap -rrb- .
experts who investigated the failed bombing of a us-bound plane in december 2009 , an attempted attack later claimed by aqap , said that if the toner bombs had been constructed by yemeni al-qaeda operatives then the group had achieved a level of expertise previously unseen .
" if al-qaeda indeed made them , " former cia agent robert baer told the washington times , " then they 've teamed up with true professionals . "
the sophistication of the bombs helped them to pass undetected through explosives scanners at hubs such as britain 's east midlands airport and cologne-bonn , a fact that prompted the german government - along with britain , france , canada and the united states - to ban airfreight from yemen and extend the restrictions to include passenger flights originating there .
terrorism experts initially suggested that the cargo planes were targeted for explosion over densely populated cities but when it was revealed that the bombs made the first part of the journey on commercial tourism flights , some experts were then forced to revise their theories to include a potential strike against airborne passengers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sophistication of the bombs have surprised experts despite foiling the bomb plots before any lives were lost , us intelligence agencies are concerned that yemen-based terrorist groups are becoming increasingly advanced in their planning .
they are quickly learning not to underestimate the threat coming out of yemen 's impoverished , tribal landscape and are reviewing their risk assessment of the group 's potential international reach .
given the sophistication of the devices , their route through germany and the discovery of one of the bombs at britain 's east midlands airport , the nightmare scenario of aqap extending its reach to europe has put the continent 's anti-terror authorities on alert .
however , jeremy binnie , terrorism and insurgency editor at jane 's defense , believes that aqap has had the opportunity to attack european targets but has so far maintained its focus on the united states .
aqap had opportunity to hit europe but did n't , say experts " the data points we have suggest that the us remains aqap 's primary target , " binnie told deutsche welle .
" they could have blown up the toner bombs anywhere over europe but chose not to which suggests their final destination would have been the united states with detonation taking place over a densely-populated area to maximise casualties .
as with the christmas day attempt last year , the bomb travelled through europe destined for chicago but again , the bomb was not detonated in europe suggesting the target was clearly the us . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aqap boss nasser al-wahaishi leads the yemen franchise " aqap are very ambitious , " he added .
" they want to hit the ' head of the snake ' as osama bin laden calls the us , not washington 's partners .
attacking the us is al-qaeda 's primary objective as it creates the maximum amount of coverage , increases international pressure on governments like yemen 's to confront islamist militants and in turn destabilizes these countries , making them even more vulnerable to al-qaeda 's influence . "
henry wilkinson , the associate director of janusian security risk management , agreed that the us was more likely to be a target for aqap but that europe 's association with the us also put it at a certain amount of risk .
" i do n't think europe is any higher a priority target than the united states , " he told deutsche welle .
" aqap has made threats against all the western powers it argues are causing harm to muslims - by gift of military deployments in afghanistan or iraq , support for israel , or perceived offences against islam such as banning the veil .
i suspect the united states is the most sought after target , but europe seems to be the focus of more plots - i suspect because it is a softer target by gift of border security and a greater preponderance of local sympathisers . "
european nations equally at risk should aqap switch focus when asked if the discovery of a toner bomb in britain or the fact that it passed through germany on its route suggested either country was under specific threat , wilkinson disagreed .
" i do n't think there is any merit in suggesting any one country is at particular risk , " he said .
" aqap has threatened many countries and may have been involved in the kidnap and murder of several german nationals in northern yemen in 2009 .
in this respect , i think germany as a leading european country is as much at risk as france , the uk , or any other prominent european nation . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bombs could have gone off in cologne or britain - but did n't " if aqap or any other groups were intent on mounting an attack in europe , they would take into account operational viability and target opportunity , as well as political significance of attacking the country .

experts who investigated the failed bombing of a us-bound plane in december 2009 , an attempted attack later claimed by aqap , said that if the toner bombs had been constructed by yemeni al-qaeda operatives then the group had achieved a level of expertise previously unseen .
" if al-qaeda indeed made them , " former cia agent robert baer told the washington times , " then they 've teamed up with true professionals . "
the sophistication of the bombs helped them to pass undetected through explosives scanners at hubs such as britain 's east midlands airport and cologne-bonn , a fact that prompted the german government - along with britain , france , canada and the united states - to ban airfreight from yemen and extend the restrictions to include passenger flights originating there .
terrorism experts initially suggested that the cargo planes were targeted for explosion over densely populated cities but when it was revealed that the bombs made the first part of the journey on commercial tourism flights , some experts were then forced to revise their theories to include a potential strike against airborne passengers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sophistication of the bombs have surprised experts despite foiling the bomb plots before any lives were lost , us intelligence agencies are concerned that yemen-based terrorist groups are becoming increasingly advanced in their planning .
they are quickly learning not to underestimate the threat coming out of yemen 's impoverished , tribal landscape and are reviewing their risk assessment of the group 's potential international reach .
given the sophistication of the devices , their route through germany and the discovery of one of the bombs at britain 's east midlands airport , the nightmare scenario of aqap extending its reach to europe has put the continent 's anti-terror authorities on alert .
however , jeremy binnie , terrorism and insurgency editor at jane 's defense , believes that aqap has had the opportunity to attack european targets but has so far maintained its focus on the united states .
aqap had opportunity to hit europe but did n't , say experts " the data points we have suggest that the us remains aqap 's primary target , " binnie told deutsche welle .
" they could have blown up the toner bombs anywhere over europe but chose not to which suggests their final destination would have been the united states with detonation taking place over a densely-populated area to maximise casualties .
as with the christmas day attempt last year , the bomb travelled through europe destined for chicago but again , the bomb was not detonated in europe suggesting the target was clearly the us . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aqap boss nasser al-wahaishi leads the yemen franchise " aqap are very ambitious , " he added .
" they want to hit the ' head of the snake ' as osama bin laden calls the us , not washington 's partners .
attacking the us is al-qaeda 's primary objective as it creates the maximum amount of coverage , increases international pressure on governments like yemen 's to confront islamist militants and in turn destabilizes these countries , making them even more vulnerable to al-qaeda 's influence . "
henry wilkinson , the associate director of janusian security risk management , agreed that the us was more likely to be a target for aqap but that europe 's association with the us also put it at a certain amount of risk .
" i do n't think europe is any higher a priority target than the united states , " he told deutsche welle .
" aqap has made threats against all the western powers it argues are causing harm to muslims - by gift of military deployments in afghanistan or iraq , support for israel , or perceived offences against islam such as banning the veil .
i suspect the united states is the most sought after target , but europe seems to be the focus of more plots - i suspect because it is a softer target by gift of border security and a greater preponderance of local sympathisers . "
european nations equally at risk should aqap switch focus when asked if the discovery of a toner bomb in britain or the fact that it passed through germany on its route suggested either country was under specific threat , wilkinson disagreed .
" i do n't think there is any merit in suggesting any one country is at particular risk , " he said .
" aqap has threatened many countries and may have been involved in the kidnap and murder of several german nationals in northern yemen in 2009 .
in this respect , i think germany as a leading european country is as much at risk as france , the uk , or any other prominent european nation . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bombs could have gone off in cologne or britain - but did n't " if aqap or any other groups were intent on mounting an attack in europe , they would take into account operational viability and target opportunity , as well as political significance of attacking the country . "
while the high-profile cases coming out of yemen have certainly turned the world 's attention toward its situation , most experts consider other countries as regions more deserving of concern in relation to european security .
" we have not seen much evidence that aqap has the capability to mount long-lead , multi-cell operations in europe , and its record of attempting such operations have mostly focused on saudi arabia , " wilkinson said .

however , in clubs and on dance floors , digital formats are changing the nature of djing in major ways .
in recent weeks , two berlin companies , native instruments and ableton , which both have a long history in the emerging digital djing market , have released new products that industry experts say are enhancing djs performance capabilities .
" ableton and native -lrb- instruments -rrb- seem to be two of the major players in this area at the moment , they keep development with djs in mind and keep the products coming fresh , " said mick wilson , the technology editor of dj magazine , in an interview with deutsche welle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the traktor kontrol s4 was released on monday native instrument 's traktor kontrol s4 was released on monday , and is an all-in-one approach to djing , allowing digital files to be performed and manipulated using a usb controller .
designed for portability , the controller allows for four different tracks to be loaded , sampled and mixed simultaneously .
similarly , ableton , in conjunction with the new zealand-based company serato , released its new software product , on september 22 .
" the bridge " integrates ableton live software , which allows djs to compose pieces , assemble tracks and play complete songs , with serato 's digital vinyl playback software .
this allows djs to manipulate all of these parts using specially produced vinyl records or cds .
both products are now making it easier for turntablists to hone their craft using entirely digital means .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ableton 's ceo called his company 's new product a " whole new level of excitement " berlin companies head in different directions while both ableton and native instruments claim to be innovators in the field of digital djing , they have chosen different directions to pursue .
" actually , this is just another piece to the puzzle of digital djing , but it 's the most outstanding piece because it 's the world 's first all-in-one computer based dj system , " said daniel haver , native instruments ' chief executive , in an interview with deutsche welle .
he added that native instruments ' " traktor kontrol s4 " also makes it far easier for djs to cut and loop segments of tracks , to essentially remix ‘ on the fly . '
" i can easily set a loop , shorten the loop , apply and effect and then drop it again , " explained constantin koehncke , a native instruments dj , as he demonstrated the product .
across town at ableton , the direction is integration but of a different kind .
" i think the bridge brings a whole new level of excitement to traditional djing , to be able to program your drum machines live , tweak you synthesizers live , that 's exciting , " said jeff milligan , of ableton .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bridge was released on september 22 competitors , but in different markets while both products have been in development for many years , taking many years in development , there should be no surprise that the two cross town rivals are keen to generate excitement about their products .
however , because both take different approaches to digital djing , it appears that they are not in direct competition .
" the two products are aimed at different areas of the market for different djs , it 's going to be both together not one or the other , " added mick wilson of dj magazine .
" i like them both , i like the idea of traktor and the new s4 controller looks really tasty as well .
i -lrb- also -rrb- like the idea of ' the bridge ' with ableton where you can play with an old school mentality but still incorporate modern production and remix capabilities . "

police spokesman athanassios kokalakis said an individual on a motorbike threw an explosive device into the swiss embassy courtyard in athens .
the object detonated with a " deafening blast " but no injuries were reported .
another bomb exploded at the russian embassy without injury .
earlier , a suspicious package was discovered at the bulgarian embassy , which was then cordoned off for a bomb squad to destroy the suspect package with a controlled blast .
one package addressed to the chilean embassy was detonated by police in a mail delivery van outside parliament in athens , while one addressed to the german embassy was discovered at the office of a courier company .
the blasts come a day after police foiled a parcel-bombing campaign in the city on monday .
authorities intercepted and defused several other packages with explosive material inside that were addressed to other embassies .
one bomb exploded at a delivery service , leaving a worker hospitalized with burns .
that bomb was addressed to the mexican embassy , according to greek officials .

each year , frankfurt 's architecture museum honors a building with the prestigious award that includes 50,000 euros -lrb- $ 69,000 -rrb- for the edifice 's owner and a statue for its architect .

the finalists include the aqua tower in chicago -lrb- usa -rrb- , the shanghai world finance center -lrb- china -rrb- and the burj khalifa tower in dubai .

a space commemorating the events of november 9 , 1989 will be presented to the public this year along a section of the wall that still stands .

synagogues were destroyed , while jewish citizens were murdered or sent to concentration camps .

the main thing is to party , drink , dance and be crazy .
after the one-day opening festival , the party mostly vanishes from public view until the new year begins .
after all , the storefronts and city squares are bedecked with holiday decorations and attractions until then .

deutsche welle has compiled a list of this month 's highlights . international highrise prize 2010 height is a status symbol , especially when it comes to skyscrapers .
company heads like to reserve the top floor for their offices and the most influential firms rise above the cityscape .
for years now , cities have competed for bragging rights when it comes to housing the world 's tallest building .
dubai recently topped its competitors with the burj khalifa tower at 828 meters -lrb- 2,717 feet -rrb- .
but height is n't everything it seems ; at least not for the international highrise award .
each year , frankfurt 's architecture museum honors a building with the prestigious award that includes 50,000 euros -lrb- $ 69,000 -rrb- for the edifice 's owner and a statue for its architect .
in selecting a winner , the jury considers the building technique , aesthetics , the structure 's connection with its surroundings and cost efficiency .
this year 's winning construction will be announced on november 5 .
the finalists include the aqua tower in chicago -lrb- usa -rrb- , the shanghai world finance center -lrb- china -rrb- and the burj khalifa tower in dubai .
the latter houses practically an entire city , including a hotel , various apartments and luxury residences , office space and an open air observatory - the world 's highest , needless to mention . bildunterschrift : skyscrapers in chicago , dubai and shanghai are finalists for the 2010 international highrise award momentous date in german history november 9 is bound up with events both wonderful and terrible from modern german history .
for one , the date marks the fall of the berlin wall in 1989 .
a space commemorating the events of november 9 , 1989 will be presented to the public this year along a section of the wall that still stands .
but looking back several decades before that turning point , november 9 was also the date of an infamous episode during the nazi era : the kristallnacht or night of broken glass .
in the night from november 8-9,1938 , nazis burned jewish institutions throughout the country .
synagogues were destroyed , while jewish citizens were murdered or sent to concentration camps .
now , the jewish community in germany marks this dark chapter in the country 's history each year with events like tours through synagogues or a silent march through the city , planned this year by school children in berlin . the " fantastic four " hit the road they brought hip hop to germany and their fans still love them for it : the band " die fantastischen vier " -lrb- " the fantastic four " -rrb- .
their songs have been staples in the german music charts for more than 20 years now .
when they got their start , hip hop was almost exclusively performed in english , but the school friends smudo , and .

and their fans are ready and waiting - not just for the songs on their new album -lrb- titled " fuer dich immer noch fanta sie " in german -rrb- but also for the group 's new stage concept .
the band will perform on a round stage in each arena , surrounded on all sides by concert-goers . bildunterschrift : still fantastic after 20 years : die fantastischen vier carnival begins spring , summer , fall and winter - those are the four official seasons in germany .
but in some parts of the country , there 's at least one more .
in the rhineland in western germany , the carnival season begins on november 11 -lrb- that is , 11/11 -rrb- at 11:11 a.m.
there are any number of theories about why the number 11 plays such a big role in the festivities but the rhineland revelers do n't worry too much about them .
the main thing is to party , drink , dance and be crazy .
after the one-day opening festival , the party mostly vanishes from public view until the new year begins .
after all , the storefronts and city squares are bedecked with holiday decorations and attractions until then .
but once january hits , the carnival clowns and streamers will be out in full force .
behind the scenes , carnival associations prepare all year round for the event and some loyal fans who have left behind the chill of a german november even listen to carnival music on the beach . bildunterschrift : 11:11 on 11/11 can only mean one thing : the start of carnival in the rhineland in memory of a great musician during mid-month in berlin , though , things will be a bit more civilized as musicians from across the world meet to take part in the " grand prix emanuel feuermann " cello contest .
the event is named after a renowned 20th-century cellist who taught at the academy of music arts in berlin before being forced out of his position in 1933 for being jewish .
he died in 1942 in new york .
the first contest was organized in 2002 by berlin 's university of the arts and is held every four years to honor feuermann .
during the first session of the contest , feuermann 's youngest sister , then in her mid 90s , was a guest , despite having planned never to return to germany again after fleeing during the nazi period .
this year 's participants will also travel in from all over the world , including competitors from china , russia , canada , korea , france , england , germany and the czech republic .
the winner receives not just a prize of 15,000 euros but also support for a cd production and concert appearances and tours . bildunterschrift : young talents from across the world will take the stage at the grand prix emanuel feuermann ruhr 2010 : trash scavengers from istanbul on stage rimini-protokoll are three young men from berlin that present theater works - but not with actors .
instead , they use people they meet on the street - for instance , four trash scavengers from istanbul .
director daniel wetzel met them around a year ago when he was in the turkish capital looking for ideas .
he saw scavengers everywhere in the city : kurdish men and roma from villages in anatolia , who scrounge around for metal , plastic , tin and anything else that 's valuable from morning until night .
after talking to some of them , the result was " herr dagacar und die goldene tektonik des muells " -lrb- " mr. dagacar and the golden tectonics of trash " -rrb- .
the theater piece premiered in istanbul on october 15 and its german premiere will take place on november 26 as part of the ruhr region 's year as a european capital of culture .
the four men on stage talk about their lives , villages , families - and their survival strategies .
the entire show is in turkish and kurdish , but for those who do n't understand the language , there 's a screen above the stage displaying subtitles .
it 's an unusual format but one that 's already meant success for the young theater makers . bildunterschrift : searching for valuable : four scavengers from istanbul take the stage in the ruhr valley christmas market season opens by the end of november , it 's already christmas time in germany .
cookies and chocolate santas have already been in the stores since september .
but the end of the month marks the official opening for many of germany 's christmas markets , including the most famous market in nuremberg on november 26 .
there , guests will be greeted personally by a figure known in german as the christkind : a woman with long blond locks wearing a golden crown .
she hands out treats , accepts wish lists and reads to children.young women in nuremberg between 16 and 19 years old can apply to fill the role each year .
around two million guests visit the market every year and many travel all the way from the us or japan just for the event .

he saw scavengers everywhere in the city : kurdish men and roma from villages in anatolia , who scrounge around for metal , plastic , tin and anything else that 's valuable from morning until night .
after talking to some of them , the result was " herr dagacar und die goldene tektonik des muells " -lrb- " mr. dagacar and the golden tectonics of trash " -rrb- .
the theater piece premiered in istanbul on october 15 and its german premiere will take place on november 26 as part of the ruhr region 's year as a european capital of culture .
the four men on stage talk about their lives , villages , families - and their survival strategies .
the entire show is in turkish and kurdish , but for those who do n't understand the language , there 's a screen above the stage displaying subtitles .
it 's an unusual format but one that 's already meant success for the young theater makers . bildunterschrift : searching for valuable : four scavengers from istanbul take the stage in the ruhr valley christmas market season opens by the end of november , it 's already christmas time in germany .
cookies and chocolate santas have already been in the stores since september .
but the end of the month marks the official opening for many of germany 's christmas markets , including the most famous market in nuremberg on november 26 .

she hands out treats , accepts wish lists and reads to children.young women in nuremberg between 16 and 19 years old can apply to fill the role each year .
around two million guests visit the market every year and many travel all the way from the us or japan just for the event .
these days , the atmosphere is so international that it 's no surprise to hear the sounds of " silent night " sung in japanese wafting from some of the stands . bildunterschrift : the " christkind " opens the festivities each year at nuremberg 's world-famous christmas market author : petra lambeck , anggatira golmer -lrb- gsw -rrb- editor : neale lytollis send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

deutsche welle has compiled a list of this month 's highlights . international highrise prize 2010 height is a status symbol , especially when it comes to skyscrapers .
company heads like to reserve the top floor for their offices and the most influential firms rise above the cityscape .
for years now , cities have competed for bragging rights when it comes to housing the world 's tallest building .
dubai recently topped its competitors with the burj khalifa tower at 828 meters -lrb- 2,717 feet -rrb- .
but height is n't everything it seems ; at least not for the international highrise award .
each year , frankfurt 's architecture museum honors a building with the prestigious award that includes 50,000 euros -lrb- $ 69,000 -rrb- for the edifice 's owner and a statue for its architect .
in selecting a winner , the jury considers the building technique , aesthetics , the structure 's connection with its surroundings and cost efficiency .
this year 's winning construction will be announced on november 5 .
the finalists include the aqua tower in chicago -lrb- usa -rrb- , the shanghai world finance center -lrb- china -rrb- and the burj khalifa tower in dubai .
the latter houses practically an entire city , including a hotel , various apartments and luxury residences , office space and an open air observatory - the world 's highest , needless to mention . bildunterschrift : skyscrapers in chicago , dubai and shanghai are finalists for the 2010 international highrise award momentous date in german history november 9 is bound up with events both wonderful and terrible from modern german history .
for one , the date marks the fall of the berlin wall in 1989 .
a space commemorating the events of november 9 , 1989 will be presented to the public this year along a section of the wall that still stands .
but looking back several decades before that turning point , november 9 was also the date of an infamous episode during the nazi era : the kristallnacht or night of broken glass .
in the night from november 8-9,1938 , nazis burned jewish institutions throughout the country .
synagogues were destroyed , while jewish citizens were murdered or sent to concentration camps .
now , the jewish community in germany marks this dark chapter in the country 's history each year with events like tours through synagogues or a silent march through the city , planned this year by school children in berlin . the " fantastic four " hit the road they brought hip hop to germany and their fans still love them for it : the band " die fantastischen vier " -lrb- " the fantastic four " -rrb- .
their songs have been staples in the german music charts for more than 20 years now .
when they got their start , hip hop was almost exclusively performed in english , but the school friends smudo , and .
ypsilon , michi beck and thomas d wanted to rap in german - with nonsensical lyrics that nevertheless raised some weighty themes .
after a creative break , the band is going back on tour starting november 9 with a total of 16 concerts in germany , austria and switzerland .
and their fans are ready and waiting - not just for the songs on their new album -lrb- titled " fuer dich immer noch fanta sie " in german -rrb- but also for the group 's new stage concept .
the band will perform on a round stage in each arena , surrounded on all sides by concert-goers . bildunterschrift : still fantastic after 20 years : die fantastischen vier carnival begins spring , summer , fall and winter - those are the four official seasons in germany .
but in some parts of the country , there 's at least one more .
in the rhineland in western germany , the carnival season begins on november 11 -lrb- that is , 11/11 -rrb- at 11:11 a.m.
there are any number of theories about why the number 11 plays such a big role in the festivities but the rhineland revelers do n't worry too much about them .
the main thing is to party , drink , dance and be crazy .
after the one-day opening festival , the party mostly vanishes from public view until the new year begins .
after all , the storefronts and city squares are bedecked with holiday decorations and attractions until then .
but once january hits , the carnival clowns and streamers will be out in full force .
behind the scenes , carnival associations prepare all year round for the event and some loyal fans who have left behind the chill of a german november even listen to carnival music on the beach . bildunterschrift : 11:11 on 11/11 can only mean one thing : the start of carnival in the rhineland in memory of a great musician during mid-month in berlin , though , things will be a bit more civilized as musicians from across the world meet to take part in the " grand prix emanuel feuermann " cello contest .
the event is named after a renowned 20th-century cellist who taught at the academy of music arts in berlin before being forced out of his position in 1933 for being jewish .
he died in 1942 in new york .
the first contest was organized in 2002 by berlin 's university of the arts and is held every four years to honor feuermann .
during the first session of the contest , feuermann 's youngest sister , then in her mid 90s , was a guest , despite having planned never to return to germany again after fleeing during the nazi period .
this year 's participants will also travel in from all over the world , including competitors from china , russia , canada , korea , france , england , germany and the czech republic .
the winner receives not just a prize of 15,000 euros but also support for a cd production and concert appearances and tours . bildunterschrift : young talents from across the world will take the stage at the grand prix emanuel feuermann ruhr 2010 : trash scavengers from istanbul on stage rimini-protokoll are three young men from berlin that present theater works - but not with actors .
instead , they use people they meet on the street - for instance , four trash scavengers from istanbul .
director daniel wetzel met them around a year ago when he was in the turkish capital looking for ideas .
he saw scavengers everywhere in the city : kurdish men and roma from villages in anatolia , who scrounge around for metal , plastic , tin and anything else that 's valuable from morning until night .
after talking to some of them , the result was " herr dagacar und die goldene tektonik des muells " -lrb- " mr. dagacar and the golden tectonics of trash " -rrb- .
the theater piece premiered in istanbul on october 15 and its german premiere will take place on november 26 as part of the ruhr region 's year as a european capital of culture .
the four men on stage talk about their lives , villages , families - and their survival strategies .
the entire show is in turkish and kurdish , but for those who do n't understand the language , there 's a screen above the stage displaying subtitles .
it 's an unusual format but one that 's already meant success for the young theater makers . bildunterschrift : searching for valuable : four scavengers from istanbul take the stage in the ruhr valley christmas market season opens by the end of november , it 's already christmas time in germany .
cookies and chocolate santas have already been in the stores since september .
but the end of the month marks the official opening for many of germany 's christmas markets , including the most famous market in nuremberg on november 26 .
there , guests will be greeted personally by a figure known in german as the christkind : a woman with long blond locks wearing a golden crown .
she hands out treats , accepts wish lists and reads to children.young women in nuremberg between 16 and 19 years old can apply to fill the role each year .
around two million guests visit the market every year and many travel all the way from the us or japan just for the event .
these days , the atmosphere is so international that it 's no surprise to hear the sounds of " silent night " sung in japanese wafting from some of the stands . bildunterschrift : the " christkind " opens the festivities each year at nuremberg 's world-famous christmas market author : petra lambeck , anggatira golmer -lrb- gsw -rrb- editor : gavin blackburn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in the night from november 8-9,1938 , nazis burned jewish institutions throughout the country .
synagogues were destroyed , while jewish citizens were murdered or sent to concentration camps .
now , the jewish community in germany marks this dark chapter in the country 's history each year with events like tours through synagogues or a silent march through the city , planned this year by school children in berlin . the " fantastic four " hit the road they brought hip hop to germany and their fans still love them for it : the band " die fantastischen vier " -lrb- " the fantastic four " -rrb- .

there are any number of theories about why the number 11 plays such a big role in the festivities but the rhineland revelers do n't worry too much about them .
the main thing is to party , drink , dance and be crazy .
after the one-day opening festival , the party mostly vanishes from public view until the new year begins .
after all , the storefronts and city squares are bedecked with holiday decorations and attractions until then .

deutsche welle has compiled a list of this month 's highlights . international highrise prize 2010 height is a status symbol , especially when it comes to skyscrapers .
company heads like to reserve the top floor for their offices and the most influential firms rise above the cityscape .
for years now , cities have competed for bragging rights when it comes to housing the world 's tallest building .
dubai recently topped its competitors with the burj khalifa tower at 828 meters -lrb- 2,717 feet -rrb- .
but height is n't everything it seems ; at least not for the international highrise award .
each year , frankfurt 's architecture museum honors a building with the prestigious award that includes 50,000 euros -lrb- $ 69,000 -rrb- for the edifice 's owner and a statue for its architect .
in selecting a winner , the jury considers the building technique , aesthetics , the structure 's connection with its surroundings and cost efficiency .
this year 's winning construction will be announced on november 5 .
the finalists include the aqua tower in chicago -lrb- usa -rrb- , the shanghai world finance center -lrb- china -rrb- and the burj khalifa tower in dubai .
the latter houses practically an entire city , including a hotel , various apartments and luxury residences , office space and an open air observatory - the world 's highest , needless to mention . bildunterschrift : skyscrapers in chicago , dubai and shanghai are finalists for the 2010 international highrise award momentous date in german history november 9 is bound up with events both wonderful and terrible from modern german history .
for one , the date marks the fall of the berlin wall in 1989 .
a space commemorating the events of november 9 , 1989 will be presented to the public this year along a section of the wall that still stands .
but looking back several decades before that turning point , november 9 was also the date of an infamous episode during the nazi era : the kristallnacht or night of broken glass .
in the night from november 8-9,1938 , nazis burned jewish institutions throughout the country .
synagogues were destroyed , while jewish citizens were murdered or sent to concentration camps .
now , the jewish community in germany marks this dark chapter in the country 's history each year with events like tours through synagogues or a silent march through the city , planned this year by school children in berlin . the " fantastic four " hit the road they brought hip hop to germany and their fans still love them for it : the band " die fantastischen vier " -lrb- " the fantastic four " -rrb- .
their songs have been staples in the german music charts for more than 20 years now .
when they got their start , hip hop was almost exclusively performed in english , but the school friends smudo , and .
ypsilon , michi beck and thomas d wanted to rap in german - with nonsensical lyrics that nevertheless raised some weighty themes .
after a creative break , the band is going back on tour starting november 9 with a total of 16 concerts in germany , austria and switzerland .
and their fans are ready and waiting - not just for the songs on their new album -lrb- titled " fuer dich immer noch fanta sie " in german -rrb- but also for the group 's new stage concept .
the band will perform on a round stage in each arena , surrounded on all sides by concert-goers . bildunterschrift : still fantastic after 20 years : die fantastischen vier carnival begins spring , summer , fall and winter - those are the four official seasons in germany .
but in some parts of the country , there 's at least one more .
in the rhineland in western germany , the carnival season begins on november 11 -lrb- that is , 11/11 -rrb- at 11:11 a.m.
there are any number of theories about why the number 11 plays such a big role in the festivities but the rhineland revelers do n't worry too much about them .
the main thing is to party , drink , dance and be crazy .
after the one-day opening festival , the party mostly vanishes from public view until the new year begins .
after all , the storefronts and city squares are bedecked with holiday decorations and attractions until then .
but once january hits , the carnival clowns and streamers will be out in full force .
behind the scenes , carnival associations prepare all year round for the event and some loyal fans who have left behind the chill of a german november even listen to carnival music on the beach . bildunterschrift : 11:11 on 11/11 can only mean one thing : the start of carnival in the rhineland in memory of a great musician during mid-month in berlin , though , things will be a bit more civilized as musicians from across the world meet to take part in the " grand prix emanuel feuermann " cello contest .
the event is named after a renowned 20th-century cellist who taught at the academy of music arts in berlin before being forced out of his position in 1933 for being jewish .
he died in 1942 in new york .
the first contest was organized in 2002 by berlin 's university of the arts and is held every four years to honor feuermann .
during the first session of the contest , feuermann 's youngest sister , then in her mid 90s , was a guest , despite having planned never to return to germany again after fleeing during the nazi period .
this year 's participants will also travel in from all over the world , including competitors from china , russia , canada , korea , france , england , germany and the czech republic .
the winner receives not just a prize of 15,000 euros but also support for a cd production and concert appearances and tours . bildunterschrift : young talents from across the world will take the stage at the grand prix emanuel feuermann ruhr 2010 : trash scavengers from istanbul on stage rimini-protokoll are three young men from berlin that present theater works - but not with actors .
instead , they use people they meet on the street - for instance , four trash scavengers from istanbul .
director daniel wetzel met them around a year ago when he was in the turkish capital looking for ideas .
he saw scavengers everywhere in the city : kurdish men and roma from villages in anatolia , who scrounge around for metal , plastic , tin and anything else that 's valuable from morning until night .
after talking to some of them , the result was " herr dagacar und die goldene tektonik des muells " -lrb- " mr. dagacar and the golden tectonics of trash " -rrb- .
the theater piece premiered in istanbul on october 15 and its german premiere will take place on november 26 as part of the ruhr region 's year as a european capital of culture .
the four men on stage talk about their lives , villages , families - and their survival strategies .
the entire show is in turkish and kurdish , but for those who do n't understand the language , there 's a screen above the stage displaying subtitles .
it 's an unusual format but one that 's already meant success for the young theater makers . bildunterschrift : searching for valuable : four scavengers from istanbul take the stage in the ruhr valley christmas market season opens by the end of november , it 's already christmas time in germany .
cookies and chocolate santas have already been in the stores since september .
but the end of the month marks the official opening for many of germany 's christmas markets , including the most famous market in nuremberg on november 26 .
there , guests will be greeted personally by a figure known in german as the christkind : a woman with long blond locks wearing a golden crown .
she hands out treats , accepts wish lists and reads to children.young women in nuremberg between 16 and 19 years old can apply to fill the role each year .
around two million guests visit the market every year and many travel all the way from the us or japan just for the event .
these days , the atmosphere is so international that it 's no surprise to hear the sounds of " silent night " sung in japanese wafting from some of the stands . bildunterschrift : the " christkind " opens the festivities each year at nuremberg 's world-famous christmas market author : petra lambeck , anggatira golmer -lrb- gsw -rrb- editor : neale lytollis send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
