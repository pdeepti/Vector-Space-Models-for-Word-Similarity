the circumstances that led to the people 's deaths remained unclear .
people tried to escape the area around the tunnel and may have been trampled to death or fallen from a bridge they scaled to flee the crowd . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : parademics had difficulty getting to the accident site von schmeling said 16 victims who died at the scene were found on a nearby access ramp , indicating they were not killed in the tunnel .
he added that prior to the stampede police had opened a second access ramp to ease crowd pressure around the tunnel .
he also said that police were responsible for regulating the number of people inside the tunnel . sixteen victims have so far been identified , including two spaniards , a bosnian , a dutchman , an australian , an italian and one person from china .
von schmeling said all those who died were between 20 and 40 years of age . it remains unclear exactly how many people were at the love parade , von schmeling said , adding that he could not confirm reports that 1.4 million people were estimated to be in attendance .
he said 105,000 people arrived by train between 9 a.m. and 2 p.m. ' over for the love parade ' love parade organizer rainer schaller said the love parade would never be held again , and that every effort would be taken to find the cause of saturday afternoon 's tragic events . " words are not enough to describe the extent of the shock i feel , " schaller said . duisburg mayor adolf sauerland was similarly rocked by the deadly stampede . " i ca n't dress up my grief with words , " he said .
" this misfortune is so gruesome that it ca n't be described with words . " the head of the duisburg emergency task force , wolfgang rabe , said he has made available all documents pertaining to the incident to the duisburg public prosecutor 's office . he said the love parade venue could accommodate some 300,000 people and was not full when the stampede occurred .
referring to the ongoing investigation , none of the officials at the press conference answered questions as to why the love parade 's main entrance led through a tunnel . cause of the tragedy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : officials did n't stop the party immediately to prevent further panic the blame-game has already begun with the police trade union in the state of north rhine-westphalia , where the incident occurred , throwing the first salvo .
the union has accusing the organizers of the love parade of careless preparation . those who lost their lives were victims " of the material interests of an organizer , " said the police union 's regional chairman , wolfgang orscheschek . witnesses to the stampede also criticized the event 's organizers , with one man describing the proceedings as " organized chaos , " while others reported that there was simply " no way out . " dj dr. motte , a founder of the festival that originated in berlin in 1989 , wrote on his blog that having one single entrance to the festival through a tunnel harbored " catastrophe by itself .

the circumstances that led to the people 's deaths remained unclear .
people tried to escape the area around the tunnel and may have been trampled to death or fallen from a bridge they scaled to flee the crowd . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : parademics had difficulty getting to the accident site von schmeling said 16 victims who died at the scene were found on a nearby access ramp , indicating they were not killed in the tunnel .
he added that prior to the stampede police had opened a second access ramp to ease crowd pressure around the tunnel .
he also said that police were responsible for regulating the number of people inside the tunnel . sixteen victims have so far been identified , including two spaniards , a bosnian , a dutchman , an australian , an italian and one person from china .
von schmeling said all those who died were between 20 and 40 years of age . it remains unclear exactly how many people were at the love parade , von schmeling said , adding that he could not confirm reports that 1.4 million people were estimated to be in attendance .
he said 105,000 people arrived by train between 9 a.m. and 2 p.m. ' over for the love parade ' love parade organizer rainer schaller said the love parade would never be held again , and that every effort would be taken to find the cause of saturday afternoon 's tragic events . " words are not enough to describe the extent of the shock i feel , " schaller said . duisburg mayor adolf sauerland was similarly rocked by the deadly stampede . " i ca n't dress up my grief with words , " he said .
" this misfortune is so gruesome that it ca n't be described with words . " the head of the duisburg emergency task force , wolfgang rabe , said he has made available all documents pertaining to the incident to the duisburg public prosecutor 's office . he said the love parade venue could accommodate some 300,000 people and was not full when the stampede occurred .
referring to the ongoing investigation , none of the officials at the press conference answered questions as to why the love parade 's main entrance led through a tunnel . cause of the tragedy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : officials did n't stop the party immediately to prevent further panic the blame-game has already begun with the police trade union in the state of north rhine-westphalia , where the incident occurred , throwing the first salvo .
the union has accusing the organizers of the love parade of careless preparation . those who lost their lives were victims " of the material interests of an organizer , " said the police union 's regional chairman , wolfgang orscheschek . witnesses to the stampede also criticized the event 's organizers , with one man describing the proceedings as " organized chaos , " while others reported that there was simply " no way out . " dj dr. motte , a founder of the festival that originated in berlin in 1989 , wrote on his blog that having one single entrance to the festival through a tunnel harbored " catastrophe by itself .

however , despite its best efforts , the german league continues to struggle to hang on to big names when wealthier clubs come calling .
once again , check books are being waved in the direction of players who have lit up the bundesliga since arriving in germany , and with some clubs bucking the financial trend of austerity thanks to the deep pockets of benevolent billionaire owners , it looks like the league could lose a few of its shining lights before the new season starts .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : big clubs have been tracking dzeko for the past two seasons unsurprisingly , the name on the top of most lists is that of edin dzeko .
the 24-year-old wolfsburg hotshot has been linked with a move away from the bundesliga since he helped shoot the wolves to title glory almost two years ago .
the bosnian international has long been linked with a move to ac milan but the rossoneri may regret not pouncing sooner because dzeko 's second season as top scorer in the bundesliga has alerted manchester city .
the arab-owned manchester club is swimming through the transfer waters this summer like a ravenous great white and has caught dzeko 's scent - which could mean bad news for milan , chelsea , juventus and anyone else not put off by his 40 million-euro -lrb- $ 51million -rrb- release clause .
the big spending mancunians still remain interested in the man who scored 23 league goals in germany last season despite dzeko favouring a move to italy .
if his preferred club ac milan can find the money - or if manchester suddenly appeals - this may be the season that the bosnian hit-man finally moves on to pastures new .
dortmund bracing for bids on trio of top stars another striker who may be following him out of the bundesliga is lucas barrios .
after enjoying a great season with borussia dortmund and featuring in paraguay 's world cup campaign in south africa , the brazilian-born forward is apparently attracting interest from ac milan , fiorentina , manchester city and napoli .
barrios has four years left on his current contract at bvb but could still move on for a fee of around 10 million euros .
dortmund will be eager to hang on to the striker who helped them finish in their best position in years last season but could be tempted to sell if the price is right .
bildunterschrift : mohamed zidan 's muscular performances for dortmund and egypt have alerted europe 's top clubs dortmund will do well to hang on to another of their best performers this summer , with crafty egyptian striker mohamed zidan in the sights of big names such as manchester united , arsenal and barcelona .
rumours of his unhappiness in dortmund surfaced during last season 's winter transfer window and the 28-year-old has done little to scotch the now deafening chatter that he could be ready to take a step up after two years and 15 goals .
dortmund could be looking at quite a depleted squad should another much sought-after player finally move on after months of speculation .
serbian defender nevan subotic has been touted as a potential replacement for fellow countryman and international defensive partner nemanja vidic , should the current manchester united hard man move to real madrid .
man united have moved to the head of the queue for subotic since vidic made it clear that he fancies a switch to spain but premiership rivals chelsea and arsenal , who have been sniffing around for some time , wo n't give up so easily .
however , bvb 's asking price of 29 million euros for the 21-year-old center-back could prove a stumbling block to any move .
altintop to earn final big pay day with free transfer bildunterschrift : after many years service in the bundesliga , hamit altintop may be on the move to pastures new one player who wo n't cost a cent in transfer fees is hamit altintop .
the versatile turkish midfielder has been a stalwart of the bundesliga with schalke 04 , and more recently bayern munich. but as younger players have come through , altintop has slowly begun his descent through the pecking order at the german champions .
with a wealth of experience and no huge price tag on his head , altintop could be one of the free transfers of the season for a club looking for a wise old head to conduct things from midfield .
in turn , a new challenge may get a few more years service out of a player who has given his all in the bundesliga .
english premiership sides aston villa and tottenham hotspur are said to be interested .

the test criteria , they say , were too weak .
europe now waits to see if the tests will impress investors . despite the positive results of europe 's bank stress tests , analysts and politicians are warning that the banking system is still in dire need of reform .
all but seven of the 91 banks tested in 20 countries passed the test .
investors are expected to focus on the dozen or so banks that just made the cut when markets reopen monday .
many have criticized the tests , published friday by the london-based committee of european banking supervisors , for lacking rigorousness .
german banks ' robust ' ?
although german finance minister wolfgang schaeuble celebrated the test results as a sign that german banks were " robust and resistant , " green party financial spokesman gerhard schick warned that " german banks are and remain unsteady . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics say schaeuble is celebrating too soon meanwhile , the president of the german institute for economic research -lrb- diw -rrb- , klaus zimmermann , expressed fears the positive results may give the " fatal impression " that a full overhaul of the bank system is no longer necessary .
" unlike in the us , the necessary european financial reforms have n't even been fully discussed , let alone finalized or implemented , " zimmermann told the website of financial daily handelsblatt .
' declaring the corpses dead ' analysts also said the exams themselves were not tough enough to bring any good , other than restoring some confidence to investors .
according to daniel gros , head of the centre for european policy studies , europe wasted an opportunity by not pushing harder criteria - and by leaving crisis scenarios out of the tests , such as a real estate crash , the collapse of the raw goods market or total defaults by a eurozone state - as could have occurred in greece earlier this year .
" the stress test declared the corpses as dead , " gros told german news agency dpa in brussels .
" we know a bit more now about where the shaky candidates are .
but the test did n't bring any real insights . "
gros believes the results of the tests will have the intended effect of calming investors ' fears but lamented that " whitewashed " test criteria prevented what could have been an " opportunity to really clean up the banking sector . "
the economist warned that european banks still often had very close ties to each other , meaning that " if a large bank fails , the whole system would be in danger . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe waits to see how the world 's markets will react to the results nervous wait the stress tests were never expected to show massive capital shortfalls , as european banks had already raised about 300 billion euros -lrb- $ 387 billion -rrb- since the financial crisis began , including 170 billion euros of government support to 34 banks .
" with so few banks failing , investors will question whether the economic scenarios -lsb- simulated by the tests -rsb- are sufficiently severe , " said jon peace , analyst at financial group nomura in london .
" it will be natural for investors to consider the margin by which banks passed , " he added , citing a good pass margin for scandinavian and british banks , with greek , spanish and italian banks faring less well .
hypo real estate was the only german financial institution to fail the test .
bundesbank vice president franz-christoph zeitler explained that " in the regulators ' view , no other german bank needs further capital , " maintaining , however that " the markets could see that differently . "
the euro fell late friday just after the publication of test results , but quickly bounced back .

the test criteria , they say , were too weak .
europe now waits to see if the tests will impress investors . despite the positive results of europe 's bank stress tests , analysts and politicians are warning that the banking system is still in dire need of reform .
all but seven of the 91 banks tested in 20 countries passed the test .
investors are expected to focus on the dozen or so banks that just made the cut when markets reopen monday .
many have criticized the tests , published friday by the london-based committee of european banking supervisors , for lacking rigorousness .
german banks ' robust ' ?
although german finance minister wolfgang schaeuble celebrated the test results as a sign that german banks were " robust and resistant , " green party financial spokesman gerhard schick warned that " german banks are and remain unsteady . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics say schaeuble is celebrating too soon meanwhile , the president of the german institute for economic research -lrb- diw -rrb- , klaus zimmermann , expressed fears the positive results may give the " fatal impression " that a full overhaul of the bank system is no longer necessary .
" unlike in the us , the necessary european financial reforms have n't even been fully discussed , let alone finalized or implemented , " zimmermann told the website of financial daily handelsblatt .
' declaring the corpses dead ' analysts also said the exams themselves were not tough enough to bring any good , other than restoring some confidence to investors .
according to daniel gros , head of the centre for european policy studies , europe wasted an opportunity by not pushing harder criteria - and by leaving crisis scenarios out of the tests , such as a real estate crash , the collapse of the raw goods market or total defaults by a eurozone state - as could have occurred in greece earlier this year .
" the stress test declared the corpses as dead , " gros told german news agency dpa in brussels .
" we know a bit more now about where the shaky candidates are .
but the test did n't bring any real insights . "
gros believes the results of the tests will have the intended effect of calming investors ' fears but lamented that " whitewashed " test criteria prevented what could have been an " opportunity to really clean up the banking sector . "
the economist warned that european banks still often had very close ties to each other , meaning that " if a large bank fails , the whole system would be in danger . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe waits to see how the world 's markets will react to the results nervous wait the stress tests were never expected to show massive capital shortfalls , as european banks had already raised about 300 billion euros -lrb- $ 387 billion -rrb- since the financial crisis began , including 170 billion euros of government support to 34 banks .
" with so few banks failing , investors will question whether the economic scenarios -lsb- simulated by the tests -rsb- are sufficiently severe , " said jon peace , analyst at financial group nomura in london .
" it will be natural for investors to consider the margin by which banks passed , " he added , citing a good pass margin for scandinavian and british banks , with greek , spanish and italian banks faring less well .
hypo real estate was the only german financial institution to fail the test .
bundesbank vice president franz-christoph zeitler explained that " in the regulators ' view , no other german bank needs further capital , " maintaining , however that " the markets could see that differently . "
the euro fell late friday just after the publication of test results , but quickly bounced back .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de central asia -pipe- 24.07.2010 osce police mission to kyrgyzstan to focus on ' stability ' großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the violence in southern kyrgyzstan led to many deaths in june , the central asian state of kyrgyzstan broke down in bouts of violence that led to hundreds of deaths .
the osce plans a ' stability ' mission in response to the crisis , a chief osce official told deutsche welle . the organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- plans to send a police mission to troubled kyrgyzstan following violence and instability in the central asian state .
deutsche welle spoke with herbert salber , the head of the osce 's conflict prevention center , about the mission . deutsche welle : what are the criteria for selecting the police being sent as part of the osce mission ? herbert salber : they should be experienced police officers in the police services of osce member countries .
they should speak one of the languages spoken on the ground .
this means , realistically , we should concentrate on russian .
we believe we will find a sufficient number of candidates in member states .
they should also be familiar with the political and cultural conditions in the region .
at the beginning we want to send 52 police officers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police came under attack during the violence which countries will they come from ? many delegations have expressed interest , and we sent out a note to our member states with a request for candidate nominations .
i estimate that we will receive nominations from 10 to 15 , if not 20 , participant countries .
naturally , this will include many from central and eastern europe , and even central asia , because there we have russian speakers . what will be the goal of the mission ? the main goal is to establish stability and reliability in southern kyrgyzstan .
the mission will counsel the kyrgyz police and accompany them in the implementation of their duties .
they will also monitor the kyrgyz police and look closely at how they go about dealing with difficult situations .
we have to assume that trust between the kyrgyz people and law enforcement has been lost in the areas where there was violence in june .
this must be restored .
the efforts of our police will depend on this .
it should be noted that these police will be unarmed , and thus they will not be a police squad , but rather they will be there to counsel , to observe and to report .
the police will report through our office in bishkek and the permanent council of the osce ambassador in order to contribute to stabilization . bildunterschrift : thousands tried to cross the border into uzbekistan some people in southern kyrgyzstan are protesting the osce mission .
why is this ? this is difficult to understand because the president of the country , roza otunbayeva , and relevant members of the kyrgyz leadership have always assured us that such a police mission was wanted and welcome .
i can only imagine that some elements want to obstruct the arrival of the police mission because they have an interest in hiding certain things from the international community .
but i do n't think we should pay too much attention to this .
what is important for us is what the government in bishkek says . will the mission aid the international investigation into the outbursts of violence in june ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the clashes created thousands of refugees we must not get involved with that .
the police mission is primarily there to support the kyrgyz police .
it 's not our mission to comment on an investigation into what happened in june .
the kyrgyz government has developed an idea to have an investigative commission shed light on this topic .
the commission should also possibly be internationally equipped .
this has nothing to do with the police mission , which is concerned with what happens between now and the future , as opposed to the commission , which will examine the past . when will the mission begin ? the mission can begin with initial delegations in the middle of august .
we have established procedures in the osce for how we select the members of our international missions .
we need to adhere to these procedures in order for all candidates to have a fair chance and so osce member states are able to participate in the mission according to their wishes .
if we shorten this process as much as possible then the first police officers can arrive in mid-august . how long should the mission take and where will the police be stationed ? initially four months , but it is possible that the mission could be extended by mutual consent .
the police will be stationed in osh and jalalabad . interview : daniele posdnjakov / dfm editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the big spending mancunians still remain interested in the man who scored 23 league goals in germany last season despite dzeko favouring a move to italy .

after enjoying a great season with borussia dortmund and featuring in paraguay 's world cup campaign in south africa , the brazilian-born forward is apparently attracting interest from ac milan , fiorentina , manchester city and napoli .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : focus : bayreuth festival 2010 black market flourishes at bayreuth festival bayreuth impresario wolfgang wagner dies at 90 music -pipe- 24.07.2010 wagner 's legacy comes to life at 99th bayreuth festival großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : visitors at the festspielhaus the fanfare from the bayreuth festival , opening on july 25 , summons an audience ranging from prominent politicians to die-hard wagnerians .
composer richard wagner 's legacy has magnetic power . apart from political and show business celebrities , the bayreuth festival audience includes many for whom simply being there means that a dream has come true .
christian thielemann , the conductor of the current production of the four-opera cycle " the ring of the nibelung , " told deutsche welle that this enthusiasm is shared by the artists as well . " they are completely focused on these works by wagner , and they sacrifice their summer vacations just for the privilege of being here , " said thielemann , " nobody comes to bayreuth who does n't truly want to . " held this year for the 99th time , the bayreuth festival continues to fascinate and intrigue : it is the high point of the festival summer in germany , the world 's most prestigious opera festival , a mecca for wagnerians , a mega-event . it began with a dream bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : richard wagner : a small man with big ambitions the festival opens with a new production of richard wagner 's romantic opera " lohengrin , " marking the bayreuth debuts of stage director hans neuenfels and conductor andris nelsons .
this season 's line-up also includes recent productions of " parsifal , " " the mastersingers of nuremburg " and the tetralogy " the ring of the nibelung . " " richard wagner writes operas for a theater that does n't exist , " a contemporary of the composer once noted .
rather than bowing to reality , wagner achieved his dream of a festival theater of his own design .
it was to be provisional , yet set standards for the future .
the opposite happened instead : richard wagner 's festspielhaus still stands and remains unique . " i think it was a clever idea for wagner not to place his festspielhaus in munich but in a small town in a beautiful countryside , here in bayreuth , where there are no distractions , " said tankred dorst , the stage director of the current " ring " production in bayreuth .

composer richard wagner 's legacy has magnetic power . apart from political and show business celebrities , the bayreuth festival audience includes many for whom simply being there means that a dream has come true .
christian thielemann , the conductor of the current production of the four-opera cycle " the ring of the nibelung , " told deutsche welle that this enthusiasm is shared by the artists as well . " they are completely focused on these works by wagner , and they sacrifice their summer vacations just for the privilege of being here , " said thielemann , " nobody comes to bayreuth who does n't truly want to . " held this year for the 99th time , the bayreuth festival continues to fascinate and intrigue : it is the high point of the festival summer in germany , the world 's most prestigious opera festival , a mecca for wagnerians , a mega-event . it began with a dream bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : richard wagner : a small man with big ambitions the festival opens with a new production of richard wagner 's romantic opera " lohengrin , " marking the bayreuth debuts of stage director hans neuenfels and conductor andris nelsons .
this season 's line-up also includes recent productions of " parsifal , " " the mastersingers of nuremburg " and the tetralogy " the ring of the nibelung . " " richard wagner writes operas for a theater that does n't exist , " a contemporary of the composer once noted .
rather than bowing to reality , wagner achieved his dream of a festival theater of his own design .
it was to be provisional , yet set standards for the future .
the opposite happened instead : richard wagner 's festspielhaus still stands and remains unique . " i think it was a clever idea for wagner not to place his festspielhaus in munich but in a small town in a beautiful countryside , here in bayreuth , where there are no distractions , " said tankred dorst , the stage director of the current " ring " production in bayreuth .
" you always see people walking around with their nose buried in a libretto . " the magic green hill bayreuth , population 72,000 , is in upper franconia in the state of bavaria , not far from nuremberg .
the festspielhaus is located just outside the city , a short drive up the so-called " green hill . "
that drive is a ritual that has been performed countless times by wagnerians , opera heavyweights and amateur spectators alike . " this ' green hill ' is of course a very special location , and not only for artistic reasons , " said 84-year-old dorst , " it has a mythological dimension itself that belongs to german history - the good , and even more so , the bad parts .

" bildunterschrift : bayreuth 's festspielhaus , pictured in 1897 the composer had died half a century before the nazis came to power in the 1930 's .
festival director winifred wagner was a member of the nazi party and a personal friend of adolf hitler .
since the founding of the bayreuth festival in 1876 , it has been led exclusively by members of the wagner family .
richard was followed by his widow cosima , son siegfried , daughter-in-law winifred , grandsons wieland and wolfgang and now , since 2008 , great-granddaughters eva and katharina . no other festival can boast a comparable dynastic tradition .
" the history of this family itself is almost like a shakespearean drama , " said juergen flimm , stage director of " the ring " from 2000 to 2005 . described by german author thomas mann as " probably the greatest artistic talent in human history , " richard wagner continues to have a polarizing effect on people .
whether the festspielhaus audience applauds or boos does n't necessarily depend on high expectations or performance quality . " people in bayreuth tend to go slightly ballistic , which is very interesting and sometimes rather alarming , " said flimm .
" this is , after all , a theater , and what occurs onstage is strongly subjective .
you might respond by saying , ' that 's different - i do n't like that , ' but not ' that 's wrong ! '
in art , there is no such thing as right or wrong . " man and myth " in his gods , man paints a picture of himself , " observed german author friedrich schiller .
richard wagner understood the meaning of myth as a reflection of human qualities on a meta-level .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : focus : bayreuth festival 2010 black market flourishes at bayreuth festival bayreuth impresario wolfgang wagner dies at 90 music -pipe- 24.07.2010 wagner 's legacy comes to life at 99th bayreuth festival großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : visitors at the festspielhaus the fanfare from the bayreuth festival , opening on july 25 , summons an audience ranging from prominent politicians to die-hard wagnerians .
composer richard wagner 's legacy has magnetic power . apart from political and show business celebrities , the bayreuth festival audience includes many for whom simply being there means that a dream has come true .
christian thielemann , the conductor of the current production of the four-opera cycle " the ring of the nibelung , " told deutsche welle that this enthusiasm is shared by the artists as well . " they are completely focused on these works by wagner , and they sacrifice their summer vacations just for the privilege of being here , " said thielemann , " nobody comes to bayreuth who does n't truly want to . " held this year for the 99th time , the bayreuth festival continues to fascinate and intrigue : it is the high point of the festival summer in germany , the world 's most prestigious opera festival , a mecca for wagnerians , a mega-event . it began with a dream bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : richard wagner : a small man with big ambitions the festival opens with a new production of richard wagner 's romantic opera " lohengrin , " marking the bayreuth debuts of stage director hans neuenfels and conductor andris nelsons .
this season 's line-up also includes recent productions of " parsifal , " " the mastersingers of nuremburg " and the tetralogy " the ring of the nibelung . " " richard wagner writes operas for a theater that does n't exist , " a contemporary of the composer once noted .
rather than bowing to reality , wagner achieved his dream of a festival theater of his own design .
it was to be provisional , yet set standards for the future .
the opposite happened instead : richard wagner 's festspielhaus still stands and remains unique . " i think it was a clever idea for wagner not to place his festspielhaus in munich but in a small town in a beautiful countryside , here in bayreuth , where there are no distractions , " said tankred dorst , the stage director of the current " ring " production in bayreuth .
" you always see people walking around with their nose buried in a libretto . " the magic green hill bayreuth , population 72,000 , is in upper franconia in the state of bavaria , not far from nuremberg .
the festspielhaus is located just outside the city , a short drive up the so-called " green hill . "
that drive is a ritual that has been performed countless times by wagnerians , opera heavyweights and amateur spectators alike . " this ' green hill ' is of course a very special location , and not only for artistic reasons , " said 84-year-old dorst , " it has a mythological dimension itself that belongs to german history - the good , and even more so , the bad parts .
when i drive up the hill to rehearsals in the morning , it reminds me of that time in german history when wagner and his works played a different role , during the nazi regime . " bildunterschrift : bayreuth 's festspielhaus , pictured in 1897 the composer had died half a century before the nazis came to power in the 1930 's .
festival director winifred wagner was a member of the nazi party and a personal friend of adolf hitler .
since the founding of the bayreuth festival in 1876 , it has been led exclusively by members of the wagner family .
richard was followed by his widow cosima , son siegfried , daughter-in-law winifred , grandsons wieland and wolfgang and now , since 2008 , great-granddaughters eva and katharina . no other festival can boast a comparable dynastic tradition .
" the history of this family itself is almost like a shakespearean drama , " said juergen flimm , stage director of " the ring " from 2000 to 2005 . described by german author thomas mann as " probably the greatest artistic talent in human history , " richard wagner continues to have a polarizing effect on people .
whether the festspielhaus audience applauds or boos does n't necessarily depend on high expectations or performance quality . " people in bayreuth tend to go slightly ballistic , which is very interesting and sometimes rather alarming , " said flimm .
" this is , after all , a theater , and what occurs onstage is strongly subjective .
you might respond by saying , ' that 's different - i do n't like that , ' but not ' that 's wrong ! '
in art , there is no such thing as right or wrong . " man and myth " in his gods , man paints a picture of himself , " observed german author friedrich schiller .
richard wagner understood the meaning of myth as a reflection of human qualities on a meta-level .

composer richard wagner 's legacy has magnetic power . apart from political and show business celebrities , the bayreuth festival audience includes many for whom simply being there means that a dream has come true .
christian thielemann , the conductor of the current production of the four-opera cycle " the ring of the nibelung , " told deutsche welle that this enthusiasm is shared by the artists as well . " they are completely focused on these works by wagner , and they sacrifice their summer vacations just for the privilege of being here , " said thielemann , " nobody comes to bayreuth who does n't truly want to . " held this year for the 99th time , the bayreuth festival continues to fascinate and intrigue : it is the high point of the festival summer in germany , the world 's most prestigious opera festival , a mecca for wagnerians , a mega-event . it began with a dream bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : richard wagner : a small man with big ambitions the festival opens with a new production of richard wagner 's romantic opera " lohengrin , " marking the bayreuth debuts of stage director hans neuenfels and conductor andris nelsons .
this season 's line-up also includes recent productions of " parsifal , " " the mastersingers of nuremburg " and the tetralogy " the ring of the nibelung . " " richard wagner writes operas for a theater that does n't exist , " a contemporary of the composer once noted .
rather than bowing to reality , wagner achieved his dream of a festival theater of his own design .
it was to be provisional , yet set standards for the future .
the opposite happened instead : richard wagner 's festspielhaus still stands and remains unique . " i think it was a clever idea for wagner not to place his festspielhaus in munich but in a small town in a beautiful countryside , here in bayreuth , where there are no distractions , " said tankred dorst , the stage director of the current " ring " production in bayreuth .
" you always see people walking around with their nose buried in a libretto . " the magic green hill bayreuth , population 72,000 , is in upper franconia in the state of bavaria , not far from nuremberg .
the festspielhaus is located just outside the city , a short drive up the so-called " green hill . "
that drive is a ritual that has been performed countless times by wagnerians , opera heavyweights and amateur spectators alike . " this ' green hill ' is of course a very special location , and not only for artistic reasons , " said 84-year-old dorst , " it has a mythological dimension itself that belongs to german history - the good , and even more so , the bad parts .
when i drive up the hill to rehearsals in the morning , it reminds me of that time in german history when wagner and his works played a different role , during the nazi regime . " bildunterschrift : bayreuth 's festspielhaus , pictured in 1897 the composer had died half a century before the nazis came to power in the 1930 's .
festival director winifred wagner was a member of the nazi party and a personal friend of adolf hitler .
since the founding of the bayreuth festival in 1876 , it has been led exclusively by members of the wagner family .
richard was followed by his widow cosima , son siegfried , daughter-in-law winifred , grandsons wieland and wolfgang and now , since 2008 , great-granddaughters eva and katharina . no other festival can boast a comparable dynastic tradition .
" the history of this family itself is almost like a shakespearean drama , " said juergen flimm , stage director of " the ring " from 2000 to 2005 . described by german author thomas mann as " probably the greatest artistic talent in human history , " richard wagner continues to have a polarizing effect on people .
whether the festspielhaus audience applauds or boos does n't necessarily depend on high expectations or performance quality . " people in bayreuth tend to go slightly ballistic , which is very interesting and sometimes rather alarming , " said flimm .
" this is , after all , a theater , and what occurs onstage is strongly subjective .
you might respond by saying , ' that 's different - i do n't like that , ' but not ' that 's wrong ! '
in art , there is no such thing as right or wrong . " man and myth " in his gods , man paints a picture of himself , " observed german author friedrich schiller .
richard wagner understood the meaning of myth as a reflection of human qualities on a meta-level .
his sources of inspiration included greek mythology and literature , where the gods are equipped with human weaknesses and failings . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german author and director tankred dorst has also written complex epic dramas in his own stories , wagner lent human attributes to germanic gods like wotan , fricka and loge .

however , despite its best efforts , the german league continues to struggle to hang on to big names when wealthier clubs come calling .
once again , check books are being waved in the direction of players who have lit up the bundesliga since arriving in germany , and with some clubs bucking the financial trend of austerity thanks to the deep pockets of benevolent billionaire owners , it looks like the league could lose a few of its shining lights before the new season starts .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : big clubs have been tracking dzeko for the past two seasons unsurprisingly , the name on the top of most lists is that of edin dzeko .
the 24-year-old wolfsburg hotshot has been linked with a move away from the bundesliga since he helped shoot the wolves to title glory almost two years ago .
the bosnian international has long been linked with a move to ac milan but the rossoneri may regret not pouncing sooner because dzeko 's second season as top scorer in the bundesliga has alerted manchester city .
the arab-owned manchester club is swimming through the transfer waters this summer like a ravenous great white and has caught dzeko 's scent - which could mean bad news for milan , chelsea , juventus and anyone else not put off by his 40 million-euro -lrb- $ 51million -rrb- release clause .
the big spending mancunians still remain interested in the man who scored 23 league goals in germany last season despite dzeko favouring a move to italy .
if his preferred club ac milan can find the money - or if manchester suddenly appeals - this may be the season that the bosnian hit-man finally moves on to pastures new .
dortmund bracing for bids on trio of top stars another striker who may be following him out of the bundesliga is lucas barrios .
after enjoying a great season with borussia dortmund and featuring in paraguay 's world cup campaign in south africa , the brazilian-born forward is apparently attracting interest from ac milan , fiorentina , manchester city and napoli .
barrios has four years left on his current contract at bvb but could still move on for a fee of around 10 million euros .
dortmund will be eager to hang on to the striker who helped them finish in their best position in years last season but could be tempted to sell if the price is right .
bildunterschrift : mohamed zidan 's muscular performances for dortmund and egypt have alerted europe 's top clubs dortmund will do well to hang on to another of their best performers this summer , with crafty egyptian striker mohamed zidan in the sights of big names such as manchester united , arsenal and barcelona .
rumours of his unhappiness in dortmund surfaced during last season 's winter transfer window and the 28-year-old has done little to scotch the now deafening chatter that he could be ready to take a step up after two years and 15 goals .
dortmund could be looking at quite a depleted squad should another much sought-after player finally move on after months of speculation .
serbian defender nevan subotic has been touted as a potential replacement for fellow countryman and international defensive partner nemanja vidic , should the current manchester united hard man move to real madrid .
man united have moved to the head of the queue for subotic since vidic made it clear that he fancies a switch to spain but premiership rivals chelsea and arsenal , who have been sniffing around for some time , wo n't give up so easily .
however , bvb 's asking price of 29 million euros for the 21-year-old center-back could prove a stumbling block to any move .
altintop to earn final big pay day with free transfer bildunterschrift : after many years service in the bundesliga , hamit altintop may be on the move to pastures new one player who wo n't cost a cent in transfer fees is hamit altintop .
the versatile turkish midfielder has been a stalwart of the bundesliga with schalke 04 , and more recently bayern munich. but as younger players have come through , altintop has slowly begun his descent through the pecking order at the german champions .
with a wealth of experience and no huge price tag on his head , altintop could be one of the free transfers of the season for a club looking for a wise old head to conduct things from midfield .
in turn , a new challenge may get a few more years service out of a player who has given his all in the bundesliga .
english premiership sides aston villa and tottenham hotspur are said to be interested .

composer richard wagner 's legacy has magnetic power . apart from political and show business celebrities , the bayreuth festival audience includes many for whom simply being there means that a dream has come true .
christian thielemann , the conductor of the current production of the four-opera cycle " the ring of the nibelung , " told deutsche welle that this enthusiasm is shared by the artists as well . " they are completely focused on these works by wagner , and they sacrifice their summer vacations just for the privilege of being here , " said thielemann , " nobody comes to bayreuth who does n't truly want to . " held this year for the 99th time , the bayreuth festival continues to fascinate and intrigue : it is the high point of the festival summer in germany , the world 's most prestigious opera festival , a mecca for wagnerians , a mega-event . it began with a dream bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : richard wagner : a small man with big ambitions the festival opens with a new production of richard wagner 's romantic opera " lohengrin , " marking the bayreuth debuts of stage director hans neuenfels and conductor andris nelsons .
this season 's line-up also includes recent productions of " parsifal , " " the mastersingers of nuremburg " and the tetralogy " the ring of the nibelung . " " richard wagner writes operas for a theater that does n't exist , " a contemporary of the composer once noted .
rather than bowing to reality , wagner achieved his dream of a festival theater of his own design .
it was to be provisional , yet set standards for the future .
the opposite happened instead : richard wagner 's festspielhaus still stands and remains unique . " i think it was a clever idea for wagner not to place his festspielhaus in munich but in a small town in a beautiful countryside , here in bayreuth , where there are no distractions , " said tankred dorst , the stage director of the current " ring " production in bayreuth .
" you always see people walking around with their nose buried in a libretto . " the magic green hill bayreuth , population 72,000 , is in upper franconia in the state of bavaria , not far from nuremberg .
the festspielhaus is located just outside the city , a short drive up the so-called " green hill . "
that drive is a ritual that has been performed countless times by wagnerians , opera heavyweights and amateur spectators alike . " this ' green hill ' is of course a very special location , and not only for artistic reasons , " said 84-year-old dorst , " it has a mythological dimension itself that belongs to german history - the good , and even more so , the bad parts .
when i drive up the hill to rehearsals in the morning , it reminds me of that time in german history when wagner and his works played a different role , during the nazi regime . " bildunterschrift : bayreuth 's festspielhaus , pictured in 1897 the composer had died half a century before the nazis came to power in the 1930 's .
festival director winifred wagner was a member of the nazi party and a personal friend of adolf hitler .
since the founding of the bayreuth festival in 1876 , it has been led exclusively by members of the wagner family .
richard was followed by his widow cosima , son siegfried , daughter-in-law winifred , grandsons wieland and wolfgang and now , since 2008 , great-granddaughters eva and katharina . no other festival can boast a comparable dynastic tradition .
" the history of this family itself is almost like a shakespearean drama , " said juergen flimm , stage director of " the ring " from 2000 to 2005 . described by german author thomas mann as " probably the greatest artistic talent in human history , " richard wagner continues to have a polarizing effect on people .
whether the festspielhaus audience applauds or boos does n't necessarily depend on high expectations or performance quality . " people in bayreuth tend to go slightly ballistic , which is very interesting and sometimes rather alarming , " said flimm .
" this is , after all , a theater , and what occurs onstage is strongly subjective .
you might respond by saying , ' that 's different - i do n't like that , ' but not ' that 's wrong ! '
in art , there is no such thing as right or wrong . " man and myth " in his gods , man paints a picture of himself , " observed german author friedrich schiller .
richard wagner understood the meaning of myth as a reflection of human qualities on a meta-level .
his sources of inspiration included greek mythology and literature , where the gods are equipped with human weaknesses and failings . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german author and director tankred dorst has also written complex epic dramas in his own stories , wagner lent human attributes to germanic gods like wotan , fricka and loge .

understanding and appreciating them requires repeated exposure to the plot and the music . over time , wagner and his works themselves have become cult .
the opening of the festival to modern mass media in recent years , with public viewing , internet streaming and podcasts from the festspielhaus , has n't reduced public interest in the festival . opening day on july 25 , with the familiar ritual of celebrities , security personnel and spectators , will be followed by 29 additional performances , concluding on august 28 . author : rick fulker editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

composer richard wagner 's legacy has magnetic power . apart from political and show business celebrities , the bayreuth festival audience includes many for whom simply being there means that a dream has come true .
christian thielemann , the conductor of the current production of the four-opera cycle " the ring of the nibelung , " told deutsche welle that this enthusiasm is shared by the artists as well . " they are completely focused on these works by wagner , and they sacrifice their summer vacations just for the privilege of being here , " said thielemann , " nobody comes to bayreuth who does n't truly want to . " held this year for the 99th time , the bayreuth festival continues to fascinate and intrigue : it is the high point of the festival summer in germany , the world 's most prestigious opera festival , a mecca for wagnerians , a mega-event . it began with a dream bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : richard wagner : a small man with big ambitions the festival opens with a new production of richard wagner 's romantic opera " lohengrin , " marking the bayreuth debuts of stage director hans neuenfels and conductor andris nelsons .
this season 's line-up also includes recent productions of " parsifal , " " the mastersingers of nuremburg " and the tetralogy " the ring of the nibelung . " " richard wagner writes operas for a theater that does n't exist , " a contemporary of the composer once noted .
rather than bowing to reality , wagner achieved his dream of a festival theater of his own design .
it was to be provisional , yet set standards for the future .
the opposite happened instead : richard wagner 's festspielhaus still stands and remains unique . " i think it was a clever idea for wagner not to place his festspielhaus in munich but in a small town in a beautiful countryside , here in bayreuth , where there are no distractions , " said tankred dorst , the stage director of the current " ring " production in bayreuth .
" you always see people walking around with their nose buried in a libretto . " the magic green hill bayreuth , population 72,000 , is in upper franconia in the state of bavaria , not far from nuremberg .
the festspielhaus is located just outside the city , a short drive up the so-called " green hill . "
that drive is a ritual that has been performed countless times by wagnerians , opera heavyweights and amateur spectators alike . " this ' green hill ' is of course a very special location , and not only for artistic reasons , " said 84-year-old dorst , " it has a mythological dimension itself that belongs to german history - the good , and even more so , the bad parts .
when i drive up the hill to rehearsals in the morning , it reminds me of that time in german history when wagner and his works played a different role , during the nazi regime . " bildunterschrift : bayreuth 's festspielhaus , pictured in 1897 the composer had died half a century before the nazis came to power in the 1930 's .
festival director winifred wagner was a member of the nazi party and a personal friend of adolf hitler .
since the founding of the bayreuth festival in 1876 , it has been led exclusively by members of the wagner family .
richard was followed by his widow cosima , son siegfried , daughter-in-law winifred , grandsons wieland and wolfgang and now , since 2008 , great-granddaughters eva and katharina . no other festival can boast a comparable dynastic tradition .
" the history of this family itself is almost like a shakespearean drama , " said juergen flimm , stage director of " the ring " from 2000 to 2005 . described by german author thomas mann as " probably the greatest artistic talent in human history , " richard wagner continues to have a polarizing effect on people .
whether the festspielhaus audience applauds or boos does n't necessarily depend on high expectations or performance quality . " people in bayreuth tend to go slightly ballistic , which is very interesting and sometimes rather alarming , " said flimm .
" this is , after all , a theater , and what occurs onstage is strongly subjective .
you might respond by saying , ' that 's different - i do n't like that , ' but not ' that 's wrong ! '
in art , there is no such thing as right or wrong . " man and myth " in his gods , man paints a picture of himself , " observed german author friedrich schiller .
richard wagner understood the meaning of myth as a reflection of human qualities on a meta-level .
his sources of inspiration included greek mythology and literature , where the gods are equipped with human weaknesses and failings . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german author and director tankred dorst has also written complex epic dramas in his own stories , wagner lent human attributes to germanic gods like wotan , fricka and loge .
he made tales and myths of the holy grail comprehensible through character development - adding the sensuous , emotional quality of music . wagner 's music dramas are complex , multi-layered and lengthy .
understanding and appreciating them requires repeated exposure to the plot and the music . over time , wagner and his works themselves have become cult .
the opening of the festival to modern mass media in recent years , with public viewing , internet streaming and podcasts from the festspielhaus , has n't reduced public interest in the festival . opening day on july 25 , with the familiar ritual of celebrities , security personnel and spectators , will be followed by 29 additional performances , concluding on august 28 . author : rick fulker editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de central asia -pipe- 24.07.2010 osce police mission to kyrgyzstan to focus on ' stability ' großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the violence in southern kyrgyzstan led to many deaths in june , the central asian state of kyrgyzstan broke down in bouts of violence that led to hundreds of deaths .
the osce plans a ' stability ' mission in response to the crisis , a chief osce official told deutsche welle . the organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- plans to send a police mission to troubled kyrgyzstan following violence and instability in the central asian state .
deutsche welle spoke with herbert salber , the head of the osce 's conflict prevention center , about the mission . deutsche welle : what are the criteria for selecting the police being sent as part of the osce mission ? herbert salber : they should be experienced police officers in the police services of osce member countries .
they should speak one of the languages spoken on the ground .
this means , realistically , we should concentrate on russian .
we believe we will find a sufficient number of candidates in member states .
they should also be familiar with the political and cultural conditions in the region .
at the beginning we want to send 52 police officers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police came under attack during the violence which countries will they come from ? many delegations have expressed interest , and we sent out a note to our member states with a request for candidate nominations .
i estimate that we will receive nominations from 10 to 15 , if not 20 , participant countries .
naturally , this will include many from central and eastern europe , and even central asia , because there we have russian speakers . what will be the goal of the mission ? the main goal is to establish stability and reliability in southern kyrgyzstan .
the mission will counsel the kyrgyz police and accompany them in the implementation of their duties .
they will also monitor the kyrgyz police and look closely at how they go about dealing with difficult situations .
we have to assume that trust between the kyrgyz people and law enforcement has been lost in the areas where there was violence in june .
this must be restored .
the efforts of our police will depend on this .
it should be noted that these police will be unarmed , and thus they will not be a police squad , but rather they will be there to counsel , to observe and to report .
the police will report through our office in bishkek and the permanent council of the osce ambassador in order to contribute to stabilization . bildunterschrift : thousands tried to cross the border into uzbekistan some people in southern kyrgyzstan are protesting the osce mission .
why is this ? this is difficult to understand because the president of the country , roza otunbayeva , and relevant members of the kyrgyz leadership have always assured us that such a police mission was wanted and welcome .
i can only imagine that some elements want to obstruct the arrival of the police mission because they have an interest in hiding certain things from the international community .
but i do n't think we should pay too much attention to this .
what is important for us is what the government in bishkek says . will the mission aid the international investigation into the outbursts of violence in june ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the clashes created thousands of refugees we must not get involved with that .
the police mission is primarily there to support the kyrgyz police .
it 's not our mission to comment on an investigation into what happened in june .
the kyrgyz government has developed an idea to have an investigative commission shed light on this topic .
the commission should also possibly be internationally equipped .
this has nothing to do with the police mission , which is concerned with what happens between now and the future , as opposed to the commission , which will examine the past . when will the mission begin ? the mission can begin with initial delegations in the middle of august .
we have established procedures in the osce for how we select the members of our international missions .
we need to adhere to these procedures in order for all candidates to have a fair chance and so osce member states are able to participate in the mission according to their wishes .
if we shorten this process as much as possible then the first police officers can arrive in mid-august . how long should the mission take and where will the police be stationed ? initially four months , but it is possible that the mission could be extended by mutual consent .
the police will be stationed in osh and jalalabad . interview : daniele posdnjakov / dfm editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

composer richard wagner 's legacy has magnetic power . apart from political and show business celebrities , the bayreuth festival audience includes many for whom simply being there means that a dream has come true .
christian thielemann , the conductor of the current production of the four-opera cycle " the ring of the nibelung , " told deutsche welle that this enthusiasm is shared by the artists as well . " they are completely focused on these works by wagner , and they sacrifice their summer vacations just for the privilege of being here , " said thielemann , " nobody comes to bayreuth who does n't truly want to . " held this year for the 99th time , the bayreuth festival continues to fascinate and intrigue : it is the high point of the festival summer in germany , the world 's most prestigious opera festival , a mecca for wagnerians , a mega-event . it began with a dream bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : richard wagner : a small man with big ambitions the festival opens with a new production of richard wagner 's romantic opera " lohengrin , " marking the bayreuth debuts of stage director hans neuenfels and conductor andris nelsons .
this season 's line-up also includes recent productions of " parsifal , " " the mastersingers of nuremburg " and the tetralogy " the ring of the nibelung . " " richard wagner writes operas for a theater that does n't exist , " a contemporary of the composer once noted .
rather than bowing to reality , wagner achieved his dream of a festival theater of his own design .
it was to be provisional , yet set standards for the future .

the test criteria , they say , were too weak .
europe now waits to see if the tests will impress investors . despite the positive results of europe 's bank stress tests , analysts and politicians are warning that the banking system is still in dire need of reform .
all but seven of the 91 banks tested in 20 countries passed the test .
investors are expected to focus on the dozen or so banks that just made the cut when markets reopen monday .
many have criticized the tests , published friday by the london-based committee of european banking supervisors , for lacking rigorousness .
german banks ' robust ' ?
although german finance minister wolfgang schaeuble celebrated the test results as a sign that german banks were " robust and resistant , " green party financial spokesman gerhard schick warned that " german banks are and remain unsteady . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics say schaeuble is celebrating too soon meanwhile , the president of the german institute for economic research -lrb- diw -rrb- , klaus zimmermann , expressed fears the positive results may give the " fatal impression " that a full overhaul of the bank system is no longer necessary .
" unlike in the us , the necessary european financial reforms have n't even been fully discussed , let alone finalized or implemented , " zimmermann told the website of financial daily handelsblatt .
' declaring the corpses dead ' analysts also said the exams themselves were not tough enough to bring any good , other than restoring some confidence to investors .
according to daniel gros , head of the centre for european policy studies , europe wasted an opportunity by not pushing harder criteria - and by leaving crisis scenarios out of the tests , such as a real estate crash , the collapse of the raw goods market or total defaults by a eurozone state - as could have occurred in greece earlier this year .
" the stress test declared the corpses as dead , " gros told german news agency dpa in brussels .
" we know a bit more now about where the shaky candidates are .
but the test did n't bring any real insights . "
gros believes the results of the tests will have the intended effect of calming investors ' fears but lamented that " whitewashed " test criteria prevented what could have been an " opportunity to really clean up the banking sector . "
the economist warned that european banks still often had very close ties to each other , meaning that " if a large bank fails , the whole system would be in danger . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe waits to see how the world 's markets will react to the results nervous wait the stress tests were never expected to show massive capital shortfalls , as european banks had already raised about 300 billion euros -lrb- $ 387 billion -rrb- since the financial crisis began , including 170 billion euros of government support to 34 banks .
" with so few banks failing , investors will question whether the economic scenarios -lsb- simulated by the tests -rsb- are sufficiently severe , " said jon peace , analyst at financial group nomura in london .
" it will be natural for investors to consider the margin by which banks passed , " he added , citing a good pass margin for scandinavian and british banks , with greek , spanish and italian banks faring less well .
hypo real estate was the only german financial institution to fail the test .
bundesbank vice president franz-christoph zeitler explained that " in the regulators ' view , no other german bank needs further capital , " maintaining , however that " the markets could see that differently . "
the euro fell late friday just after the publication of test results , but quickly bounced back .
us stocks also rose slightly on friday .
european governments must now wait for markets to reopen on monday in order to get the full global reaction .

the circumstances that led to the people 's deaths remained unclear .
people tried to escape the area around the tunnel and may have been trampled to death or fallen from a bridge they scaled to flee the crowd . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : parademics had difficulty getting to the accident site von schmeling said 16 victims who died at the scene were found on a nearby access ramp , indicating they were not killed in the tunnel .
he added that prior to the stampede police had opened a second access ramp to ease crowd pressure around the tunnel .
he also said that police were responsible for regulating the number of people inside the tunnel . sixteen victims have so far been identified , including two spaniards , a bosnian , a dutchman , an australian , an italian and one person from china .
von schmeling said all those who died were between 20 and 40 years of age . it remains unclear exactly how many people were at the love parade , von schmeling said , adding that he could not confirm reports that 1.4 million people were estimated to be in attendance .
he said 105,000 people arrived by train between 9 a.m. and 2 p.m. ' over for the love parade ' love parade organizer rainer schaller said the love parade would never be held again , and that every effort would be taken to find the cause of saturday afternoon 's tragic events .

the test criteria , they say , were too weak .
europe now waits to see if the tests will impress investors . despite the positive results of europe 's bank stress tests , analysts and politicians are warning that the banking system is still in dire need of reform .
all but seven of the 91 banks tested in 20 countries passed the test .
investors are expected to focus on the dozen or so banks that just made the cut when markets reopen monday .
many have criticized the tests , published friday by the london-based committee of european banking supervisors , for lacking rigorousness .
german banks ' robust ' ?
although german finance minister wolfgang schaeuble celebrated the test results as a sign that german banks were " robust and resistant , " green party financial spokesman gerhard schick warned that " german banks are and remain unsteady . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics say schaeuble is celebrating too soon meanwhile , the president of the german institute for economic research -lrb- diw -rrb- , klaus zimmermann , expressed fears the positive results may give the " fatal impression " that a full overhaul of the bank system is no longer necessary .
" unlike in the us , the necessary european financial reforms have n't even been fully discussed , let alone finalized or implemented , " zimmermann told the website of financial daily handelsblatt .
' declaring the corpses dead ' analysts also said the exams themselves were not tough enough to bring any good , other than restoring some confidence to investors .
according to daniel gros , head of the centre for european policy studies , europe wasted an opportunity by not pushing harder criteria - and by leaving crisis scenarios out of the tests , such as a real estate crash , the collapse of the raw goods market or total defaults by a eurozone state - as could have occurred in greece earlier this year .
" the stress test declared the corpses as dead , " gros told german news agency dpa in brussels .
" we know a bit more now about where the shaky candidates are .
but the test did n't bring any real insights . "
gros believes the results of the tests will have the intended effect of calming investors ' fears but lamented that " whitewashed " test criteria prevented what could have been an " opportunity to really clean up the banking sector . "
the economist warned that european banks still often had very close ties to each other , meaning that " if a large bank fails , the whole system would be in danger . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe waits to see how the world 's markets will react to the results nervous wait the stress tests were never expected to show massive capital shortfalls , as european banks had already raised about 300 billion euros -lrb- $ 387 billion -rrb- since the financial crisis began , including 170 billion euros of government support to 34 banks .
" with so few banks failing , investors will question whether the economic scenarios -lsb- simulated by the tests -rsb- are sufficiently severe , " said jon peace , analyst at financial group nomura in london .
" it will be natural for investors to consider the margin by which banks passed , " he added , citing a good pass margin for scandinavian and british banks , with greek , spanish and italian banks faring less well .
hypo real estate was the only german financial institution to fail the test .
bundesbank vice president franz-christoph zeitler explained that " in the regulators ' view , no other german bank needs further capital , " maintaining , however that " the markets could see that differently . "
the euro fell late friday just after the publication of test results , but quickly bounced back .
us stocks also rose slightly on friday .
european governments must now wait for markets to reopen on monday in order to get the full global reaction .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de central asia -pipe- 24.07.2010 osce police mission to kyrgyzstan to focus on ' stability ' großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the violence in southern kyrgyzstan led to many deaths in june , the central asian state of kyrgyzstan broke down in bouts of violence that led to hundreds of deaths .
the osce plans a ' stability ' mission in response to the crisis , a chief osce official told deutsche welle . the organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- plans to send a police mission to troubled kyrgyzstan following violence and instability in the central asian state .
deutsche welle spoke with herbert salber , the head of the osce 's conflict prevention center , about the mission . deutsche welle : what are the criteria for selecting the police being sent as part of the osce mission ? herbert salber : they should be experienced police officers in the police services of osce member countries .
they should speak one of the languages spoken on the ground .
this means , realistically , we should concentrate on russian .
we believe we will find a sufficient number of candidates in member states .
they should also be familiar with the political and cultural conditions in the region .
at the beginning we want to send 52 police officers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police came under attack during the violence which countries will they come from ? many delegations have expressed interest , and we sent out a note to our member states with a request for candidate nominations .
i estimate that we will receive nominations from 10 to 15 , if not 20 , participant countries .
naturally , this will include many from central and eastern europe , and even central asia , because there we have russian speakers . what will be the goal of the mission ? the main goal is to establish stability and reliability in southern kyrgyzstan .
the mission will counsel the kyrgyz police and accompany them in the implementation of their duties .
they will also monitor the kyrgyz police and look closely at how they go about dealing with difficult situations .
we have to assume that trust between the kyrgyz people and law enforcement has been lost in the areas where there was violence in june .
this must be restored .
the efforts of our police will depend on this .
it should be noted that these police will be unarmed , and thus they will not be a police squad , but rather they will be there to counsel , to observe and to report .
the police will report through our office in bishkek and the permanent council of the osce ambassador in order to contribute to stabilization . bildunterschrift : thousands tried to cross the border into uzbekistan some people in southern kyrgyzstan are protesting the osce mission .
why is this ? this is difficult to understand because the president of the country , roza otunbayeva , and relevant members of the kyrgyz leadership have always assured us that such a police mission was wanted and welcome .
i can only imagine that some elements want to obstruct the arrival of the police mission because they have an interest in hiding certain things from the international community .
but i do n't think we should pay too much attention to this .
what is important for us is what the government in bishkek says . will the mission aid the international investigation into the outbursts of violence in june ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the clashes created thousands of refugees we must not get involved with that .
the police mission is primarily there to support the kyrgyz police .
it 's not our mission to comment on an investigation into what happened in june .
the kyrgyz government has developed an idea to have an investigative commission shed light on this topic .
the commission should also possibly be internationally equipped .
this has nothing to do with the police mission , which is concerned with what happens between now and the future , as opposed to the commission , which will examine the past . when will the mission begin ? the mission can begin with initial delegations in the middle of august .
we have established procedures in the osce for how we select the members of our international missions .
we need to adhere to these procedures in order for all candidates to have a fair chance and so osce member states are able to participate in the mission according to their wishes .
if we shorten this process as much as possible then the first police officers can arrive in mid-august . how long should the mission take and where will the police be stationed ? initially four months , but it is possible that the mission could be extended by mutual consent .
the police will be stationed in osh and jalalabad . interview : daniele posdnjakov / dfm editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : focus : bayreuth festival 2010 black market flourishes at bayreuth festival bayreuth impresario wolfgang wagner dies at 90 music -pipe- 24.07.2010 wagner 's legacy comes to life at 99th bayreuth festival großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : visitors at the festspielhaus the fanfare from the bayreuth festival , opening on july 25 , summons an audience ranging from prominent politicians to die-hard wagnerians .
composer richard wagner 's legacy has magnetic power . apart from political and show business celebrities , the bayreuth festival audience includes many for whom simply being there means that a dream has come true .
christian thielemann , the conductor of the current production of the four-opera cycle " the ring of the nibelung , " told deutsche welle that this enthusiasm is shared by the artists as well . " they are completely focused on these works by wagner , and they sacrifice their summer vacations just for the privilege of being here , " said thielemann , " nobody comes to bayreuth who does n't truly want to . " held this year for the 99th time , the bayreuth festival continues to fascinate and intrigue : it is the high point of the festival summer in germany , the world 's most prestigious opera festival , a mecca for wagnerians , a mega-event . it began with a dream bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : richard wagner : a small man with big ambitions the festival opens with a new production of richard wagner 's romantic opera " lohengrin , " marking the bayreuth debuts of stage director hans neuenfels and conductor andris nelsons .
this season 's line-up also includes recent productions of " parsifal , " " the mastersingers of nuremburg " and the tetralogy " the ring of the nibelung . " " richard wagner writes operas for a theater that does n't exist , " a contemporary of the composer once noted .
rather than bowing to reality , wagner achieved his dream of a festival theater of his own design .
it was to be provisional , yet set standards for the future .
the opposite happened instead : richard wagner 's festspielhaus still stands and remains unique . " i think it was a clever idea for wagner not to place his festspielhaus in munich but in a small town in a beautiful countryside , here in bayreuth , where there are no distractions , " said tankred dorst , the stage director of the current " ring " production in bayreuth .
" you always see people walking around with their nose buried in a libretto . " the magic green hill bayreuth , population 72,000 , is in upper franconia in the state of bavaria , not far from nuremberg .
the festspielhaus is located just outside the city , a short drive up the so-called " green hill . "
that drive is a ritual that has been performed countless times by wagnerians , opera heavyweights and amateur spectators alike . " this ' green hill ' is of course a very special location , and not only for artistic reasons , " said 84-year-old dorst , " it has a mythological dimension itself that belongs to german history - the good , and even more so , the bad parts .
when i drive up the hill to rehearsals in the morning , it reminds me of that time in german history when wagner and his works played a different role , during the nazi regime . " bildunterschrift : bayreuth 's festspielhaus , pictured in 1897 the composer had died half a century before the nazis came to power in the 1930 's .
festival director winifred wagner was a member of the nazi party and a personal friend of adolf hitler .
since the founding of the bayreuth festival in 1876 , it has been led exclusively by members of the wagner family .
richard was followed by his widow cosima , son siegfried , daughter-in-law winifred , grandsons wieland and wolfgang and now , since 2008 , great-granddaughters eva and katharina . no other festival can boast a comparable dynastic tradition .
" the history of this family itself is almost like a shakespearean drama , " said juergen flimm , stage director of " the ring " from 2000 to 2005 . described by german author thomas mann as " probably the greatest artistic talent in human history , " richard wagner continues to have a polarizing effect on people .
whether the festspielhaus audience applauds or boos does n't necessarily depend on high expectations or performance quality . " people in bayreuth tend to go slightly ballistic , which is very interesting and sometimes rather alarming , " said flimm .
" this is , after all , a theater , and what occurs onstage is strongly subjective .
you might respond by saying , ' that 's different - i do n't like that , ' but not ' that 's wrong ! '
in art , there is no such thing as right or wrong . " man and myth " in his gods , man paints a picture of himself , " observed german author friedrich schiller .
richard wagner understood the meaning of myth as a reflection of human qualities on a meta-level .
his sources of inspiration included greek mythology and literature , where the gods are equipped with human weaknesses and failings . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german author and director tankred dorst has also written complex epic dramas in his own stories , wagner lent human attributes to germanic gods like wotan , fricka and loge .
he made tales and myths of the holy grail comprehensible through character development - adding the sensuous , emotional quality of music . wagner 's music dramas are complex , multi-layered and lengthy .
understanding and appreciating them requires repeated exposure to the plot and the music . over time , wagner and his works themselves have become cult .
the opening of the festival to modern mass media in recent years , with public viewing , internet streaming and podcasts from the festspielhaus , has n't reduced public interest in the festival . opening day on july 25 , with the familiar ritual of celebrities , security personnel and spectators , will be followed by 29 additional performances , concluding on august 28 . author : rick fulker editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the test criteria , they say , were too weak .
europe now waits to see if the tests will impress investors . despite the positive results of europe 's bank stress tests , analysts and politicians are warning that the banking system is still in dire need of reform .
all but seven of the 91 banks tested in 20 countries passed the test .
investors are expected to focus on the dozen or so banks that just made the cut when markets reopen monday .
many have criticized the tests , published friday by the london-based committee of european banking supervisors , for lacking rigorousness .
german banks ' robust ' ?
although german finance minister wolfgang schaeuble celebrated the test results as a sign that german banks were " robust and resistant , " green party financial spokesman gerhard schick warned that " german banks are and remain unsteady . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics say schaeuble is celebrating too soon meanwhile , the president of the german institute for economic research -lrb- diw -rrb- , klaus zimmermann , expressed fears the positive results may give the " fatal impression " that a full overhaul of the bank system is no longer necessary .
" unlike in the us , the necessary european financial reforms have n't even been fully discussed , let alone finalized or implemented , " zimmermann told the website of financial daily handelsblatt .
' declaring the corpses dead ' analysts also said the exams themselves were not tough enough to bring any good , other than restoring some confidence to investors .
according to daniel gros , head of the centre for european policy studies , europe wasted an opportunity by not pushing harder criteria - and by leaving crisis scenarios out of the tests , such as a real estate crash , the collapse of the raw goods market or total defaults by a eurozone state - as could have occurred in greece earlier this year .
" the stress test declared the corpses as dead , " gros told german news agency dpa in brussels .
" we know a bit more now about where the shaky candidates are .
but the test did n't bring any real insights . "
gros believes the results of the tests will have the intended effect of calming investors ' fears but lamented that " whitewashed " test criteria prevented what could have been an " opportunity to really clean up the banking sector . "
the economist warned that european banks still often had very close ties to each other , meaning that " if a large bank fails , the whole system would be in danger . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe waits to see how the world 's markets will react to the results nervous wait the stress tests were never expected to show massive capital shortfalls , as european banks had already raised about 300 billion euros -lrb- $ 387 billion -rrb- since the financial crisis began , including 170 billion euros of government support to 34 banks .
" with so few banks failing , investors will question whether the economic scenarios -lsb- simulated by the tests -rsb- are sufficiently severe , " said jon peace , analyst at financial group nomura in london .
" it will be natural for investors to consider the margin by which banks passed , " he added , citing a good pass margin for scandinavian and british banks , with greek , spanish and italian banks faring less well .
hypo real estate was the only german financial institution to fail the test .
bundesbank vice president franz-christoph zeitler explained that " in the regulators ' view , no other german bank needs further capital , " maintaining , however that " the markets could see that differently . "
the euro fell late friday just after the publication of test results , but quickly bounced back .
us stocks also rose slightly on friday .
european governments must now wait for markets to reopen on monday in order to get the full global reaction .

the circumstances that led to the people 's deaths remained unclear .
people tried to escape the area around the tunnel and may have been trampled to death or fallen from a bridge they scaled to flee the crowd . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : parademics had difficulty getting to the accident site von schmeling said 16 victims who died at the scene were found on a nearby access ramp , indicating they were not killed in the tunnel .
he added that prior to the stampede police had opened a second access ramp to ease crowd pressure around the tunnel .
he also said that police were responsible for regulating the number of people inside the tunnel . sixteen victims have so far been identified , including two spaniards , a bosnian , a dutchman , an australian , an italian and one person from china .
von schmeling said all those who died were between 20 and 40 years of age . it remains unclear exactly how many people were at the love parade , von schmeling said , adding that he could not confirm reports that 1.4 million people were estimated to be in attendance .
he said 105,000 people arrived by train between 9 a.m. and 2 p.m. ' over for the love parade ' love parade organizer rainer schaller said the love parade would never be held again , and that every effort would be taken to find the cause of saturday afternoon 's tragic events . " words are not enough to describe the extent of the shock i feel , " schaller said . duisburg mayor adolf sauerland was similarly rocked by the deadly stampede . " i ca n't dress up my grief with words , " he said .
" this misfortune is so gruesome that it ca n't be described with words . " the head of the duisburg emergency task force , wolfgang rabe , said he has made available all documents pertaining to the incident to the duisburg public prosecutor 's office . he said the love parade venue could accommodate some 300,000 people and was not full when the stampede occurred .
referring to the ongoing investigation , none of the officials at the press conference answered questions as to why the love parade 's main entrance led through a tunnel . cause of the tragedy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : officials did n't stop the party immediately to prevent further panic the blame-game has already begun with the police trade union in the state of north rhine-westphalia , where the incident occurred , throwing the first salvo .
the union has accusing the organizers of the love parade of careless preparation . those who lost their lives were victims " of the material interests of an organizer , " said the police union 's regional chairman , wolfgang orscheschek . witnesses to the stampede also criticized the event 's organizers , with one man describing the proceedings as " organized chaos , " while others reported that there was simply " no way out . " dj dr. motte , a founder of the festival that originated in berlin in 1989 , wrote on his blog that having one single entrance to the festival through a tunnel harbored " catastrophe by itself .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de finance -pipe- 24.07.2010 ' bank stress tests not rigorous enough , ' say analysts großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : analysts warn that strong results reflect a weak test despite better-than-expected stress test results , analysts warn that europe 's banks still need reform .
the test criteria , they say , were too weak .
europe now waits to see if the tests will impress investors . despite the positive results of europe 's bank stress tests , analysts and politicians are warning that the banking system is still in dire need of reform .
all but seven of the 91 banks tested in 20 countries passed the test .
investors are expected to focus on the dozen or so banks that just made the cut when markets reopen monday .
many have criticized the tests , published friday by the london-based committee of european banking supervisors , for lacking rigorousness .
german banks ' robust ' ?
although german finance minister wolfgang schaeuble celebrated the test results as a sign that german banks were " robust and resistant , " green party financial spokesman gerhard schick warned that " german banks are and remain unsteady . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics say schaeuble is celebrating too soon meanwhile , the president of the german institute for economic research -lrb- diw -rrb- , klaus zimmermann , expressed fears the positive results may give the " fatal impression " that a full overhaul of the bank system is no longer necessary .
" unlike in the us , the necessary european financial reforms have n't even been fully discussed , let alone finalized or implemented , " zimmermann told the website of financial daily handelsblatt .
' declaring the corpses dead ' analysts also said the exams themselves were not tough enough to bring any good , other than restoring some confidence to investors .
according to daniel gros , head of the centre for european policy studies , europe wasted an opportunity by not pushing harder criteria - and by leaving crisis scenarios out of the tests , such as a real estate crash , the collapse of the raw goods market or total defaults by a eurozone state - as could have occurred in greece earlier this year .
" the stress test declared the corpses as dead , " gros told german news agency dpa in brussels .
" we know a bit more now about where the shaky candidates are .
but the test did n't bring any real insights . "
gros believes the results of the tests will have the intended effect of calming investors ' fears but lamented that " whitewashed " test criteria prevented what could have been an " opportunity to really clean up the banking sector . "
the economist warned that european banks still often had very close ties to each other , meaning that " if a large bank fails , the whole system would be in danger . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe waits to see how the world 's markets will react to the results nervous wait the stress tests were never expected to show massive capital shortfalls , as european banks had already raised about 300 billion euros -lrb- $ 387 billion -rrb- since the financial crisis began , including 170 billion euros of government support to 34 banks .
" with so few banks failing , investors will question whether the economic scenarios -lsb- simulated by the tests -rsb- are sufficiently severe , " said jon peace , analyst at financial group nomura in london .
" it will be natural for investors to consider the margin by which banks passed , " he added , citing a good pass margin for scandinavian and british banks , with greek , spanish and italian banks faring less well .
hypo real estate was the only german financial institution to fail the test .
bundesbank vice president franz-christoph zeitler explained that " in the regulators ' view , no other german bank needs further capital , " maintaining , however that " the markets could see that differently . "
the euro fell late friday just after the publication of test results , but quickly bounced back .
us stocks also rose slightly on friday .
european governments must now wait for markets to reopen on monday in order to get the full global reaction .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de central asia -pipe- 24.07.2010 osce police mission to kyrgyzstan to focus on ' stability ' großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the violence in southern kyrgyzstan led to many deaths in june , the central asian state of kyrgyzstan broke down in bouts of violence that led to hundreds of deaths .
the osce plans a ' stability ' mission in response to the crisis , a chief osce official told deutsche welle . the organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- plans to send a police mission to troubled kyrgyzstan following violence and instability in the central asian state .
deutsche welle spoke with herbert salber , the head of the osce 's conflict prevention center , about the mission . deutsche welle : what are the criteria for selecting the police being sent as part of the osce mission ? herbert salber : they should be experienced police officers in the police services of osce member countries .
they should speak one of the languages spoken on the ground .
this means , realistically , we should concentrate on russian .
we believe we will find a sufficient number of candidates in member states .
they should also be familiar with the political and cultural conditions in the region .
at the beginning we want to send 52 police officers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police came under attack during the violence which countries will they come from ? many delegations have expressed interest , and we sent out a note to our member states with a request for candidate nominations .
i estimate that we will receive nominations from 10 to 15 , if not 20 , participant countries .
naturally , this will include many from central and eastern europe , and even central asia , because there we have russian speakers . what will be the goal of the mission ? the main goal is to establish stability and reliability in southern kyrgyzstan .
the mission will counsel the kyrgyz police and accompany them in the implementation of their duties .
they will also monitor the kyrgyz police and look closely at how they go about dealing with difficult situations .
we have to assume that trust between the kyrgyz people and law enforcement has been lost in the areas where there was violence in june .
this must be restored .
the efforts of our police will depend on this .
it should be noted that these police will be unarmed , and thus they will not be a police squad , but rather they will be there to counsel , to observe and to report .
the police will report through our office in bishkek and the permanent council of the osce ambassador in order to contribute to stabilization . bildunterschrift : thousands tried to cross the border into uzbekistan some people in southern kyrgyzstan are protesting the osce mission .
why is this ? this is difficult to understand because the president of the country , roza otunbayeva , and relevant members of the kyrgyz leadership have always assured us that such a police mission was wanted and welcome .
i can only imagine that some elements want to obstruct the arrival of the police mission because they have an interest in hiding certain things from the international community .
but i do n't think we should pay too much attention to this .
what is important for us is what the government in bishkek says . will the mission aid the international investigation into the outbursts of violence in june ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the clashes created thousands of refugees we must not get involved with that .
the police mission is primarily there to support the kyrgyz police .
it 's not our mission to comment on an investigation into what happened in june .
the kyrgyz government has developed an idea to have an investigative commission shed light on this topic .
the commission should also possibly be internationally equipped .
this has nothing to do with the police mission , which is concerned with what happens between now and the future , as opposed to the commission , which will examine the past . when will the mission begin ? the mission can begin with initial delegations in the middle of august .
we have established procedures in the osce for how we select the members of our international missions .
we need to adhere to these procedures in order for all candidates to have a fair chance and so osce member states are able to participate in the mission according to their wishes .
if we shorten this process as much as possible then the first police officers can arrive in mid-august . how long should the mission take and where will the police be stationed ? initially four months , but it is possible that the mission could be extended by mutual consent .
the police will be stationed in osh and jalalabad . interview : daniele posdnjakov / dfm editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the circumstances that led to the people 's deaths remained unclear .
people tried to escape the area around the tunnel and may have been trampled to death or fallen from a bridge they scaled to flee the crowd . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : parademics had difficulty getting to the accident site von schmeling said 16 victims who died at the scene were found on a nearby access ramp , indicating they were not killed in the tunnel .
he added that prior to the stampede police had opened a second access ramp to ease crowd pressure around the tunnel .
he also said that police were responsible for regulating the number of people inside the tunnel . sixteen victims have so far been identified , including two spaniards , a bosnian , a dutchman , an australian , an italian and one person from china .
von schmeling said all those who died were between 20 and 40 years of age . it remains unclear exactly how many people were at the love parade , von schmeling said , adding that he could not confirm reports that 1.4 million people were estimated to be in attendance .
he said 105,000 people arrived by train between 9 a.m. and 2 p.m. ' over for the love parade ' love parade organizer rainer schaller said the love parade would never be held again , and that every effort would be taken to find the cause of saturday afternoon 's tragic events . " words are not enough to describe the extent of the shock i feel , " schaller said . duisburg mayor adolf sauerland was similarly rocked by the deadly stampede . " i ca n't dress up my grief with words , " he said .
" this misfortune is so gruesome that it ca n't be described with words . " the head of the duisburg emergency task force , wolfgang rabe , said he has made available all documents pertaining to the incident to the duisburg public prosecutor 's office . he said the love parade venue could accommodate some 300,000 people and was not full when the stampede occurred .
referring to the ongoing investigation , none of the officials at the press conference answered questions as to why the love parade 's main entrance led through a tunnel . cause of the tragedy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : officials did n't stop the party immediately to prevent further panic the blame-game has already begun with the police trade union in the state of north rhine-westphalia , where the incident occurred , throwing the first salvo .
the union has accusing the organizers of the love parade of careless preparation . those who lost their lives were victims " of the material interests of an organizer , " said the police union 's regional chairman , wolfgang orscheschek . witnesses to the stampede also criticized the event 's organizers , with one man describing the proceedings as " organized chaos , " while others reported that there was simply " no way out . " dj dr. motte , a founder of the festival that originated in berlin in 1989 , wrote on his blog that having one single entrance to the festival through a tunnel harbored " catastrophe by itself .

the test criteria , they say , were too weak .
europe now waits to see if the tests will impress investors . despite the positive results of europe 's bank stress tests , analysts and politicians are warning that the banking system is still in dire need of reform .
all but seven of the 91 banks tested in 20 countries passed the test .
investors are expected to focus on the dozen or so banks that just made the cut when markets reopen monday .
many have criticized the tests , published friday by the london-based committee of european banking supervisors , for lacking rigorousness .
german banks ' robust ' ?
although german finance minister wolfgang schaeuble celebrated the test results as a sign that german banks were " robust and resistant , " green party financial spokesman gerhard schick warned that " german banks are and remain unsteady . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics say schaeuble is celebrating too soon meanwhile , the president of the german institute for economic research -lrb- diw -rrb- , klaus zimmermann , expressed fears the positive results may give the " fatal impression " that a full overhaul of the bank system is no longer necessary .
" unlike in the us , the necessary european financial reforms have n't even been fully discussed , let alone finalized or implemented , " zimmermann told the website of financial daily handelsblatt .
' declaring the corpses dead ' analysts also said the exams themselves were not tough enough to bring any good , other than restoring some confidence to investors .
according to daniel gros , head of the centre for european policy studies , europe wasted an opportunity by not pushing harder criteria - and by leaving crisis scenarios out of the tests , such as a real estate crash , the collapse of the raw goods market or total defaults by a eurozone state - as could have occurred in greece earlier this year .
" the stress test declared the corpses as dead , " gros told german news agency dpa in brussels .
" we know a bit more now about where the shaky candidates are .
but the test did n't bring any real insights . "
gros believes the results of the tests will have the intended effect of calming investors ' fears but lamented that " whitewashed " test criteria prevented what could have been an " opportunity to really clean up the banking sector . "
the economist warned that european banks still often had very close ties to each other , meaning that " if a large bank fails , the whole system would be in danger . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe waits to see how the world 's markets will react to the results nervous wait the stress tests were never expected to show massive capital shortfalls , as european banks had already raised about 300 billion euros -lrb- $ 387 billion -rrb- since the financial crisis began , including 170 billion euros of government support to 34 banks .

" it will be natural for investors to consider the margin by which banks passed , " he added , citing a good pass margin for scandinavian and british banks , with greek , spanish and italian banks faring less well .
hypo real estate was the only german financial institution to fail the test .
bundesbank vice president franz-christoph zeitler explained that " in the regulators ' view , no other german bank needs further capital , " maintaining , however that " the markets could see that differently . "

although german finance minister wolfgang schaeuble celebrated the test results as a sign that german banks were " robust and resistant , " green party financial spokesman gerhard schick warned that " german banks are and remain unsteady . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics say schaeuble is celebrating too soon meanwhile , the president of the german institute for economic research -lrb- diw -rrb- , klaus zimmermann , expressed fears the positive results may give the " fatal impression " that a full overhaul of the bank system is no longer necessary .
" unlike in the us , the necessary european financial reforms have n't even been fully discussed , let alone finalized or implemented , " zimmermann told the website of financial daily handelsblatt .
' declaring the corpses dead ' analysts also said the exams themselves were not tough enough to bring any good , other than restoring some confidence to investors .
according to daniel gros , head of the centre for european policy studies , europe wasted an opportunity by not pushing harder criteria - and by leaving crisis scenarios out of the tests , such as a real estate crash , the collapse of the raw goods market or total defaults by a eurozone state - as could have occurred in greece earlier this year .
" the stress test declared the corpses as dead , " gros told german news agency dpa in brussels .
" we know a bit more now about where the shaky candidates are .
but the test did n't bring any real insights . "
gros believes the results of the tests will have the intended effect of calming investors ' fears but lamented that " whitewashed " test criteria prevented what could have been an " opportunity to really clean up the banking sector . "
the economist warned that european banks still often had very close ties to each other , meaning that " if a large bank fails , the whole system would be in danger . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe waits to see how the world 's markets will react to the results nervous wait the stress tests were never expected to show massive capital shortfalls , as european banks had already raised about 300 billion euros -lrb- $ 387 billion -rrb- since the financial crisis began , including 170 billion euros of government support to 34 banks .
" with so few banks failing , investors will question whether the economic scenarios -lsb- simulated by the tests -rsb- are sufficiently severe , " said jon peace , analyst at financial group nomura in london .
" it will be natural for investors to consider the margin by which banks passed , " he added , citing a good pass margin for scandinavian and british banks , with greek , spanish and italian banks faring less well .
hypo real estate was the only german financial institution to fail the test .
bundesbank vice president franz-christoph zeitler explained that " in the regulators ' view , no other german bank needs further capital , " maintaining , however that " the markets could see that differently . "
the euro fell late friday just after the publication of test results , but quickly bounced back .
us stocks also rose slightly on friday .
european governments must now wait for markets to reopen on monday in order to get the full global reaction .

composer richard wagner 's legacy has magnetic power . apart from political and show business celebrities , the bayreuth festival audience includes many for whom simply being there means that a dream has come true .

whether the festspielhaus audience applauds or boos does n't necessarily depend on high expectations or performance quality . " people in bayreuth tend to go slightly ballistic , which is very interesting and sometimes rather alarming , " said flimm .

composer richard wagner 's legacy has magnetic power . apart from political and show business celebrities , the bayreuth festival audience includes many for whom simply being there means that a dream has come true .
christian thielemann , the conductor of the current production of the four-opera cycle " the ring of the nibelung , " told deutsche welle that this enthusiasm is shared by the artists as well . " they are completely focused on these works by wagner , and they sacrifice their summer vacations just for the privilege of being here , " said thielemann , " nobody comes to bayreuth who does n't truly want to . " held this year for the 99th time , the bayreuth festival continues to fascinate and intrigue : it is the high point of the festival summer in germany , the world 's most prestigious opera festival , a mecca for wagnerians , a mega-event . it began with a dream bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : richard wagner : a small man with big ambitions the festival opens with a new production of richard wagner 's romantic opera " lohengrin , " marking the bayreuth debuts of stage director hans neuenfels and conductor andris nelsons .
this season 's line-up also includes recent productions of " parsifal , " " the mastersingers of nuremburg " and the tetralogy " the ring of the nibelung . " " richard wagner writes operas for a theater that does n't exist , " a contemporary of the composer once noted .
rather than bowing to reality , wagner achieved his dream of a festival theater of his own design .
it was to be provisional , yet set standards for the future .
the opposite happened instead : richard wagner 's festspielhaus still stands and remains unique . " i think it was a clever idea for wagner not to place his festspielhaus in munich but in a small town in a beautiful countryside , here in bayreuth , where there are no distractions , " said tankred dorst , the stage director of the current " ring " production in bayreuth .
" you always see people walking around with their nose buried in a libretto . " the magic green hill bayreuth , population 72,000 , is in upper franconia in the state of bavaria , not far from nuremberg .
the festspielhaus is located just outside the city , a short drive up the so-called " green hill . "
that drive is a ritual that has been performed countless times by wagnerians , opera heavyweights and amateur spectators alike . " this ' green hill ' is of course a very special location , and not only for artistic reasons , " said 84-year-old dorst , " it has a mythological dimension itself that belongs to german history - the good , and even more so , the bad parts .
when i drive up the hill to rehearsals in the morning , it reminds me of that time in german history when wagner and his works played a different role , during the nazi regime . " bildunterschrift : bayreuth 's festspielhaus , pictured in 1897 the composer had died half a century before the nazis came to power in the 1930 's .
festival director winifred wagner was a member of the nazi party and a personal friend of adolf hitler .
since the founding of the bayreuth festival in 1876 , it has been led exclusively by members of the wagner family .
richard was followed by his widow cosima , son siegfried , daughter-in-law winifred , grandsons wieland and wolfgang and now , since 2008 , great-granddaughters eva and katharina . no other festival can boast a comparable dynastic tradition .
" the history of this family itself is almost like a shakespearean drama , " said juergen flimm , stage director of " the ring " from 2000 to 2005 . described by german author thomas mann as " probably the greatest artistic talent in human history , " richard wagner continues to have a polarizing effect on people .
whether the festspielhaus audience applauds or boos does n't necessarily depend on high expectations or performance quality . " people in bayreuth tend to go slightly ballistic , which is very interesting and sometimes rather alarming , " said flimm .
" this is , after all , a theater , and what occurs onstage is strongly subjective .
you might respond by saying , ' that 's different - i do n't like that , ' but not ' that 's wrong ! '
in art , there is no such thing as right or wrong . " man and myth " in his gods , man paints a picture of himself , " observed german author friedrich schiller .
richard wagner understood the meaning of myth as a reflection of human qualities on a meta-level .
his sources of inspiration included greek mythology and literature , where the gods are equipped with human weaknesses and failings . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german author and director tankred dorst has also written complex epic dramas in his own stories , wagner lent human attributes to germanic gods like wotan , fricka and loge .
he made tales and myths of the holy grail comprehensible through character development - adding the sensuous , emotional quality of music . wagner 's music dramas are complex , multi-layered and lengthy .
understanding and appreciating them requires repeated exposure to the plot and the music . over time , wagner and his works themselves have become cult .
the opening of the festival to modern mass media in recent years , with public viewing , internet streaming and podcasts from the festspielhaus , has n't reduced public interest in the festival . opening day on july 25 , with the familiar ritual of celebrities , security personnel and spectators , will be followed by 29 additional performances , concluding on august 28 . author : rick fulker editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the osce plans a ' stability ' mission in response to the crisis , a chief osce official told deutsche welle . the organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- plans to send a police mission to troubled kyrgyzstan following violence and instability in the central asian state .
deutsche welle spoke with herbert salber , the head of the osce 's conflict prevention center , about the mission . deutsche welle : what are the criteria for selecting the police being sent as part of the osce mission ? herbert salber : they should be experienced police officers in the police services of osce member countries .
they should speak one of the languages spoken on the ground .
this means , realistically , we should concentrate on russian .
we believe we will find a sufficient number of candidates in member states .
they should also be familiar with the political and cultural conditions in the region .
at the beginning we want to send 52 police officers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police came under attack during the violence which countries will they come from ? many delegations have expressed interest , and we sent out a note to our member states with a request for candidate nominations .
i estimate that we will receive nominations from 10 to 15 , if not 20 , participant countries .
naturally , this will include many from central and eastern europe , and even central asia , because there we have russian speakers . what will be the goal of the mission ? the main goal is to establish stability and reliability in southern kyrgyzstan .
the mission will counsel the kyrgyz police and accompany them in the implementation of their duties .
they will also monitor the kyrgyz police and look closely at how they go about dealing with difficult situations .
we have to assume that trust between the kyrgyz people and law enforcement has been lost in the areas where there was violence in june .
this must be restored .
the efforts of our police will depend on this .
it should be noted that these police will be unarmed , and thus they will not be a police squad , but rather they will be there to counsel , to observe and to report .
the police will report through our office in bishkek and the permanent council of the osce ambassador in order to contribute to stabilization . bildunterschrift : thousands tried to cross the border into uzbekistan some people in southern kyrgyzstan are protesting the osce mission .
why is this ? this is difficult to understand because the president of the country , roza otunbayeva , and relevant members of the kyrgyz leadership have always assured us that such a police mission was wanted and welcome .
i can only imagine that some elements want to obstruct the arrival of the police mission because they have an interest in hiding certain things from the international community .
but i do n't think we should pay too much attention to this .
what is important for us is what the government in bishkek says . will the mission aid the international investigation into the outbursts of violence in june ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the clashes created thousands of refugees we must not get involved with that .
the police mission is primarily there to support the kyrgyz police .
it 's not our mission to comment on an investigation into what happened in june .
the kyrgyz government has developed an idea to have an investigative commission shed light on this topic .
the commission should also possibly be internationally equipped .
this has nothing to do with the police mission , which is concerned with what happens between now and the future , as opposed to the commission , which will examine the past . when will the mission begin ? the mission can begin with initial delegations in the middle of august .
we have established procedures in the osce for how we select the members of our international missions .
we need to adhere to these procedures in order for all candidates to have a fair chance and so osce member states are able to participate in the mission according to their wishes .
if we shorten this process as much as possible then the first police officers can arrive in mid-august . how long should the mission take and where will the police be stationed ? initially four months , but it is possible that the mission could be extended by mutual consent .
the police will be stationed in osh and jalalabad . interview : daniele posdnjakov / dfm editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

however , despite its best efforts , the german league continues to struggle to hang on to big names when wealthier clubs come calling .
once again , check books are being waved in the direction of players who have lit up the bundesliga since arriving in germany , and with some clubs bucking the financial trend of austerity thanks to the deep pockets of benevolent billionaire owners , it looks like the league could lose a few of its shining lights before the new season starts .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : big clubs have been tracking dzeko for the past two seasons unsurprisingly , the name on the top of most lists is that of edin dzeko .
the 24-year-old wolfsburg hotshot has been linked with a move away from the bundesliga since he helped shoot the wolves to title glory almost two years ago .
the bosnian international has long been linked with a move to ac milan but the rossoneri may regret not pouncing sooner because dzeko 's second season as top scorer in the bundesliga has alerted manchester city .
the arab-owned manchester club is swimming through the transfer waters this summer like a ravenous great white and has caught dzeko 's scent - which could mean bad news for milan , chelsea , juventus and anyone else not put off by his 40 million-euro -lrb- $ 51million -rrb- release clause .
the big spending mancunians still remain interested in the man who scored 23 league goals in germany last season despite dzeko favouring a move to italy .
if his preferred club ac milan can find the money - or if manchester suddenly appeals - this may be the season that the bosnian hit-man finally moves on to pastures new .
dortmund bracing for bids on trio of top stars another striker who may be following him out of the bundesliga is lucas barrios .
after enjoying a great season with borussia dortmund and featuring in paraguay 's world cup campaign in south africa , the brazilian-born forward is apparently attracting interest from ac milan , fiorentina , manchester city and napoli .
barrios has four years left on his current contract at bvb but could still move on for a fee of around 10 million euros .
dortmund will be eager to hang on to the striker who helped them finish in their best position in years last season but could be tempted to sell if the price is right .
bildunterschrift : mohamed zidan 's muscular performances for dortmund and egypt have alerted europe 's top clubs dortmund will do well to hang on to another of their best performers this summer , with crafty egyptian striker mohamed zidan in the sights of big names such as manchester united , arsenal and barcelona .
rumours of his unhappiness in dortmund surfaced during last season 's winter transfer window and the 28-year-old has done little to scotch the now deafening chatter that he could be ready to take a step up after two years and 15 goals .
dortmund could be looking at quite a depleted squad should another much sought-after player finally move on after months of speculation .
serbian defender nevan subotic has been touted as a potential replacement for fellow countryman and international defensive partner nemanja vidic , should the current manchester united hard man move to real madrid .
man united have moved to the head of the queue for subotic since vidic made it clear that he fancies a switch to spain but premiership rivals chelsea and arsenal , who have been sniffing around for some time , wo n't give up so easily .
however , bvb 's asking price of 29 million euros for the 21-year-old center-back could prove a stumbling block to any move .
altintop to earn final big pay day with free transfer bildunterschrift : after many years service in the bundesliga , hamit altintop may be on the move to pastures new one player who wo n't cost a cent in transfer fees is hamit altintop .
the versatile turkish midfielder has been a stalwart of the bundesliga with schalke 04 , and more recently bayern munich. but as younger players have come through , altintop has slowly begun his descent through the pecking order at the german champions .
with a wealth of experience and no huge price tag on his head , altintop could be one of the free transfers of the season for a club looking for a wise old head to conduct things from midfield .
in turn , a new challenge may get a few more years service out of a player who has given his all in the bundesliga .
english premiership sides aston villa and tottenham hotspur are said to be interested .

however , despite its best efforts , the german league continues to struggle to hang on to big names when wealthier clubs come calling .
once again , check books are being waved in the direction of players who have lit up the bundesliga since arriving in germany , and with some clubs bucking the financial trend of austerity thanks to the deep pockets of benevolent billionaire owners , it looks like the league could lose a few of its shining lights before the new season starts .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : big clubs have been tracking dzeko for the past two seasons unsurprisingly , the name on the top of most lists is that of edin dzeko .
the 24-year-old wolfsburg hotshot has been linked with a move away from the bundesliga since he helped shoot the wolves to title glory almost two years ago .
the bosnian international has long been linked with a move to ac milan but the rossoneri may regret not pouncing sooner because dzeko 's second season as top scorer in the bundesliga has alerted manchester city .
the arab-owned manchester club is swimming through the transfer waters this summer like a ravenous great white and has caught dzeko 's scent - which could mean bad news for milan , chelsea , juventus and anyone else not put off by his 40 million-euro -lrb- $ 51million -rrb- release clause .
the big spending mancunians still remain interested in the man who scored 23 league goals in germany last season despite dzeko favouring a move to italy .
if his preferred club ac milan can find the money - or if manchester suddenly appeals - this may be the season that the bosnian hit-man finally moves on to pastures new .
dortmund bracing for bids on trio of top stars another striker who may be following him out of the bundesliga is lucas barrios .
after enjoying a great season with borussia dortmund and featuring in paraguay 's world cup campaign in south africa , the brazilian-born forward is apparently attracting interest from ac milan , fiorentina , manchester city and napoli .
barrios has four years left on his current contract at bvb but could still move on for a fee of around 10 million euros .
dortmund will be eager to hang on to the striker who helped them finish in their best position in years last season but could be tempted to sell if the price is right .
bildunterschrift : mohamed zidan 's muscular performances for dortmund and egypt have alerted europe 's top clubs dortmund will do well to hang on to another of their best performers this summer , with crafty egyptian striker mohamed zidan in the sights of big names such as manchester united , arsenal and barcelona .
rumours of his unhappiness in dortmund surfaced during last season 's winter transfer window and the 28-year-old has done little to scotch the now deafening chatter that he could be ready to take a step up after two years and 15 goals .
dortmund could be looking at quite a depleted squad should another much sought-after player finally move on after months of speculation .
serbian defender nevan subotic has been touted as a potential replacement for fellow countryman and international defensive partner nemanja vidic , should the current manchester united hard man move to real madrid .
man united have moved to the head of the queue for subotic since vidic made it clear that he fancies a switch to spain but premiership rivals chelsea and arsenal , who have been sniffing around for some time , wo n't give up so easily .
however , bvb 's asking price of 29 million euros for the 21-year-old center-back could prove a stumbling block to any move .
altintop to earn final big pay day with free transfer bildunterschrift : after many years service in the bundesliga , hamit altintop may be on the move to pastures new one player who wo n't cost a cent in transfer fees is hamit altintop .
the versatile turkish midfielder has been a stalwart of the bundesliga with schalke 04 , and more recently bayern munich. but as younger players have come through , altintop has slowly begun his descent through the pecking order at the german champions .
with a wealth of experience and no huge price tag on his head , altintop could be one of the free transfers of the season for a club looking for a wise old head to conduct things from midfield .
in turn , a new challenge may get a few more years service out of a player who has given his all in the bundesliga .

the test criteria , they say , were too weak .
europe now waits to see if the tests will impress investors . despite the positive results of europe 's bank stress tests , analysts and politicians are warning that the banking system is still in dire need of reform .
all but seven of the 91 banks tested in 20 countries passed the test .
investors are expected to focus on the dozen or so banks that just made the cut when markets reopen monday .
many have criticized the tests , published friday by the london-based committee of european banking supervisors , for lacking rigorousness .
german banks ' robust ' ?
although german finance minister wolfgang schaeuble celebrated the test results as a sign that german banks were " robust and resistant , " green party financial spokesman gerhard schick warned that " german banks are and remain unsteady . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics say schaeuble is celebrating too soon meanwhile , the president of the german institute for economic research -lrb- diw -rrb- , klaus zimmermann , expressed fears the positive results may give the " fatal impression " that a full overhaul of the bank system is no longer necessary .
" unlike in the us , the necessary european financial reforms have n't even been fully discussed , let alone finalized or implemented , " zimmermann told the website of financial daily handelsblatt .
' declaring the corpses dead ' analysts also said the exams themselves were not tough enough to bring any good , other than restoring some confidence to investors .
according to daniel gros , head of the centre for european policy studies , europe wasted an opportunity by not pushing harder criteria - and by leaving crisis scenarios out of the tests , such as a real estate crash , the collapse of the raw goods market or total defaults by a eurozone state - as could have occurred in greece earlier this year .
" the stress test declared the corpses as dead , " gros told german news agency dpa in brussels .
" we know a bit more now about where the shaky candidates are .
but the test did n't bring any real insights . "
gros believes the results of the tests will have the intended effect of calming investors ' fears but lamented that " whitewashed " test criteria prevented what could have been an " opportunity to really clean up the banking sector . "
the economist warned that european banks still often had very close ties to each other , meaning that " if a large bank fails , the whole system would be in danger . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe waits to see how the world 's markets will react to the results nervous wait the stress tests were never expected to show massive capital shortfalls , as european banks had already raised about 300 billion euros -lrb- $ 387 billion -rrb- since the financial crisis began , including 170 billion euros of government support to 34 banks .
" with so few banks failing , investors will question whether the economic scenarios -lsb- simulated by the tests -rsb- are sufficiently severe , " said jon peace , analyst at financial group nomura in london .
" it will be natural for investors to consider the margin by which banks passed , " he added , citing a good pass margin for scandinavian and british banks , with greek , spanish and italian banks faring less well .
hypo real estate was the only german financial institution to fail the test .
bundesbank vice president franz-christoph zeitler explained that " in the regulators ' view , no other german bank needs further capital , " maintaining , however that " the markets could see that differently . "
the euro fell late friday just after the publication of test results , but quickly bounced back .
us stocks also rose slightly on friday .
european governments must now wait for markets to reopen on monday in order to get the full global reaction .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics say schaeuble is celebrating too soon meanwhile , the president of the german institute for economic research -lrb- diw -rrb- , klaus zimmermann , expressed fears the positive results may give the " fatal impression " that a full overhaul of the bank system is no longer necessary .
" unlike in the us , the necessary european financial reforms have n't even been fully discussed , let alone finalized or implemented , " zimmermann told the website of financial daily handelsblatt .
' declaring the corpses dead ' analysts also said the exams themselves were not tough enough to bring any good , other than restoring some confidence to investors .
according to daniel gros , head of the centre for european policy studies , europe wasted an opportunity by not pushing harder criteria - and by leaving crisis scenarios out of the tests , such as a real estate crash , the collapse of the raw goods market or total defaults by a eurozone state - as could have occurred in greece earlier this year .
" the stress test declared the corpses as dead , " gros told german news agency dpa in brussels .
" we know a bit more now about where the shaky candidates are .
but the test did n't bring any real insights . "
gros believes the results of the tests will have the intended effect of calming investors ' fears but lamented that " whitewashed " test criteria prevented what could have been an " opportunity to really clean up the banking sector . "
the economist warned that european banks still often had very close ties to each other , meaning that " if a large bank fails , the whole system would be in danger . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe waits to see how the world 's markets will react to the results nervous wait the stress tests were never expected to show massive capital shortfalls , as european banks had already raised about 300 billion euros -lrb- $ 387 billion -rrb- since the financial crisis began , including 170 billion euros of government support to 34 banks .
" with so few banks failing , investors will question whether the economic scenarios -lsb- simulated by the tests -rsb- are sufficiently severe , " said jon peace , analyst at financial group nomura in london .
" it will be natural for investors to consider the margin by which banks passed , " he added , citing a good pass margin for scandinavian and british banks , with greek , spanish and italian banks faring less well .
hypo real estate was the only german financial institution to fail the test .
bundesbank vice president franz-christoph zeitler explained that " in the regulators ' view , no other german bank needs further capital , " maintaining , however that " the markets could see that differently . "
the euro fell late friday just after the publication of test results , but quickly bounced back .
us stocks also rose slightly on friday .
european governments must now wait for markets to reopen on monday in order to get the full global reaction .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de breaking news -pipe- 24.07.2010 duisburg officials have few answers for causes of love parade deaths großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police described the situation as " very chaotic " officials from the german city of duisburg , which saw 19 people killed saturday in a deadly stampede at the love parade music festival , have offered little at a press conference to explain what caused the tragic events . as an investigation attempts to shed light on what caused a deadly stampede at the love parade dance music festival in duisburg on saturday , city officials have faced tough questions over the tragedy . duisburg deputy police chief detlef von schmeling told reporters on sunday that two criminal reports were pending on the incident , but he could not confirm whether the organizers or emergency services would be implicated in the investigation . calls for an " intensive " and " uncompromising " investigation into the causes of the tragedy have come from as high up as germany 's chancellor angela merkel and president christian wulff . victims from at least seven countries in total , 19 people were killed when panic broke out in an over-crowded tunnel entrance to the festival .
the circumstances that led to the people 's deaths remained unclear .
people tried to escape the area around the tunnel and may have been trampled to death or fallen from a bridge they scaled to flee the crowd . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : parademics had difficulty getting to the accident site von schmeling said 16 victims who died at the scene were found on a nearby access ramp , indicating they were not killed in the tunnel .
he added that prior to the stampede police had opened a second access ramp to ease crowd pressure around the tunnel .
he also said that police were responsible for regulating the number of people inside the tunnel . sixteen victims have so far been identified , including two spaniards , a bosnian , a dutchman , an australian , an italian and one person from china .
von schmeling said all those who died were between 20 and 40 years of age . it remains unclear exactly how many people were at the love parade , von schmeling said , adding that he could not confirm reports that 1.4 million people were estimated to be in attendance .
he said 105,000 people arrived by train between 9 a.m. and 2 p.m. ' over for the love parade ' love parade organizer rainer schaller said the love parade would never be held again , and that every effort would be taken to find the cause of saturday afternoon 's tragic events . " words are not enough to describe the extent of the shock i feel , " schaller said . duisburg mayor adolf sauerland was similarly rocked by the deadly stampede . " i ca n't dress up my grief with words , " he said .
" this misfortune is so gruesome that it ca n't be described with words . " the head of the duisburg emergency task force , wolfgang rabe , said he has made available all documents pertaining to the incident to the duisburg public prosecutor 's office . he said the love parade venue could accommodate some 300,000 people and was not full when the stampede occurred .
referring to the ongoing investigation , none of the officials at the press conference answered questions as to why the love parade 's main entrance led through a tunnel . cause of the tragedy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : officials did n't stop the party immediately to prevent further panic the blame-game has already begun with the police trade union in the state of north rhine-westphalia , where the incident occurred , throwing the first salvo .
the union has accusing the organizers of the love parade of careless preparation . those who lost their lives were victims " of the material interests of an organizer , " said the police union 's regional chairman , wolfgang orscheschek . witnesses to the stampede also criticized the event 's organizers , with one man describing the proceedings as " organized chaos , " while others reported that there was simply " no way out . " dj dr. motte , a founder of the festival that originated in berlin in 1989 , wrote on his blog that having one single entrance to the festival through a tunnel harbored " catastrophe by itself .

the circumstances that led to the people 's deaths remained unclear .
people tried to escape the area around the tunnel and may have been trampled to death or fallen from a bridge they scaled to flee the crowd . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : parademics had difficulty getting to the accident site von schmeling said 16 victims who died at the scene were found on a nearby access ramp , indicating they were not killed in the tunnel .
he added that prior to the stampede police had opened a second access ramp to ease crowd pressure around the tunnel .
he also said that police were responsible for regulating the number of people inside the tunnel . sixteen victims have so far been identified , including two spaniards , a bosnian , a dutchman , an australian , an italian and one person from china .
von schmeling said all those who died were between 20 and 40 years of age . it remains unclear exactly how many people were at the love parade , von schmeling said , adding that he could not confirm reports that 1.4 million people were estimated to be in attendance .
he said 105,000 people arrived by train between 9 a.m. and 2 p.m. ' over for the love parade ' love parade organizer rainer schaller said the love parade would never be held again , and that every effort would be taken to find the cause of saturday afternoon 's tragic events . " words are not enough to describe the extent of the shock i feel , " schaller said . duisburg mayor adolf sauerland was similarly rocked by the deadly stampede . " i ca n't dress up my grief with words , " he said .
" this misfortune is so gruesome that it ca n't be described with words . " the head of the duisburg emergency task force , wolfgang rabe , said he has made available all documents pertaining to the incident to the duisburg public prosecutor 's office . he said the love parade venue could accommodate some 300,000 people and was not full when the stampede occurred .
referring to the ongoing investigation , none of the officials at the press conference answered questions as to why the love parade 's main entrance led through a tunnel . cause of the tragedy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : officials did n't stop the party immediately to prevent further panic the blame-game has already begun with the police trade union in the state of north rhine-westphalia , where the incident occurred , throwing the first salvo .
the union has accusing the organizers of the love parade of careless preparation . those who lost their lives were victims " of the material interests of an organizer , " said the police union 's regional chairman , wolfgang orscheschek . witnesses to the stampede also criticized the event 's organizers , with one man describing the proceedings as " organized chaos , " while others reported that there was simply " no way out . " dj dr. motte , a founder of the festival that originated in berlin in 1989 , wrote on his blog that having one single entrance to the festival through a tunnel harbored " catastrophe by itself .

the osce plans a ' stability ' mission in response to the crisis , a chief osce official told deutsche welle . the organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- plans to send a police mission to troubled kyrgyzstan following violence and instability in the central asian state .
deutsche welle spoke with herbert salber , the head of the osce 's conflict prevention center , about the mission . deutsche welle : what are the criteria for selecting the police being sent as part of the osce mission ? herbert salber : they should be experienced police officers in the police services of osce member countries .
they should speak one of the languages spoken on the ground .
this means , realistically , we should concentrate on russian .
we believe we will find a sufficient number of candidates in member states .
they should also be familiar with the political and cultural conditions in the region .
at the beginning we want to send 52 police officers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police came under attack during the violence which countries will they come from ? many delegations have expressed interest , and we sent out a note to our member states with a request for candidate nominations .
i estimate that we will receive nominations from 10 to 15 , if not 20 , participant countries .
naturally , this will include many from central and eastern europe , and even central asia , because there we have russian speakers . what will be the goal of the mission ? the main goal is to establish stability and reliability in southern kyrgyzstan .
the mission will counsel the kyrgyz police and accompany them in the implementation of their duties .
they will also monitor the kyrgyz police and look closely at how they go about dealing with difficult situations .
we have to assume that trust between the kyrgyz people and law enforcement has been lost in the areas where there was violence in june .
this must be restored .
the efforts of our police will depend on this .
it should be noted that these police will be unarmed , and thus they will not be a police squad , but rather they will be there to counsel , to observe and to report .

why is this ? this is difficult to understand because the president of the country , roza otunbayeva , and relevant members of the kyrgyz leadership have always assured us that such a police mission was wanted and welcome .
i can only imagine that some elements want to obstruct the arrival of the police mission because they have an interest in hiding certain things from the international community .

it 's not our mission to comment on an investigation into what happened in june .
the kyrgyz government has developed an idea to have an investigative commission shed light on this topic .
the commission should also possibly be internationally equipped .
this has nothing to do with the police mission , which is concerned with what happens between now and the future , as opposed to the commission , which will examine the past . when will the mission begin ? the mission can begin with initial delegations in the middle of august .
we have established procedures in the osce for how we select the members of our international missions .
we need to adhere to these procedures in order for all candidates to have a fair chance and so osce member states are able to participate in the mission according to their wishes .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de finance -pipe- 24.07.2010 ' bank stress tests not rigorous enough , ' say analysts großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : analysts warn that strong results reflect a weak test despite better-than-expected stress test results , analysts warn that europe 's banks still need reform .
the test criteria , they say , were too weak .
europe now waits to see if the tests will impress investors . despite the positive results of europe 's bank stress tests , analysts and politicians are warning that the banking system is still in dire need of reform .
all but seven of the 91 banks tested in 20 countries passed the test .
investors are expected to focus on the dozen or so banks that just made the cut when markets reopen monday .
many have criticized the tests , published friday by the london-based committee of european banking supervisors , for lacking rigorousness .
german banks ' robust ' ?
although german finance minister wolfgang schaeuble celebrated the test results as a sign that german banks were " robust and resistant , " green party financial spokesman gerhard schick warned that " german banks are and remain unsteady . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics say schaeuble is celebrating too soon meanwhile , the president of the german institute for economic research -lrb- diw -rrb- , klaus zimmermann , expressed fears the positive results may give the " fatal impression " that a full overhaul of the bank system is no longer necessary .
" unlike in the us , the necessary european financial reforms have n't even been fully discussed , let alone finalized or implemented , " zimmermann told the website of financial daily handelsblatt .
' declaring the corpses dead ' analysts also said the exams themselves were not tough enough to bring any good , other than restoring some confidence to investors .
according to daniel gros , head of the centre for european policy studies , europe wasted an opportunity by not pushing harder criteria - and by leaving crisis scenarios out of the tests , such as a real estate crash , the collapse of the raw goods market or total defaults by a eurozone state - as could have occurred in greece earlier this year .
" the stress test declared the corpses as dead , " gros told german news agency dpa in brussels .
" we know a bit more now about where the shaky candidates are .
but the test did n't bring any real insights . "
gros believes the results of the tests will have the intended effect of calming investors ' fears but lamented that " whitewashed " test criteria prevented what could have been an " opportunity to really clean up the banking sector . "
the economist warned that european banks still often had very close ties to each other , meaning that " if a large bank fails , the whole system would be in danger . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe waits to see how the world 's markets will react to the results nervous wait the stress tests were never expected to show massive capital shortfalls , as european banks had already raised about 300 billion euros -lrb- $ 387 billion -rrb- since the financial crisis began , including 170 billion euros of government support to 34 banks .
" with so few banks failing , investors will question whether the economic scenarios -lsb- simulated by the tests -rsb- are sufficiently severe , " said jon peace , analyst at financial group nomura in london .

the test criteria , they say , were too weak .
europe now waits to see if the tests will impress investors . despite the positive results of europe 's bank stress tests , analysts and politicians are warning that the banking system is still in dire need of reform .
all but seven of the 91 banks tested in 20 countries passed the test .
investors are expected to focus on the dozen or so banks that just made the cut when markets reopen monday .
many have criticized the tests , published friday by the london-based committee of european banking supervisors , for lacking rigorousness .
german banks ' robust ' ?
although german finance minister wolfgang schaeuble celebrated the test results as a sign that german banks were " robust and resistant , " green party financial spokesman gerhard schick warned that " german banks are and remain unsteady . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics say schaeuble is celebrating too soon meanwhile , the president of the german institute for economic research -lrb- diw -rrb- , klaus zimmermann , expressed fears the positive results may give the " fatal impression " that a full overhaul of the bank system is no longer necessary .
" unlike in the us , the necessary european financial reforms have n't even been fully discussed , let alone finalized or implemented , " zimmermann told the website of financial daily handelsblatt .
' declaring the corpses dead ' analysts also said the exams themselves were not tough enough to bring any good , other than restoring some confidence to investors .
according to daniel gros , head of the centre for european policy studies , europe wasted an opportunity by not pushing harder criteria - and by leaving crisis scenarios out of the tests , such as a real estate crash , the collapse of the raw goods market or total defaults by a eurozone state - as could have occurred in greece earlier this year .
" the stress test declared the corpses as dead , " gros told german news agency dpa in brussels .
" we know a bit more now about where the shaky candidates are .
but the test did n't bring any real insights . "
gros believes the results of the tests will have the intended effect of calming investors ' fears but lamented that " whitewashed " test criteria prevented what could have been an " opportunity to really clean up the banking sector . "
the economist warned that european banks still often had very close ties to each other , meaning that " if a large bank fails , the whole system would be in danger . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe waits to see how the world 's markets will react to the results nervous wait the stress tests were never expected to show massive capital shortfalls , as european banks had already raised about 300 billion euros -lrb- $ 387 billion -rrb- since the financial crisis began , including 170 billion euros of government support to 34 banks .
" with so few banks failing , investors will question whether the economic scenarios -lsb- simulated by the tests -rsb- are sufficiently severe , " said jon peace , analyst at financial group nomura in london .
" it will be natural for investors to consider the margin by which banks passed , " he added , citing a good pass margin for scandinavian and british banks , with greek , spanish and italian banks faring less well .
hypo real estate was the only german financial institution to fail the test .
bundesbank vice president franz-christoph zeitler explained that " in the regulators ' view , no other german bank needs further capital , " maintaining , however that " the markets could see that differently . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : focus : bayreuth festival 2010 black market flourishes at bayreuth festival bayreuth impresario wolfgang wagner dies at 90 music -pipe- 24.07.2010 wagner 's legacy comes to life at 99th bayreuth festival großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : visitors at the festspielhaus the fanfare from the bayreuth festival , opening on july 25 , summons an audience ranging from prominent politicians to die-hard wagnerians .
composer richard wagner 's legacy has magnetic power . apart from political and show business celebrities , the bayreuth festival audience includes many for whom simply being there means that a dream has come true .
christian thielemann , the conductor of the current production of the four-opera cycle " the ring of the nibelung , " told deutsche welle that this enthusiasm is shared by the artists as well . " they are completely focused on these works by wagner , and they sacrifice their summer vacations just for the privilege of being here , " said thielemann , " nobody comes to bayreuth who does n't truly want to . " held this year for the 99th time , the bayreuth festival continues to fascinate and intrigue : it is the high point of the festival summer in germany , the world 's most prestigious opera festival , a mecca for wagnerians , a mega-event . it began with a dream bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : richard wagner : a small man with big ambitions the festival opens with a new production of richard wagner 's romantic opera " lohengrin , " marking the bayreuth debuts of stage director hans neuenfels and conductor andris nelsons .
this season 's line-up also includes recent productions of " parsifal , " " the mastersingers of nuremburg " and the tetralogy " the ring of the nibelung . " " richard wagner writes operas for a theater that does n't exist , " a contemporary of the composer once noted .
rather than bowing to reality , wagner achieved his dream of a festival theater of his own design .
it was to be provisional , yet set standards for the future .
the opposite happened instead : richard wagner 's festspielhaus still stands and remains unique . " i think it was a clever idea for wagner not to place his festspielhaus in munich but in a small town in a beautiful countryside , here in bayreuth , where there are no distractions , " said tankred dorst , the stage director of the current " ring " production in bayreuth .
" you always see people walking around with their nose buried in a libretto . " the magic green hill bayreuth , population 72,000 , is in upper franconia in the state of bavaria , not far from nuremberg .
the festspielhaus is located just outside the city , a short drive up the so-called " green hill . "
that drive is a ritual that has been performed countless times by wagnerians , opera heavyweights and amateur spectators alike . " this ' green hill ' is of course a very special location , and not only for artistic reasons , " said 84-year-old dorst , " it has a mythological dimension itself that belongs to german history - the good , and even more so , the bad parts .
when i drive up the hill to rehearsals in the morning , it reminds me of that time in german history when wagner and his works played a different role , during the nazi regime . " bildunterschrift : bayreuth 's festspielhaus , pictured in 1897 the composer had died half a century before the nazis came to power in the 1930 's .
festival director winifred wagner was a member of the nazi party and a personal friend of adolf hitler .
since the founding of the bayreuth festival in 1876 , it has been led exclusively by members of the wagner family .
richard was followed by his widow cosima , son siegfried , daughter-in-law winifred , grandsons wieland and wolfgang and now , since 2008 , great-granddaughters eva and katharina . no other festival can boast a comparable dynastic tradition .
" the history of this family itself is almost like a shakespearean drama , " said juergen flimm , stage director of " the ring " from 2000 to 2005 . described by german author thomas mann as " probably the greatest artistic talent in human history , " richard wagner continues to have a polarizing effect on people .
whether the festspielhaus audience applauds or boos does n't necessarily depend on high expectations or performance quality . " people in bayreuth tend to go slightly ballistic , which is very interesting and sometimes rather alarming , " said flimm .
" this is , after all , a theater , and what occurs onstage is strongly subjective .
you might respond by saying , ' that 's different - i do n't like that , ' but not ' that 's wrong ! '
in art , there is no such thing as right or wrong . " man and myth " in his gods , man paints a picture of himself , " observed german author friedrich schiller .
richard wagner understood the meaning of myth as a reflection of human qualities on a meta-level .
his sources of inspiration included greek mythology and literature , where the gods are equipped with human weaknesses and failings . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german author and director tankred dorst has also written complex epic dramas in his own stories , wagner lent human attributes to germanic gods like wotan , fricka and loge .
he made tales and myths of the holy grail comprehensible through character development - adding the sensuous , emotional quality of music . wagner 's music dramas are complex , multi-layered and lengthy .
understanding and appreciating them requires repeated exposure to the plot and the music . over time , wagner and his works themselves have become cult .
the opening of the festival to modern mass media in recent years , with public viewing , internet streaming and podcasts from the festspielhaus , has n't reduced public interest in the festival . opening day on july 25 , with the familiar ritual of celebrities , security personnel and spectators , will be followed by 29 additional performances , concluding on august 28 . author : rick fulker editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

however , despite its best efforts , the german league continues to struggle to hang on to big names when wealthier clubs come calling .
once again , check books are being waved in the direction of players who have lit up the bundesliga since arriving in germany , and with some clubs bucking the financial trend of austerity thanks to the deep pockets of benevolent billionaire owners , it looks like the league could lose a few of its shining lights before the new season starts .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : big clubs have been tracking dzeko for the past two seasons unsurprisingly , the name on the top of most lists is that of edin dzeko .
the 24-year-old wolfsburg hotshot has been linked with a move away from the bundesliga since he helped shoot the wolves to title glory almost two years ago .
the bosnian international has long been linked with a move to ac milan but the rossoneri may regret not pouncing sooner because dzeko 's second season as top scorer in the bundesliga has alerted manchester city .
the arab-owned manchester club is swimming through the transfer waters this summer like a ravenous great white and has caught dzeko 's scent - which could mean bad news for milan , chelsea , juventus and anyone else not put off by his 40 million-euro -lrb- $ 51million -rrb- release clause .
the big spending mancunians still remain interested in the man who scored 23 league goals in germany last season despite dzeko favouring a move to italy .
if his preferred club ac milan can find the money - or if manchester suddenly appeals - this may be the season that the bosnian hit-man finally moves on to pastures new .
dortmund bracing for bids on trio of top stars another striker who may be following him out of the bundesliga is lucas barrios .
after enjoying a great season with borussia dortmund and featuring in paraguay 's world cup campaign in south africa , the brazilian-born forward is apparently attracting interest from ac milan , fiorentina , manchester city and napoli .
barrios has four years left on his current contract at bvb but could still move on for a fee of around 10 million euros .
dortmund will be eager to hang on to the striker who helped them finish in their best position in years last season but could be tempted to sell if the price is right .

rumours of his unhappiness in dortmund surfaced during last season 's winter transfer window and the 28-year-old has done little to scotch the now deafening chatter that he could be ready to take a step up after two years and 15 goals .
dortmund could be looking at quite a depleted squad should another much sought-after player finally move on after months of speculation .
serbian defender nevan subotic has been touted as a potential replacement for fellow countryman and international defensive partner nemanja vidic , should the current manchester united hard man move to real madrid .
man united have moved to the head of the queue for subotic since vidic made it clear that he fancies a switch to spain but premiership rivals chelsea and arsenal , who have been sniffing around for some time , wo n't give up so easily .
however , bvb 's asking price of 29 million euros for the 21-year-old center-back could prove a stumbling block to any move .
altintop to earn final big pay day with free transfer bildunterschrift : after many years service in the bundesliga , hamit altintop may be on the move to pastures new one player who wo n't cost a cent in transfer fees is hamit altintop .
the versatile turkish midfielder has been a stalwart of the bundesliga with schalke 04 , and more recently bayern munich. but as younger players have come through , altintop has slowly begun his descent through the pecking order at the german champions .
with a wealth of experience and no huge price tag on his head , altintop could be one of the free transfers of the season for a club looking for a wise old head to conduct things from midfield .
in turn , a new challenge may get a few more years service out of a player who has given his all in the bundesliga .
english premiership sides aston villa and tottenham hotspur are said to be interested .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : focus : bayreuth festival 2010 black market flourishes at bayreuth festival bayreuth impresario wolfgang wagner dies at 90 music -pipe- 24.07.2010 wagner 's legacy comes to life at 99th bayreuth festival großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : visitors at the festspielhaus the fanfare from the bayreuth festival , opening on july 25 , summons an audience ranging from prominent politicians to die-hard wagnerians .
composer richard wagner 's legacy has magnetic power . apart from political and show business celebrities , the bayreuth festival audience includes many for whom simply being there means that a dream has come true .
christian thielemann , the conductor of the current production of the four-opera cycle " the ring of the nibelung , " told deutsche welle that this enthusiasm is shared by the artists as well . " they are completely focused on these works by wagner , and they sacrifice their summer vacations just for the privilege of being here , " said thielemann , " nobody comes to bayreuth who does n't truly want to . " held this year for the 99th time , the bayreuth festival continues to fascinate and intrigue : it is the high point of the festival summer in germany , the world 's most prestigious opera festival , a mecca for wagnerians , a mega-event . it began with a dream bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : richard wagner : a small man with big ambitions the festival opens with a new production of richard wagner 's romantic opera " lohengrin , " marking the bayreuth debuts of stage director hans neuenfels and conductor andris nelsons .
this season 's line-up also includes recent productions of " parsifal , " " the mastersingers of nuremburg " and the tetralogy " the ring of the nibelung . " " richard wagner writes operas for a theater that does n't exist , " a contemporary of the composer once noted .
rather than bowing to reality , wagner achieved his dream of a festival theater of his own design .
it was to be provisional , yet set standards for the future .
the opposite happened instead : richard wagner 's festspielhaus still stands and remains unique . " i think it was a clever idea for wagner not to place his festspielhaus in munich but in a small town in a beautiful countryside , here in bayreuth , where there are no distractions , " said tankred dorst , the stage director of the current " ring " production in bayreuth .
" you always see people walking around with their nose buried in a libretto . " the magic green hill bayreuth , population 72,000 , is in upper franconia in the state of bavaria , not far from nuremberg .
the festspielhaus is located just outside the city , a short drive up the so-called " green hill . "
that drive is a ritual that has been performed countless times by wagnerians , opera heavyweights and amateur spectators alike . " this ' green hill ' is of course a very special location , and not only for artistic reasons , " said 84-year-old dorst , " it has a mythological dimension itself that belongs to german history - the good , and even more so , the bad parts .
when i drive up the hill to rehearsals in the morning , it reminds me of that time in german history when wagner and his works played a different role , during the nazi regime . " bildunterschrift : bayreuth 's festspielhaus , pictured in 1897 the composer had died half a century before the nazis came to power in the 1930 's .
festival director winifred wagner was a member of the nazi party and a personal friend of adolf hitler .
since the founding of the bayreuth festival in 1876 , it has been led exclusively by members of the wagner family .
richard was followed by his widow cosima , son siegfried , daughter-in-law winifred , grandsons wieland and wolfgang and now , since 2008 , great-granddaughters eva and katharina . no other festival can boast a comparable dynastic tradition .
" the history of this family itself is almost like a shakespearean drama , " said juergen flimm , stage director of " the ring " from 2000 to 2005 . described by german author thomas mann as " probably the greatest artistic talent in human history , " richard wagner continues to have a polarizing effect on people .
whether the festspielhaus audience applauds or boos does n't necessarily depend on high expectations or performance quality . " people in bayreuth tend to go slightly ballistic , which is very interesting and sometimes rather alarming , " said flimm .
" this is , after all , a theater , and what occurs onstage is strongly subjective .
you might respond by saying , ' that 's different - i do n't like that , ' but not ' that 's wrong ! '
in art , there is no such thing as right or wrong . " man and myth " in his gods , man paints a picture of himself , " observed german author friedrich schiller .
richard wagner understood the meaning of myth as a reflection of human qualities on a meta-level .
his sources of inspiration included greek mythology and literature , where the gods are equipped with human weaknesses and failings . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german author and director tankred dorst has also written complex epic dramas in his own stories , wagner lent human attributes to germanic gods like wotan , fricka and loge .
he made tales and myths of the holy grail comprehensible through character development - adding the sensuous , emotional quality of music . wagner 's music dramas are complex , multi-layered and lengthy .
understanding and appreciating them requires repeated exposure to the plot and the music . over time , wagner and his works themselves have become cult .
the opening of the festival to modern mass media in recent years , with public viewing , internet streaming and podcasts from the festspielhaus , has n't reduced public interest in the festival . opening day on july 25 , with the familiar ritual of celebrities , security personnel and spectators , will be followed by 29 additional performances , concluding on august 28 . author : rick fulker editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

serbian defender nevan subotic has been touted as a potential replacement for fellow countryman and international defensive partner nemanja vidic , should the current manchester united hard man move to real madrid .
man united have moved to the head of the queue for subotic since vidic made it clear that he fancies a switch to spain but premiership rivals chelsea and arsenal , who have been sniffing around for some time , wo n't give up so easily .
however , bvb 's asking price of 29 million euros for the 21-year-old center-back could prove a stumbling block to any move .
altintop to earn final big pay day with free transfer bildunterschrift : after many years service in the bundesliga , hamit altintop may be on the move to pastures new one player who wo n't cost a cent in transfer fees is hamit altintop .
the versatile turkish midfielder has been a stalwart of the bundesliga with schalke 04 , and more recently bayern munich. but as younger players have come through , altintop has slowly begun his descent through the pecking order at the german champions .
with a wealth of experience and no huge price tag on his head , altintop could be one of the free transfers of the season for a club looking for a wise old head to conduct things from midfield .
in turn , a new challenge may get a few more years service out of a player who has given his all in the bundesliga .
english premiership sides aston villa and tottenham hotspur are said to be interested .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : focus : bayreuth festival 2010 black market flourishes at bayreuth festival bayreuth impresario wolfgang wagner dies at 90 music -pipe- 24.07.2010 wagner 's legacy comes to life at 99th bayreuth festival großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : visitors at the festspielhaus the fanfare from the bayreuth festival , opening on july 25 , summons an audience ranging from prominent politicians to die-hard wagnerians .
composer richard wagner 's legacy has magnetic power . apart from political and show business celebrities , the bayreuth festival audience includes many for whom simply being there means that a dream has come true .
christian thielemann , the conductor of the current production of the four-opera cycle " the ring of the nibelung , " told deutsche welle that this enthusiasm is shared by the artists as well . " they are completely focused on these works by wagner , and they sacrifice their summer vacations just for the privilege of being here , " said thielemann , " nobody comes to bayreuth who does n't truly want to . " held this year for the 99th time , the bayreuth festival continues to fascinate and intrigue : it is the high point of the festival summer in germany , the world 's most prestigious opera festival , a mecca for wagnerians , a mega-event . it began with a dream bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : richard wagner : a small man with big ambitions the festival opens with a new production of richard wagner 's romantic opera " lohengrin , " marking the bayreuth debuts of stage director hans neuenfels and conductor andris nelsons .
this season 's line-up also includes recent productions of " parsifal , " " the mastersingers of nuremburg " and the tetralogy " the ring of the nibelung . " " richard wagner writes operas for a theater that does n't exist , " a contemporary of the composer once noted .
rather than bowing to reality , wagner achieved his dream of a festival theater of his own design .
it was to be provisional , yet set standards for the future .
the opposite happened instead : richard wagner 's festspielhaus still stands and remains unique . " i think it was a clever idea for wagner not to place his festspielhaus in munich but in a small town in a beautiful countryside , here in bayreuth , where there are no distractions , " said tankred dorst , the stage director of the current " ring " production in bayreuth .
" you always see people walking around with their nose buried in a libretto . " the magic green hill bayreuth , population 72,000 , is in upper franconia in the state of bavaria , not far from nuremberg .
the festspielhaus is located just outside the city , a short drive up the so-called " green hill . "
that drive is a ritual that has been performed countless times by wagnerians , opera heavyweights and amateur spectators alike . " this ' green hill ' is of course a very special location , and not only for artistic reasons , " said 84-year-old dorst , " it has a mythological dimension itself that belongs to german history - the good , and even more so , the bad parts .
when i drive up the hill to rehearsals in the morning , it reminds me of that time in german history when wagner and his works played a different role , during the nazi regime . " bildunterschrift : bayreuth 's festspielhaus , pictured in 1897 the composer had died half a century before the nazis came to power in the 1930 's .
festival director winifred wagner was a member of the nazi party and a personal friend of adolf hitler .
since the founding of the bayreuth festival in 1876 , it has been led exclusively by members of the wagner family .
richard was followed by his widow cosima , son siegfried , daughter-in-law winifred , grandsons wieland and wolfgang and now , since 2008 , great-granddaughters eva and katharina . no other festival can boast a comparable dynastic tradition .
" the history of this family itself is almost like a shakespearean drama , " said juergen flimm , stage director of " the ring " from 2000 to 2005 . described by german author thomas mann as " probably the greatest artistic talent in human history , " richard wagner continues to have a polarizing effect on people .
whether the festspielhaus audience applauds or boos does n't necessarily depend on high expectations or performance quality . " people in bayreuth tend to go slightly ballistic , which is very interesting and sometimes rather alarming , " said flimm .
" this is , after all , a theater , and what occurs onstage is strongly subjective .
you might respond by saying , ' that 's different - i do n't like that , ' but not ' that 's wrong ! '
in art , there is no such thing as right or wrong . " man and myth " in his gods , man paints a picture of himself , " observed german author friedrich schiller .
richard wagner understood the meaning of myth as a reflection of human qualities on a meta-level .
his sources of inspiration included greek mythology and literature , where the gods are equipped with human weaknesses and failings . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german author and director tankred dorst has also written complex epic dramas in his own stories , wagner lent human attributes to germanic gods like wotan , fricka and loge .
he made tales and myths of the holy grail comprehensible through character development - adding the sensuous , emotional quality of music . wagner 's music dramas are complex , multi-layered and lengthy .
understanding and appreciating them requires repeated exposure to the plot and the music . over time , wagner and his works themselves have become cult .
the opening of the festival to modern mass media in recent years , with public viewing , internet streaming and podcasts from the festspielhaus , has n't reduced public interest in the festival . opening day on july 25 , with the familiar ritual of celebrities , security personnel and spectators , will be followed by 29 additional performances , concluding on august 28 . author : rick fulker editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

composer richard wagner 's legacy has magnetic power . apart from political and show business celebrities , the bayreuth festival audience includes many for whom simply being there means that a dream has come true .
christian thielemann , the conductor of the current production of the four-opera cycle " the ring of the nibelung , " told deutsche welle that this enthusiasm is shared by the artists as well . " they are completely focused on these works by wagner , and they sacrifice their summer vacations just for the privilege of being here , " said thielemann , " nobody comes to bayreuth who does n't truly want to . " held this year for the 99th time , the bayreuth festival continues to fascinate and intrigue : it is the high point of the festival summer in germany , the world 's most prestigious opera festival , a mecca for wagnerians , a mega-event . it began with a dream bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : richard wagner : a small man with big ambitions the festival opens with a new production of richard wagner 's romantic opera " lohengrin , " marking the bayreuth debuts of stage director hans neuenfels and conductor andris nelsons .
this season 's line-up also includes recent productions of " parsifal , " " the mastersingers of nuremburg " and the tetralogy " the ring of the nibelung . " " richard wagner writes operas for a theater that does n't exist , " a contemporary of the composer once noted .
rather than bowing to reality , wagner achieved his dream of a festival theater of his own design .
it was to be provisional , yet set standards for the future .
the opposite happened instead : richard wagner 's festspielhaus still stands and remains unique . " i think it was a clever idea for wagner not to place his festspielhaus in munich but in a small town in a beautiful countryside , here in bayreuth , where there are no distractions , " said tankred dorst , the stage director of the current " ring " production in bayreuth .
" you always see people walking around with their nose buried in a libretto . " the magic green hill bayreuth , population 72,000 , is in upper franconia in the state of bavaria , not far from nuremberg .
the festspielhaus is located just outside the city , a short drive up the so-called " green hill . "
that drive is a ritual that has been performed countless times by wagnerians , opera heavyweights and amateur spectators alike . " this ' green hill ' is of course a very special location , and not only for artistic reasons , " said 84-year-old dorst , " it has a mythological dimension itself that belongs to german history - the good , and even more so , the bad parts .
when i drive up the hill to rehearsals in the morning , it reminds me of that time in german history when wagner and his works played a different role , during the nazi regime . " bildunterschrift : bayreuth 's festspielhaus , pictured in 1897 the composer had died half a century before the nazis came to power in the 1930 's .
festival director winifred wagner was a member of the nazi party and a personal friend of adolf hitler .
since the founding of the bayreuth festival in 1876 , it has been led exclusively by members of the wagner family .
richard was followed by his widow cosima , son siegfried , daughter-in-law winifred , grandsons wieland and wolfgang and now , since 2008 , great-granddaughters eva and katharina . no other festival can boast a comparable dynastic tradition .
" the history of this family itself is almost like a shakespearean drama , " said juergen flimm , stage director of " the ring " from 2000 to 2005 . described by german author thomas mann as " probably the greatest artistic talent in human history , " richard wagner continues to have a polarizing effect on people .
whether the festspielhaus audience applauds or boos does n't necessarily depend on high expectations or performance quality . " people in bayreuth tend to go slightly ballistic , which is very interesting and sometimes rather alarming , " said flimm .
" this is , after all , a theater , and what occurs onstage is strongly subjective .
you might respond by saying , ' that 's different - i do n't like that , ' but not ' that 's wrong ! '
in art , there is no such thing as right or wrong . " man and myth " in his gods , man paints a picture of himself , " observed german author friedrich schiller .
richard wagner understood the meaning of myth as a reflection of human qualities on a meta-level .
his sources of inspiration included greek mythology and literature , where the gods are equipped with human weaknesses and failings . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german author and director tankred dorst has also written complex epic dramas in his own stories , wagner lent human attributes to germanic gods like wotan , fricka and loge .

europe now waits to see if the tests will impress investors . despite the positive results of europe 's bank stress tests , analysts and politicians are warning that the banking system is still in dire need of reform .
all but seven of the 91 banks tested in 20 countries passed the test .
investors are expected to focus on the dozen or so banks that just made the cut when markets reopen monday .
many have criticized the tests , published friday by the london-based committee of european banking supervisors , for lacking rigorousness .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics say schaeuble is celebrating too soon meanwhile , the president of the german institute for economic research -lrb- diw -rrb- , klaus zimmermann , expressed fears the positive results may give the " fatal impression " that a full overhaul of the bank system is no longer necessary .
" unlike in the us , the necessary european financial reforms have n't even been fully discussed , let alone finalized or implemented , " zimmermann told the website of financial daily handelsblatt .
' declaring the corpses dead ' analysts also said the exams themselves were not tough enough to bring any good , other than restoring some confidence to investors .
according to daniel gros , head of the centre for european policy studies , europe wasted an opportunity by not pushing harder criteria - and by leaving crisis scenarios out of the tests , such as a real estate crash , the collapse of the raw goods market or total defaults by a eurozone state - as could have occurred in greece earlier this year .
" the stress test declared the corpses as dead , " gros told german news agency dpa in brussels .
" we know a bit more now about where the shaky candidates are .
but the test did n't bring any real insights . "
gros believes the results of the tests will have the intended effect of calming investors ' fears but lamented that " whitewashed " test criteria prevented what could have been an " opportunity to really clean up the banking sector . "
the economist warned that european banks still often had very close ties to each other , meaning that " if a large bank fails , the whole system would be in danger . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe waits to see how the world 's markets will react to the results nervous wait the stress tests were never expected to show massive capital shortfalls , as european banks had already raised about 300 billion euros -lrb- $ 387 billion -rrb- since the financial crisis began , including 170 billion euros of government support to 34 banks .
" with so few banks failing , investors will question whether the economic scenarios -lsb- simulated by the tests -rsb- are sufficiently severe , " said jon peace , analyst at financial group nomura in london .
" it will be natural for investors to consider the margin by which banks passed , " he added , citing a good pass margin for scandinavian and british banks , with greek , spanish and italian banks faring less well .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de finance -pipe- 24.07.2010 ' bank stress tests not rigorous enough , ' say analysts großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : analysts warn that strong results reflect a weak test despite better-than-expected stress test results , analysts warn that europe 's banks still need reform .
the test criteria , they say , were too weak .
europe now waits to see if the tests will impress investors . despite the positive results of europe 's bank stress tests , analysts and politicians are warning that the banking system is still in dire need of reform .
all but seven of the 91 banks tested in 20 countries passed the test .
investors are expected to focus on the dozen or so banks that just made the cut when markets reopen monday .
many have criticized the tests , published friday by the london-based committee of european banking supervisors , for lacking rigorousness .
german banks ' robust ' ?
although german finance minister wolfgang schaeuble celebrated the test results as a sign that german banks were " robust and resistant , " green party financial spokesman gerhard schick warned that " german banks are and remain unsteady . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics say schaeuble is celebrating too soon meanwhile , the president of the german institute for economic research -lrb- diw -rrb- , klaus zimmermann , expressed fears the positive results may give the " fatal impression " that a full overhaul of the bank system is no longer necessary .
" unlike in the us , the necessary european financial reforms have n't even been fully discussed , let alone finalized or implemented , " zimmermann told the website of financial daily handelsblatt .
' declaring the corpses dead ' analysts also said the exams themselves were not tough enough to bring any good , other than restoring some confidence to investors .
according to daniel gros , head of the centre for european policy studies , europe wasted an opportunity by not pushing harder criteria - and by leaving crisis scenarios out of the tests , such as a real estate crash , the collapse of the raw goods market or total defaults by a eurozone state - as could have occurred in greece earlier this year .
" the stress test declared the corpses as dead , " gros told german news agency dpa in brussels .
" we know a bit more now about where the shaky candidates are .
but the test did n't bring any real insights . "
gros believes the results of the tests will have the intended effect of calming investors ' fears but lamented that " whitewashed " test criteria prevented what could have been an " opportunity to really clean up the banking sector . "
the economist warned that european banks still often had very close ties to each other , meaning that " if a large bank fails , the whole system would be in danger . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe waits to see how the world 's markets will react to the results nervous wait the stress tests were never expected to show massive capital shortfalls , as european banks had already raised about 300 billion euros -lrb- $ 387 billion -rrb- since the financial crisis began , including 170 billion euros of government support to 34 banks .
" with so few banks failing , investors will question whether the economic scenarios -lsb- simulated by the tests -rsb- are sufficiently severe , " said jon peace , analyst at financial group nomura in london .
" it will be natural for investors to consider the margin by which banks passed , " he added , citing a good pass margin for scandinavian and british banks , with greek , spanish and italian banks faring less well .
hypo real estate was the only german financial institution to fail the test .
bundesbank vice president franz-christoph zeitler explained that " in the regulators ' view , no other german bank needs further capital , " maintaining , however that " the markets could see that differently . "
the euro fell late friday just after the publication of test results , but quickly bounced back .
us stocks also rose slightly on friday .
european governments must now wait for markets to reopen on monday in order to get the full global reaction .

the test criteria , they say , were too weak .
europe now waits to see if the tests will impress investors . despite the positive results of europe 's bank stress tests , analysts and politicians are warning that the banking system is still in dire need of reform .
all but seven of the 91 banks tested in 20 countries passed the test .
investors are expected to focus on the dozen or so banks that just made the cut when markets reopen monday .
many have criticized the tests , published friday by the london-based committee of european banking supervisors , for lacking rigorousness .
german banks ' robust ' ?
although german finance minister wolfgang schaeuble celebrated the test results as a sign that german banks were " robust and resistant , " green party financial spokesman gerhard schick warned that " german banks are and remain unsteady . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics say schaeuble is celebrating too soon meanwhile , the president of the german institute for economic research -lrb- diw -rrb- , klaus zimmermann , expressed fears the positive results may give the " fatal impression " that a full overhaul of the bank system is no longer necessary .
" unlike in the us , the necessary european financial reforms have n't even been fully discussed , let alone finalized or implemented , " zimmermann told the website of financial daily handelsblatt .
' declaring the corpses dead ' analysts also said the exams themselves were not tough enough to bring any good , other than restoring some confidence to investors .
according to daniel gros , head of the centre for european policy studies , europe wasted an opportunity by not pushing harder criteria - and by leaving crisis scenarios out of the tests , such as a real estate crash , the collapse of the raw goods market or total defaults by a eurozone state - as could have occurred in greece earlier this year .
" the stress test declared the corpses as dead , " gros told german news agency dpa in brussels .

the test criteria , they say , were too weak .
europe now waits to see if the tests will impress investors . despite the positive results of europe 's bank stress tests , analysts and politicians are warning that the banking system is still in dire need of reform .
all but seven of the 91 banks tested in 20 countries passed the test .
investors are expected to focus on the dozen or so banks that just made the cut when markets reopen monday .
many have criticized the tests , published friday by the london-based committee of european banking supervisors , for lacking rigorousness .
german banks ' robust ' ?
although german finance minister wolfgang schaeuble celebrated the test results as a sign that german banks were " robust and resistant , " green party financial spokesman gerhard schick warned that " german banks are and remain unsteady . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics say schaeuble is celebrating too soon meanwhile , the president of the german institute for economic research -lrb- diw -rrb- , klaus zimmermann , expressed fears the positive results may give the " fatal impression " that a full overhaul of the bank system is no longer necessary .
" unlike in the us , the necessary european financial reforms have n't even been fully discussed , let alone finalized or implemented , " zimmermann told the website of financial daily handelsblatt .
' declaring the corpses dead ' analysts also said the exams themselves were not tough enough to bring any good , other than restoring some confidence to investors .
according to daniel gros , head of the centre for european policy studies , europe wasted an opportunity by not pushing harder criteria - and by leaving crisis scenarios out of the tests , such as a real estate crash , the collapse of the raw goods market or total defaults by a eurozone state - as could have occurred in greece earlier this year .
" the stress test declared the corpses as dead , " gros told german news agency dpa in brussels .
" we know a bit more now about where the shaky candidates are .
but the test did n't bring any real insights . "
