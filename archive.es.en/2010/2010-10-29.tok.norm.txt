program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de work -pipe- 29.10.2010 berlin : home of the poor , unpaid intern großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's mayor , klaus wowereit , once proudly announced that his city was " poor but sexy , " but with this rather chic poverty comes a cynical exploitation of eager young workers . the uk media was recently full of reports about the national union of journalists ' new campaign , cashback for interns , in which the union encouraged people who had completed internships to sue their former employers for unpaid wages .
while some thought the move was silly and a rather pitiful example of the nanny state , many others supported the campaign , claiming a fair wage was a rather obvious basic reward for a hard day 's work . while the nuj campaign undoubtedly gathers momentum over in england , one can only hope that something similar starts here in berlin ; a movement dedicated to reigning in the blatant exploitation of students and new graduates in the workplace .
poor and sexy berlin may be but it is also rife with stinginess when it comes to doling out the wages . a typical internship - or praktikum as they 're known - in berlin runs for around six months , during which time the " successful " applicant is expected to work from monday to friday , often putting in shifts of over eight hours , for no money whatsoever .
the employer therefore only needs to take on two keen young workers and he or she has extra much-needed manpower for a whole year and it does n't cost a nickel . my former flatmate once got an actual job in a shop and was put on a six-month trial period during which time she received a lower-than-average trainee wage while her employer was not legally obliged to make any health insurance or social security contributions .
lo and behold once the trial was over , the employer decided she was n't right for the job and let her go .
when she returned to pick up some bits and pieces she 'd left behind , there was a new girl doing exactly the same job in her place , presumably on yet another trial run .
little wonder that berlin city magazine , zitty , recently ran with " generation praktikant " -lrb- generation intern -rrb- as their cover story . bildunterschrift : interns need to juggle many tasks at the same time to impress potential employers - but how are they expected to pay the bills ? call me mr jump-to-conclusions but i would imagine as an employer that i could pretty accurately assess a person 's suitability for a job after two or three days ; a trial period of six months does seem rather excessive but it is yet another way to milk a year 's hard graft out of two poor saps without having to cough up for the privilege . a friend of a friend told me a tale of a girl who had re-located to berlin from the states on the promise of a job at a local radio station only to be on the phone to her parents in tears three months later as she 'd still not received any money .
she had , however , very promptly received an eviction notice on her flat , given that she had n't paid any rent .
everyone has some internship-related horror story that either happened to them or a friend . now it is n't , of course , all doom and gloom .
a good number of students and graduates take on internship positions fully aware that they are n't going to receive any money and do so with other funding behind them -lrb- savings or money from their parents , for example -rrb- and use their six months with the company to gain some valuable work experience .
sadly though , internships never seem to be offered on the basis that the employer is scouting for hot new talent to add to his or her company .
interns seem to be cynically picked like cherries just so there is always someone there to answer the phone and take the mail to the post office . this exploitation of workers really does need to be addressed , especially in berlin , a city which exists on the labors of the intern and those who do either one-euro-an-hour job while also receiving welfare money .
it 's all very well gaining industry experience but if no one in the industry is prepared to give you a proper job you might as well sign up for unemployment benefit and spend your day doing crosswords . since i would n't be in the least bit surprised if even the city 's decision-makers were themselves a rotating army of interns , it seems unlikely that the problem will be tackled at an official level anytime soon .
so it 's time for a revolution .
berlin 's interns need to strike , even just for a day , for fair pay , while employers look on in horror as virtually every business in the city grinds to an absolute halt . of course , if revolution is n't your thing , just do the unpaid berlin internship and head off to munich .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 29.10.2010 dw pundits channel esoteric predictions in bundesliga match day ten großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can the spirit world be of help to our bundesliga predictors ?
there 's no need to question a perfectly reasonable on-the-nose prediction - at least not when it comes from afar .
another realm , in this case .
here dw sports forward the spooky ones ' predictions for match day ten . match day nine ’ s predictions saw the dw pundits increase their week-on-week total with six points .
not such a special tally , but one that included a surprising spot-on forecast of werder bremen 's 4-1 victory away to borussia moenchengladbach .
to fight the unsubstantiated and scurrilous accusations of match-fixing that have been swirling , dw 's experts are ready to come clean - the spirits made them do it .
they 're still under their control , in fact : here are their picks for week ten .
friday , oct .
29 bayern - freiburg few would have predicted freiburg being above bayern after nine games but the league table does n't lie .
bayern are suffering a crisis of confidence and fluidity in the bundesliga , while the freiburgers are just enjoying their early season ride .
robin dutt ’ s men have notched points against their mid-table rivals but have come unstuck against the better teams .
ordinarily bayern would be included in that latter category , but right now they 're adrift in mediocrity .
however , at home , with a partisan crowd expecting a return to the status quo , bayern should edge it .
prediction : bayern 2-1 saturday , oct .
30 bremen - nuremberg bremen have managed to steady their ship after a choppy start to the season and are unbeaten in five league games .
they still lie in eighth place but show signs of rediscovering the consistency which could see them climb the table .
but this is werder , remember , and nothing can be taken for granted .
they can win 4-1 one week and get thumped by the same scoreline the next .
nuremberg are experiencing the pendulum of form ; winning one week , losing the next .
if it continues to swing , after beating wolfsburg last week , then bremen should come out on top in this one .
prediction : bremen 3-0 wolfsburg - stuttgart bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : keller has got stuttgart winning again and out of danger jens keller is unbeaten as stuttgart coach after taking over from the sacked christian gross two weeks ago , and the four points his team has eked out in their last two league games have taken them out of the drop zone .
confidence is slowly coming back , boosted by recent europa league and dfb cup wins , and while it is still a nascent recovery , vfb do have some momentum at last .
wolfsburg , on the other hand , have lost theirs .
two defeats and a loss have put the skids under their own revival and coming into this match , stuttgart look to have the edge .
stuttgart : 1-0 cologne - hamburg the enigma that is hamburger sv continues to confound .
after an impressive start followed by a worrying slump , hsv are rebuilding their campaign by going three games unbeaten .
two wins and a goalless draw against bayern could have been seen as a solid base to push on , but their 5-2 cup hammering at the hands of frankfurt in midweek may have released old demons .
cologne , however , appear to have little in their locker which could inflict such a heavy defeat on hamburg - in fact , any kind of defeat looks unlikely .
the bottom club have a solitary win to their name and their second isn ’ t likely to come this weekend , even with the benefit of home advantage .
prediction : hamburg 2-0 kaiserslautern - moenchengladbach kaiserslautern 's last win - the impressive 2-0 defeat of bayern - seems a long time ago .
indeed since those heady days of august , when kaiserslautern notched two wins on the trot , all that has followed is a downward spiral of six reversals and a draw , leaving the red devils hovering perilously over the drop zone .
they got a welcome boost with a midweek cup win - but then again so did gladbach .
however , given that gladbach slipped to second-from-bottom after their sixth defeat of the season last weekend , little should be read into that .
these are two teams in deep , albeit it early , trouble .
their desperation may cancel each other out .
prediction : draw 2-2 st. pauli - frankfurt given they were afforded little chance of staying up this season , st- pauli 's current position in 10th could already be hailed as a triumph .
as long as they do n't start panicking that last week 's defeat to stuttgart and their slight tumble down the league is the start of their predicted demise , st. pauli have the guts to slog it out and remain in the bundesliga .
frankfurt sit a place above them on goal difference with an exact replica of the hamburg club 's record to date .
eintracht come into this game on the back of three wins and a draw so they will be up for it against pauli .
expect a gutsy battle .
prediction : draw 1-1 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : raul did n't expect to swap real madrid for a relegation fight schalke - leverkusen things still look desperate for schalke .
their only victory in the league this season , ground out against freiburg over a month ago , looks increasingly like a false dawn .
a defeat and three draws suggests little has been put right since .
their home form has been pitiful and leverkusen will certainly fancy their chances when they make the journey to gelsenkirchen on saturday .
leverkusen have had plenty of joy on their travels .
unbeaten in four away games with three wins and a draw , it appears to be advantage bayer .
schalke 's revival will have to wait at least another week .
prediction : leverkusen 3-2 sunday , oct .
31 mainz - dortmund halloween came early for dortmund in the dfb cup on wednesday .
instead of the treat they might have expected from a fixture against a third division side , they got tricked in a 4-2 loss on penalties at kickers offenbach .
bvb , who have been on fire in front of goal , will be wondering how they went 120 minutes without scoring and will be hoping they find they find the target ahead of this first-versus-second clash .
mainz , who returned to the summit last weekend , also lost in the cup to alemannia aachen so this game is primed for both teams to put their woes behind them .
dortmund will have the added incentive of going top if they win and could take heart from the fact that mainz 's only league defeat so far has come at home .
prediction : dortmund 3-1 hoffenheim - hanover bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hannover 's players are n't suffering from altitude sickness hanover continues to overachieve this season .
up to third after last week 's victory over cologne , they look to have put the brakes on the minor slide which affected them after losing to st. pauli at the start of october .
hoffenheim , meanwhile , are still challenging at the top end but their own push for the summit has suffered a few hiccups in recent weeks .
after three wins on the bounce at the start of the season , it took hoffenheim until two weeks ago to record their next .
keeping dortmund at bay in last week 's 1-1 draw suggests they 've found their balance again but hanover may edge this to keep their impressive campaign on track .

dw 's ramon garcia-ziemsen writes about how germany 's history was deliberately repressed . yes , it is shocking how german diplomats were complicit in the holocaust in the second world war , and how they were involved in its implementation .
it 's unbelievable how much continuity there was in the diplomatic personnel after 1945 in germany : men who had participated in the nazi extermination policies later made careers and protected each other , even before their involvement was made public .
but it 's just as incredible how long it has taken : that only now , 65 years on , this has come to the attention of the wider german public .
in 1979 , a book was published by a british historian about the participation of the foreign office in the so called " final solution , " the nazi description for the murder of european jews .
the book describes what the nature of the foreign office 's participation in the holocaust was , how deportation orders were signed there , how the office was a systematic element of the nazi killing machine .
and even back in the 1950s , there was clear evidence showing that the foreign office was certainly not a " school of passive resistance " against hitler , as it liked to present itself in the post-war period .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ramon garcia-ziemsen head of dw 's german culture department a lot was known , a lot was forgotten in short : much was known .
and almost everything was forgotten .
how the germans dealt with the third reich is not as exemplary as it has often been perceived around the world , it is also a history of forgetting and repressing .
the elites have often knowingly prevented a discussion about their past .
and the public allowed this discourse to be prevented .
how could this happen ? after 1945 , german society was always looking for the " good , " for the " other germany " - the " other germany " that had remained innocent , that had perhaps not been openly resistant , but did not allow itself to be sucked into nazi ideology ; which had remained resistant , which had rejected the nazi madness , and of which one might even be proud .
because it wanted a fresh start , the young germany did not think it could live with the weight of such a large feeling of guilt .
myths and collective guilt and in this way the yarn was spun : first came the myth that many germans had only found out about the holocaust in 1945 from the allies .
the myth was born that only a small group around hitler had known what had happened in concentration camps like auschwitz and dachau .
the germans were a nation led astray .
this position was also of course a reaction to the similarly blanket collective guilt theory purported by the allies after the war . then came the myth of the armed forces : that the soldiers had played almost no part in hitler 's atrocities - and besides that everything had been carried out under orders .
both theories were exposed by historians as false only decades later , from the 1970s , through studies , books and exhibitions .
large parts of the population knew not only why jewish friends and neighbors had suddenly disappeared , but they had also assisted with this disappearance .
soldiers took part in shooting jews - voluntarily and not under orders .
but again it took years and decades , well into the 1990s , until this knowledge resulted in a public debate and led to a real demystification . where the myth certainly still existed was in the foreign office , one of the last places where the fairy tale of the " other germany " could live on .
the solidarity of the diplomats worked so well and perhaps the respect for the future german president richard von weizsaecker was too great .
weizsaecker 's father ernst was a top diplomat , who supported the nazi ideology in the foreign office .
but germany 's longing for this " other germany " , which existed much less than most germans had thought , was also too great .

" we want to get rid of the procedure where you have to translate a patent into all languages in order for it to be valid , " he told deutsche welle .
" patents should be valid across the eu if they are in english , french or german .

german chancellor angela merkel said the leaders had had a " profound and difficult discussion , " and other participants described the discussions as heated and emotional . merkel added that she was satisfied with the outcome of the debate : " we have promoted our essential points , " she said .
" everyone is in agreement that a limited change to the lisbon treaty is necessary . " eu council president herman van rompuy told a news conference that " important decisions to strengthen the eurozone " had been taken .
" we recommend a robust and credible permanent crisis resolution mechanism to safeguard the financial stability of the eurozone as a whole , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : van rompuy is now charged with proposing the amendments merkel stressed that the current , limited protection of loan guarantees for euro states was not a permanent solution under the current treaty conditions .
she said the new crisis mechanism would only be " valid for cases where the stability of the euro as a whole is at risk . " " we said once more that ... should a country ever need to make use of this , it would be faced with very strict requirements , " she said . opposition to budget increase some non-eurozone states threw around their weight in the discussions , like the united kingdom , which sought to cap the eu 's budget next year , and poland , which wants the calculation of its national debt to take into account costly pension reforms . merkel chimed in , saying , " if we have to reduce our budget at home - we do this at the federal level by more than 3 percent - it can not be that the european budget rises by nearly 6 percent . " the leaders asked van rompuy to prepare potential changes to the lisbon treaty ahead of another eu summit in december .
the changes are to be agreed on by mid-2013 , the expiration date of a 750-billion euro -lrb- $ 1 trillion -rrb- fund set up last may to reassure markets that greece 's debt crisis would not spill over to the rest of the continent . tough reform process bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy and merkel jointly proposed tough sanctions on overspenders germany , europe 's largest economy , led the calls at the summit for tougher penalties on states that exceed the eurozone 's limit on budget deficits of 3 percent of gross domestic product . merkel and french president nicolas sarkozy had called for the suspension of voting rights of members who flout budget rules , but such a reform was unpopular with several smaller states . " if treaty change is to reduce the rights of member states on voting , i find it unacceptable , and , frankly speaking , it is not realistic , " european commission president jose manuel barroso said . it would also likely turn into a political nightmare for national governments .
the lisbon treaty took 10 years of wrangling to enact , after challenges in national courts and referendum failures in france , ireland and the netherlands . " many countries do not want a huge treaty reform , and therefore we are trying to narrow it down to a very limited treaty change that should be acceptable for countries without having to face referendums , " swedish prime minister fredrik reinfeldt said . although the proposals were weaker than merkel had pushed for , she said the eu had underlined that " private investors will not be able to make money or speculate against the euro .

however , the outcome might well have an impact on washington 's relations with the rest of the world . when american voters head to the polls to elect a new house of representatives and 37 new senators , there is perhaps nothing that sums up their sentiment better than the old adage from bill clinton 's 1992 presidential campaign : " it 's the economy , stupid . " and with unemployment hovering at close to 10 percent , a collapsed housing market and a stuttering economy , there certainly is ample reason for voters to worry about their personal well-being . to be sure , there are definitely enough foreign policy issues that would merit the electorate 's attention too : a war in afghanistan , now in its ninth year , which is not going well , a tense situation in the middle east with us-sponsored negotiations between israelis and palestinians always on the verge of collapse , iran 's alleged efforts to acquire nuclear weapons still unresolved and north korea in the middle of a leadership handover .
but all of that does n't really matter , says thomas e. mann , a congressional scholar at the brookings institution in washington : " for the most part the public is so distressed and pessimistic about the economy that that is what 's dominating the campaigns , " he told deutsche welle . international issues on the sidelines the only way foreign policy gets any traction as an election topic is when it relates to a domestic issue , adds mann .
china , for example , plays a role in certain campaigns when trade issues or the currency imbalances are discussed .
and mexico is addressed when illegal immigration and its effect on the economy is debated .
other than that , domestic issues , especially the economy , dominate the midterm elections almost completely .
while foreign policy issues have no impact on the election , the results of the elections could well have an impact on us foreign policy .
if , as most pollsters predict , the republicans win back the house of representatives and stand a small chance of also retaking the senate , this will have implications for the way washington carries out international relations . " there are a lot of republican candidates running for the house who are tea party candidates , who are very hard-right candidates , " douglas foyle , a professor at wesleyan university who has researched about the impact of domestic issues on international relations , told deutsche welle .

" and pulling back in foreign policy in terms of the military is not something that traditionally the republicans would do . "
future of the republican party his colleague mann also sees a chance of a " significant number of tea party-based republicans coming in to the senate with rather extreme views on the limited role for government and really hostile sentiments toward globalization and international organizations . "
he adds : " if this group were to gain the upper hand in the republican party we would have one center-left party and one extreme-right party in the country .
that 's not reassuring . "
regardless how the soul searching of the republican party ends , the party 's majority in one or both chambers of congress would have an impact on us foreign policy in any case . while the president has considerably more leeway to pursue his own course in international affairs than on the domestic front and also serves as the commander-in-chief of the military , he ca n't disregard congress entirely .
first , congress approves the budget and through that can influence policy as well . " let 's look at afghanistan for example , " juergen chrobog , germany 's former ambassador in washington who now heads the bmw foundation herbert quandt , told deutsche welle : " the troops and the war must be financed .
and here the members of congress have an enormous lever : they can give more or less . "

even with a sizeable majority in both chambers during the first half of his term , president barack obama could n't get a climate change treaty through congress .
with a republican majority in one or both chambers of congress , predict the experts , a climate change treaty which must be ratified by a two-thirds majority in the senate is all but dead .
the fate of the new start treaty , the follow-up to the original nuclear disarmament pact signed by republican icon ronald reagan and soviet leader mikhail gorbachev , is also uncertain . the lame duck senate will vote on the issue in the middle of november . whether it goes through is still unclear .
if it does n't , it seems rather unlikely that it will have an easier time in the new senate . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us voters worry primarily about the economy and about losing their jobs " i do n't see any major treaties like these being ratified , at least not easily , " says chrobog .
" i hope that president obama and the democrats at least keep their majority in the senate . "
the likely swing to the right in the midterm elections could make us foreign policy less predictable and more complicated , argue the experts .
still , they add , europeans should n't fret too much about the outcome of the polls . " i think the most important thing for those looking from abroad at this election is to realize this is not fundamentally about ideology , " says mann .
" this is about americans being scared and sour and pessimistic about our economic well-being and instinctively voting against the party in power . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de film -pipe- 29.10.2010 berlin and beyond film festival highlights plight of immigrants großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a still from " home from home " directed by sung hyung-cho 's chancellor angela merkel recently said that multi-culturalism in germany had " utterly failed . "
as the debate rages on , one film festival in san francisco aims to offer a more nuanced portrait of immigration . when 8,000 korean nurses arrived in germany during the 1960s , few of them thought they 'd be staying in the country longer than their three-year contracts allowed . thirty-seven years later , three of these women found themselves retiring to korea with their husbands , the sole german residents of the seaside " german village . "
replete with red-tiled roofs , garden gnomes and black bread for breakfast , the retirement community and its german inhabitants have become a must-see for many korean tourists .
they 've also provided the inspiration for sung hyung-cho 's wistful documentary , " endstation der sehnsuechte " -lrb- " home from home " -rrb- .
cameras followed these three couples through their everyday lives – watching as one man created his own sausages so he could get a taste of home and following another as he learned a traditional korean dance .
the women have different experiences , showing a real wariness toward settling in ; as the movie played on , the discomfort these women feel in their birthland grew acute .
" we have no homeland and that is the tragedy of our lives , " one of the women said .
though she 'd long dreamed of returning to korea , she told the camera , " the longer i live here , the more i think of germany . "
heimat has no plural it 's this cross-cultural nostalgia that director sung-hyung cho wanted to address in her film .
" a lot of people have two heimat s -lrb- homes -rrb- , " she told an audience at the berlin and beyond film festival running this week in san francisco , california .
" in german , there is no possibility to have two homes – the word heimat has no plural .
but i have two homes : korea and germany .
when i finally felt at home in germany , i simultaneously became frightened that i would n't be able to feel at home again in korea . "
it was that feeling that drove cho to make the documentary – to explore the depths of homesickness , the bizarre emotional pull that two very different places can have on migrants .
an emphasis on diversity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : another festival highlight was comedy-drama " wedding fever in campobello " " home from home " was just one of several award-winning films playing at the festival this week that added nuance to the extended immigrant experience while showing the diversity of contemporary germany .
" die fremde " -lrb- " when we leave " -rrb- , the festival 's centerpiece film directed by feo aladag , highlighted the plight of a german-born turk who struggled to survive between two very different worlds in modern-day berlin and istanbul .
it 's quite a different story than that shown in the flashbacks in the romantic comedy " wedding fever in campobello " .
the violence and prejudice that the protagonist encountered just after his arrival in osnabrueck in the 1960s are unflinchingly portrayed .
set alongside the modern-day story of his daughter 's wedding , however , the film showcased what the children of these guest workers have lived through as they 've attempted to balance two worlds , two cultures , two languages .
still , the emphasis on the problems facing immigrants was n't an intentional theme for berlin and beyond , said festival director sophaon sorn .
" we really wanted to empower the festival with a diverse program , one that shows a wide variety of human experience , " said sorn .
" and san francisco is a diverse city , it appreciates diversity , so we tried to find movies that would appeal both within the german community here and extend to a broader community as well . "
rudolf de baey , director of the goethe institute of san francisco , emphasized that diversity and immigration are both powerful elements in german society today .
" the reality of germany is that it 's just not a blonde-haired , blue-eyed country any more .

there 's no need to question a perfectly reasonable on-the-nose prediction - at least not when it comes from afar .
another realm , in this case .
here dw sports forward the spooky ones ' predictions for match day ten . match day nine ’ s predictions saw the dw pundits increase their week-on-week total with six points .
not such a special tally , but one that included a surprising spot-on forecast of werder bremen 's 4-1 victory away to borussia moenchengladbach .
to fight the unsubstantiated and scurrilous accusations of match-fixing that have been swirling , dw 's experts are ready to come clean - the spirits made them do it .
they 're still under their control , in fact : here are their picks for week ten .
friday , oct .
29 bayern - freiburg few would have predicted freiburg being above bayern after nine games but the league table does n't lie .
bayern are suffering a crisis of confidence and fluidity in the bundesliga , while the freiburgers are just enjoying their early season ride .
robin dutt ’ s men have notched points against their mid-table rivals but have come unstuck against the better teams .
ordinarily bayern would be included in that latter category , but right now they 're adrift in mediocrity .
however , at home , with a partisan crowd expecting a return to the status quo , bayern should edge it .
prediction : bayern 2-1 saturday , oct .
30 bremen - nuremberg bremen have managed to steady their ship after a choppy start to the season and are unbeaten in five league games .
they still lie in eighth place but show signs of rediscovering the consistency which could see them climb the table .
but this is werder , remember , and nothing can be taken for granted .
they can win 4-1 one week and get thumped by the same scoreline the next .
nuremberg are experiencing the pendulum of form ; winning one week , losing the next .
if it continues to swing , after beating wolfsburg last week , then bremen should come out on top in this one .
prediction : bremen 3-0 wolfsburg - stuttgart bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : keller has got stuttgart winning again and out of danger jens keller is unbeaten as stuttgart coach after taking over from the sacked christian gross two weeks ago , and the four points his team has eked out in their last two league games have taken them out of the drop zone .
confidence is slowly coming back , boosted by recent europa league and dfb cup wins , and while it is still a nascent recovery , vfb do have some momentum at last .
wolfsburg , on the other hand , have lost theirs .
two defeats and a loss have put the skids under their own revival and coming into this match , stuttgart look to have the edge .
stuttgart : 1-0 cologne - hamburg the enigma that is hamburger sv continues to confound .
after an impressive start followed by a worrying slump , hsv are rebuilding their campaign by going three games unbeaten .
two wins and a goalless draw against bayern could have been seen as a solid base to push on , but their 5-2 cup hammering at the hands of frankfurt in midweek may have released old demons .
cologne , however , appear to have little in their locker which could inflict such a heavy defeat on hamburg - in fact , any kind of defeat looks unlikely .
the bottom club have a solitary win to their name and their second isn ’ t likely to come this weekend , even with the benefit of home advantage .
prediction : hamburg 2-0 kaiserslautern - moenchengladbach kaiserslautern 's last win - the impressive 2-0 defeat of bayern - seems a long time ago .
indeed since those heady days of august , when kaiserslautern notched two wins on the trot , all that has followed is a downward spiral of six reversals and a draw , leaving the red devils hovering perilously over the drop zone .
they got a welcome boost with a midweek cup win - but then again so did gladbach .
however , given that gladbach slipped to second-from-bottom after their sixth defeat of the season last weekend , little should be read into that .
these are two teams in deep , albeit it early , trouble .
their desperation may cancel each other out .
prediction : draw 2-2 st. pauli - frankfurt given they were afforded little chance of staying up this season , st- pauli 's current position in 10th could already be hailed as a triumph .
as long as they do n't start panicking that last week 's defeat to stuttgart and their slight tumble down the league is the start of their predicted demise , st. pauli have the guts to slog it out and remain in the bundesliga .
frankfurt sit a place above them on goal difference with an exact replica of the hamburg club 's record to date .
eintracht come into this game on the back of three wins and a draw so they will be up for it against pauli .
expect a gutsy battle .
prediction : draw 1-1 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : raul did n't expect to swap real madrid for a relegation fight schalke - leverkusen things still look desperate for schalke .
their only victory in the league this season , ground out against freiburg over a month ago , looks increasingly like a false dawn .
a defeat and three draws suggests little has been put right since .
their home form has been pitiful and leverkusen will certainly fancy their chances when they make the journey to gelsenkirchen on saturday .
leverkusen have had plenty of joy on their travels .
unbeaten in four away games with three wins and a draw , it appears to be advantage bayer .
schalke 's revival will have to wait at least another week .
prediction : leverkusen 3-2 sunday , oct .
31 mainz - dortmund halloween came early for dortmund in the dfb cup on wednesday .
instead of the treat they might have expected from a fixture against a third division side , they got tricked in a 4-2 loss on penalties at kickers offenbach .
bvb , who have been on fire in front of goal , will be wondering how they went 120 minutes without scoring and will be hoping they find they find the target ahead of this first-versus-second clash .
mainz , who returned to the summit last weekend , also lost in the cup to alemannia aachen so this game is primed for both teams to put their woes behind them .
dortmund will have the added incentive of going top if they win and could take heart from the fact that mainz 's only league defeat so far has come at home .
prediction : dortmund 3-1 hoffenheim - hanover bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hannover 's players are n't suffering from altitude sickness hanover continues to overachieve this season .
up to third after last week 's victory over cologne , they look to have put the brakes on the minor slide which affected them after losing to st. pauli at the start of october .
hoffenheim , meanwhile , are still challenging at the top end but their own push for the summit has suffered a few hiccups in recent weeks .
after three wins on the bounce at the start of the season , it took hoffenheim until two weeks ago to record their next .
keeping dortmund at bay in last week 's 1-1 draw suggests they 've found their balance again but hanover may edge this to keep their impressive campaign on track .
prediction : hannover 1-0 last week 's results : 6 points hamburg - bayern 0-0 -lrb- dw prediction : 1-2 -rrb- frankfurt - schalke 0-0 -lrb- dw prediction : 2-2 -rrb- moenchengladbach - werder bremen 1-4 -lrb- dw prediction : 1-4 -rrb- freiburg - kaiserslautern 2-1 -lrb- dw prediction : 1-1 -rrb- hanover - cologne 2-1 -lrb- dw prediction : 1-0 -rrb- nuremberg - wolfsburg 2-1 -lrb- dw prediction : 1-2 -rrb- dortmund - hoffenheim 1-1 -lrb- dw prediction : 2-0 -rrb- leverkusen - mainz 0-1 -lrb- dw prediction : 2-1 -rrb- stuttgart - st.pauli 2-0 -lrb- dw prediction : 1-2 -rrb- total for the season : 43 three points for a correct score prediction two points for a correct margin prediction one point for a correct winner prediction author : nick amies editor : matt hermann send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

"
as the debate rages on , one film festival in san francisco aims to offer a more nuanced portrait of immigration . when 8,000 korean nurses arrived in germany during the 1960s , few of them thought they 'd be staying in the country longer than their three-year contracts allowed . thirty-seven years later , three of these women found themselves retiring to korea with their husbands , the sole german residents of the seaside " german village . "
replete with red-tiled roofs , garden gnomes and black bread for breakfast , the retirement community and its german inhabitants have become a must-see for many korean tourists .
they 've also provided the inspiration for sung hyung-cho 's wistful documentary , " endstation der sehnsuechte " -lrb- " home from home " -rrb- .
cameras followed these three couples through their everyday lives – watching as one man created his own sausages so he could get a taste of home and following another as he learned a traditional korean dance .
the women have different experiences , showing a real wariness toward settling in ; as the movie played on , the discomfort these women feel in their birthland grew acute .
" we have no homeland and that is the tragedy of our lives , " one of the women said .
though she 'd long dreamed of returning to korea , she told the camera , " the longer i live here , the more i think of germany . "
heimat has no plural it 's this cross-cultural nostalgia that director sung-hyung cho wanted to address in her film .
" a lot of people have two heimat s -lrb- homes -rrb- , " she told an audience at the berlin and beyond film festival running this week in san francisco , california .
" in german , there is no possibility to have two homes – the word heimat has no plural .
but i have two homes : korea and germany .
when i finally felt at home in germany , i simultaneously became frightened that i would n't be able to feel at home again in korea . "
it was that feeling that drove cho to make the documentary – to explore the depths of homesickness , the bizarre emotional pull that two very different places can have on migrants .
an emphasis on diversity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : another festival highlight was comedy-drama " wedding fever in campobello " " home from home " was just one of several award-winning films playing at the festival this week that added nuance to the extended immigrant experience while showing the diversity of contemporary germany .
" die fremde " -lrb- " when we leave " -rrb- , the festival 's centerpiece film directed by feo aladag , highlighted the plight of a german-born turk who struggled to survive between two very different worlds in modern-day berlin and istanbul .
it 's quite a different story than that shown in the flashbacks in the romantic comedy " wedding fever in campobello " .
the violence and prejudice that the protagonist encountered just after his arrival in osnabrueck in the 1960s are unflinchingly portrayed .
set alongside the modern-day story of his daughter 's wedding , however , the film showcased what the children of these guest workers have lived through as they 've attempted to balance two worlds , two cultures , two languages .
still , the emphasis on the problems facing immigrants was n't an intentional theme for berlin and beyond , said festival director sophaon sorn .
" we really wanted to empower the festival with a diverse program , one that shows a wide variety of human experience , " said sorn .
" and san francisco is a diverse city , it appreciates diversity , so we tried to find movies that would appeal both within the german community here and extend to a broader community as well . "
rudolf de baey , director of the goethe institute of san francisco , emphasized that diversity and immigration are both powerful elements in german society today .
" the reality of germany is that it 's just not a blonde-haired , blue-eyed country any more .
and i think these films reflect that . "

however , the outcome might well have an impact on washington 's relations with the rest of the world . when american voters head to the polls to elect a new house of representatives and 37 new senators , there is perhaps nothing that sums up their sentiment better than the old adage from bill clinton 's 1992 presidential campaign : " it 's the economy , stupid . " and with unemployment hovering at close to 10 percent , a collapsed housing market and a stuttering economy , there certainly is ample reason for voters to worry about their personal well-being . to be sure , there are definitely enough foreign policy issues that would merit the electorate 's attention too : a war in afghanistan , now in its ninth year , which is not going well , a tense situation in the middle east with us-sponsored negotiations between israelis and palestinians always on the verge of collapse , iran 's alleged efforts to acquire nuclear weapons still unresolved and north korea in the middle of a leadership handover .
but all of that does n't really matter , says thomas e. mann , a congressional scholar at the brookings institution in washington : " for the most part the public is so distressed and pessimistic about the economy that that is what 's dominating the campaigns , " he told deutsche welle . international issues on the sidelines the only way foreign policy gets any traction as an election topic is when it relates to a domestic issue , adds mann .
china , for example , plays a role in certain campaigns when trade issues or the currency imbalances are discussed .
and mexico is addressed when illegal immigration and its effect on the economy is debated .
other than that , domestic issues , especially the economy , dominate the midterm elections almost completely .
while foreign policy issues have no impact on the election , the results of the elections could well have an impact on us foreign policy .
if , as most pollsters predict , the republicans win back the house of representatives and stand a small chance of also retaking the senate , this will have implications for the way washington carries out international relations . " there are a lot of republican candidates running for the house who are tea party candidates , who are very hard-right candidates , " douglas foyle , a professor at wesleyan university who has researched about the impact of domestic issues on international relations , told deutsche welle .
" they have n't said too much about foreign policy and so it 's anybody 's guess what they are going to do once they get into office . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president barack obama wo n't be able to get a climate change treaty through the new congress what the tea party candidates have said very clearly however , is that they want to balance the budget .
" if they are going to balance the budget , they will have to cut defense spending because that 's about half of all discretionary federal spending , " notes foyle .
" and pulling back in foreign policy in terms of the military is not something that traditionally the republicans would do . "
future of the republican party his colleague mann also sees a chance of a " significant number of tea party-based republicans coming in to the senate with rather extreme views on the limited role for government and really hostile sentiments toward globalization and international organizations . "
he adds : " if this group were to gain the upper hand in the republican party we would have one center-left party and one extreme-right party in the country .
that 's not reassuring . "
regardless how the soul searching of the republican party ends , the party 's majority in one or both chambers of congress would have an impact on us foreign policy in any case . while the president has considerably more leeway to pursue his own course in international affairs than on the domestic front and also serves as the commander-in-chief of the military , he ca n't disregard congress entirely .
first , congress approves the budget and through that can influence policy as well . " let 's look at afghanistan for example , " juergen chrobog , germany 's former ambassador in washington who now heads the bmw foundation herbert quandt , told deutsche welle : " the troops and the war must be financed .
and here the members of congress have an enormous lever : they can give more or less . "
treaties face tough obstacles what 's more , congress is also needed to ratify international treaties .
even with a sizeable majority in both chambers during the first half of his term , president barack obama could n't get a climate change treaty through congress .
with a republican majority in one or both chambers of congress , predict the experts , a climate change treaty which must be ratified by a two-thirds majority in the senate is all but dead .
the fate of the new start treaty , the follow-up to the original nuclear disarmament pact signed by republican icon ronald reagan and soviet leader mikhail gorbachev , is also uncertain . the lame duck senate will vote on the issue in the middle of november . whether it goes through is still unclear .
if it does n't , it seems rather unlikely that it will have an easier time in the new senate . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us voters worry primarily about the economy and about losing their jobs " i do n't see any major treaties like these being ratified , at least not easily , " says chrobog .
" i hope that president obama and the democrats at least keep their majority in the senate . "
the likely swing to the right in the midterm elections could make us foreign policy less predictable and more complicated , argue the experts .
still , they add , europeans should n't fret too much about the outcome of the polls . " i think the most important thing for those looking from abroad at this election is to realize this is not fundamentally about ideology , " says mann .
" this is about americans being scared and sour and pessimistic about our economic well-being and instinctively voting against the party in power . "

but all of that does n't really matter , says thomas e. mann , a congressional scholar at the brookings institution in washington : " for the most part the public is so distressed and pessimistic about the economy that that is what 's dominating the campaigns , " he told deutsche welle . international issues on the sidelines the only way foreign policy gets any traction as an election topic is when it relates to a domestic issue , adds mann .
china , for example , plays a role in certain campaigns when trade issues or the currency imbalances are discussed .
and mexico is addressed when illegal immigration and its effect on the economy is debated .
other than that , domestic issues , especially the economy , dominate the midterm elections almost completely .
while foreign policy issues have no impact on the election , the results of the elections could well have an impact on us foreign policy .
if , as most pollsters predict , the republicans win back the house of representatives and stand a small chance of also retaking the senate , this will have implications for the way washington carries out international relations . " there are a lot of republican candidates running for the house who are tea party candidates , who are very hard-right candidates , " douglas foyle , a professor at wesleyan university who has researched about the impact of domestic issues on international relations , told deutsche welle .
" they have n't said too much about foreign policy and so it 's anybody 's guess what they are going to do once they get into office . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president barack obama wo n't be able to get a climate change treaty through the new congress what the tea party candidates have said very clearly however , is that they want to balance the budget .
" if they are going to balance the budget , they will have to cut defense spending because that 's about half of all discretionary federal spending , " notes foyle .
" and pulling back in foreign policy in terms of the military is not something that traditionally the republicans would do . "
future of the republican party his colleague mann also sees a chance of a " significant number of tea party-based republicans coming in to the senate with rather extreme views on the limited role for government and really hostile sentiments toward globalization and international organizations . "
he adds : " if this group were to gain the upper hand in the republican party we would have one center-left party and one extreme-right party in the country .
that 's not reassuring . "
regardless how the soul searching of the republican party ends , the party 's majority in one or both chambers of congress would have an impact on us foreign policy in any case . while the president has considerably more leeway to pursue his own course in international affairs than on the domestic front and also serves as the commander-in-chief of the military , he ca n't disregard congress entirely .
first , congress approves the budget and through that can influence policy as well . " let 's look at afghanistan for example , " juergen chrobog , germany 's former ambassador in washington who now heads the bmw foundation herbert quandt , told deutsche welle : " the troops and the war must be financed .
and here the members of congress have an enormous lever : they can give more or less . "
treaties face tough obstacles what 's more , congress is also needed to ratify international treaties .
even with a sizeable majority in both chambers during the first half of his term , president barack obama could n't get a climate change treaty through congress .
with a republican majority in one or both chambers of congress , predict the experts , a climate change treaty which must be ratified by a two-thirds majority in the senate is all but dead .
the fate of the new start treaty , the follow-up to the original nuclear disarmament pact signed by republican icon ronald reagan and soviet leader mikhail gorbachev , is also uncertain . the lame duck senate will vote on the issue in the middle of november . whether it goes through is still unclear .
if it does n't , it seems rather unlikely that it will have an easier time in the new senate . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us voters worry primarily about the economy and about losing their jobs " i do n't see any major treaties like these being ratified , at least not easily , " says chrobog .
" i hope that president obama and the democrats at least keep their majority in the senate . "
the likely swing to the right in the midterm elections could make us foreign policy less predictable and more complicated , argue the experts .
still , they add , europeans should n't fret too much about the outcome of the polls . " i think the most important thing for those looking from abroad at this election is to realize this is not fundamentally about ideology , " says mann .
" this is about americans being scared and sour and pessimistic about our economic well-being and instinctively voting against the party in power . "

here dw sports forward the spooky ones ' predictions for match day ten . match day nine ’ s predictions saw the dw pundits increase their week-on-week total with six points .
not such a special tally , but one that included a surprising spot-on forecast of werder bremen 's 4-1 victory away to borussia moenchengladbach .
to fight the unsubstantiated and scurrilous accusations of match-fixing that have been swirling , dw 's experts are ready to come clean - the spirits made them do it .
they 're still under their control , in fact : here are their picks for week ten .
friday , oct .
29 bayern - freiburg few would have predicted freiburg being above bayern after nine games but the league table does n't lie .
bayern are suffering a crisis of confidence and fluidity in the bundesliga , while the freiburgers are just enjoying their early season ride .
robin dutt ’ s men have notched points against their mid-table rivals but have come unstuck against the better teams .
ordinarily bayern would be included in that latter category , but right now they 're adrift in mediocrity .
however , at home , with a partisan crowd expecting a return to the status quo , bayern should edge it .
prediction : bayern 2-1 saturday , oct .
30 bremen - nuremberg bremen have managed to steady their ship after a choppy start to the season and are unbeaten in five league games .
they still lie in eighth place but show signs of rediscovering the consistency which could see them climb the table .
but this is werder , remember , and nothing can be taken for granted .
they can win 4-1 one week and get thumped by the same scoreline the next .
nuremberg are experiencing the pendulum of form ; winning one week , losing the next .
if it continues to swing , after beating wolfsburg last week , then bremen should come out on top in this one .
prediction : bremen 3-0 wolfsburg - stuttgart bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : keller has got stuttgart winning again and out of danger jens keller is unbeaten as stuttgart coach after taking over from the sacked christian gross two weeks ago , and the four points his team has eked out in their last two league games have taken them out of the drop zone .
confidence is slowly coming back , boosted by recent europa league and dfb cup wins , and while it is still a nascent recovery , vfb do have some momentum at last .
wolfsburg , on the other hand , have lost theirs .
two defeats and a loss have put the skids under their own revival and coming into this match , stuttgart look to have the edge .
stuttgart : 1-0 cologne - hamburg the enigma that is hamburger sv continues to confound .
after an impressive start followed by a worrying slump , hsv are rebuilding their campaign by going three games unbeaten .
two wins and a goalless draw against bayern could have been seen as a solid base to push on , but their 5-2 cup hammering at the hands of frankfurt in midweek may have released old demons .
cologne , however , appear to have little in their locker which could inflict such a heavy defeat on hamburg - in fact , any kind of defeat looks unlikely .
the bottom club have a solitary win to their name and their second isn ’ t likely to come this weekend , even with the benefit of home advantage .
prediction : hamburg 2-0 kaiserslautern - moenchengladbach kaiserslautern 's last win - the impressive 2-0 defeat of bayern - seems a long time ago .
indeed since those heady days of august , when kaiserslautern notched two wins on the trot , all that has followed is a downward spiral of six reversals and a draw , leaving the red devils hovering perilously over the drop zone .
they got a welcome boost with a midweek cup win - but then again so did gladbach .
however , given that gladbach slipped to second-from-bottom after their sixth defeat of the season last weekend , little should be read into that .
these are two teams in deep , albeit it early , trouble .
their desperation may cancel each other out .
prediction : draw 2-2 st. pauli - frankfurt given they were afforded little chance of staying up this season , st- pauli 's current position in 10th could already be hailed as a triumph .
as long as they do n't start panicking that last week 's defeat to stuttgart and their slight tumble down the league is the start of their predicted demise , st. pauli have the guts to slog it out and remain in the bundesliga .
frankfurt sit a place above them on goal difference with an exact replica of the hamburg club 's record to date .
eintracht come into this game on the back of three wins and a draw so they will be up for it against pauli .
expect a gutsy battle .
prediction : draw 1-1 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : raul did n't expect to swap real madrid for a relegation fight schalke - leverkusen things still look desperate for schalke .
their only victory in the league this season , ground out against freiburg over a month ago , looks increasingly like a false dawn .
a defeat and three draws suggests little has been put right since .
their home form has been pitiful and leverkusen will certainly fancy their chances when they make the journey to gelsenkirchen on saturday .
leverkusen have had plenty of joy on their travels .
unbeaten in four away games with three wins and a draw , it appears to be advantage bayer .
schalke 's revival will have to wait at least another week .
prediction : leverkusen 3-2 sunday , oct .
31 mainz - dortmund halloween came early for dortmund in the dfb cup on wednesday .
instead of the treat they might have expected from a fixture against a third division side , they got tricked in a 4-2 loss on penalties at kickers offenbach .
bvb , who have been on fire in front of goal , will be wondering how they went 120 minutes without scoring and will be hoping they find they find the target ahead of this first-versus-second clash .
mainz , who returned to the summit last weekend , also lost in the cup to alemannia aachen so this game is primed for both teams to put their woes behind them .
dortmund will have the added incentive of going top if they win and could take heart from the fact that mainz 's only league defeat so far has come at home .
prediction : dortmund 3-1 hoffenheim - hanover bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hannover 's players are n't suffering from altitude sickness hanover continues to overachieve this season .
up to third after last week 's victory over cologne , they look to have put the brakes on the minor slide which affected them after losing to st. pauli at the start of october .
hoffenheim , meanwhile , are still challenging at the top end but their own push for the summit has suffered a few hiccups in recent weeks .
after three wins on the bounce at the start of the season , it took hoffenheim until two weeks ago to record their next .
keeping dortmund at bay in last week 's 1-1 draw suggests they 've found their balance again but hanover may edge this to keep their impressive campaign on track .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de history -pipe- 29.10.2010 opinion : germany 's nazi history is clouded by myths großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the study of the foreign office 's crimes under hitler shows that memories of the nazi period are still dominated by myths .
dw 's ramon garcia-ziemsen writes about how germany 's history was deliberately repressed . yes , it is shocking how german diplomats were complicit in the holocaust in the second world war , and how they were involved in its implementation .
it 's unbelievable how much continuity there was in the diplomatic personnel after 1945 in germany : men who had participated in the nazi extermination policies later made careers and protected each other , even before their involvement was made public .
but it 's just as incredible how long it has taken : that only now , 65 years on , this has come to the attention of the wider german public .
in 1979 , a book was published by a british historian about the participation of the foreign office in the so called " final solution , " the nazi description for the murder of european jews .
the book describes what the nature of the foreign office 's participation in the holocaust was , how deportation orders were signed there , how the office was a systematic element of the nazi killing machine .
and even back in the 1950s , there was clear evidence showing that the foreign office was certainly not a " school of passive resistance " against hitler , as it liked to present itself in the post-war period .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ramon garcia-ziemsen head of dw 's german culture department a lot was known , a lot was forgotten in short : much was known .
and almost everything was forgotten .
how the germans dealt with the third reich is not as exemplary as it has often been perceived around the world , it is also a history of forgetting and repressing .
the elites have often knowingly prevented a discussion about their past .
and the public allowed this discourse to be prevented .
how could this happen ? after 1945 , german society was always looking for the " good , " for the " other germany " - the " other germany " that had remained innocent , that had perhaps not been openly resistant , but did not allow itself to be sucked into nazi ideology ; which had remained resistant , which had rejected the nazi madness , and of which one might even be proud .
because it wanted a fresh start , the young germany did not think it could live with the weight of such a large feeling of guilt .
myths and collective guilt and in this way the yarn was spun : first came the myth that many germans had only found out about the holocaust in 1945 from the allies .
the myth was born that only a small group around hitler had known what had happened in concentration camps like auschwitz and dachau .
the germans were a nation led astray .
this position was also of course a reaction to the similarly blanket collective guilt theory purported by the allies after the war . then came the myth of the armed forces : that the soldiers had played almost no part in hitler 's atrocities - and besides that everything had been carried out under orders .
both theories were exposed by historians as false only decades later , from the 1970s , through studies , books and exhibitions .
large parts of the population knew not only why jewish friends and neighbors had suddenly disappeared , but they had also assisted with this disappearance .
soldiers took part in shooting jews - voluntarily and not under orders .
but again it took years and decades , well into the 1990s , until this knowledge resulted in a public debate and led to a real demystification . where the myth certainly still existed was in the foreign office , one of the last places where the fairy tale of the " other germany " could live on .
the solidarity of the diplomats worked so well and perhaps the respect for the future german president richard von weizsaecker was too great .
weizsaecker 's father ernst was a top diplomat , who supported the nazi ideology in the foreign office .
but germany 's longing for this " other germany " , which existed much less than most germans had thought , was also too great .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de film -pipe- 29.10.2010 berlin and beyond film festival highlights plight of immigrants großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a still from " home from home " directed by sung hyung-cho 's chancellor angela merkel recently said that multi-culturalism in germany had " utterly failed . "
as the debate rages on , one film festival in san francisco aims to offer a more nuanced portrait of immigration . when 8,000 korean nurses arrived in germany during the 1960s , few of them thought they 'd be staying in the country longer than their three-year contracts allowed . thirty-seven years later , three of these women found themselves retiring to korea with their husbands , the sole german residents of the seaside " german village . "
replete with red-tiled roofs , garden gnomes and black bread for breakfast , the retirement community and its german inhabitants have become a must-see for many korean tourists .
they 've also provided the inspiration for sung hyung-cho 's wistful documentary , " endstation der sehnsuechte " -lrb- " home from home " -rrb- .
cameras followed these three couples through their everyday lives – watching as one man created his own sausages so he could get a taste of home and following another as he learned a traditional korean dance .
the women have different experiences , showing a real wariness toward settling in ; as the movie played on , the discomfort these women feel in their birthland grew acute .
" we have no homeland and that is the tragedy of our lives , " one of the women said .
though she 'd long dreamed of returning to korea , she told the camera , " the longer i live here , the more i think of germany . "
heimat has no plural it 's this cross-cultural nostalgia that director sung-hyung cho wanted to address in her film .
" a lot of people have two heimat s -lrb- homes -rrb- , " she told an audience at the berlin and beyond film festival running this week in san francisco , california .
" in german , there is no possibility to have two homes – the word heimat has no plural .
but i have two homes : korea and germany .
when i finally felt at home in germany , i simultaneously became frightened that i would n't be able to feel at home again in korea . "
it was that feeling that drove cho to make the documentary – to explore the depths of homesickness , the bizarre emotional pull that two very different places can have on migrants .
an emphasis on diversity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : another festival highlight was comedy-drama " wedding fever in campobello " " home from home " was just one of several award-winning films playing at the festival this week that added nuance to the extended immigrant experience while showing the diversity of contemporary germany .
" die fremde " -lrb- " when we leave " -rrb- , the festival 's centerpiece film directed by feo aladag , highlighted the plight of a german-born turk who struggled to survive between two very different worlds in modern-day berlin and istanbul .
it 's quite a different story than that shown in the flashbacks in the romantic comedy " wedding fever in campobello " .
the violence and prejudice that the protagonist encountered just after his arrival in osnabrueck in the 1960s are unflinchingly portrayed .
set alongside the modern-day story of his daughter 's wedding , however , the film showcased what the children of these guest workers have lived through as they 've attempted to balance two worlds , two cultures , two languages .
still , the emphasis on the problems facing immigrants was n't an intentional theme for berlin and beyond , said festival director sophaon sorn .
" we really wanted to empower the festival with a diverse program , one that shows a wide variety of human experience , " said sorn .
" and san francisco is a diverse city , it appreciates diversity , so we tried to find movies that would appeal both within the german community here and extend to a broader community as well . "
rudolf de baey , director of the goethe institute of san francisco , emphasized that diversity and immigration are both powerful elements in german society today .
" the reality of germany is that it 's just not a blonde-haired , blue-eyed country any more .
and i think these films reflect that . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de integration -pipe- 29.10.2010 greens propose simplified citizenship laws for retired immigrants großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the proposal would make becoming a citizen easier for some good german is required to get german citizenship .
one lawmaker says it 's time to do long-term immigrants a favor and loosen up that rule . new legislation introduced in the german parliament could allow certain groups to get a german passport more easily and quickly , as well as granting more people the right to hold dual citizenship .
currently , immigrants who want to get german citizenship must take a naturalization test and show that they have a firm grasp of the language .
in addition , they generally have to renounce their previous citizenship .
pensioners who came to the country as immigrants are one of the groups that would benefit most from a change to the law .
if the bill were passed , a person who is over 53 years old and has been living in germany for at least 15 years could apply for a passport without meeting the language requirements .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kilic wants to see an immigrant 's work rewarded " if a person has made a contribution to this society , i want to make it easier for them to become citizens , " green party parliamentarian memet kilic told deutsche welle .
" especially older immigrants - who gave their youth and health to build up this country - should be able to obtain citizenship without a language requirement .
that way , we can win the hearts of their children and grandchildren for this country . "
integration conversation kilic 's bill comes as the integration of immigrants is under the microscope in germany .
chancellor angela merkel , a christian democrat , said earlier this month that multiculturalism had failed in germany .
there have also been repeated calls for immigrants to integrate better into german society by learning the language and customs .
kilic , who was born in turkey , said the legislation he sponsored would be welcome news to immigrants .
" third-generation immigrant children in germany hear three times a day that they do n't belong to this country , " he said .
" what good is that ?
i want to turn the tables . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : integration is hard to define in germany in support of the bill , kilic cited statistics showing that the number of citizens naturalized in germany each year had fallen by 20 percent since 2004 .
this was an indication that becoming a german citizen was simply too difficult , he said .
without citizenship , many of germany 's 6.7 million immigrants do not have the right to vote in the country .
but citizenship goes beyond the legal realm .
" integration means more than simply structural integration , " said guelistan guerbey , a political scientist at berlin 's free university .
" it has a very strong emotional and psychological dimension . "
this is especially true for dual citizens .
if the bill became law , an immigrant would no longer have to give up their passport to become german .
guerbey said this would have a positive effect .
" a person has emotional ties in both directions , " she said , " and dual citizenship is a legal recognition of this emotional state . "
time to learn german but while legal benefits and emotional satisfaction might encourage a retired immigrant with less-than-perfect german to apply for citizenship under the loosened rules of the proposed law , they may never get the chance .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : learning german is essential for integration , says grindel on thursday in the bundestag , reinhard grindel of the governing christian democrats , was clear about what his party thought of the proposal .
" when someone wants to become a german citizen , " grindel said , " then i have to be able to say , as an incentive , that you must learn german if you have n't learned it well enough already .
that 's a part of the integration process - to finally learn german . "
and there is reason to believe that many retired immigrants in germany would n't apply for a german passport if the rules were loosened .
some come from other european union countries , where moving across borders is n't problematic , though they do not have full voting rights in germany .
but kilic says there are some 2,000-3,000 retirees from other countries who would gladly take advantage of the opportunity .

german chancellor angela merkel said the leaders had had a " profound and difficult discussion , " and other participants described the discussions as heated and emotional . merkel added that she was satisfied with the outcome of the debate : " we have promoted our essential points , " she said .
" everyone is in agreement that a limited change to the lisbon treaty is necessary . " eu council president herman van rompuy told a news conference that " important decisions to strengthen the eurozone " had been taken .
" we recommend a robust and credible permanent crisis resolution mechanism to safeguard the financial stability of the eurozone as a whole , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : van rompuy is now charged with proposing the amendments merkel stressed that the current , limited protection of loan guarantees for euro states was not a permanent solution under the current treaty conditions .
she said the new crisis mechanism would only be " valid for cases where the stability of the euro as a whole is at risk . " " we said once more that ... should a country ever need to make use of this , it would be faced with very strict requirements , " she said . opposition to budget increase some non-eurozone states threw around their weight in the discussions , like the united kingdom , which sought to cap the eu 's budget next year , and poland , which wants the calculation of its national debt to take into account costly pension reforms . merkel chimed in , saying , " if we have to reduce our budget at home - we do this at the federal level by more than 3 percent - it can not be that the european budget rises by nearly 6 percent . " the leaders asked van rompuy to prepare potential changes to the lisbon treaty ahead of another eu summit in december .
the changes are to be agreed on by mid-2013 , the expiration date of a 750-billion euro -lrb- $ 1 trillion -rrb- fund set up last may to reassure markets that greece 's debt crisis would not spill over to the rest of the continent . tough reform process bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy and merkel jointly proposed tough sanctions on overspenders germany , europe 's largest economy , led the calls at the summit for tougher penalties on states that exceed the eurozone 's limit on budget deficits of 3 percent of gross domestic product . merkel and french president nicolas sarkozy had called for the suspension of voting rights of members who flout budget rules , but such a reform was unpopular with several smaller states . " if treaty change is to reduce the rights of member states on voting , i find it unacceptable , and , frankly speaking , it is not realistic , " european commission president jose manuel barroso said . it would also likely turn into a political nightmare for national governments .
the lisbon treaty took 10 years of wrangling to enact , after challenges in national courts and referendum failures in france , ireland and the netherlands . " many countries do not want a huge treaty reform , and therefore we are trying to narrow it down to a very limited treaty change that should be acceptable for countries without having to face referendums , " swedish prime minister fredrik reinfeldt said . although the proposals were weaker than merkel had pushed for , she said the eu had underlined that " private investors will not be able to make money or speculate against the euro .

one lawmaker says it 's time to do long-term immigrants a favor and loosen up that rule . new legislation introduced in the german parliament could allow certain groups to get a german passport more easily and quickly , as well as granting more people the right to hold dual citizenship .
currently , immigrants who want to get german citizenship must take a naturalization test and show that they have a firm grasp of the language .
in addition , they generally have to renounce their previous citizenship .
pensioners who came to the country as immigrants are one of the groups that would benefit most from a change to the law .
if the bill were passed , a person who is over 53 years old and has been living in germany for at least 15 years could apply for a passport without meeting the language requirements .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kilic wants to see an immigrant 's work rewarded " if a person has made a contribution to this society , i want to make it easier for them to become citizens , " green party parliamentarian memet kilic told deutsche welle .
" especially older immigrants - who gave their youth and health to build up this country - should be able to obtain citizenship without a language requirement .
that way , we can win the hearts of their children and grandchildren for this country . "
integration conversation kilic 's bill comes as the integration of immigrants is under the microscope in germany .
chancellor angela merkel , a christian democrat , said earlier this month that multiculturalism had failed in germany .
there have also been repeated calls for immigrants to integrate better into german society by learning the language and customs .
kilic , who was born in turkey , said the legislation he sponsored would be welcome news to immigrants .
" third-generation immigrant children in germany hear three times a day that they do n't belong to this country , " he said .
" what good is that ?
i want to turn the tables . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : integration is hard to define in germany in support of the bill , kilic cited statistics showing that the number of citizens naturalized in germany each year had fallen by 20 percent since 2004 .
this was an indication that becoming a german citizen was simply too difficult , he said .
without citizenship , many of germany 's 6.7 million immigrants do not have the right to vote in the country .
but citizenship goes beyond the legal realm .
" integration means more than simply structural integration , " said guelistan guerbey , a political scientist at berlin 's free university .
" it has a very strong emotional and psychological dimension . "
this is especially true for dual citizens .
if the bill became law , an immigrant would no longer have to give up their passport to become german .
guerbey said this would have a positive effect .
" a person has emotional ties in both directions , " she said , " and dual citizenship is a legal recognition of this emotional state . "
time to learn german but while legal benefits and emotional satisfaction might encourage a retired immigrant with less-than-perfect german to apply for citizenship under the loosened rules of the proposed law , they may never get the chance .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : learning german is essential for integration , says grindel on thursday in the bundestag , reinhard grindel of the governing christian democrats , was clear about what his party thought of the proposal .
" when someone wants to become a german citizen , " grindel said , " then i have to be able to say , as an incentive , that you must learn german if you have n't learned it well enough already .
that 's a part of the integration process - to finally learn german . "
and there is reason to believe that many retired immigrants in germany would n't apply for a german passport if the rules were loosened .
some come from other european union countries , where moving across borders is n't problematic , though they do not have full voting rights in germany .
but kilic says there are some 2,000-3,000 retirees from other countries who would gladly take advantage of the opportunity .

there 's no need to question a perfectly reasonable on-the-nose prediction - at least not when it comes from afar .
another realm , in this case .
here dw sports forward the spooky ones ' predictions for match day ten . match day nine ’ s predictions saw the dw pundits increase their week-on-week total with six points .
not such a special tally , but one that included a surprising spot-on forecast of werder bremen 's 4-1 victory away to borussia moenchengladbach .
to fight the unsubstantiated and scurrilous accusations of match-fixing that have been swirling , dw 's experts are ready to come clean - the spirits made them do it .
they 're still under their control , in fact : here are their picks for week ten .
friday , oct .
29 bayern - freiburg few would have predicted freiburg being above bayern after nine games but the league table does n't lie .
bayern are suffering a crisis of confidence and fluidity in the bundesliga , while the freiburgers are just enjoying their early season ride .
robin dutt ’ s men have notched points against their mid-table rivals but have come unstuck against the better teams .
ordinarily bayern would be included in that latter category , but right now they 're adrift in mediocrity .
however , at home , with a partisan crowd expecting a return to the status quo , bayern should edge it .
prediction : bayern 2-1 saturday , oct .
30 bremen - nuremberg bremen have managed to steady their ship after a choppy start to the season and are unbeaten in five league games .
they still lie in eighth place but show signs of rediscovering the consistency which could see them climb the table .
but this is werder , remember , and nothing can be taken for granted .
they can win 4-1 one week and get thumped by the same scoreline the next .
nuremberg are experiencing the pendulum of form ; winning one week , losing the next .
if it continues to swing , after beating wolfsburg last week , then bremen should come out on top in this one .
prediction : bremen 3-0 wolfsburg - stuttgart bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : keller has got stuttgart winning again and out of danger jens keller is unbeaten as stuttgart coach after taking over from the sacked christian gross two weeks ago , and the four points his team has eked out in their last two league games have taken them out of the drop zone .
confidence is slowly coming back , boosted by recent europa league and dfb cup wins , and while it is still a nascent recovery , vfb do have some momentum at last .
wolfsburg , on the other hand , have lost theirs .
two defeats and a loss have put the skids under their own revival and coming into this match , stuttgart look to have the edge .
stuttgart : 1-0 cologne - hamburg the enigma that is hamburger sv continues to confound .
after an impressive start followed by a worrying slump , hsv are rebuilding their campaign by going three games unbeaten .
two wins and a goalless draw against bayern could have been seen as a solid base to push on , but their 5-2 cup hammering at the hands of frankfurt in midweek may have released old demons .
cologne , however , appear to have little in their locker which could inflict such a heavy defeat on hamburg - in fact , any kind of defeat looks unlikely .
the bottom club have a solitary win to their name and their second isn ’ t likely to come this weekend , even with the benefit of home advantage .
prediction : hamburg 2-0 kaiserslautern - moenchengladbach kaiserslautern 's last win - the impressive 2-0 defeat of bayern - seems a long time ago .
indeed since those heady days of august , when kaiserslautern notched two wins on the trot , all that has followed is a downward spiral of six reversals and a draw , leaving the red devils hovering perilously over the drop zone .
they got a welcome boost with a midweek cup win - but then again so did gladbach .
however , given that gladbach slipped to second-from-bottom after their sixth defeat of the season last weekend , little should be read into that .
these are two teams in deep , albeit it early , trouble .
their desperation may cancel each other out .
prediction : draw 2-2 st. pauli - frankfurt given they were afforded little chance of staying up this season , st- pauli 's current position in 10th could already be hailed as a triumph .
as long as they do n't start panicking that last week 's defeat to stuttgart and their slight tumble down the league is the start of their predicted demise , st. pauli have the guts to slog it out and remain in the bundesliga .
frankfurt sit a place above them on goal difference with an exact replica of the hamburg club 's record to date .
eintracht come into this game on the back of three wins and a draw so they will be up for it against pauli .
expect a gutsy battle .
prediction : draw 1-1 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : raul did n't expect to swap real madrid for a relegation fight schalke - leverkusen things still look desperate for schalke .
their only victory in the league this season , ground out against freiburg over a month ago , looks increasingly like a false dawn .
a defeat and three draws suggests little has been put right since .
their home form has been pitiful and leverkusen will certainly fancy their chances when they make the journey to gelsenkirchen on saturday .
leverkusen have had plenty of joy on their travels .
unbeaten in four away games with three wins and a draw , it appears to be advantage bayer .
schalke 's revival will have to wait at least another week .
prediction : leverkusen 3-2 sunday , oct .
31 mainz - dortmund halloween came early for dortmund in the dfb cup on wednesday .
instead of the treat they might have expected from a fixture against a third division side , they got tricked in a 4-2 loss on penalties at kickers offenbach .
bvb , who have been on fire in front of goal , will be wondering how they went 120 minutes without scoring and will be hoping they find they find the target ahead of this first-versus-second clash .
mainz , who returned to the summit last weekend , also lost in the cup to alemannia aachen so this game is primed for both teams to put their woes behind them .
dortmund will have the added incentive of going top if they win and could take heart from the fact that mainz 's only league defeat so far has come at home .
prediction : dortmund 3-1 hoffenheim - hanover bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hannover 's players are n't suffering from altitude sickness hanover continues to overachieve this season .
up to third after last week 's victory over cologne , they look to have put the brakes on the minor slide which affected them after losing to st. pauli at the start of october .
hoffenheim , meanwhile , are still challenging at the top end but their own push for the summit has suffered a few hiccups in recent weeks .
after three wins on the bounce at the start of the season , it took hoffenheim until two weeks ago to record their next .
keeping dortmund at bay in last week 's 1-1 draw suggests they 've found their balance again but hanover may edge this to keep their impressive campaign on track .

but now the eu wants to make patent protection easier and less expensive for the bloc 's inventors . the economic crisis has n't put european companies and independent inventors off investing into research and development .
judged by the some 60,000 patents issued so far this year in germany , the country 's is on track to meet 2009 's total . " companies followed experts ' advice and continued investing in new products - even though we were in the middle of a crisis , " bettina berner of the german patent and trade mark office -lrb- dpma -rrb- said on thursday at the opening ceremony of the 62nd edition of the inventors ' trade fair iena in nuremberg . hoping for a break through bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some 800 products , like an unpoppable tire , are on display at the iena trade fair inventors from 37 countries are currently presenting some 800 new products at the fair , which the organizers said is the largest of its kind in the world . rollerblades , the folding bicycle and inflatable water wings are some of products that went on to conquer the world after being presented in nuremberg .
like their successful predecessors , many inventors at this year 's fair are hoping for break-through deals with the industry so their products can be mass-produced . shaky hands ?
no problem ! bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the willomat tray lets the clumsy wait tables - without worrying guests bernhard haehnsen is one such inventor .
the former ship 's captain grew tired moping up after glasses spilled their contents as his ship pitched on the high seas .
his neighbor barbara willomat designed a way to stabilize glasses and cups on trays .
special suction cups which can be fixed on a tray hold retainers in different shapes and sizes . " when you 're carrying beer glasses on a tray across wobbly grass in a beer garden , the glasses break easily if you do n't attach them , " haehnsen said , adding that the willomat tray could also facilitate work in hospitals and help anyone with shaky hands . register first , then show it bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moreau 's idea came when he saw a report about delayed flights other products on display at iena this year include a foldable chair attached to a suitcase , invented by 12-year-old johannes von moreau , and a remote control for model sports cars which can be used with one hand rather than two . the two inventors kevin hummel and nicolas rathauser have registered their product with the munich-based german patent office -lrb- dpma -rrb- already .
that 's a step experts strongly recommend . " many independent inventors do n't have their products registered before they present them at a trade fair , " said dpma spokesperson berner . lengthy , costly patent process but inventors who want to protect their product in more than one european country currently have to undergo a tedious and costly process that begins with registration at the european patent office . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : inventors register their products here : the european patent office in munich " you have to decide in how many countries you want to have your patent validated , " heinrich dornbusch , a consultant with german patent marketing agency provendis , told deutsche welle .
" currently you have to do that separately in every single member state .
this means you have to invest a lot of time and money . " the costs for registering a product in 13 of the eu 's 27 countries , for instance , can easily amount to more than 20,000 euros -lrb- $ 28,000 -rrb- - 10 times the cost of a patent in the united states , according to dornbusch three languages sufficient the laborious validation process needs simplification , said stefaan de rynck from the internal market and services division at the european commission . " we want to get rid of the procedure where you have to translate a patent into all languages in order for it to be valid , " he told deutsche welle .
" patents should be valid across the eu if they are in english , french or german .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de integration -pipe- 29.10.2010 greens propose simplified citizenship laws for retired immigrants großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the proposal would make becoming a citizen easier for some good german is required to get german citizenship .
one lawmaker says it 's time to do long-term immigrants a favor and loosen up that rule . new legislation introduced in the german parliament could allow certain groups to get a german passport more easily and quickly , as well as granting more people the right to hold dual citizenship .
currently , immigrants who want to get german citizenship must take a naturalization test and show that they have a firm grasp of the language .
in addition , they generally have to renounce their previous citizenship .
pensioners who came to the country as immigrants are one of the groups that would benefit most from a change to the law .
if the bill were passed , a person who is over 53 years old and has been living in germany for at least 15 years could apply for a passport without meeting the language requirements .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kilic wants to see an immigrant 's work rewarded " if a person has made a contribution to this society , i want to make it easier for them to become citizens , " green party parliamentarian memet kilic told deutsche welle .
" especially older immigrants - who gave their youth and health to build up this country - should be able to obtain citizenship without a language requirement .
that way , we can win the hearts of their children and grandchildren for this country . "
integration conversation kilic 's bill comes as the integration of immigrants is under the microscope in germany .
chancellor angela merkel , a christian democrat , said earlier this month that multiculturalism had failed in germany .
there have also been repeated calls for immigrants to integrate better into german society by learning the language and customs .
kilic , who was born in turkey , said the legislation he sponsored would be welcome news to immigrants .
" third-generation immigrant children in germany hear three times a day that they do n't belong to this country , " he said .
" what good is that ?
i want to turn the tables . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : integration is hard to define in germany in support of the bill , kilic cited statistics showing that the number of citizens naturalized in germany each year had fallen by 20 percent since 2004 .
this was an indication that becoming a german citizen was simply too difficult , he said .
without citizenship , many of germany 's 6.7 million immigrants do not have the right to vote in the country .
but citizenship goes beyond the legal realm .
" integration means more than simply structural integration , " said guelistan guerbey , a political scientist at berlin 's free university .
" it has a very strong emotional and psychological dimension . "
this is especially true for dual citizens .
if the bill became law , an immigrant would no longer have to give up their passport to become german .
guerbey said this would have a positive effect .
" a person has emotional ties in both directions , " she said , " and dual citizenship is a legal recognition of this emotional state . "
time to learn german but while legal benefits and emotional satisfaction might encourage a retired immigrant with less-than-perfect german to apply for citizenship under the loosened rules of the proposed law , they may never get the chance .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : learning german is essential for integration , says grindel on thursday in the bundestag , reinhard grindel of the governing christian democrats , was clear about what his party thought of the proposal .
" when someone wants to become a german citizen , " grindel said , " then i have to be able to say , as an incentive , that you must learn german if you have n't learned it well enough already .
that 's a part of the integration process - to finally learn german . "
and there is reason to believe that many retired immigrants in germany would n't apply for a german passport if the rules were loosened .
some come from other european union countries , where moving across borders is n't problematic , though they do not have full voting rights in germany .
but kilic says there are some 2,000-3,000 retirees from other countries who would gladly take advantage of the opportunity .

german chancellor angela merkel said the leaders had had a " profound and difficult discussion , " and other participants described the discussions as heated and emotional . merkel added that she was satisfied with the outcome of the debate : " we have promoted our essential points , " she said .
" everyone is in agreement that a limited change to the lisbon treaty is necessary . " eu council president herman van rompuy told a news conference that " important decisions to strengthen the eurozone " had been taken .
" we recommend a robust and credible permanent crisis resolution mechanism to safeguard the financial stability of the eurozone as a whole , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : van rompuy is now charged with proposing the amendments merkel stressed that the current , limited protection of loan guarantees for euro states was not a permanent solution under the current treaty conditions .
she said the new crisis mechanism would only be " valid for cases where the stability of the euro as a whole is at risk . " " we said once more that ... should a country ever need to make use of this , it would be faced with very strict requirements , " she said . opposition to budget increase some non-eurozone states threw around their weight in the discussions , like the united kingdom , which sought to cap the eu 's budget next year , and poland , which wants the calculation of its national debt to take into account costly pension reforms . merkel chimed in , saying , " if we have to reduce our budget at home - we do this at the federal level by more than 3 percent - it can not be that the european budget rises by nearly 6 percent . " the leaders asked van rompuy to prepare potential changes to the lisbon treaty ahead of another eu summit in december .
the changes are to be agreed on by mid-2013 , the expiration date of a 750-billion euro -lrb- $ 1 trillion -rrb- fund set up last may to reassure markets that greece 's debt crisis would not spill over to the rest of the continent . tough reform process bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy and merkel jointly proposed tough sanctions on overspenders germany , europe 's largest economy , led the calls at the summit for tougher penalties on states that exceed the eurozone 's limit on budget deficits of 3 percent of gross domestic product . merkel and french president nicolas sarkozy had called for the suspension of voting rights of members who flout budget rules , but such a reform was unpopular with several smaller states . " if treaty change is to reduce the rights of member states on voting , i find it unacceptable , and , frankly speaking , it is not realistic , " european commission president jose manuel barroso said . it would also likely turn into a political nightmare for national governments .
the lisbon treaty took 10 years of wrangling to enact , after challenges in national courts and referendum failures in france , ireland and the netherlands . " many countries do not want a huge treaty reform , and therefore we are trying to narrow it down to a very limited treaty change that should be acceptable for countries without having to face referendums , " swedish prime minister fredrik reinfeldt said . although the proposals were weaker than merkel had pushed for , she said the eu had underlined that " private investors will not be able to make money or speculate against the euro .

there 's no need to question a perfectly reasonable on-the-nose prediction - at least not when it comes from afar .
another realm , in this case .
here dw sports forward the spooky ones ' predictions for match day ten . match day nine ’ s predictions saw the dw pundits increase their week-on-week total with six points .
not such a special tally , but one that included a surprising spot-on forecast of werder bremen 's 4-1 victory away to borussia moenchengladbach .
to fight the unsubstantiated and scurrilous accusations of match-fixing that have been swirling , dw 's experts are ready to come clean - the spirits made them do it .
they 're still under their control , in fact : here are their picks for week ten .
friday , oct .
29 bayern - freiburg few would have predicted freiburg being above bayern after nine games but the league table does n't lie .
bayern are suffering a crisis of confidence and fluidity in the bundesliga , while the freiburgers are just enjoying their early season ride .
robin dutt ’ s men have notched points against their mid-table rivals but have come unstuck against the better teams .
ordinarily bayern would be included in that latter category , but right now they 're adrift in mediocrity .
however , at home , with a partisan crowd expecting a return to the status quo , bayern should edge it .
prediction : bayern 2-1 saturday , oct .
30 bremen - nuremberg bremen have managed to steady their ship after a choppy start to the season and are unbeaten in five league games .
they still lie in eighth place but show signs of rediscovering the consistency which could see them climb the table .
but this is werder , remember , and nothing can be taken for granted .
they can win 4-1 one week and get thumped by the same scoreline the next .
nuremberg are experiencing the pendulum of form ; winning one week , losing the next .
if it continues to swing , after beating wolfsburg last week , then bremen should come out on top in this one .
prediction : bremen 3-0 wolfsburg - stuttgart bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : keller has got stuttgart winning again and out of danger jens keller is unbeaten as stuttgart coach after taking over from the sacked christian gross two weeks ago , and the four points his team has eked out in their last two league games have taken them out of the drop zone .
confidence is slowly coming back , boosted by recent europa league and dfb cup wins , and while it is still a nascent recovery , vfb do have some momentum at last .
wolfsburg , on the other hand , have lost theirs .
two defeats and a loss have put the skids under their own revival and coming into this match , stuttgart look to have the edge .
stuttgart : 1-0 cologne - hamburg the enigma that is hamburger sv continues to confound .
after an impressive start followed by a worrying slump , hsv are rebuilding their campaign by going three games unbeaten .
two wins and a goalless draw against bayern could have been seen as a solid base to push on , but their 5-2 cup hammering at the hands of frankfurt in midweek may have released old demons .
cologne , however , appear to have little in their locker which could inflict such a heavy defeat on hamburg - in fact , any kind of defeat looks unlikely .
the bottom club have a solitary win to their name and their second isn ’ t likely to come this weekend , even with the benefit of home advantage .
prediction : hamburg 2-0 kaiserslautern - moenchengladbach kaiserslautern 's last win - the impressive 2-0 defeat of bayern - seems a long time ago .
indeed since those heady days of august , when kaiserslautern notched two wins on the trot , all that has followed is a downward spiral of six reversals and a draw , leaving the red devils hovering perilously over the drop zone .
they got a welcome boost with a midweek cup win - but then again so did gladbach .
however , given that gladbach slipped to second-from-bottom after their sixth defeat of the season last weekend , little should be read into that .
these are two teams in deep , albeit it early , trouble .
their desperation may cancel each other out .
prediction : draw 2-2 st. pauli - frankfurt given they were afforded little chance of staying up this season , st- pauli 's current position in 10th could already be hailed as a triumph .
as long as they do n't start panicking that last week 's defeat to stuttgart and their slight tumble down the league is the start of their predicted demise , st. pauli have the guts to slog it out and remain in the bundesliga .
frankfurt sit a place above them on goal difference with an exact replica of the hamburg club 's record to date .
eintracht come into this game on the back of three wins and a draw so they will be up for it against pauli .
expect a gutsy battle .
prediction : draw 1-1 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : raul did n't expect to swap real madrid for a relegation fight schalke - leverkusen things still look desperate for schalke .
their only victory in the league this season , ground out against freiburg over a month ago , looks increasingly like a false dawn .
a defeat and three draws suggests little has been put right since .
their home form has been pitiful and leverkusen will certainly fancy their chances when they make the journey to gelsenkirchen on saturday .
leverkusen have had plenty of joy on their travels .
unbeaten in four away games with three wins and a draw , it appears to be advantage bayer .
schalke 's revival will have to wait at least another week .
prediction : leverkusen 3-2 sunday , oct .
31 mainz - dortmund halloween came early for dortmund in the dfb cup on wednesday .
instead of the treat they might have expected from a fixture against a third division side , they got tricked in a 4-2 loss on penalties at kickers offenbach .
bvb , who have been on fire in front of goal , will be wondering how they went 120 minutes without scoring and will be hoping they find they find the target ahead of this first-versus-second clash .
mainz , who returned to the summit last weekend , also lost in the cup to alemannia aachen so this game is primed for both teams to put their woes behind them .
dortmund will have the added incentive of going top if they win and could take heart from the fact that mainz 's only league defeat so far has come at home .
prediction : dortmund 3-1 hoffenheim - hanover bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hannover 's players are n't suffering from altitude sickness hanover continues to overachieve this season .
up to third after last week 's victory over cologne , they look to have put the brakes on the minor slide which affected them after losing to st. pauli at the start of october .
hoffenheim , meanwhile , are still challenging at the top end but their own push for the summit has suffered a few hiccups in recent weeks .
after three wins on the bounce at the start of the season , it took hoffenheim until two weeks ago to record their next .
keeping dortmund at bay in last week 's 1-1 draw suggests they 've found their balance again but hanover may edge this to keep their impressive campaign on track .

there 's no need to question a perfectly reasonable on-the-nose prediction - at least not when it comes from afar .
another realm , in this case .
here dw sports forward the spooky ones ' predictions for match day ten . match day nine ’ s predictions saw the dw pundits increase their week-on-week total with six points .
not such a special tally , but one that included a surprising spot-on forecast of werder bremen 's 4-1 victory away to borussia moenchengladbach .
to fight the unsubstantiated and scurrilous accusations of match-fixing that have been swirling , dw 's experts are ready to come clean - the spirits made them do it .
they 're still under their control , in fact : here are their picks for week ten .
friday , oct .
29 bayern - freiburg few would have predicted freiburg being above bayern after nine games but the league table does n't lie .
bayern are suffering a crisis of confidence and fluidity in the bundesliga , while the freiburgers are just enjoying their early season ride .
robin dutt ’ s men have notched points against their mid-table rivals but have come unstuck against the better teams .
ordinarily bayern would be included in that latter category , but right now they 're adrift in mediocrity .
however , at home , with a partisan crowd expecting a return to the status quo , bayern should edge it .
prediction : bayern 2-1 saturday , oct .
30 bremen - nuremberg bremen have managed to steady their ship after a choppy start to the season and are unbeaten in five league games .
they still lie in eighth place but show signs of rediscovering the consistency which could see them climb the table .
but this is werder , remember , and nothing can be taken for granted .
they can win 4-1 one week and get thumped by the same scoreline the next .
nuremberg are experiencing the pendulum of form ; winning one week , losing the next .
if it continues to swing , after beating wolfsburg last week , then bremen should come out on top in this one .
prediction : bremen 3-0 wolfsburg - stuttgart bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : keller has got stuttgart winning again and out of danger jens keller is unbeaten as stuttgart coach after taking over from the sacked christian gross two weeks ago , and the four points his team has eked out in their last two league games have taken them out of the drop zone .
confidence is slowly coming back , boosted by recent europa league and dfb cup wins , and while it is still a nascent recovery , vfb do have some momentum at last .
wolfsburg , on the other hand , have lost theirs .
two defeats and a loss have put the skids under their own revival and coming into this match , stuttgart look to have the edge .
stuttgart : 1-0 cologne - hamburg the enigma that is hamburger sv continues to confound .
after an impressive start followed by a worrying slump , hsv are rebuilding their campaign by going three games unbeaten .
two wins and a goalless draw against bayern could have been seen as a solid base to push on , but their 5-2 cup hammering at the hands of frankfurt in midweek may have released old demons .
cologne , however , appear to have little in their locker which could inflict such a heavy defeat on hamburg - in fact , any kind of defeat looks unlikely .
the bottom club have a solitary win to their name and their second isn ’ t likely to come this weekend , even with the benefit of home advantage .
prediction : hamburg 2-0 kaiserslautern - moenchengladbach kaiserslautern 's last win - the impressive 2-0 defeat of bayern - seems a long time ago .
indeed since those heady days of august , when kaiserslautern notched two wins on the trot , all that has followed is a downward spiral of six reversals and a draw , leaving the red devils hovering perilously over the drop zone .
they got a welcome boost with a midweek cup win - but then again so did gladbach .
however , given that gladbach slipped to second-from-bottom after their sixth defeat of the season last weekend , little should be read into that .
these are two teams in deep , albeit it early , trouble .
their desperation may cancel each other out .
prediction : draw 2-2 st. pauli - frankfurt given they were afforded little chance of staying up this season , st- pauli 's current position in 10th could already be hailed as a triumph .
as long as they do n't start panicking that last week 's defeat to stuttgart and their slight tumble down the league is the start of their predicted demise , st. pauli have the guts to slog it out and remain in the bundesliga .
frankfurt sit a place above them on goal difference with an exact replica of the hamburg club 's record to date .
eintracht come into this game on the back of three wins and a draw so they will be up for it against pauli .
expect a gutsy battle .
prediction : draw 1-1 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : raul did n't expect to swap real madrid for a relegation fight schalke - leverkusen things still look desperate for schalke .
their only victory in the league this season , ground out against freiburg over a month ago , looks increasingly like a false dawn .
a defeat and three draws suggests little has been put right since .
their home form has been pitiful and leverkusen will certainly fancy their chances when they make the journey to gelsenkirchen on saturday .
leverkusen have had plenty of joy on their travels .
unbeaten in four away games with three wins and a draw , it appears to be advantage bayer .
schalke 's revival will have to wait at least another week .
prediction : leverkusen 3-2 sunday , oct .
31 mainz - dortmund halloween came early for dortmund in the dfb cup on wednesday .
instead of the treat they might have expected from a fixture against a third division side , they got tricked in a 4-2 loss on penalties at kickers offenbach .
bvb , who have been on fire in front of goal , will be wondering how they went 120 minutes without scoring and will be hoping they find they find the target ahead of this first-versus-second clash .
mainz , who returned to the summit last weekend , also lost in the cup to alemannia aachen so this game is primed for both teams to put their woes behind them .
dortmund will have the added incentive of going top if they win and could take heart from the fact that mainz 's only league defeat so far has come at home .
prediction : dortmund 3-1 hoffenheim - hanover bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hannover 's players are n't suffering from altitude sickness hanover continues to overachieve this season .
up to third after last week 's victory over cologne , they look to have put the brakes on the minor slide which affected them after losing to st. pauli at the start of october .
hoffenheim , meanwhile , are still challenging at the top end but their own push for the summit has suffered a few hiccups in recent weeks .
after three wins on the bounce at the start of the season , it took hoffenheim until two weeks ago to record their next .
keeping dortmund at bay in last week 's 1-1 draw suggests they 've found their balance again but hanover may edge this to keep their impressive campaign on track .
prediction : hannover 1-0 last week 's results : 6 points hamburg - bayern 0-0 -lrb- dw prediction : 1-2 -rrb- frankfurt - schalke 0-0 -lrb- dw prediction : 2-2 -rrb- moenchengladbach - werder bremen 1-4 -lrb- dw prediction : 1-4 -rrb- freiburg - kaiserslautern 2-1 -lrb- dw prediction : 1-1 -rrb- hanover - cologne 2-1 -lrb- dw prediction : 1-0 -rrb- nuremberg - wolfsburg 2-1 -lrb- dw prediction : 1-2 -rrb- dortmund - hoffenheim 1-1 -lrb- dw prediction : 2-0 -rrb- leverkusen - mainz 0-1 -lrb- dw prediction : 2-1 -rrb- stuttgart - st.pauli 2-0 -lrb- dw prediction : 1-2 -rrb- total for the season : 43 three points for a correct score prediction two points for a correct margin prediction one point for a correct winner prediction author : nick amies editor : matt hermann send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : focus : midterm elections in the us eu and us ' must work together , ' says diplomat obama seeks to mobilize disappointed voters foreign donations spark row ahead of us midterm elections european companies back climate skeptics in us senate race , report says elections -pipe- 29.10.2010 shift to the right in midterm elections could affect us foreign policy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the foreign policy leanings of many tea party candidates are unclear the issue of us foreign policy has hardly played a role in the congressional midterm elections campaign .
however , the outcome might well have an impact on washington 's relations with the rest of the world . when american voters head to the polls to elect a new house of representatives and 37 new senators , there is perhaps nothing that sums up their sentiment better than the old adage from bill clinton 's 1992 presidential campaign : " it 's the economy , stupid . " and with unemployment hovering at close to 10 percent , a collapsed housing market and a stuttering economy , there certainly is ample reason for voters to worry about their personal well-being . to be sure , there are definitely enough foreign policy issues that would merit the electorate 's attention too : a war in afghanistan , now in its ninth year , which is not going well , a tense situation in the middle east with us-sponsored negotiations between israelis and palestinians always on the verge of collapse , iran 's alleged efforts to acquire nuclear weapons still unresolved and north korea in the middle of a leadership handover .
but all of that does n't really matter , says thomas e. mann , a congressional scholar at the brookings institution in washington : " for the most part the public is so distressed and pessimistic about the economy that that is what 's dominating the campaigns , " he told deutsche welle . international issues on the sidelines the only way foreign policy gets any traction as an election topic is when it relates to a domestic issue , adds mann .
china , for example , plays a role in certain campaigns when trade issues or the currency imbalances are discussed .
and mexico is addressed when illegal immigration and its effect on the economy is debated .
other than that , domestic issues , especially the economy , dominate the midterm elections almost completely .
while foreign policy issues have no impact on the election , the results of the elections could well have an impact on us foreign policy .
if , as most pollsters predict , the republicans win back the house of representatives and stand a small chance of also retaking the senate , this will have implications for the way washington carries out international relations . " there are a lot of republican candidates running for the house who are tea party candidates , who are very hard-right candidates , " douglas foyle , a professor at wesleyan university who has researched about the impact of domestic issues on international relations , told deutsche welle .
" they have n't said too much about foreign policy and so it 's anybody 's guess what they are going to do once they get into office . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president barack obama wo n't be able to get a climate change treaty through the new congress what the tea party candidates have said very clearly however , is that they want to balance the budget .
" if they are going to balance the budget , they will have to cut defense spending because that 's about half of all discretionary federal spending , " notes foyle .
" and pulling back in foreign policy in terms of the military is not something that traditionally the republicans would do . "
future of the republican party his colleague mann also sees a chance of a " significant number of tea party-based republicans coming in to the senate with rather extreme views on the limited role for government and really hostile sentiments toward globalization and international organizations . "
he adds : " if this group were to gain the upper hand in the republican party we would have one center-left party and one extreme-right party in the country .
that 's not reassuring . "
regardless how the soul searching of the republican party ends , the party 's majority in one or both chambers of congress would have an impact on us foreign policy in any case . while the president has considerably more leeway to pursue his own course in international affairs than on the domestic front and also serves as the commander-in-chief of the military , he ca n't disregard congress entirely .
first , congress approves the budget and through that can influence policy as well . " let 's look at afghanistan for example , " juergen chrobog , germany 's former ambassador in washington who now heads the bmw foundation herbert quandt , told deutsche welle : " the troops and the war must be financed .
and here the members of congress have an enormous lever : they can give more or less . "
treaties face tough obstacles what 's more , congress is also needed to ratify international treaties .
even with a sizeable majority in both chambers during the first half of his term , president barack obama could n't get a climate change treaty through congress .
with a republican majority in one or both chambers of congress , predict the experts , a climate change treaty which must be ratified by a two-thirds majority in the senate is all but dead .
the fate of the new start treaty , the follow-up to the original nuclear disarmament pact signed by republican icon ronald reagan and soviet leader mikhail gorbachev , is also uncertain . the lame duck senate will vote on the issue in the middle of november . whether it goes through is still unclear .
if it does n't , it seems rather unlikely that it will have an easier time in the new senate . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us voters worry primarily about the economy and about losing their jobs " i do n't see any major treaties like these being ratified , at least not easily , " says chrobog .
" i hope that president obama and the democrats at least keep their majority in the senate . "
the likely swing to the right in the midterm elections could make us foreign policy less predictable and more complicated , argue the experts .
still , they add , europeans should n't fret too much about the outcome of the polls . " i think the most important thing for those looking from abroad at this election is to realize this is not fundamentally about ideology , " says mann .
" this is about americans being scared and sour and pessimistic about our economic well-being and instinctively voting against the party in power . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 29.10.2010 eu leaders agree to ' limited ' changes to bloc 's main treaty großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel succeeded in convincing eu partners to agree to changes european union leaders agreed to the principle of ' limited ' changes to the bloc 's main treaty to keep member states ' deficits in line , but the road to reforming the document could become a political nightmare . the 27 leaders of european union member states on friday gave way to german demands to slight amendments to the bloc 's guiding lisbon treaty in order to prevent future debt crises . the announcement came early in the morning after seven hours of intense talks at the start of a two-day eu summit in brussels .
german chancellor angela merkel said the leaders had had a " profound and difficult discussion , " and other participants described the discussions as heated and emotional . merkel added that she was satisfied with the outcome of the debate : " we have promoted our essential points , " she said .
" everyone is in agreement that a limited change to the lisbon treaty is necessary . " eu council president herman van rompuy told a news conference that " important decisions to strengthen the eurozone " had been taken .
" we recommend a robust and credible permanent crisis resolution mechanism to safeguard the financial stability of the eurozone as a whole , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : van rompuy is now charged with proposing the amendments merkel stressed that the current , limited protection of loan guarantees for euro states was not a permanent solution under the current treaty conditions .
she said the new crisis mechanism would only be " valid for cases where the stability of the euro as a whole is at risk . " " we said once more that ... should a country ever need to make use of this , it would be faced with very strict requirements , " she said . opposition to budget increase some non-eurozone states threw around their weight in the discussions , like the united kingdom , which sought to cap the eu 's budget next year , and poland , which wants the calculation of its national debt to take into account costly pension reforms . merkel chimed in , saying , " if we have to reduce our budget at home - we do this at the federal level by more than 3 percent - it can not be that the european budget rises by nearly 6 percent . " the leaders asked van rompuy to prepare potential changes to the lisbon treaty ahead of another eu summit in december .
the changes are to be agreed on by mid-2013 , the expiration date of a 750-billion euro -lrb- $ 1 trillion -rrb- fund set up last may to reassure markets that greece 's debt crisis would not spill over to the rest of the continent . tough reform process bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy and merkel jointly proposed tough sanctions on overspenders germany , europe 's largest economy , led the calls at the summit for tougher penalties on states that exceed the eurozone 's limit on budget deficits of 3 percent of gross domestic product . merkel and french president nicolas sarkozy had called for the suspension of voting rights of members who flout budget rules , but such a reform was unpopular with several smaller states . " if treaty change is to reduce the rights of member states on voting , i find it unacceptable , and , frankly speaking , it is not realistic , " european commission president jose manuel barroso said . it would also likely turn into a political nightmare for national governments .
the lisbon treaty took 10 years of wrangling to enact , after challenges in national courts and referendum failures in france , ireland and the netherlands . " many countries do not want a huge treaty reform , and therefore we are trying to narrow it down to a very limited treaty change that should be acceptable for countries without having to face referendums , " swedish prime minister fredrik reinfeldt said . although the proposals were weaker than merkel had pushed for , she said the eu had underlined that " private investors will not be able to make money or speculate against the euro .

however , the outcome might well have an impact on washington 's relations with the rest of the world . when american voters head to the polls to elect a new house of representatives and 37 new senators , there is perhaps nothing that sums up their sentiment better than the old adage from bill clinton 's 1992 presidential campaign : " it 's the economy , stupid . " and with unemployment hovering at close to 10 percent , a collapsed housing market and a stuttering economy , there certainly is ample reason for voters to worry about their personal well-being . to be sure , there are definitely enough foreign policy issues that would merit the electorate 's attention too : a war in afghanistan , now in its ninth year , which is not going well , a tense situation in the middle east with us-sponsored negotiations between israelis and palestinians always on the verge of collapse , iran 's alleged efforts to acquire nuclear weapons still unresolved and north korea in the middle of a leadership handover .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de integration -pipe- 29.10.2010 greens propose simplified citizenship laws for retired immigrants großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the proposal would make becoming a citizen easier for some good german is required to get german citizenship .
one lawmaker says it 's time to do long-term immigrants a favor and loosen up that rule . new legislation introduced in the german parliament could allow certain groups to get a german passport more easily and quickly , as well as granting more people the right to hold dual citizenship .
currently , immigrants who want to get german citizenship must take a naturalization test and show that they have a firm grasp of the language .
in addition , they generally have to renounce their previous citizenship .
pensioners who came to the country as immigrants are one of the groups that would benefit most from a change to the law .
if the bill were passed , a person who is over 53 years old and has been living in germany for at least 15 years could apply for a passport without meeting the language requirements .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kilic wants to see an immigrant 's work rewarded " if a person has made a contribution to this society , i want to make it easier for them to become citizens , " green party parliamentarian memet kilic told deutsche welle .
" especially older immigrants - who gave their youth and health to build up this country - should be able to obtain citizenship without a language requirement .
that way , we can win the hearts of their children and grandchildren for this country . "
integration conversation kilic 's bill comes as the integration of immigrants is under the microscope in germany .
chancellor angela merkel , a christian democrat , said earlier this month that multiculturalism had failed in germany .
there have also been repeated calls for immigrants to integrate better into german society by learning the language and customs .
kilic , who was born in turkey , said the legislation he sponsored would be welcome news to immigrants .
" third-generation immigrant children in germany hear three times a day that they do n't belong to this country , " he said .
" what good is that ?
i want to turn the tables . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : integration is hard to define in germany in support of the bill , kilic cited statistics showing that the number of citizens naturalized in germany each year had fallen by 20 percent since 2004 .
this was an indication that becoming a german citizen was simply too difficult , he said .
without citizenship , many of germany 's 6.7 million immigrants do not have the right to vote in the country .
but citizenship goes beyond the legal realm .
" integration means more than simply structural integration , " said guelistan guerbey , a political scientist at berlin 's free university .
" it has a very strong emotional and psychological dimension . "
this is especially true for dual citizens .
if the bill became law , an immigrant would no longer have to give up their passport to become german .
guerbey said this would have a positive effect .
" a person has emotional ties in both directions , " she said , " and dual citizenship is a legal recognition of this emotional state . "
time to learn german but while legal benefits and emotional satisfaction might encourage a retired immigrant with less-than-perfect german to apply for citizenship under the loosened rules of the proposed law , they may never get the chance .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : learning german is essential for integration , says grindel on thursday in the bundestag , reinhard grindel of the governing christian democrats , was clear about what his party thought of the proposal .
" when someone wants to become a german citizen , " grindel said , " then i have to be able to say , as an incentive , that you must learn german if you have n't learned it well enough already .
that 's a part of the integration process - to finally learn german . "
and there is reason to believe that many retired immigrants in germany would n't apply for a german passport if the rules were loosened .
some come from other european union countries , where moving across borders is n't problematic , though they do not have full voting rights in germany .
but kilic says there are some 2,000-3,000 retirees from other countries who would gladly take advantage of the opportunity .

german chancellor angela merkel said the leaders had had a " profound and difficult discussion , " and other participants described the discussions as heated and emotional . merkel added that she was satisfied with the outcome of the debate : " we have promoted our essential points , " she said .
" everyone is in agreement that a limited change to the lisbon treaty is necessary . " eu council president herman van rompuy told a news conference that " important decisions to strengthen the eurozone " had been taken .
" we recommend a robust and credible permanent crisis resolution mechanism to safeguard the financial stability of the eurozone as a whole , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : van rompuy is now charged with proposing the amendments merkel stressed that the current , limited protection of loan guarantees for euro states was not a permanent solution under the current treaty conditions .
she said the new crisis mechanism would only be " valid for cases where the stability of the euro as a whole is at risk . " " we said once more that ... should a country ever need to make use of this , it would be faced with very strict requirements , " she said . opposition to budget increase some non-eurozone states threw around their weight in the discussions , like the united kingdom , which sought to cap the eu 's budget next year , and poland , which wants the calculation of its national debt to take into account costly pension reforms . merkel chimed in , saying , " if we have to reduce our budget at home - we do this at the federal level by more than 3 percent - it can not be that the european budget rises by nearly 6 percent . " the leaders asked van rompuy to prepare potential changes to the lisbon treaty ahead of another eu summit in december .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : focus : midterm elections in the us eu and us ' must work together , ' says diplomat obama seeks to mobilize disappointed voters foreign donations spark row ahead of us midterm elections european companies back climate skeptics in us senate race , report says elections -pipe- 29.10.2010 shift to the right in midterm elections could affect us foreign policy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the foreign policy leanings of many tea party candidates are unclear the issue of us foreign policy has hardly played a role in the congressional midterm elections campaign .
however , the outcome might well have an impact on washington 's relations with the rest of the world . when american voters head to the polls to elect a new house of representatives and 37 new senators , there is perhaps nothing that sums up their sentiment better than the old adage from bill clinton 's 1992 presidential campaign : " it 's the economy , stupid . " and with unemployment hovering at close to 10 percent , a collapsed housing market and a stuttering economy , there certainly is ample reason for voters to worry about their personal well-being . to be sure , there are definitely enough foreign policy issues that would merit the electorate 's attention too : a war in afghanistan , now in its ninth year , which is not going well , a tense situation in the middle east with us-sponsored negotiations between israelis and palestinians always on the verge of collapse , iran 's alleged efforts to acquire nuclear weapons still unresolved and north korea in the middle of a leadership handover .
but all of that does n't really matter , says thomas e. mann , a congressional scholar at the brookings institution in washington : " for the most part the public is so distressed and pessimistic about the economy that that is what 's dominating the campaigns , " he told deutsche welle . international issues on the sidelines the only way foreign policy gets any traction as an election topic is when it relates to a domestic issue , adds mann .
china , for example , plays a role in certain campaigns when trade issues or the currency imbalances are discussed .
and mexico is addressed when illegal immigration and its effect on the economy is debated .
other than that , domestic issues , especially the economy , dominate the midterm elections almost completely .
while foreign policy issues have no impact on the election , the results of the elections could well have an impact on us foreign policy .
if , as most pollsters predict , the republicans win back the house of representatives and stand a small chance of also retaking the senate , this will have implications for the way washington carries out international relations . " there are a lot of republican candidates running for the house who are tea party candidates , who are very hard-right candidates , " douglas foyle , a professor at wesleyan university who has researched about the impact of domestic issues on international relations , told deutsche welle .
" they have n't said too much about foreign policy and so it 's anybody 's guess what they are going to do once they get into office . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president barack obama wo n't be able to get a climate change treaty through the new congress what the tea party candidates have said very clearly however , is that they want to balance the budget .
" if they are going to balance the budget , they will have to cut defense spending because that 's about half of all discretionary federal spending , " notes foyle .
" and pulling back in foreign policy in terms of the military is not something that traditionally the republicans would do . "
future of the republican party his colleague mann also sees a chance of a " significant number of tea party-based republicans coming in to the senate with rather extreme views on the limited role for government and really hostile sentiments toward globalization and international organizations . "
he adds : " if this group were to gain the upper hand in the republican party we would have one center-left party and one extreme-right party in the country .
that 's not reassuring . "
regardless how the soul searching of the republican party ends , the party 's majority in one or both chambers of congress would have an impact on us foreign policy in any case . while the president has considerably more leeway to pursue his own course in international affairs than on the domestic front and also serves as the commander-in-chief of the military , he ca n't disregard congress entirely .
first , congress approves the budget and through that can influence policy as well . " let 's look at afghanistan for example , " juergen chrobog , germany 's former ambassador in washington who now heads the bmw foundation herbert quandt , told deutsche welle : " the troops and the war must be financed .
and here the members of congress have an enormous lever : they can give more or less . "
treaties face tough obstacles what 's more , congress is also needed to ratify international treaties .
even with a sizeable majority in both chambers during the first half of his term , president barack obama could n't get a climate change treaty through congress .
with a republican majority in one or both chambers of congress , predict the experts , a climate change treaty which must be ratified by a two-thirds majority in the senate is all but dead .
the fate of the new start treaty , the follow-up to the original nuclear disarmament pact signed by republican icon ronald reagan and soviet leader mikhail gorbachev , is also uncertain . the lame duck senate will vote on the issue in the middle of november . whether it goes through is still unclear .
if it does n't , it seems rather unlikely that it will have an easier time in the new senate . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us voters worry primarily about the economy and about losing their jobs " i do n't see any major treaties like these being ratified , at least not easily , " says chrobog .
" i hope that president obama and the democrats at least keep their majority in the senate . "
the likely swing to the right in the midterm elections could make us foreign policy less predictable and more complicated , argue the experts .
still , they add , europeans should n't fret too much about the outcome of the polls . " i think the most important thing for those looking from abroad at this election is to realize this is not fundamentally about ideology , " says mann .
" this is about americans being scared and sour and pessimistic about our economic well-being and instinctively voting against the party in power . "

there 's no need to question a perfectly reasonable on-the-nose prediction - at least not when it comes from afar .
another realm , in this case .
here dw sports forward the spooky ones ' predictions for match day ten . match day nine ’ s predictions saw the dw pundits increase their week-on-week total with six points .
not such a special tally , but one that included a surprising spot-on forecast of werder bremen 's 4-1 victory away to borussia moenchengladbach .
to fight the unsubstantiated and scurrilous accusations of match-fixing that have been swirling , dw 's experts are ready to come clean - the spirits made them do it .
they 're still under their control , in fact : here are their picks for week ten .
friday , oct .
29 bayern - freiburg few would have predicted freiburg being above bayern after nine games but the league table does n't lie .
bayern are suffering a crisis of confidence and fluidity in the bundesliga , while the freiburgers are just enjoying their early season ride .
robin dutt ’ s men have notched points against their mid-table rivals but have come unstuck against the better teams .
ordinarily bayern would be included in that latter category , but right now they 're adrift in mediocrity .
however , at home , with a partisan crowd expecting a return to the status quo , bayern should edge it .
prediction : bayern 2-1 saturday , oct .
30 bremen - nuremberg bremen have managed to steady their ship after a choppy start to the season and are unbeaten in five league games .
they still lie in eighth place but show signs of rediscovering the consistency which could see them climb the table .
but this is werder , remember , and nothing can be taken for granted .
they can win 4-1 one week and get thumped by the same scoreline the next .
nuremberg are experiencing the pendulum of form ; winning one week , losing the next .
if it continues to swing , after beating wolfsburg last week , then bremen should come out on top in this one .
prediction : bremen 3-0 wolfsburg - stuttgart bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : keller has got stuttgart winning again and out of danger jens keller is unbeaten as stuttgart coach after taking over from the sacked christian gross two weeks ago , and the four points his team has eked out in their last two league games have taken them out of the drop zone .
confidence is slowly coming back , boosted by recent europa league and dfb cup wins , and while it is still a nascent recovery , vfb do have some momentum at last .
wolfsburg , on the other hand , have lost theirs .
two defeats and a loss have put the skids under their own revival and coming into this match , stuttgart look to have the edge .
stuttgart : 1-0 cologne - hamburg the enigma that is hamburger sv continues to confound .
after an impressive start followed by a worrying slump , hsv are rebuilding their campaign by going three games unbeaten .
two wins and a goalless draw against bayern could have been seen as a solid base to push on , but their 5-2 cup hammering at the hands of frankfurt in midweek may have released old demons .
cologne , however , appear to have little in their locker which could inflict such a heavy defeat on hamburg - in fact , any kind of defeat looks unlikely .
the bottom club have a solitary win to their name and their second isn ’ t likely to come this weekend , even with the benefit of home advantage .
prediction : hamburg 2-0 kaiserslautern - moenchengladbach kaiserslautern 's last win - the impressive 2-0 defeat of bayern - seems a long time ago .
indeed since those heady days of august , when kaiserslautern notched two wins on the trot , all that has followed is a downward spiral of six reversals and a draw , leaving the red devils hovering perilously over the drop zone .
they got a welcome boost with a midweek cup win - but then again so did gladbach .
however , given that gladbach slipped to second-from-bottom after their sixth defeat of the season last weekend , little should be read into that .
these are two teams in deep , albeit it early , trouble .
their desperation may cancel each other out .
prediction : draw 2-2 st. pauli - frankfurt given they were afforded little chance of staying up this season , st- pauli 's current position in 10th could already be hailed as a triumph .
as long as they do n't start panicking that last week 's defeat to stuttgart and their slight tumble down the league is the start of their predicted demise , st. pauli have the guts to slog it out and remain in the bundesliga .
frankfurt sit a place above them on goal difference with an exact replica of the hamburg club 's record to date .
eintracht come into this game on the back of three wins and a draw so they will be up for it against pauli .
expect a gutsy battle .
prediction : draw 1-1 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : raul did n't expect to swap real madrid for a relegation fight schalke - leverkusen things still look desperate for schalke .
their only victory in the league this season , ground out against freiburg over a month ago , looks increasingly like a false dawn .
a defeat and three draws suggests little has been put right since .
their home form has been pitiful and leverkusen will certainly fancy their chances when they make the journey to gelsenkirchen on saturday .
leverkusen have had plenty of joy on their travels .
unbeaten in four away games with three wins and a draw , it appears to be advantage bayer .
schalke 's revival will have to wait at least another week .
prediction : leverkusen 3-2 sunday , oct .
31 mainz - dortmund halloween came early for dortmund in the dfb cup on wednesday .
instead of the treat they might have expected from a fixture against a third division side , they got tricked in a 4-2 loss on penalties at kickers offenbach .
bvb , who have been on fire in front of goal , will be wondering how they went 120 minutes without scoring and will be hoping they find they find the target ahead of this first-versus-second clash .
mainz , who returned to the summit last weekend , also lost in the cup to alemannia aachen so this game is primed for both teams to put their woes behind them .
dortmund will have the added incentive of going top if they win and could take heart from the fact that mainz 's only league defeat so far has come at home .
prediction : dortmund 3-1 hoffenheim - hanover bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hannover 's players are n't suffering from altitude sickness hanover continues to overachieve this season .
up to third after last week 's victory over cologne , they look to have put the brakes on the minor slide which affected them after losing to st. pauli at the start of october .
hoffenheim , meanwhile , are still challenging at the top end but their own push for the summit has suffered a few hiccups in recent weeks .
after three wins on the bounce at the start of the season , it took hoffenheim until two weeks ago to record their next .
keeping dortmund at bay in last week 's 1-1 draw suggests they 've found their balance again but hanover may edge this to keep their impressive campaign on track .
prediction : hannover 1-0 last week 's results : 6 points hamburg - bayern 0-0 -lrb- dw prediction : 1-2 -rrb- frankfurt - schalke 0-0 -lrb- dw prediction : 2-2 -rrb- moenchengladbach - werder bremen 1-4 -lrb- dw prediction : 1-4 -rrb- freiburg - kaiserslautern 2-1 -lrb- dw prediction : 1-1 -rrb- hanover - cologne 2-1 -lrb- dw prediction : 1-0 -rrb- nuremberg - wolfsburg 2-1 -lrb- dw prediction : 1-2 -rrb- dortmund - hoffenheim 1-1 -lrb- dw prediction : 2-0 -rrb- leverkusen - mainz 0-1 -lrb- dw prediction : 2-1 -rrb- stuttgart - st.pauli 2-0 -lrb- dw prediction : 1-2 -rrb- total for the season : 43 three points for a correct score prediction two points for a correct margin prediction one point for a correct winner prediction author : nick amies editor : matt hermann send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

german chancellor angela merkel said the leaders had had a " profound and difficult discussion , " and other participants described the discussions as heated and emotional . merkel added that she was satisfied with the outcome of the debate : " we have promoted our essential points , " she said .
" everyone is in agreement that a limited change to the lisbon treaty is necessary . " eu council president herman van rompuy told a news conference that " important decisions to strengthen the eurozone " had been taken .
" we recommend a robust and credible permanent crisis resolution mechanism to safeguard the financial stability of the eurozone as a whole , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : van rompuy is now charged with proposing the amendments merkel stressed that the current , limited protection of loan guarantees for euro states was not a permanent solution under the current treaty conditions .
she said the new crisis mechanism would only be " valid for cases where the stability of the euro as a whole is at risk . " " we said once more that ... should a country ever need to make use of this , it would be faced with very strict requirements , " she said . opposition to budget increase some non-eurozone states threw around their weight in the discussions , like the united kingdom , which sought to cap the eu 's budget next year , and poland , which wants the calculation of its national debt to take into account costly pension reforms . merkel chimed in , saying , " if we have to reduce our budget at home - we do this at the federal level by more than 3 percent - it can not be that the european budget rises by nearly 6 percent . " the leaders asked van rompuy to prepare potential changes to the lisbon treaty ahead of another eu summit in december .
the changes are to be agreed on by mid-2013 , the expiration date of a 750-billion euro -lrb- $ 1 trillion -rrb- fund set up last may to reassure markets that greece 's debt crisis would not spill over to the rest of the continent . tough reform process bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy and merkel jointly proposed tough sanctions on overspenders germany , europe 's largest economy , led the calls at the summit for tougher penalties on states that exceed the eurozone 's limit on budget deficits of 3 percent of gross domestic product . merkel and french president nicolas sarkozy had called for the suspension of voting rights of members who flout budget rules , but such a reform was unpopular with several smaller states . " if treaty change is to reduce the rights of member states on voting , i find it unacceptable , and , frankly speaking , it is not realistic , " european commission president jose manuel barroso said . it would also likely turn into a political nightmare for national governments .

" many countries do not want a huge treaty reform , and therefore we are trying to narrow it down to a very limited treaty change that should be acceptable for countries without having to face referendums , " swedish prime minister fredrik reinfeldt said . although the proposals were weaker than merkel had pushed for , she said the eu had underlined that " private investors will not be able to make money or speculate against the euro .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de integration -pipe- 29.10.2010 greens propose simplified citizenship laws for retired immigrants großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the proposal would make becoming a citizen easier for some good german is required to get german citizenship .
one lawmaker says it 's time to do long-term immigrants a favor and loosen up that rule . new legislation introduced in the german parliament could allow certain groups to get a german passport more easily and quickly , as well as granting more people the right to hold dual citizenship .
currently , immigrants who want to get german citizenship must take a naturalization test and show that they have a firm grasp of the language .
in addition , they generally have to renounce their previous citizenship .
pensioners who came to the country as immigrants are one of the groups that would benefit most from a change to the law .
if the bill were passed , a person who is over 53 years old and has been living in germany for at least 15 years could apply for a passport without meeting the language requirements .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kilic wants to see an immigrant 's work rewarded " if a person has made a contribution to this society , i want to make it easier for them to become citizens , " green party parliamentarian memet kilic told deutsche welle .
" especially older immigrants - who gave their youth and health to build up this country - should be able to obtain citizenship without a language requirement .
that way , we can win the hearts of their children and grandchildren for this country . "
integration conversation kilic 's bill comes as the integration of immigrants is under the microscope in germany .
chancellor angela merkel , a christian democrat , said earlier this month that multiculturalism had failed in germany .
there have also been repeated calls for immigrants to integrate better into german society by learning the language and customs .
kilic , who was born in turkey , said the legislation he sponsored would be welcome news to immigrants .
" third-generation immigrant children in germany hear three times a day that they do n't belong to this country , " he said .
" what good is that ?
i want to turn the tables . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : integration is hard to define in germany in support of the bill , kilic cited statistics showing that the number of citizens naturalized in germany each year had fallen by 20 percent since 2004 .
this was an indication that becoming a german citizen was simply too difficult , he said .
without citizenship , many of germany 's 6.7 million immigrants do not have the right to vote in the country .
but citizenship goes beyond the legal realm .
" integration means more than simply structural integration , " said guelistan guerbey , a political scientist at berlin 's free university .
" it has a very strong emotional and psychological dimension . "
this is especially true for dual citizens .
if the bill became law , an immigrant would no longer have to give up their passport to become german .
guerbey said this would have a positive effect .
" a person has emotional ties in both directions , " she said , " and dual citizenship is a legal recognition of this emotional state . "
time to learn german but while legal benefits and emotional satisfaction might encourage a retired immigrant with less-than-perfect german to apply for citizenship under the loosened rules of the proposed law , they may never get the chance .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : learning german is essential for integration , says grindel on thursday in the bundestag , reinhard grindel of the governing christian democrats , was clear about what his party thought of the proposal .
" when someone wants to become a german citizen , " grindel said , " then i have to be able to say , as an incentive , that you must learn german if you have n't learned it well enough already .
that 's a part of the integration process - to finally learn german . "
and there is reason to believe that many retired immigrants in germany would n't apply for a german passport if the rules were loosened .
some come from other european union countries , where moving across borders is n't problematic , though they do not have full voting rights in germany .
but kilic says there are some 2,000-3,000 retirees from other countries who would gladly take advantage of the opportunity .

but now the eu wants to make patent protection easier and less expensive for the bloc 's inventors . the economic crisis has n't put european companies and independent inventors off investing into research and development .
judged by the some 60,000 patents issued so far this year in germany , the country 's is on track to meet 2009 's total . " companies followed experts ' advice and continued investing in new products - even though we were in the middle of a crisis , " bettina berner of the german patent and trade mark office -lrb- dpma -rrb- said on thursday at the opening ceremony of the 62nd edition of the inventors ' trade fair iena in nuremberg . hoping for a break through bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some 800 products , like an unpoppable tire , are on display at the iena trade fair inventors from 37 countries are currently presenting some 800 new products at the fair , which the organizers said is the largest of its kind in the world . rollerblades , the folding bicycle and inflatable water wings are some of products that went on to conquer the world after being presented in nuremberg .
like their successful predecessors , many inventors at this year 's fair are hoping for break-through deals with the industry so their products can be mass-produced . shaky hands ?
no problem ! bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the willomat tray lets the clumsy wait tables - without worrying guests bernhard haehnsen is one such inventor .
the former ship 's captain grew tired moping up after glasses spilled their contents as his ship pitched on the high seas .
his neighbor barbara willomat designed a way to stabilize glasses and cups on trays .
special suction cups which can be fixed on a tray hold retainers in different shapes and sizes . " when you 're carrying beer glasses on a tray across wobbly grass in a beer garden , the glasses break easily if you do n't attach them , " haehnsen said , adding that the willomat tray could also facilitate work in hospitals and help anyone with shaky hands . register first , then show it bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moreau 's idea came when he saw a report about delayed flights other products on display at iena this year include a foldable chair attached to a suitcase , invented by 12-year-old johannes von moreau , and a remote control for model sports cars which can be used with one hand rather than two . the two inventors kevin hummel and nicolas rathauser have registered their product with the munich-based german patent office -lrb- dpma -rrb- already .
that 's a step experts strongly recommend . " many independent inventors do n't have their products registered before they present them at a trade fair , " said dpma spokesperson berner . lengthy , costly patent process but inventors who want to protect their product in more than one european country currently have to undergo a tedious and costly process that begins with registration at the european patent office . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : inventors register their products here : the european patent office in munich " you have to decide in how many countries you want to have your patent validated , " heinrich dornbusch , a consultant with german patent marketing agency provendis , told deutsche welle .
" currently you have to do that separately in every single member state .
this means you have to invest a lot of time and money . " the costs for registering a product in 13 of the eu 's 27 countries , for instance , can easily amount to more than 20,000 euros -lrb- $ 28,000 -rrb- - 10 times the cost of a patent in the united states , according to dornbusch three languages sufficient the laborious validation process needs simplification , said stefaan de rynck from the internal market and services division at the european commission . " we want to get rid of the procedure where you have to translate a patent into all languages in order for it to be valid , " he told deutsche welle .
" patents should be valid across the eu if they are in english , french or german . " this would considerably lower registration costs as the largest part currently goes into translating the relevant documents into the individual countries ' languages . authors : nina haase , brigitta moll -lrb- dpa , ap -rrb- editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : focus : midterm elections in the us eu and us ' must work together , ' says diplomat obama seeks to mobilize disappointed voters foreign donations spark row ahead of us midterm elections european companies back climate skeptics in us senate race , report says elections -pipe- 29.10.2010 shift to the right in midterm elections could affect us foreign policy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the foreign policy leanings of many tea party candidates are unclear the issue of us foreign policy has hardly played a role in the congressional midterm elections campaign .
however , the outcome might well have an impact on washington 's relations with the rest of the world . when american voters head to the polls to elect a new house of representatives and 37 new senators , there is perhaps nothing that sums up their sentiment better than the old adage from bill clinton 's 1992 presidential campaign : " it 's the economy , stupid . " and with unemployment hovering at close to 10 percent , a collapsed housing market and a stuttering economy , there certainly is ample reason for voters to worry about their personal well-being . to be sure , there are definitely enough foreign policy issues that would merit the electorate 's attention too : a war in afghanistan , now in its ninth year , which is not going well , a tense situation in the middle east with us-sponsored negotiations between israelis and palestinians always on the verge of collapse , iran 's alleged efforts to acquire nuclear weapons still unresolved and north korea in the middle of a leadership handover .
but all of that does n't really matter , says thomas e. mann , a congressional scholar at the brookings institution in washington : " for the most part the public is so distressed and pessimistic about the economy that that is what 's dominating the campaigns , " he told deutsche welle . international issues on the sidelines the only way foreign policy gets any traction as an election topic is when it relates to a domestic issue , adds mann .
china , for example , plays a role in certain campaigns when trade issues or the currency imbalances are discussed .
and mexico is addressed when illegal immigration and its effect on the economy is debated .
other than that , domestic issues , especially the economy , dominate the midterm elections almost completely .
while foreign policy issues have no impact on the election , the results of the elections could well have an impact on us foreign policy .
if , as most pollsters predict , the republicans win back the house of representatives and stand a small chance of also retaking the senate , this will have implications for the way washington carries out international relations . " there are a lot of republican candidates running for the house who are tea party candidates , who are very hard-right candidates , " douglas foyle , a professor at wesleyan university who has researched about the impact of domestic issues on international relations , told deutsche welle .
" they have n't said too much about foreign policy and so it 's anybody 's guess what they are going to do once they get into office . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president barack obama wo n't be able to get a climate change treaty through the new congress what the tea party candidates have said very clearly however , is that they want to balance the budget .
" if they are going to balance the budget , they will have to cut defense spending because that 's about half of all discretionary federal spending , " notes foyle .
" and pulling back in foreign policy in terms of the military is not something that traditionally the republicans would do . "
future of the republican party his colleague mann also sees a chance of a " significant number of tea party-based republicans coming in to the senate with rather extreme views on the limited role for government and really hostile sentiments toward globalization and international organizations . "
he adds : " if this group were to gain the upper hand in the republican party we would have one center-left party and one extreme-right party in the country .
that 's not reassuring . "
regardless how the soul searching of the republican party ends , the party 's majority in one or both chambers of congress would have an impact on us foreign policy in any case . while the president has considerably more leeway to pursue his own course in international affairs than on the domestic front and also serves as the commander-in-chief of the military , he ca n't disregard congress entirely .
first , congress approves the budget and through that can influence policy as well . " let 's look at afghanistan for example , " juergen chrobog , germany 's former ambassador in washington who now heads the bmw foundation herbert quandt , told deutsche welle : " the troops and the war must be financed .
and here the members of congress have an enormous lever : they can give more or less . "
treaties face tough obstacles what 's more , congress is also needed to ratify international treaties .
even with a sizeable majority in both chambers during the first half of his term , president barack obama could n't get a climate change treaty through congress .
with a republican majority in one or both chambers of congress , predict the experts , a climate change treaty which must be ratified by a two-thirds majority in the senate is all but dead .
the fate of the new start treaty , the follow-up to the original nuclear disarmament pact signed by republican icon ronald reagan and soviet leader mikhail gorbachev , is also uncertain . the lame duck senate will vote on the issue in the middle of november . whether it goes through is still unclear .
if it does n't , it seems rather unlikely that it will have an easier time in the new senate . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us voters worry primarily about the economy and about losing their jobs " i do n't see any major treaties like these being ratified , at least not easily , " says chrobog .
" i hope that president obama and the democrats at least keep their majority in the senate . "
the likely swing to the right in the midterm elections could make us foreign policy less predictable and more complicated , argue the experts .
still , they add , europeans should n't fret too much about the outcome of the polls . " i think the most important thing for those looking from abroad at this election is to realize this is not fundamentally about ideology , " says mann .
" this is about americans being scared and sour and pessimistic about our economic well-being and instinctively voting against the party in power . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de work -pipe- 29.10.2010 berlin : home of the poor , unpaid intern großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's mayor , klaus wowereit , once proudly announced that his city was " poor but sexy , " but with this rather chic poverty comes a cynical exploitation of eager young workers . the uk media was recently full of reports about the national union of journalists ' new campaign , cashback for interns , in which the union encouraged people who had completed internships to sue their former employers for unpaid wages .
while some thought the move was silly and a rather pitiful example of the nanny state , many others supported the campaign , claiming a fair wage was a rather obvious basic reward for a hard day 's work . while the nuj campaign undoubtedly gathers momentum over in england , one can only hope that something similar starts here in berlin ; a movement dedicated to reigning in the blatant exploitation of students and new graduates in the workplace .
poor and sexy berlin may be but it is also rife with stinginess when it comes to doling out the wages . a typical internship - or praktikum as they 're known - in berlin runs for around six months , during which time the " successful " applicant is expected to work from monday to friday , often putting in shifts of over eight hours , for no money whatsoever .
the employer therefore only needs to take on two keen young workers and he or she has extra much-needed manpower for a whole year and it does n't cost a nickel . my former flatmate once got an actual job in a shop and was put on a six-month trial period during which time she received a lower-than-average trainee wage while her employer was not legally obliged to make any health insurance or social security contributions .
lo and behold once the trial was over , the employer decided she was n't right for the job and let her go .
when she returned to pick up some bits and pieces she 'd left behind , there was a new girl doing exactly the same job in her place , presumably on yet another trial run .
little wonder that berlin city magazine , zitty , recently ran with " generation praktikant " -lrb- generation intern -rrb- as their cover story . bildunterschrift : interns need to juggle many tasks at the same time to impress potential employers - but how are they expected to pay the bills ? call me mr jump-to-conclusions but i would imagine as an employer that i could pretty accurately assess a person 's suitability for a job after two or three days ; a trial period of six months does seem rather excessive but it is yet another way to milk a year 's hard graft out of two poor saps without having to cough up for the privilege . a friend of a friend told me a tale of a girl who had re-located to berlin from the states on the promise of a job at a local radio station only to be on the phone to her parents in tears three months later as she 'd still not received any money .
she had , however , very promptly received an eviction notice on her flat , given that she had n't paid any rent .
everyone has some internship-related horror story that either happened to them or a friend . now it is n't , of course , all doom and gloom .
a good number of students and graduates take on internship positions fully aware that they are n't going to receive any money and do so with other funding behind them -lrb- savings or money from their parents , for example -rrb- and use their six months with the company to gain some valuable work experience .
sadly though , internships never seem to be offered on the basis that the employer is scouting for hot new talent to add to his or her company .
interns seem to be cynically picked like cherries just so there is always someone there to answer the phone and take the mail to the post office . this exploitation of workers really does need to be addressed , especially in berlin , a city which exists on the labors of the intern and those who do either one-euro-an-hour job while also receiving welfare money .
it 's all very well gaining industry experience but if no one in the industry is prepared to give you a proper job you might as well sign up for unemployment benefit and spend your day doing crosswords . since i would n't be in the least bit surprised if even the city 's decision-makers were themselves a rotating army of interns , it seems unlikely that the problem will be tackled at an official level anytime soon .
so it 's time for a revolution .
berlin 's interns need to strike , even just for a day , for fair pay , while employers look on in horror as virtually every business in the city grinds to an absolute halt . of course , if revolution is n't your thing , just do the unpaid berlin internship and head off to munich .
after all , that 's where all the money is . neale lytollis has happily never done an unpaid internship , despite working in the media . editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

while some thought the move was silly and a rather pitiful example of the nanny state , many others supported the campaign , claiming a fair wage was a rather obvious basic reward for a hard day 's work . while the nuj campaign undoubtedly gathers momentum over in england , one can only hope that something similar starts here in berlin ; a movement dedicated to reigning in the blatant exploitation of students and new graduates in the workplace .
poor and sexy berlin may be but it is also rife with stinginess when it comes to doling out the wages . a typical internship - or praktikum as they 're known - in berlin runs for around six months , during which time the " successful " applicant is expected to work from monday to friday , often putting in shifts of over eight hours , for no money whatsoever .
the employer therefore only needs to take on two keen young workers and he or she has extra much-needed manpower for a whole year and it does n't cost a nickel . my former flatmate once got an actual job in a shop and was put on a six-month trial period during which time she received a lower-than-average trainee wage while her employer was not legally obliged to make any health insurance or social security contributions .
lo and behold once the trial was over , the employer decided she was n't right for the job and let her go .
when she returned to pick up some bits and pieces she 'd left behind , there was a new girl doing exactly the same job in her place , presumably on yet another trial run .
little wonder that berlin city magazine , zitty , recently ran with " generation praktikant " -lrb- generation intern -rrb- as their cover story . bildunterschrift : interns need to juggle many tasks at the same time to impress potential employers - but how are they expected to pay the bills ? call me mr jump-to-conclusions but i would imagine as an employer that i could pretty accurately assess a person 's suitability for a job after two or three days ; a trial period of six months does seem rather excessive but it is yet another way to milk a year 's hard graft out of two poor saps without having to cough up for the privilege . a friend of a friend told me a tale of a girl who had re-located to berlin from the states on the promise of a job at a local radio station only to be on the phone to her parents in tears three months later as she 'd still not received any money .
she had , however , very promptly received an eviction notice on her flat , given that she had n't paid any rent .
everyone has some internship-related horror story that either happened to them or a friend . now it is n't , of course , all doom and gloom .
a good number of students and graduates take on internship positions fully aware that they are n't going to receive any money and do so with other funding behind them -lrb- savings or money from their parents , for example -rrb- and use their six months with the company to gain some valuable work experience .
sadly though , internships never seem to be offered on the basis that the employer is scouting for hot new talent to add to his or her company .
interns seem to be cynically picked like cherries just so there is always someone there to answer the phone and take the mail to the post office . this exploitation of workers really does need to be addressed , especially in berlin , a city which exists on the labors of the intern and those who do either one-euro-an-hour job while also receiving welfare money .
it 's all very well gaining industry experience but if no one in the industry is prepared to give you a proper job you might as well sign up for unemployment benefit and spend your day doing crosswords . since i would n't be in the least bit surprised if even the city 's decision-makers were themselves a rotating army of interns , it seems unlikely that the problem will be tackled at an official level anytime soon .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de integration -pipe- 29.10.2010 greens propose simplified citizenship laws for retired immigrants großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the proposal would make becoming a citizen easier for some good german is required to get german citizenship .
one lawmaker says it 's time to do long-term immigrants a favor and loosen up that rule . new legislation introduced in the german parliament could allow certain groups to get a german passport more easily and quickly , as well as granting more people the right to hold dual citizenship .
currently , immigrants who want to get german citizenship must take a naturalization test and show that they have a firm grasp of the language .
in addition , they generally have to renounce their previous citizenship .
pensioners who came to the country as immigrants are one of the groups that would benefit most from a change to the law .
if the bill were passed , a person who is over 53 years old and has been living in germany for at least 15 years could apply for a passport without meeting the language requirements .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kilic wants to see an immigrant 's work rewarded " if a person has made a contribution to this society , i want to make it easier for them to become citizens , " green party parliamentarian memet kilic told deutsche welle .
" especially older immigrants - who gave their youth and health to build up this country - should be able to obtain citizenship without a language requirement .
that way , we can win the hearts of their children and grandchildren for this country . "
integration conversation kilic 's bill comes as the integration of immigrants is under the microscope in germany .
chancellor angela merkel , a christian democrat , said earlier this month that multiculturalism had failed in germany .
there have also been repeated calls for immigrants to integrate better into german society by learning the language and customs .
kilic , who was born in turkey , said the legislation he sponsored would be welcome news to immigrants .
" third-generation immigrant children in germany hear three times a day that they do n't belong to this country , " he said .
" what good is that ?
i want to turn the tables . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : integration is hard to define in germany in support of the bill , kilic cited statistics showing that the number of citizens naturalized in germany each year had fallen by 20 percent since 2004 .
this was an indication that becoming a german citizen was simply too difficult , he said .
without citizenship , many of germany 's 6.7 million immigrants do not have the right to vote in the country .
but citizenship goes beyond the legal realm .
" integration means more than simply structural integration , " said guelistan guerbey , a political scientist at berlin 's free university .
" it has a very strong emotional and psychological dimension . "
this is especially true for dual citizens .
if the bill became law , an immigrant would no longer have to give up their passport to become german .
guerbey said this would have a positive effect .
" a person has emotional ties in both directions , " she said , " and dual citizenship is a legal recognition of this emotional state . "
time to learn german but while legal benefits and emotional satisfaction might encourage a retired immigrant with less-than-perfect german to apply for citizenship under the loosened rules of the proposed law , they may never get the chance .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : learning german is essential for integration , says grindel on thursday in the bundestag , reinhard grindel of the governing christian democrats , was clear about what his party thought of the proposal .
" when someone wants to become a german citizen , " grindel said , " then i have to be able to say , as an incentive , that you must learn german if you have n't learned it well enough already .
that 's a part of the integration process - to finally learn german . "
and there is reason to believe that many retired immigrants in germany would n't apply for a german passport if the rules were loosened .
some come from other european union countries , where moving across borders is n't problematic , though they do not have full voting rights in germany .
but kilic says there are some 2,000-3,000 retirees from other countries who would gladly take advantage of the opportunity .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de competition -pipe- 29.10.2010 eu pushes to simplify patents for new bright ideas großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protecting your product across the eu is costly and complex european inventors currently spend 10 times as much protecting their ideas as their us counterparts .
but now the eu wants to make patent protection easier and less expensive for the bloc 's inventors . the economic crisis has n't put european companies and independent inventors off investing into research and development .
judged by the some 60,000 patents issued so far this year in germany , the country 's is on track to meet 2009 's total . " companies followed experts ' advice and continued investing in new products - even though we were in the middle of a crisis , " bettina berner of the german patent and trade mark office -lrb- dpma -rrb- said on thursday at the opening ceremony of the 62nd edition of the inventors ' trade fair iena in nuremberg . hoping for a break through bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some 800 products , like an unpoppable tire , are on display at the iena trade fair inventors from 37 countries are currently presenting some 800 new products at the fair , which the organizers said is the largest of its kind in the world . rollerblades , the folding bicycle and inflatable water wings are some of products that went on to conquer the world after being presented in nuremberg .
like their successful predecessors , many inventors at this year 's fair are hoping for break-through deals with the industry so their products can be mass-produced . shaky hands ?
no problem ! bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the willomat tray lets the clumsy wait tables - without worrying guests bernhard haehnsen is one such inventor .
the former ship 's captain grew tired moping up after glasses spilled their contents as his ship pitched on the high seas .
his neighbor barbara willomat designed a way to stabilize glasses and cups on trays .
special suction cups which can be fixed on a tray hold retainers in different shapes and sizes . " when you 're carrying beer glasses on a tray across wobbly grass in a beer garden , the glasses break easily if you do n't attach them , " haehnsen said , adding that the willomat tray could also facilitate work in hospitals and help anyone with shaky hands . register first , then show it bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moreau 's idea came when he saw a report about delayed flights other products on display at iena this year include a foldable chair attached to a suitcase , invented by 12-year-old johannes von moreau , and a remote control for model sports cars which can be used with one hand rather than two . the two inventors kevin hummel and nicolas rathauser have registered their product with the munich-based german patent office -lrb- dpma -rrb- already .
that 's a step experts strongly recommend . " many independent inventors do n't have their products registered before they present them at a trade fair , " said dpma spokesperson berner . lengthy , costly patent process but inventors who want to protect their product in more than one european country currently have to undergo a tedious and costly process that begins with registration at the european patent office . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : inventors register their products here : the european patent office in munich " you have to decide in how many countries you want to have your patent validated , " heinrich dornbusch , a consultant with german patent marketing agency provendis , told deutsche welle .
" currently you have to do that separately in every single member state .
this means you have to invest a lot of time and money . " the costs for registering a product in 13 of the eu 's 27 countries , for instance , can easily amount to more than 20,000 euros -lrb- $ 28,000 -rrb- - 10 times the cost of a patent in the united states , according to dornbusch three languages sufficient the laborious validation process needs simplification , said stefaan de rynck from the internal market and services division at the european commission . " we want to get rid of the procedure where you have to translate a patent into all languages in order for it to be valid , " he told deutsche welle .
" patents should be valid across the eu if they are in english , french or german .

but now the eu wants to make patent protection easier and less expensive for the bloc 's inventors . the economic crisis has n't put european companies and independent inventors off investing into research and development .
judged by the some 60,000 patents issued so far this year in germany , the country 's is on track to meet 2009 's total . " companies followed experts ' advice and continued investing in new products - even though we were in the middle of a crisis , " bettina berner of the german patent and trade mark office -lrb- dpma -rrb- said on thursday at the opening ceremony of the 62nd edition of the inventors ' trade fair iena in nuremberg . hoping for a break through bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some 800 products , like an unpoppable tire , are on display at the iena trade fair inventors from 37 countries are currently presenting some 800 new products at the fair , which the organizers said is the largest of its kind in the world . rollerblades , the folding bicycle and inflatable water wings are some of products that went on to conquer the world after being presented in nuremberg .
like their successful predecessors , many inventors at this year 's fair are hoping for break-through deals with the industry so their products can be mass-produced . shaky hands ?
no problem ! bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the willomat tray lets the clumsy wait tables - without worrying guests bernhard haehnsen is one such inventor .
the former ship 's captain grew tired moping up after glasses spilled their contents as his ship pitched on the high seas .
his neighbor barbara willomat designed a way to stabilize glasses and cups on trays .
special suction cups which can be fixed on a tray hold retainers in different shapes and sizes . " when you 're carrying beer glasses on a tray across wobbly grass in a beer garden , the glasses break easily if you do n't attach them , " haehnsen said , adding that the willomat tray could also facilitate work in hospitals and help anyone with shaky hands . register first , then show it bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moreau 's idea came when he saw a report about delayed flights other products on display at iena this year include a foldable chair attached to a suitcase , invented by 12-year-old johannes von moreau , and a remote control for model sports cars which can be used with one hand rather than two . the two inventors kevin hummel and nicolas rathauser have registered their product with the munich-based german patent office -lrb- dpma -rrb- already .
that 's a step experts strongly recommend . " many independent inventors do n't have their products registered before they present them at a trade fair , " said dpma spokesperson berner . lengthy , costly patent process but inventors who want to protect their product in more than one european country currently have to undergo a tedious and costly process that begins with registration at the european patent office . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : inventors register their products here : the european patent office in munich " you have to decide in how many countries you want to have your patent validated , " heinrich dornbusch , a consultant with german patent marketing agency provendis , told deutsche welle .
" currently you have to do that separately in every single member state .
this means you have to invest a lot of time and money . " the costs for registering a product in 13 of the eu 's 27 countries , for instance , can easily amount to more than 20,000 euros -lrb- $ 28,000 -rrb- - 10 times the cost of a patent in the united states , according to dornbusch three languages sufficient the laborious validation process needs simplification , said stefaan de rynck from the internal market and services division at the european commission . " we want to get rid of the procedure where you have to translate a patent into all languages in order for it to be valid , " he told deutsche welle .
" patents should be valid across the eu if they are in english , french or german .

german chancellor angela merkel said the leaders had had a " profound and difficult discussion , " and other participants described the discussions as heated and emotional . merkel added that she was satisfied with the outcome of the debate : " we have promoted our essential points , " she said .
" everyone is in agreement that a limited change to the lisbon treaty is necessary . " eu council president herman van rompuy told a news conference that " important decisions to strengthen the eurozone " had been taken .
" we recommend a robust and credible permanent crisis resolution mechanism to safeguard the financial stability of the eurozone as a whole , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : van rompuy is now charged with proposing the amendments merkel stressed that the current , limited protection of loan guarantees for euro states was not a permanent solution under the current treaty conditions .
she said the new crisis mechanism would only be " valid for cases where the stability of the euro as a whole is at risk . " " we said once more that ... should a country ever need to make use of this , it would be faced with very strict requirements , " she said . opposition to budget increase some non-eurozone states threw around their weight in the discussions , like the united kingdom , which sought to cap the eu 's budget next year , and poland , which wants the calculation of its national debt to take into account costly pension reforms . merkel chimed in , saying , " if we have to reduce our budget at home - we do this at the federal level by more than 3 percent - it can not be that the european budget rises by nearly 6 percent . " the leaders asked van rompuy to prepare potential changes to the lisbon treaty ahead of another eu summit in december .
the changes are to be agreed on by mid-2013 , the expiration date of a 750-billion euro -lrb- $ 1 trillion -rrb- fund set up last may to reassure markets that greece 's debt crisis would not spill over to the rest of the continent . tough reform process bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy and merkel jointly proposed tough sanctions on overspenders germany , europe 's largest economy , led the calls at the summit for tougher penalties on states that exceed the eurozone 's limit on budget deficits of 3 percent of gross domestic product . merkel and french president nicolas sarkozy had called for the suspension of voting rights of members who flout budget rules , but such a reform was unpopular with several smaller states . " if treaty change is to reduce the rights of member states on voting , i find it unacceptable , and , frankly speaking , it is not realistic , " european commission president jose manuel barroso said . it would also likely turn into a political nightmare for national governments .
the lisbon treaty took 10 years of wrangling to enact , after challenges in national courts and referendum failures in france , ireland and the netherlands . " many countries do not want a huge treaty reform , and therefore we are trying to narrow it down to a very limited treaty change that should be acceptable for countries without having to face referendums , " swedish prime minister fredrik reinfeldt said . although the proposals were weaker than merkel had pushed for , she said the eu had underlined that " private investors will not be able to make money or speculate against the euro .

there 's no need to question a perfectly reasonable on-the-nose prediction - at least not when it comes from afar .
another realm , in this case .
here dw sports forward the spooky ones ' predictions for match day ten . match day nine ’ s predictions saw the dw pundits increase their week-on-week total with six points .
not such a special tally , but one that included a surprising spot-on forecast of werder bremen 's 4-1 victory away to borussia moenchengladbach .
to fight the unsubstantiated and scurrilous accusations of match-fixing that have been swirling , dw 's experts are ready to come clean - the spirits made them do it .
they 're still under their control , in fact : here are their picks for week ten .
friday , oct .
29 bayern - freiburg few would have predicted freiburg being above bayern after nine games but the league table does n't lie .
bayern are suffering a crisis of confidence and fluidity in the bundesliga , while the freiburgers are just enjoying their early season ride .
robin dutt ’ s men have notched points against their mid-table rivals but have come unstuck against the better teams .
ordinarily bayern would be included in that latter category , but right now they 're adrift in mediocrity .
however , at home , with a partisan crowd expecting a return to the status quo , bayern should edge it .
prediction : bayern 2-1 saturday , oct .
30 bremen - nuremberg bremen have managed to steady their ship after a choppy start to the season and are unbeaten in five league games .
they still lie in eighth place but show signs of rediscovering the consistency which could see them climb the table .
but this is werder , remember , and nothing can be taken for granted .
they can win 4-1 one week and get thumped by the same scoreline the next .
nuremberg are experiencing the pendulum of form ; winning one week , losing the next .
if it continues to swing , after beating wolfsburg last week , then bremen should come out on top in this one .
prediction : bremen 3-0 wolfsburg - stuttgart bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : keller has got stuttgart winning again and out of danger jens keller is unbeaten as stuttgart coach after taking over from the sacked christian gross two weeks ago , and the four points his team has eked out in their last two league games have taken them out of the drop zone .
confidence is slowly coming back , boosted by recent europa league and dfb cup wins , and while it is still a nascent recovery , vfb do have some momentum at last .
wolfsburg , on the other hand , have lost theirs .
two defeats and a loss have put the skids under their own revival and coming into this match , stuttgart look to have the edge .
stuttgart : 1-0 cologne - hamburg the enigma that is hamburger sv continues to confound .
after an impressive start followed by a worrying slump , hsv are rebuilding their campaign by going three games unbeaten .
two wins and a goalless draw against bayern could have been seen as a solid base to push on , but their 5-2 cup hammering at the hands of frankfurt in midweek may have released old demons .
cologne , however , appear to have little in their locker which could inflict such a heavy defeat on hamburg - in fact , any kind of defeat looks unlikely .
the bottom club have a solitary win to their name and their second isn ’ t likely to come this weekend , even with the benefit of home advantage .
prediction : hamburg 2-0 kaiserslautern - moenchengladbach kaiserslautern 's last win - the impressive 2-0 defeat of bayern - seems a long time ago .
indeed since those heady days of august , when kaiserslautern notched two wins on the trot , all that has followed is a downward spiral of six reversals and a draw , leaving the red devils hovering perilously over the drop zone .
they got a welcome boost with a midweek cup win - but then again so did gladbach .
however , given that gladbach slipped to second-from-bottom after their sixth defeat of the season last weekend , little should be read into that .
these are two teams in deep , albeit it early , trouble .
their desperation may cancel each other out .
prediction : draw 2-2 st. pauli - frankfurt given they were afforded little chance of staying up this season , st- pauli 's current position in 10th could already be hailed as a triumph .
as long as they do n't start panicking that last week 's defeat to stuttgart and their slight tumble down the league is the start of their predicted demise , st. pauli have the guts to slog it out and remain in the bundesliga .
frankfurt sit a place above them on goal difference with an exact replica of the hamburg club 's record to date .
eintracht come into this game on the back of three wins and a draw so they will be up for it against pauli .
expect a gutsy battle .
prediction : draw 1-1 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : raul did n't expect to swap real madrid for a relegation fight schalke - leverkusen things still look desperate for schalke .
their only victory in the league this season , ground out against freiburg over a month ago , looks increasingly like a false dawn .
a defeat and three draws suggests little has been put right since .
their home form has been pitiful and leverkusen will certainly fancy their chances when they make the journey to gelsenkirchen on saturday .
leverkusen have had plenty of joy on their travels .
unbeaten in four away games with three wins and a draw , it appears to be advantage bayer .
schalke 's revival will have to wait at least another week .
prediction : leverkusen 3-2 sunday , oct .
31 mainz - dortmund halloween came early for dortmund in the dfb cup on wednesday .
instead of the treat they might have expected from a fixture against a third division side , they got tricked in a 4-2 loss on penalties at kickers offenbach .
bvb , who have been on fire in front of goal , will be wondering how they went 120 minutes without scoring and will be hoping they find they find the target ahead of this first-versus-second clash .
mainz , who returned to the summit last weekend , also lost in the cup to alemannia aachen so this game is primed for both teams to put their woes behind them .
dortmund will have the added incentive of going top if they win and could take heart from the fact that mainz 's only league defeat so far has come at home .
prediction : dortmund 3-1 hoffenheim - hanover bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hannover 's players are n't suffering from altitude sickness hanover continues to overachieve this season .
up to third after last week 's victory over cologne , they look to have put the brakes on the minor slide which affected them after losing to st. pauli at the start of october .
hoffenheim , meanwhile , are still challenging at the top end but their own push for the summit has suffered a few hiccups in recent weeks .
after three wins on the bounce at the start of the season , it took hoffenheim until two weeks ago to record their next .
keeping dortmund at bay in last week 's 1-1 draw suggests they 've found their balance again but hanover may edge this to keep their impressive campaign on track .
prediction : hannover 1-0 last week 's results : 6 points hamburg - bayern 0-0 -lrb- dw prediction : 1-2 -rrb- frankfurt - schalke 0-0 -lrb- dw prediction : 2-2 -rrb- moenchengladbach - werder bremen 1-4 -lrb- dw prediction : 1-4 -rrb- freiburg - kaiserslautern 2-1 -lrb- dw prediction : 1-1 -rrb- hanover - cologne 2-1 -lrb- dw prediction : 1-0 -rrb- nuremberg - wolfsburg 2-1 -lrb- dw prediction : 1-2 -rrb- dortmund - hoffenheim 1-1 -lrb- dw prediction : 2-0 -rrb- leverkusen - mainz 0-1 -lrb- dw prediction : 2-1 -rrb- stuttgart - st.pauli 2-0 -lrb- dw prediction : 1-2 -rrb- total for the season : 43 three points for a correct score prediction two points for a correct margin prediction one point for a correct winner prediction author : nick amies editor : matt hermann send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

however , the outcome might well have an impact on washington 's relations with the rest of the world . when american voters head to the polls to elect a new house of representatives and 37 new senators , there is perhaps nothing that sums up their sentiment better than the old adage from bill clinton 's 1992 presidential campaign : " it 's the economy , stupid . " and with unemployment hovering at close to 10 percent , a collapsed housing market and a stuttering economy , there certainly is ample reason for voters to worry about their personal well-being . to be sure , there are definitely enough foreign policy issues that would merit the electorate 's attention too : a war in afghanistan , now in its ninth year , which is not going well , a tense situation in the middle east with us-sponsored negotiations between israelis and palestinians always on the verge of collapse , iran 's alleged efforts to acquire nuclear weapons still unresolved and north korea in the middle of a leadership handover .
but all of that does n't really matter , says thomas e. mann , a congressional scholar at the brookings institution in washington : " for the most part the public is so distressed and pessimistic about the economy that that is what 's dominating the campaigns , " he told deutsche welle . international issues on the sidelines the only way foreign policy gets any traction as an election topic is when it relates to a domestic issue , adds mann .
china , for example , plays a role in certain campaigns when trade issues or the currency imbalances are discussed .
and mexico is addressed when illegal immigration and its effect on the economy is debated .
other than that , domestic issues , especially the economy , dominate the midterm elections almost completely .
while foreign policy issues have no impact on the election , the results of the elections could well have an impact on us foreign policy .
if , as most pollsters predict , the republicans win back the house of representatives and stand a small chance of also retaking the senate , this will have implications for the way washington carries out international relations . " there are a lot of republican candidates running for the house who are tea party candidates , who are very hard-right candidates , " douglas foyle , a professor at wesleyan university who has researched about the impact of domestic issues on international relations , told deutsche welle .
" they have n't said too much about foreign policy and so it 's anybody 's guess what they are going to do once they get into office . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president barack obama wo n't be able to get a climate change treaty through the new congress what the tea party candidates have said very clearly however , is that they want to balance the budget .
" if they are going to balance the budget , they will have to cut defense spending because that 's about half of all discretionary federal spending , " notes foyle .
" and pulling back in foreign policy in terms of the military is not something that traditionally the republicans would do . "
future of the republican party his colleague mann also sees a chance of a " significant number of tea party-based republicans coming in to the senate with rather extreme views on the limited role for government and really hostile sentiments toward globalization and international organizations . "
he adds : " if this group were to gain the upper hand in the republican party we would have one center-left party and one extreme-right party in the country .
that 's not reassuring . "
regardless how the soul searching of the republican party ends , the party 's majority in one or both chambers of congress would have an impact on us foreign policy in any case . while the president has considerably more leeway to pursue his own course in international affairs than on the domestic front and also serves as the commander-in-chief of the military , he ca n't disregard congress entirely .
first , congress approves the budget and through that can influence policy as well . " let 's look at afghanistan for example , " juergen chrobog , germany 's former ambassador in washington who now heads the bmw foundation herbert quandt , told deutsche welle : " the troops and the war must be financed .
and here the members of congress have an enormous lever : they can give more or less . "
treaties face tough obstacles what 's more , congress is also needed to ratify international treaties .
even with a sizeable majority in both chambers during the first half of his term , president barack obama could n't get a climate change treaty through congress .
with a republican majority in one or both chambers of congress , predict the experts , a climate change treaty which must be ratified by a two-thirds majority in the senate is all but dead .
the fate of the new start treaty , the follow-up to the original nuclear disarmament pact signed by republican icon ronald reagan and soviet leader mikhail gorbachev , is also uncertain . the lame duck senate will vote on the issue in the middle of november . whether it goes through is still unclear .
if it does n't , it seems rather unlikely that it will have an easier time in the new senate . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us voters worry primarily about the economy and about losing their jobs " i do n't see any major treaties like these being ratified , at least not easily , " says chrobog .
" i hope that president obama and the democrats at least keep their majority in the senate . "
the likely swing to the right in the midterm elections could make us foreign policy less predictable and more complicated , argue the experts .
still , they add , europeans should n't fret too much about the outcome of the polls . " i think the most important thing for those looking from abroad at this election is to realize this is not fundamentally about ideology , " says mann .
" this is about americans being scared and sour and pessimistic about our economic well-being and instinctively voting against the party in power . "

german chancellor angela merkel said the leaders had had a " profound and difficult discussion , " and other participants described the discussions as heated and emotional . merkel added that she was satisfied with the outcome of the debate : " we have promoted our essential points , " she said .
" everyone is in agreement that a limited change to the lisbon treaty is necessary . " eu council president herman van rompuy told a news conference that " important decisions to strengthen the eurozone " had been taken .
" we recommend a robust and credible permanent crisis resolution mechanism to safeguard the financial stability of the eurozone as a whole , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : van rompuy is now charged with proposing the amendments merkel stressed that the current , limited protection of loan guarantees for euro states was not a permanent solution under the current treaty conditions .
she said the new crisis mechanism would only be " valid for cases where the stability of the euro as a whole is at risk . " " we said once more that ... should a country ever need to make use of this , it would be faced with very strict requirements , " she said . opposition to budget increase some non-eurozone states threw around their weight in the discussions , like the united kingdom , which sought to cap the eu 's budget next year , and poland , which wants the calculation of its national debt to take into account costly pension reforms . merkel chimed in , saying , " if we have to reduce our budget at home - we do this at the federal level by more than 3 percent - it can not be that the european budget rises by nearly 6 percent . " the leaders asked van rompuy to prepare potential changes to the lisbon treaty ahead of another eu summit in december .
the changes are to be agreed on by mid-2013 , the expiration date of a 750-billion euro -lrb- $ 1 trillion -rrb- fund set up last may to reassure markets that greece 's debt crisis would not spill over to the rest of the continent . tough reform process bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy and merkel jointly proposed tough sanctions on overspenders germany , europe 's largest economy , led the calls at the summit for tougher penalties on states that exceed the eurozone 's limit on budget deficits of 3 percent of gross domestic product . merkel and french president nicolas sarkozy had called for the suspension of voting rights of members who flout budget rules , but such a reform was unpopular with several smaller states . " if treaty change is to reduce the rights of member states on voting , i find it unacceptable , and , frankly speaking , it is not realistic , " european commission president jose manuel barroso said . it would also likely turn into a political nightmare for national governments .
the lisbon treaty took 10 years of wrangling to enact , after challenges in national courts and referendum failures in france , ireland and the netherlands . " many countries do not want a huge treaty reform , and therefore we are trying to narrow it down to a very limited treaty change that should be acceptable for countries without having to face referendums , " swedish prime minister fredrik reinfeldt said . although the proposals were weaker than merkel had pushed for , she said the eu had underlined that " private investors will not be able to make money or speculate against the euro .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de work -pipe- 29.10.2010 berlin : home of the poor , unpaid intern großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's mayor , klaus wowereit , once proudly announced that his city was " poor but sexy , " but with this rather chic poverty comes a cynical exploitation of eager young workers . the uk media was recently full of reports about the national union of journalists ' new campaign , cashback for interns , in which the union encouraged people who had completed internships to sue their former employers for unpaid wages .
while some thought the move was silly and a rather pitiful example of the nanny state , many others supported the campaign , claiming a fair wage was a rather obvious basic reward for a hard day 's work . while the nuj campaign undoubtedly gathers momentum over in england , one can only hope that something similar starts here in berlin ; a movement dedicated to reigning in the blatant exploitation of students and new graduates in the workplace .
poor and sexy berlin may be but it is also rife with stinginess when it comes to doling out the wages . a typical internship - or praktikum as they 're known - in berlin runs for around six months , during which time the " successful " applicant is expected to work from monday to friday , often putting in shifts of over eight hours , for no money whatsoever .
the employer therefore only needs to take on two keen young workers and he or she has extra much-needed manpower for a whole year and it does n't cost a nickel . my former flatmate once got an actual job in a shop and was put on a six-month trial period during which time she received a lower-than-average trainee wage while her employer was not legally obliged to make any health insurance or social security contributions .
lo and behold once the trial was over , the employer decided she was n't right for the job and let her go .
when she returned to pick up some bits and pieces she 'd left behind , there was a new girl doing exactly the same job in her place , presumably on yet another trial run .
little wonder that berlin city magazine , zitty , recently ran with " generation praktikant " -lrb- generation intern -rrb- as their cover story . bildunterschrift : interns need to juggle many tasks at the same time to impress potential employers - but how are they expected to pay the bills ? call me mr jump-to-conclusions but i would imagine as an employer that i could pretty accurately assess a person 's suitability for a job after two or three days ; a trial period of six months does seem rather excessive but it is yet another way to milk a year 's hard graft out of two poor saps without having to cough up for the privilege . a friend of a friend told me a tale of a girl who had re-located to berlin from the states on the promise of a job at a local radio station only to be on the phone to her parents in tears three months later as she 'd still not received any money .
she had , however , very promptly received an eviction notice on her flat , given that she had n't paid any rent .
everyone has some internship-related horror story that either happened to them or a friend . now it is n't , of course , all doom and gloom .
a good number of students and graduates take on internship positions fully aware that they are n't going to receive any money and do so with other funding behind them -lrb- savings or money from their parents , for example -rrb- and use their six months with the company to gain some valuable work experience .
sadly though , internships never seem to be offered on the basis that the employer is scouting for hot new talent to add to his or her company .
interns seem to be cynically picked like cherries just so there is always someone there to answer the phone and take the mail to the post office . this exploitation of workers really does need to be addressed , especially in berlin , a city which exists on the labors of the intern and those who do either one-euro-an-hour job while also receiving welfare money .
it 's all very well gaining industry experience but if no one in the industry is prepared to give you a proper job you might as well sign up for unemployment benefit and spend your day doing crosswords . since i would n't be in the least bit surprised if even the city 's decision-makers were themselves a rotating army of interns , it seems unlikely that the problem will be tackled at an official level anytime soon .
so it 's time for a revolution .
berlin 's interns need to strike , even just for a day , for fair pay , while employers look on in horror as virtually every business in the city grinds to an absolute halt . of course , if revolution is n't your thing , just do the unpaid berlin internship and head off to munich .
after all , that 's where all the money is . neale lytollis has happily never done an unpaid internship , despite working in the media . editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

there 's no need to question a perfectly reasonable on-the-nose prediction - at least not when it comes from afar .
another realm , in this case .
here dw sports forward the spooky ones ' predictions for match day ten . match day nine ’ s predictions saw the dw pundits increase their week-on-week total with six points .
not such a special tally , but one that included a surprising spot-on forecast of werder bremen 's 4-1 victory away to borussia moenchengladbach .
to fight the unsubstantiated and scurrilous accusations of match-fixing that have been swirling , dw 's experts are ready to come clean - the spirits made them do it .
they 're still under their control , in fact : here are their picks for week ten .
friday , oct .
29 bayern - freiburg few would have predicted freiburg being above bayern after nine games but the league table does n't lie .
bayern are suffering a crisis of confidence and fluidity in the bundesliga , while the freiburgers are just enjoying their early season ride .
robin dutt ’ s men have notched points against their mid-table rivals but have come unstuck against the better teams .
ordinarily bayern would be included in that latter category , but right now they 're adrift in mediocrity .
however , at home , with a partisan crowd expecting a return to the status quo , bayern should edge it .
prediction : bayern 2-1 saturday , oct .
30 bremen - nuremberg bremen have managed to steady their ship after a choppy start to the season and are unbeaten in five league games .
they still lie in eighth place but show signs of rediscovering the consistency which could see them climb the table .
but this is werder , remember , and nothing can be taken for granted .
they can win 4-1 one week and get thumped by the same scoreline the next .
nuremberg are experiencing the pendulum of form ; winning one week , losing the next .
if it continues to swing , after beating wolfsburg last week , then bremen should come out on top in this one .
prediction : bremen 3-0 wolfsburg - stuttgart bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : keller has got stuttgart winning again and out of danger jens keller is unbeaten as stuttgart coach after taking over from the sacked christian gross two weeks ago , and the four points his team has eked out in their last two league games have taken them out of the drop zone .
confidence is slowly coming back , boosted by recent europa league and dfb cup wins , and while it is still a nascent recovery , vfb do have some momentum at last .
wolfsburg , on the other hand , have lost theirs .
two defeats and a loss have put the skids under their own revival and coming into this match , stuttgart look to have the edge .
stuttgart : 1-0 cologne - hamburg the enigma that is hamburger sv continues to confound .
after an impressive start followed by a worrying slump , hsv are rebuilding their campaign by going three games unbeaten .
two wins and a goalless draw against bayern could have been seen as a solid base to push on , but their 5-2 cup hammering at the hands of frankfurt in midweek may have released old demons .
cologne , however , appear to have little in their locker which could inflict such a heavy defeat on hamburg - in fact , any kind of defeat looks unlikely .
the bottom club have a solitary win to their name and their second isn ’ t likely to come this weekend , even with the benefit of home advantage .
prediction : hamburg 2-0 kaiserslautern - moenchengladbach kaiserslautern 's last win - the impressive 2-0 defeat of bayern - seems a long time ago .
indeed since those heady days of august , when kaiserslautern notched two wins on the trot , all that has followed is a downward spiral of six reversals and a draw , leaving the red devils hovering perilously over the drop zone .
they got a welcome boost with a midweek cup win - but then again so did gladbach .
however , given that gladbach slipped to second-from-bottom after their sixth defeat of the season last weekend , little should be read into that .
these are two teams in deep , albeit it early , trouble .
their desperation may cancel each other out .
prediction : draw 2-2 st. pauli - frankfurt given they were afforded little chance of staying up this season , st- pauli 's current position in 10th could already be hailed as a triumph .
as long as they do n't start panicking that last week 's defeat to stuttgart and their slight tumble down the league is the start of their predicted demise , st. pauli have the guts to slog it out and remain in the bundesliga .
frankfurt sit a place above them on goal difference with an exact replica of the hamburg club 's record to date .
eintracht come into this game on the back of three wins and a draw so they will be up for it against pauli .
expect a gutsy battle .
prediction : draw 1-1 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : raul did n't expect to swap real madrid for a relegation fight schalke - leverkusen things still look desperate for schalke .
their only victory in the league this season , ground out against freiburg over a month ago , looks increasingly like a false dawn .
a defeat and three draws suggests little has been put right since .
their home form has been pitiful and leverkusen will certainly fancy their chances when they make the journey to gelsenkirchen on saturday .
leverkusen have had plenty of joy on their travels .
unbeaten in four away games with three wins and a draw , it appears to be advantage bayer .
schalke 's revival will have to wait at least another week .
prediction : leverkusen 3-2 sunday , oct .
31 mainz - dortmund halloween came early for dortmund in the dfb cup on wednesday .
instead of the treat they might have expected from a fixture against a third division side , they got tricked in a 4-2 loss on penalties at kickers offenbach .
bvb , who have been on fire in front of goal , will be wondering how they went 120 minutes without scoring and will be hoping they find they find the target ahead of this first-versus-second clash .
mainz , who returned to the summit last weekend , also lost in the cup to alemannia aachen so this game is primed for both teams to put their woes behind them .
dortmund will have the added incentive of going top if they win and could take heart from the fact that mainz 's only league defeat so far has come at home .
prediction : dortmund 3-1 hoffenheim - hanover bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hannover 's players are n't suffering from altitude sickness hanover continues to overachieve this season .
up to third after last week 's victory over cologne , they look to have put the brakes on the minor slide which affected them after losing to st. pauli at the start of october .
hoffenheim , meanwhile , are still challenging at the top end but their own push for the summit has suffered a few hiccups in recent weeks .
after three wins on the bounce at the start of the season , it took hoffenheim until two weeks ago to record their next .
keeping dortmund at bay in last week 's 1-1 draw suggests they 've found their balance again but hanover may edge this to keep their impressive campaign on track .

one lawmaker says it 's time to do long-term immigrants a favor and loosen up that rule . new legislation introduced in the german parliament could allow certain groups to get a german passport more easily and quickly , as well as granting more people the right to hold dual citizenship .
currently , immigrants who want to get german citizenship must take a naturalization test and show that they have a firm grasp of the language .
in addition , they generally have to renounce their previous citizenship .
pensioners who came to the country as immigrants are one of the groups that would benefit most from a change to the law .
if the bill were passed , a person who is over 53 years old and has been living in germany for at least 15 years could apply for a passport without meeting the language requirements .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kilic wants to see an immigrant 's work rewarded " if a person has made a contribution to this society , i want to make it easier for them to become citizens , " green party parliamentarian memet kilic told deutsche welle .
" especially older immigrants - who gave their youth and health to build up this country - should be able to obtain citizenship without a language requirement .
that way , we can win the hearts of their children and grandchildren for this country . "
integration conversation kilic 's bill comes as the integration of immigrants is under the microscope in germany .
chancellor angela merkel , a christian democrat , said earlier this month that multiculturalism had failed in germany .
there have also been repeated calls for immigrants to integrate better into german society by learning the language and customs .
kilic , who was born in turkey , said the legislation he sponsored would be welcome news to immigrants .
" third-generation immigrant children in germany hear three times a day that they do n't belong to this country , " he said .
" what good is that ?
i want to turn the tables . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : integration is hard to define in germany in support of the bill , kilic cited statistics showing that the number of citizens naturalized in germany each year had fallen by 20 percent since 2004 .
this was an indication that becoming a german citizen was simply too difficult , he said .
without citizenship , many of germany 's 6.7 million immigrants do not have the right to vote in the country .
but citizenship goes beyond the legal realm .
" integration means more than simply structural integration , " said guelistan guerbey , a political scientist at berlin 's free university .
" it has a very strong emotional and psychological dimension . "
this is especially true for dual citizens .
if the bill became law , an immigrant would no longer have to give up their passport to become german .
guerbey said this would have a positive effect .
" a person has emotional ties in both directions , " she said , " and dual citizenship is a legal recognition of this emotional state . "
time to learn german but while legal benefits and emotional satisfaction might encourage a retired immigrant with less-than-perfect german to apply for citizenship under the loosened rules of the proposed law , they may never get the chance .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : learning german is essential for integration , says grindel on thursday in the bundestag , reinhard grindel of the governing christian democrats , was clear about what his party thought of the proposal .
" when someone wants to become a german citizen , " grindel said , " then i have to be able to say , as an incentive , that you must learn german if you have n't learned it well enough already .
that 's a part of the integration process - to finally learn german . "
and there is reason to believe that many retired immigrants in germany would n't apply for a german passport if the rules were loosened .
some come from other european union countries , where moving across borders is n't problematic , though they do not have full voting rights in germany .
but kilic says there are some 2,000-3,000 retirees from other countries who would gladly take advantage of the opportunity .

there 's no need to question a perfectly reasonable on-the-nose prediction - at least not when it comes from afar .
another realm , in this case .
here dw sports forward the spooky ones ' predictions for match day ten . match day nine ’ s predictions saw the dw pundits increase their week-on-week total with six points .
not such a special tally , but one that included a surprising spot-on forecast of werder bremen 's 4-1 victory away to borussia moenchengladbach .
to fight the unsubstantiated and scurrilous accusations of match-fixing that have been swirling , dw 's experts are ready to come clean - the spirits made them do it .
they 're still under their control , in fact : here are their picks for week ten .
friday , oct .
29 bayern - freiburg few would have predicted freiburg being above bayern after nine games but the league table does n't lie .
bayern are suffering a crisis of confidence and fluidity in the bundesliga , while the freiburgers are just enjoying their early season ride .
robin dutt ’ s men have notched points against their mid-table rivals but have come unstuck against the better teams .
ordinarily bayern would be included in that latter category , but right now they 're adrift in mediocrity .
however , at home , with a partisan crowd expecting a return to the status quo , bayern should edge it .
prediction : bayern 2-1 saturday , oct .
30 bremen - nuremberg bremen have managed to steady their ship after a choppy start to the season and are unbeaten in five league games .
they still lie in eighth place but show signs of rediscovering the consistency which could see them climb the table .
but this is werder , remember , and nothing can be taken for granted .
they can win 4-1 one week and get thumped by the same scoreline the next .
nuremberg are experiencing the pendulum of form ; winning one week , losing the next .
if it continues to swing , after beating wolfsburg last week , then bremen should come out on top in this one .
prediction : bremen 3-0 wolfsburg - stuttgart bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : keller has got stuttgart winning again and out of danger jens keller is unbeaten as stuttgart coach after taking over from the sacked christian gross two weeks ago , and the four points his team has eked out in their last two league games have taken them out of the drop zone .
confidence is slowly coming back , boosted by recent europa league and dfb cup wins , and while it is still a nascent recovery , vfb do have some momentum at last .
wolfsburg , on the other hand , have lost theirs .
two defeats and a loss have put the skids under their own revival and coming into this match , stuttgart look to have the edge .
stuttgart : 1-0 cologne - hamburg the enigma that is hamburger sv continues to confound .
after an impressive start followed by a worrying slump , hsv are rebuilding their campaign by going three games unbeaten .
two wins and a goalless draw against bayern could have been seen as a solid base to push on , but their 5-2 cup hammering at the hands of frankfurt in midweek may have released old demons .
cologne , however , appear to have little in their locker which could inflict such a heavy defeat on hamburg - in fact , any kind of defeat looks unlikely .
the bottom club have a solitary win to their name and their second isn ’ t likely to come this weekend , even with the benefit of home advantage .
prediction : hamburg 2-0 kaiserslautern - moenchengladbach kaiserslautern 's last win - the impressive 2-0 defeat of bayern - seems a long time ago .
indeed since those heady days of august , when kaiserslautern notched two wins on the trot , all that has followed is a downward spiral of six reversals and a draw , leaving the red devils hovering perilously over the drop zone .
they got a welcome boost with a midweek cup win - but then again so did gladbach .
however , given that gladbach slipped to second-from-bottom after their sixth defeat of the season last weekend , little should be read into that .
these are two teams in deep , albeit it early , trouble .
their desperation may cancel each other out .
prediction : draw 2-2 st. pauli - frankfurt given they were afforded little chance of staying up this season , st- pauli 's current position in 10th could already be hailed as a triumph .
as long as they do n't start panicking that last week 's defeat to stuttgart and their slight tumble down the league is the start of their predicted demise , st. pauli have the guts to slog it out and remain in the bundesliga .
frankfurt sit a place above them on goal difference with an exact replica of the hamburg club 's record to date .
eintracht come into this game on the back of three wins and a draw so they will be up for it against pauli .
expect a gutsy battle .
prediction : draw 1-1 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : raul did n't expect to swap real madrid for a relegation fight schalke - leverkusen things still look desperate for schalke .
their only victory in the league this season , ground out against freiburg over a month ago , looks increasingly like a false dawn .
a defeat and three draws suggests little has been put right since .
their home form has been pitiful and leverkusen will certainly fancy their chances when they make the journey to gelsenkirchen on saturday .
leverkusen have had plenty of joy on their travels .
unbeaten in four away games with three wins and a draw , it appears to be advantage bayer .
schalke 's revival will have to wait at least another week .
prediction : leverkusen 3-2 sunday , oct .
31 mainz - dortmund halloween came early for dortmund in the dfb cup on wednesday .
instead of the treat they might have expected from a fixture against a third division side , they got tricked in a 4-2 loss on penalties at kickers offenbach .
bvb , who have been on fire in front of goal , will be wondering how they went 120 minutes without scoring and will be hoping they find they find the target ahead of this first-versus-second clash .
mainz , who returned to the summit last weekend , also lost in the cup to alemannia aachen so this game is primed for both teams to put their woes behind them .
dortmund will have the added incentive of going top if they win and could take heart from the fact that mainz 's only league defeat so far has come at home .
prediction : dortmund 3-1 hoffenheim - hanover bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hannover 's players are n't suffering from altitude sickness hanover continues to overachieve this season .
up to third after last week 's victory over cologne , they look to have put the brakes on the minor slide which affected them after losing to st. pauli at the start of october .
hoffenheim , meanwhile , are still challenging at the top end but their own push for the summit has suffered a few hiccups in recent weeks .
after three wins on the bounce at the start of the season , it took hoffenheim until two weeks ago to record their next .
keeping dortmund at bay in last week 's 1-1 draw suggests they 've found their balance again but hanover may edge this to keep their impressive campaign on track .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : focus : midterm elections in the us eu and us ' must work together , ' says diplomat obama seeks to mobilize disappointed voters foreign donations spark row ahead of us midterm elections european companies back climate skeptics in us senate race , report says elections -pipe- 29.10.2010 shift to the right in midterm elections could affect us foreign policy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the foreign policy leanings of many tea party candidates are unclear the issue of us foreign policy has hardly played a role in the congressional midterm elections campaign .
however , the outcome might well have an impact on washington 's relations with the rest of the world . when american voters head to the polls to elect a new house of representatives and 37 new senators , there is perhaps nothing that sums up their sentiment better than the old adage from bill clinton 's 1992 presidential campaign : " it 's the economy , stupid . " and with unemployment hovering at close to 10 percent , a collapsed housing market and a stuttering economy , there certainly is ample reason for voters to worry about their personal well-being . to be sure , there are definitely enough foreign policy issues that would merit the electorate 's attention too : a war in afghanistan , now in its ninth year , which is not going well , a tense situation in the middle east with us-sponsored negotiations between israelis and palestinians always on the verge of collapse , iran 's alleged efforts to acquire nuclear weapons still unresolved and north korea in the middle of a leadership handover .
but all of that does n't really matter , says thomas e. mann , a congressional scholar at the brookings institution in washington : " for the most part the public is so distressed and pessimistic about the economy that that is what 's dominating the campaigns , " he told deutsche welle . international issues on the sidelines the only way foreign policy gets any traction as an election topic is when it relates to a domestic issue , adds mann .
china , for example , plays a role in certain campaigns when trade issues or the currency imbalances are discussed .
and mexico is addressed when illegal immigration and its effect on the economy is debated .
other than that , domestic issues , especially the economy , dominate the midterm elections almost completely .
while foreign policy issues have no impact on the election , the results of the elections could well have an impact on us foreign policy .
if , as most pollsters predict , the republicans win back the house of representatives and stand a small chance of also retaking the senate , this will have implications for the way washington carries out international relations . " there are a lot of republican candidates running for the house who are tea party candidates , who are very hard-right candidates , " douglas foyle , a professor at wesleyan university who has researched about the impact of domestic issues on international relations , told deutsche welle .
" they have n't said too much about foreign policy and so it 's anybody 's guess what they are going to do once they get into office . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president barack obama wo n't be able to get a climate change treaty through the new congress what the tea party candidates have said very clearly however , is that they want to balance the budget .
" if they are going to balance the budget , they will have to cut defense spending because that 's about half of all discretionary federal spending , " notes foyle .
" and pulling back in foreign policy in terms of the military is not something that traditionally the republicans would do . "
future of the republican party his colleague mann also sees a chance of a " significant number of tea party-based republicans coming in to the senate with rather extreme views on the limited role for government and really hostile sentiments toward globalization and international organizations . "
he adds : " if this group were to gain the upper hand in the republican party we would have one center-left party and one extreme-right party in the country .
that 's not reassuring . "
regardless how the soul searching of the republican party ends , the party 's majority in one or both chambers of congress would have an impact on us foreign policy in any case . while the president has considerably more leeway to pursue his own course in international affairs than on the domestic front and also serves as the commander-in-chief of the military , he ca n't disregard congress entirely .
first , congress approves the budget and through that can influence policy as well . " let 's look at afghanistan for example , " juergen chrobog , germany 's former ambassador in washington who now heads the bmw foundation herbert quandt , told deutsche welle : " the troops and the war must be financed .
and here the members of congress have an enormous lever : they can give more or less . "
treaties face tough obstacles what 's more , congress is also needed to ratify international treaties .
even with a sizeable majority in both chambers during the first half of his term , president barack obama could n't get a climate change treaty through congress .
with a republican majority in one or both chambers of congress , predict the experts , a climate change treaty which must be ratified by a two-thirds majority in the senate is all but dead .
the fate of the new start treaty , the follow-up to the original nuclear disarmament pact signed by republican icon ronald reagan and soviet leader mikhail gorbachev , is also uncertain . the lame duck senate will vote on the issue in the middle of november . whether it goes through is still unclear .
if it does n't , it seems rather unlikely that it will have an easier time in the new senate . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us voters worry primarily about the economy and about losing their jobs " i do n't see any major treaties like these being ratified , at least not easily , " says chrobog .
" i hope that president obama and the democrats at least keep their majority in the senate . "
the likely swing to the right in the midterm elections could make us foreign policy less predictable and more complicated , argue the experts .
still , they add , europeans should n't fret too much about the outcome of the polls . " i think the most important thing for those looking from abroad at this election is to realize this is not fundamentally about ideology , " says mann .
" this is about americans being scared and sour and pessimistic about our economic well-being and instinctively voting against the party in power . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de work -pipe- 29.10.2010 berlin : home of the poor , unpaid intern großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's mayor , klaus wowereit , once proudly announced that his city was " poor but sexy , " but with this rather chic poverty comes a cynical exploitation of eager young workers . the uk media was recently full of reports about the national union of journalists ' new campaign , cashback for interns , in which the union encouraged people who had completed internships to sue their former employers for unpaid wages .
while some thought the move was silly and a rather pitiful example of the nanny state , many others supported the campaign , claiming a fair wage was a rather obvious basic reward for a hard day 's work . while the nuj campaign undoubtedly gathers momentum over in england , one can only hope that something similar starts here in berlin ; a movement dedicated to reigning in the blatant exploitation of students and new graduates in the workplace .
poor and sexy berlin may be but it is also rife with stinginess when it comes to doling out the wages . a typical internship - or praktikum as they 're known - in berlin runs for around six months , during which time the " successful " applicant is expected to work from monday to friday , often putting in shifts of over eight hours , for no money whatsoever .
the employer therefore only needs to take on two keen young workers and he or she has extra much-needed manpower for a whole year and it does n't cost a nickel . my former flatmate once got an actual job in a shop and was put on a six-month trial period during which time she received a lower-than-average trainee wage while her employer was not legally obliged to make any health insurance or social security contributions .
lo and behold once the trial was over , the employer decided she was n't right for the job and let her go .
when she returned to pick up some bits and pieces she 'd left behind , there was a new girl doing exactly the same job in her place , presumably on yet another trial run .
little wonder that berlin city magazine , zitty , recently ran with " generation praktikant " -lrb- generation intern -rrb- as their cover story . bildunterschrift : interns need to juggle many tasks at the same time to impress potential employers - but how are they expected to pay the bills ? call me mr jump-to-conclusions but i would imagine as an employer that i could pretty accurately assess a person 's suitability for a job after two or three days ; a trial period of six months does seem rather excessive but it is yet another way to milk a year 's hard graft out of two poor saps without having to cough up for the privilege . a friend of a friend told me a tale of a girl who had re-located to berlin from the states on the promise of a job at a local radio station only to be on the phone to her parents in tears three months later as she 'd still not received any money .
she had , however , very promptly received an eviction notice on her flat , given that she had n't paid any rent .
everyone has some internship-related horror story that either happened to them or a friend . now it is n't , of course , all doom and gloom .
a good number of students and graduates take on internship positions fully aware that they are n't going to receive any money and do so with other funding behind them -lrb- savings or money from their parents , for example -rrb- and use their six months with the company to gain some valuable work experience .
sadly though , internships never seem to be offered on the basis that the employer is scouting for hot new talent to add to his or her company .
interns seem to be cynically picked like cherries just so there is always someone there to answer the phone and take the mail to the post office . this exploitation of workers really does need to be addressed , especially in berlin , a city which exists on the labors of the intern and those who do either one-euro-an-hour job while also receiving welfare money .
it 's all very well gaining industry experience but if no one in the industry is prepared to give you a proper job you might as well sign up for unemployment benefit and spend your day doing crosswords . since i would n't be in the least bit surprised if even the city 's decision-makers were themselves a rotating army of interns , it seems unlikely that the problem will be tackled at an official level anytime soon .
so it 's time for a revolution .
berlin 's interns need to strike , even just for a day , for fair pay , while employers look on in horror as virtually every business in the city grinds to an absolute halt . of course , if revolution is n't your thing , just do the unpaid berlin internship and head off to munich .
after all , that 's where all the money is . neale lytollis has happily never done an unpaid internship , despite working in the media . editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de integration -pipe- 29.10.2010 greens propose simplified citizenship laws for retired immigrants großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the proposal would make becoming a citizen easier for some good german is required to get german citizenship .
one lawmaker says it 's time to do long-term immigrants a favor and loosen up that rule . new legislation introduced in the german parliament could allow certain groups to get a german passport more easily and quickly , as well as granting more people the right to hold dual citizenship .
currently , immigrants who want to get german citizenship must take a naturalization test and show that they have a firm grasp of the language .
in addition , they generally have to renounce their previous citizenship .
pensioners who came to the country as immigrants are one of the groups that would benefit most from a change to the law .
if the bill were passed , a person who is over 53 years old and has been living in germany for at least 15 years could apply for a passport without meeting the language requirements .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kilic wants to see an immigrant 's work rewarded " if a person has made a contribution to this society , i want to make it easier for them to become citizens , " green party parliamentarian memet kilic told deutsche welle .
" especially older immigrants - who gave their youth and health to build up this country - should be able to obtain citizenship without a language requirement .
that way , we can win the hearts of their children and grandchildren for this country . "
integration conversation kilic 's bill comes as the integration of immigrants is under the microscope in germany .
chancellor angela merkel , a christian democrat , said earlier this month that multiculturalism had failed in germany .
there have also been repeated calls for immigrants to integrate better into german society by learning the language and customs .
kilic , who was born in turkey , said the legislation he sponsored would be welcome news to immigrants .
" third-generation immigrant children in germany hear three times a day that they do n't belong to this country , " he said .
" what good is that ?
i want to turn the tables . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : integration is hard to define in germany in support of the bill , kilic cited statistics showing that the number of citizens naturalized in germany each year had fallen by 20 percent since 2004 .
this was an indication that becoming a german citizen was simply too difficult , he said .
without citizenship , many of germany 's 6.7 million immigrants do not have the right to vote in the country .
but citizenship goes beyond the legal realm .
" integration means more than simply structural integration , " said guelistan guerbey , a political scientist at berlin 's free university .
" it has a very strong emotional and psychological dimension . "
this is especially true for dual citizens .
if the bill became law , an immigrant would no longer have to give up their passport to become german .
guerbey said this would have a positive effect .
" a person has emotional ties in both directions , " she said , " and dual citizenship is a legal recognition of this emotional state . "
time to learn german but while legal benefits and emotional satisfaction might encourage a retired immigrant with less-than-perfect german to apply for citizenship under the loosened rules of the proposed law , they may never get the chance .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : learning german is essential for integration , says grindel on thursday in the bundestag , reinhard grindel of the governing christian democrats , was clear about what his party thought of the proposal .
" when someone wants to become a german citizen , " grindel said , " then i have to be able to say , as an incentive , that you must learn german if you have n't learned it well enough already .
that 's a part of the integration process - to finally learn german . "
and there is reason to believe that many retired immigrants in germany would n't apply for a german passport if the rules were loosened .
some come from other european union countries , where moving across borders is n't problematic , though they do not have full voting rights in germany .
but kilic says there are some 2,000-3,000 retirees from other countries who would gladly take advantage of the opportunity .

but now the eu wants to make patent protection easier and less expensive for the bloc 's inventors . the economic crisis has n't put european companies and independent inventors off investing into research and development .
judged by the some 60,000 patents issued so far this year in germany , the country 's is on track to meet 2009 's total . " companies followed experts ' advice and continued investing in new products - even though we were in the middle of a crisis , " bettina berner of the german patent and trade mark office -lrb- dpma -rrb- said on thursday at the opening ceremony of the 62nd edition of the inventors ' trade fair iena in nuremberg . hoping for a break through bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some 800 products , like an unpoppable tire , are on display at the iena trade fair inventors from 37 countries are currently presenting some 800 new products at the fair , which the organizers said is the largest of its kind in the world . rollerblades , the folding bicycle and inflatable water wings are some of products that went on to conquer the world after being presented in nuremberg .
like their successful predecessors , many inventors at this year 's fair are hoping for break-through deals with the industry so their products can be mass-produced . shaky hands ?
no problem ! bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the willomat tray lets the clumsy wait tables - without worrying guests bernhard haehnsen is one such inventor .
the former ship 's captain grew tired moping up after glasses spilled their contents as his ship pitched on the high seas .
his neighbor barbara willomat designed a way to stabilize glasses and cups on trays .
special suction cups which can be fixed on a tray hold retainers in different shapes and sizes . " when you 're carrying beer glasses on a tray across wobbly grass in a beer garden , the glasses break easily if you do n't attach them , " haehnsen said , adding that the willomat tray could also facilitate work in hospitals and help anyone with shaky hands . register first , then show it bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moreau 's idea came when he saw a report about delayed flights other products on display at iena this year include a foldable chair attached to a suitcase , invented by 12-year-old johannes von moreau , and a remote control for model sports cars which can be used with one hand rather than two . the two inventors kevin hummel and nicolas rathauser have registered their product with the munich-based german patent office -lrb- dpma -rrb- already .
that 's a step experts strongly recommend . " many independent inventors do n't have their products registered before they present them at a trade fair , " said dpma spokesperson berner . lengthy , costly patent process but inventors who want to protect their product in more than one european country currently have to undergo a tedious and costly process that begins with registration at the european patent office . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : inventors register their products here : the european patent office in munich " you have to decide in how many countries you want to have your patent validated , " heinrich dornbusch , a consultant with german patent marketing agency provendis , told deutsche welle .
" currently you have to do that separately in every single member state .
this means you have to invest a lot of time and money . " the costs for registering a product in 13 of the eu 's 27 countries , for instance , can easily amount to more than 20,000 euros -lrb- $ 28,000 -rrb- - 10 times the cost of a patent in the united states , according to dornbusch three languages sufficient the laborious validation process needs simplification , said stefaan de rynck from the internal market and services division at the european commission . " we want to get rid of the procedure where you have to translate a patent into all languages in order for it to be valid , " he told deutsche welle .
" patents should be valid across the eu if they are in english , french or german . " this would considerably lower registration costs as the largest part currently goes into translating the relevant documents into the individual countries ' languages . authors : nina haase , brigitta moll -lrb- dpa , ap -rrb- editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

there 's no need to question a perfectly reasonable on-the-nose prediction - at least not when it comes from afar .
another realm , in this case .
here dw sports forward the spooky ones ' predictions for match day ten . match day nine ’ s predictions saw the dw pundits increase their week-on-week total with six points .
not such a special tally , but one that included a surprising spot-on forecast of werder bremen 's 4-1 victory away to borussia moenchengladbach .
to fight the unsubstantiated and scurrilous accusations of match-fixing that have been swirling , dw 's experts are ready to come clean - the spirits made them do it .
they 're still under their control , in fact : here are their picks for week ten .
friday , oct .
29 bayern - freiburg few would have predicted freiburg being above bayern after nine games but the league table does n't lie .
bayern are suffering a crisis of confidence and fluidity in the bundesliga , while the freiburgers are just enjoying their early season ride .
robin dutt ’ s men have notched points against their mid-table rivals but have come unstuck against the better teams .
ordinarily bayern would be included in that latter category , but right now they 're adrift in mediocrity .
however , at home , with a partisan crowd expecting a return to the status quo , bayern should edge it .
prediction : bayern 2-1 saturday , oct .
30 bremen - nuremberg bremen have managed to steady their ship after a choppy start to the season and are unbeaten in five league games .
they still lie in eighth place but show signs of rediscovering the consistency which could see them climb the table .
but this is werder , remember , and nothing can be taken for granted .
they can win 4-1 one week and get thumped by the same scoreline the next .
nuremberg are experiencing the pendulum of form ; winning one week , losing the next .
if it continues to swing , after beating wolfsburg last week , then bremen should come out on top in this one .
prediction : bremen 3-0 wolfsburg - stuttgart bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : keller has got stuttgart winning again and out of danger jens keller is unbeaten as stuttgart coach after taking over from the sacked christian gross two weeks ago , and the four points his team has eked out in their last two league games have taken them out of the drop zone .
confidence is slowly coming back , boosted by recent europa league and dfb cup wins , and while it is still a nascent recovery , vfb do have some momentum at last .
wolfsburg , on the other hand , have lost theirs .
two defeats and a loss have put the skids under their own revival and coming into this match , stuttgart look to have the edge .
stuttgart : 1-0 cologne - hamburg the enigma that is hamburger sv continues to confound .
after an impressive start followed by a worrying slump , hsv are rebuilding their campaign by going three games unbeaten .
two wins and a goalless draw against bayern could have been seen as a solid base to push on , but their 5-2 cup hammering at the hands of frankfurt in midweek may have released old demons .
cologne , however , appear to have little in their locker which could inflict such a heavy defeat on hamburg - in fact , any kind of defeat looks unlikely .
the bottom club have a solitary win to their name and their second isn ’ t likely to come this weekend , even with the benefit of home advantage .
prediction : hamburg 2-0 kaiserslautern - moenchengladbach kaiserslautern 's last win - the impressive 2-0 defeat of bayern - seems a long time ago .
indeed since those heady days of august , when kaiserslautern notched two wins on the trot , all that has followed is a downward spiral of six reversals and a draw , leaving the red devils hovering perilously over the drop zone .
they got a welcome boost with a midweek cup win - but then again so did gladbach .
however , given that gladbach slipped to second-from-bottom after their sixth defeat of the season last weekend , little should be read into that .
these are two teams in deep , albeit it early , trouble .
their desperation may cancel each other out .
prediction : draw 2-2 st. pauli - frankfurt given they were afforded little chance of staying up this season , st- pauli 's current position in 10th could already be hailed as a triumph .
as long as they do n't start panicking that last week 's defeat to stuttgart and their slight tumble down the league is the start of their predicted demise , st. pauli have the guts to slog it out and remain in the bundesliga .
frankfurt sit a place above them on goal difference with an exact replica of the hamburg club 's record to date .
eintracht come into this game on the back of three wins and a draw so they will be up for it against pauli .
expect a gutsy battle .
prediction : draw 1-1 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : raul did n't expect to swap real madrid for a relegation fight schalke - leverkusen things still look desperate for schalke .
their only victory in the league this season , ground out against freiburg over a month ago , looks increasingly like a false dawn .
a defeat and three draws suggests little has been put right since .
their home form has been pitiful and leverkusen will certainly fancy their chances when they make the journey to gelsenkirchen on saturday .
leverkusen have had plenty of joy on their travels .
unbeaten in four away games with three wins and a draw , it appears to be advantage bayer .
schalke 's revival will have to wait at least another week .
prediction : leverkusen 3-2 sunday , oct .
31 mainz - dortmund halloween came early for dortmund in the dfb cup on wednesday .
instead of the treat they might have expected from a fixture against a third division side , they got tricked in a 4-2 loss on penalties at kickers offenbach .
bvb , who have been on fire in front of goal , will be wondering how they went 120 minutes without scoring and will be hoping they find they find the target ahead of this first-versus-second clash .
mainz , who returned to the summit last weekend , also lost in the cup to alemannia aachen so this game is primed for both teams to put their woes behind them .
dortmund will have the added incentive of going top if they win and could take heart from the fact that mainz 's only league defeat so far has come at home .
prediction : dortmund 3-1 hoffenheim - hanover bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hannover 's players are n't suffering from altitude sickness hanover continues to overachieve this season .
up to third after last week 's victory over cologne , they look to have put the brakes on the minor slide which affected them after losing to st. pauli at the start of october .
hoffenheim , meanwhile , are still challenging at the top end but their own push for the summit has suffered a few hiccups in recent weeks .
after three wins on the bounce at the start of the season , it took hoffenheim until two weeks ago to record their next .
keeping dortmund at bay in last week 's 1-1 draw suggests they 've found their balance again but hanover may edge this to keep their impressive campaign on track .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : focus : midterm elections in the us eu and us ' must work together , ' says diplomat obama seeks to mobilize disappointed voters foreign donations spark row ahead of us midterm elections european companies back climate skeptics in us senate race , report says elections -pipe- 29.10.2010 shift to the right in midterm elections could affect us foreign policy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the foreign policy leanings of many tea party candidates are unclear the issue of us foreign policy has hardly played a role in the congressional midterm elections campaign .
however , the outcome might well have an impact on washington 's relations with the rest of the world . when american voters head to the polls to elect a new house of representatives and 37 new senators , there is perhaps nothing that sums up their sentiment better than the old adage from bill clinton 's 1992 presidential campaign : " it 's the economy , stupid . " and with unemployment hovering at close to 10 percent , a collapsed housing market and a stuttering economy , there certainly is ample reason for voters to worry about their personal well-being . to be sure , there are definitely enough foreign policy issues that would merit the electorate 's attention too : a war in afghanistan , now in its ninth year , which is not going well , a tense situation in the middle east with us-sponsored negotiations between israelis and palestinians always on the verge of collapse , iran 's alleged efforts to acquire nuclear weapons still unresolved and north korea in the middle of a leadership handover .
but all of that does n't really matter , says thomas e. mann , a congressional scholar at the brookings institution in washington : " for the most part the public is so distressed and pessimistic about the economy that that is what 's dominating the campaigns , " he told deutsche welle . international issues on the sidelines the only way foreign policy gets any traction as an election topic is when it relates to a domestic issue , adds mann .
china , for example , plays a role in certain campaigns when trade issues or the currency imbalances are discussed .
and mexico is addressed when illegal immigration and its effect on the economy is debated .
other than that , domestic issues , especially the economy , dominate the midterm elections almost completely .
while foreign policy issues have no impact on the election , the results of the elections could well have an impact on us foreign policy .
if , as most pollsters predict , the republicans win back the house of representatives and stand a small chance of also retaking the senate , this will have implications for the way washington carries out international relations . " there are a lot of republican candidates running for the house who are tea party candidates , who are very hard-right candidates , " douglas foyle , a professor at wesleyan university who has researched about the impact of domestic issues on international relations , told deutsche welle .
" they have n't said too much about foreign policy and so it 's anybody 's guess what they are going to do once they get into office . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president barack obama wo n't be able to get a climate change treaty through the new congress what the tea party candidates have said very clearly however , is that they want to balance the budget .
" if they are going to balance the budget , they will have to cut defense spending because that 's about half of all discretionary federal spending , " notes foyle .
" and pulling back in foreign policy in terms of the military is not something that traditionally the republicans would do . "
future of the republican party his colleague mann also sees a chance of a " significant number of tea party-based republicans coming in to the senate with rather extreme views on the limited role for government and really hostile sentiments toward globalization and international organizations . "
he adds : " if this group were to gain the upper hand in the republican party we would have one center-left party and one extreme-right party in the country .
that 's not reassuring . "
regardless how the soul searching of the republican party ends , the party 's majority in one or both chambers of congress would have an impact on us foreign policy in any case . while the president has considerably more leeway to pursue his own course in international affairs than on the domestic front and also serves as the commander-in-chief of the military , he ca n't disregard congress entirely .
first , congress approves the budget and through that can influence policy as well . " let 's look at afghanistan for example , " juergen chrobog , germany 's former ambassador in washington who now heads the bmw foundation herbert quandt , told deutsche welle : " the troops and the war must be financed .
and here the members of congress have an enormous lever : they can give more or less . "
treaties face tough obstacles what 's more , congress is also needed to ratify international treaties .
even with a sizeable majority in both chambers during the first half of his term , president barack obama could n't get a climate change treaty through congress .

the likely swing to the right in the midterm elections could make us foreign policy less predictable and more complicated , argue the experts .
still , they add , europeans should n't fret too much about the outcome of the polls . " i think the most important thing for those looking from abroad at this election is to realize this is not fundamentally about ideology , " says mann .
" this is about americans being scared and sour and pessimistic about our economic well-being and instinctively voting against the party in power . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de health -pipe- 29.10.2010 new study finds german men much less healthy than women großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the study found that men are more wary of doctors than women a new study has found that german men are more prone to stress , depression , heart attacks and suicide - and have a life-expectancy over five years shorter than women .
traditional gender attitudes could be to blame . a new government-commissioned study conducted by the german society for man and health -lrb- dgmg -rrb- and the men 's health foundation , was released on thursday , nearly a decade after a ground-breaking report on women 's health was conducted in 2001 .
speaking at its launch , family affairs minister kristina schroeder said it was high time : " a men 's health report is vitally necessary , because we still have a difference in life expectancy between men and women of 5.5 years . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kristina schroeder said the study was urgently needed one of the main causes for concern is the heart .
men suffer heart-related problems much earlier and more frequently and more seriously than women .
dr. ursula mueller-werdan , a cardiologist at the halle university heart clinic , spoke of the significant differences .
" heart attacks manifest themselves about 15 years earlier in men than in women , " she said .
" men often have unhealthy cardiovascular risk profiles in younger years .
that means , for example , high blood pressure well before the age of 55 . "
doctor-shy men the causes are manifold , but the study identified one particular social difference that can cause problems .
men are much less likely to take their ailments to the doctor , and so serious problems often go unnoticed for too long .
on top of this , only two out of 10 german men go to the doctor for precautionary check-ups .
elmar braehler , professor of medicinal psychology at the university of leipzig says men simply need to get over their fears .
" women are used to going to the gynecologist , they go for contraception , for pregnancies , " he said .
" men are scared of what the doctor will find , and tend to avoid doctors .
they see it as part of their social role that they have to show they are healthy . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : men are more likely to keep depression to themselves the study also concluded that men are more likely to let psychological problems go untreated .
three times as many men commit suicide than women , even though only half as many men are diagnosed with depression than women .
male menopause but this finding simply confirmed a relatively commonly held theory .
the study also highlighted a less well-known problem - that of male menopause .
dr. stefan kowalik believes that while hormone problems are routinely treated in women , they are too often ignored in men .
" hormone disorders are not just important for sexuality , " he said .
" the male hormone , testosterone , is also important for blood production , bone production , muscle production .
a lot of people do n't even know that . "
german state health insurance only pays for male check-ups over the age of 55 , and one of the study 's recommendations is the introduction of check-up programs for young men , but old-fashioned attitudes need to be changed first .

there 's no need to question a perfectly reasonable on-the-nose prediction - at least not when it comes from afar .
another realm , in this case .
here dw sports forward the spooky ones ' predictions for match day ten . match day nine ’ s predictions saw the dw pundits increase their week-on-week total with six points .
not such a special tally , but one that included a surprising spot-on forecast of werder bremen 's 4-1 victory away to borussia moenchengladbach .
to fight the unsubstantiated and scurrilous accusations of match-fixing that have been swirling , dw 's experts are ready to come clean - the spirits made them do it .
they 're still under their control , in fact : here are their picks for week ten .
friday , oct .
29 bayern - freiburg few would have predicted freiburg being above bayern after nine games but the league table does n't lie .
bayern are suffering a crisis of confidence and fluidity in the bundesliga , while the freiburgers are just enjoying their early season ride .
robin dutt ’ s men have notched points against their mid-table rivals but have come unstuck against the better teams .
ordinarily bayern would be included in that latter category , but right now they 're adrift in mediocrity .
however , at home , with a partisan crowd expecting a return to the status quo , bayern should edge it .
prediction : bayern 2-1 saturday , oct .
30 bremen - nuremberg bremen have managed to steady their ship after a choppy start to the season and are unbeaten in five league games .
they still lie in eighth place but show signs of rediscovering the consistency which could see them climb the table .
but this is werder , remember , and nothing can be taken for granted .
they can win 4-1 one week and get thumped by the same scoreline the next .
nuremberg are experiencing the pendulum of form ; winning one week , losing the next .
if it continues to swing , after beating wolfsburg last week , then bremen should come out on top in this one .
prediction : bremen 3-0 wolfsburg - stuttgart bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : keller has got stuttgart winning again and out of danger jens keller is unbeaten as stuttgart coach after taking over from the sacked christian gross two weeks ago , and the four points his team has eked out in their last two league games have taken them out of the drop zone .
confidence is slowly coming back , boosted by recent europa league and dfb cup wins , and while it is still a nascent recovery , vfb do have some momentum at last .
wolfsburg , on the other hand , have lost theirs .
two defeats and a loss have put the skids under their own revival and coming into this match , stuttgart look to have the edge .
stuttgart : 1-0 cologne - hamburg the enigma that is hamburger sv continues to confound .
after an impressive start followed by a worrying slump , hsv are rebuilding their campaign by going three games unbeaten .
two wins and a goalless draw against bayern could have been seen as a solid base to push on , but their 5-2 cup hammering at the hands of frankfurt in midweek may have released old demons .
cologne , however , appear to have little in their locker which could inflict such a heavy defeat on hamburg - in fact , any kind of defeat looks unlikely .
the bottom club have a solitary win to their name and their second isn ’ t likely to come this weekend , even with the benefit of home advantage .
prediction : hamburg 2-0 kaiserslautern - moenchengladbach kaiserslautern 's last win - the impressive 2-0 defeat of bayern - seems a long time ago .
indeed since those heady days of august , when kaiserslautern notched two wins on the trot , all that has followed is a downward spiral of six reversals and a draw , leaving the red devils hovering perilously over the drop zone .
they got a welcome boost with a midweek cup win - but then again so did gladbach .
however , given that gladbach slipped to second-from-bottom after their sixth defeat of the season last weekend , little should be read into that .
these are two teams in deep , albeit it early , trouble .
their desperation may cancel each other out .
prediction : draw 2-2 st. pauli - frankfurt given they were afforded little chance of staying up this season , st- pauli 's current position in 10th could already be hailed as a triumph .
as long as they do n't start panicking that last week 's defeat to stuttgart and their slight tumble down the league is the start of their predicted demise , st. pauli have the guts to slog it out and remain in the bundesliga .
frankfurt sit a place above them on goal difference with an exact replica of the hamburg club 's record to date .
eintracht come into this game on the back of three wins and a draw so they will be up for it against pauli .
expect a gutsy battle .
prediction : draw 1-1 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : raul did n't expect to swap real madrid for a relegation fight schalke - leverkusen things still look desperate for schalke .
their only victory in the league this season , ground out against freiburg over a month ago , looks increasingly like a false dawn .
a defeat and three draws suggests little has been put right since .
their home form has been pitiful and leverkusen will certainly fancy their chances when they make the journey to gelsenkirchen on saturday .
leverkusen have had plenty of joy on their travels .
unbeaten in four away games with three wins and a draw , it appears to be advantage bayer .
schalke 's revival will have to wait at least another week .
prediction : leverkusen 3-2 sunday , oct .
31 mainz - dortmund halloween came early for dortmund in the dfb cup on wednesday .
instead of the treat they might have expected from a fixture against a third division side , they got tricked in a 4-2 loss on penalties at kickers offenbach .
bvb , who have been on fire in front of goal , will be wondering how they went 120 minutes without scoring and will be hoping they find they find the target ahead of this first-versus-second clash .
mainz , who returned to the summit last weekend , also lost in the cup to alemannia aachen so this game is primed for both teams to put their woes behind them .
dortmund will have the added incentive of going top if they win and could take heart from the fact that mainz 's only league defeat so far has come at home .
prediction : dortmund 3-1 hoffenheim - hanover bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hannover 's players are n't suffering from altitude sickness hanover continues to overachieve this season .
up to third after last week 's victory over cologne , they look to have put the brakes on the minor slide which affected them after losing to st. pauli at the start of october .
hoffenheim , meanwhile , are still challenging at the top end but their own push for the summit has suffered a few hiccups in recent weeks .
after three wins on the bounce at the start of the season , it took hoffenheim until two weeks ago to record their next .
keeping dortmund at bay in last week 's 1-1 draw suggests they 've found their balance again but hanover may edge this to keep their impressive campaign on track .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : focus : midterm elections in the us eu and us ' must work together , ' says diplomat obama seeks to mobilize disappointed voters foreign donations spark row ahead of us midterm elections european companies back climate skeptics in us senate race , report says elections -pipe- 29.10.2010 shift to the right in midterm elections could affect us foreign policy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the foreign policy leanings of many tea party candidates are unclear the issue of us foreign policy has hardly played a role in the congressional midterm elections campaign .
however , the outcome might well have an impact on washington 's relations with the rest of the world . when american voters head to the polls to elect a new house of representatives and 37 new senators , there is perhaps nothing that sums up their sentiment better than the old adage from bill clinton 's 1992 presidential campaign : " it 's the economy , stupid . " and with unemployment hovering at close to 10 percent , a collapsed housing market and a stuttering economy , there certainly is ample reason for voters to worry about their personal well-being . to be sure , there are definitely enough foreign policy issues that would merit the electorate 's attention too : a war in afghanistan , now in its ninth year , which is not going well , a tense situation in the middle east with us-sponsored negotiations between israelis and palestinians always on the verge of collapse , iran 's alleged efforts to acquire nuclear weapons still unresolved and north korea in the middle of a leadership handover .
but all of that does n't really matter , says thomas e. mann , a congressional scholar at the brookings institution in washington : " for the most part the public is so distressed and pessimistic about the economy that that is what 's dominating the campaigns , " he told deutsche welle . international issues on the sidelines the only way foreign policy gets any traction as an election topic is when it relates to a domestic issue , adds mann .
china , for example , plays a role in certain campaigns when trade issues or the currency imbalances are discussed .
and mexico is addressed when illegal immigration and its effect on the economy is debated .
other than that , domestic issues , especially the economy , dominate the midterm elections almost completely .
while foreign policy issues have no impact on the election , the results of the elections could well have an impact on us foreign policy .
if , as most pollsters predict , the republicans win back the house of representatives and stand a small chance of also retaking the senate , this will have implications for the way washington carries out international relations . " there are a lot of republican candidates running for the house who are tea party candidates , who are very hard-right candidates , " douglas foyle , a professor at wesleyan university who has researched about the impact of domestic issues on international relations , told deutsche welle .
" they have n't said too much about foreign policy and so it 's anybody 's guess what they are going to do once they get into office . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president barack obama wo n't be able to get a climate change treaty through the new congress what the tea party candidates have said very clearly however , is that they want to balance the budget .
" if they are going to balance the budget , they will have to cut defense spending because that 's about half of all discretionary federal spending , " notes foyle .
" and pulling back in foreign policy in terms of the military is not something that traditionally the republicans would do . "
future of the republican party his colleague mann also sees a chance of a " significant number of tea party-based republicans coming in to the senate with rather extreme views on the limited role for government and really hostile sentiments toward globalization and international organizations . "
he adds : " if this group were to gain the upper hand in the republican party we would have one center-left party and one extreme-right party in the country .
that 's not reassuring . "
regardless how the soul searching of the republican party ends , the party 's majority in one or both chambers of congress would have an impact on us foreign policy in any case . while the president has considerably more leeway to pursue his own course in international affairs than on the domestic front and also serves as the commander-in-chief of the military , he ca n't disregard congress entirely .
first , congress approves the budget and through that can influence policy as well . " let 's look at afghanistan for example , " juergen chrobog , germany 's former ambassador in washington who now heads the bmw foundation herbert quandt , told deutsche welle : " the troops and the war must be financed .
and here the members of congress have an enormous lever : they can give more or less . "
treaties face tough obstacles what 's more , congress is also needed to ratify international treaties .
even with a sizeable majority in both chambers during the first half of his term , president barack obama could n't get a climate change treaty through congress .

the fate of the new start treaty , the follow-up to the original nuclear disarmament pact signed by republican icon ronald reagan and soviet leader mikhail gorbachev , is also uncertain . the lame duck senate will vote on the issue in the middle of november . whether it goes through is still unclear .
if it does n't , it seems rather unlikely that it will have an easier time in the new senate . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us voters worry primarily about the economy and about losing their jobs " i do n't see any major treaties like these being ratified , at least not easily , " says chrobog .
" i hope that president obama and the democrats at least keep their majority in the senate . "
the likely swing to the right in the midterm elections could make us foreign policy less predictable and more complicated , argue the experts .
still , they add , europeans should n't fret too much about the outcome of the polls . " i think the most important thing for those looking from abroad at this election is to realize this is not fundamentally about ideology , " says mann .
" this is about americans being scared and sour and pessimistic about our economic well-being and instinctively voting against the party in power . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de health -pipe- 29.10.2010 new study finds german men much less healthy than women großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the study found that men are more wary of doctors than women a new study has found that german men are more prone to stress , depression , heart attacks and suicide - and have a life-expectancy over five years shorter than women .
traditional gender attitudes could be to blame . a new government-commissioned study conducted by the german society for man and health -lrb- dgmg -rrb- and the men 's health foundation , was released on thursday , nearly a decade after a ground-breaking report on women 's health was conducted in 2001 .
speaking at its launch , family affairs minister kristina schroeder said it was high time : " a men 's health report is vitally necessary , because we still have a difference in life expectancy between men and women of 5.5 years . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kristina schroeder said the study was urgently needed one of the main causes for concern is the heart .
men suffer heart-related problems much earlier and more frequently and more seriously than women .
dr. ursula mueller-werdan , a cardiologist at the halle university heart clinic , spoke of the significant differences .
" heart attacks manifest themselves about 15 years earlier in men than in women , " she said .
" men often have unhealthy cardiovascular risk profiles in younger years .
that means , for example , high blood pressure well before the age of 55 . "
doctor-shy men the causes are manifold , but the study identified one particular social difference that can cause problems .
men are much less likely to take their ailments to the doctor , and so serious problems often go unnoticed for too long .
on top of this , only two out of 10 german men go to the doctor for precautionary check-ups .
elmar braehler , professor of medicinal psychology at the university of leipzig says men simply need to get over their fears .
" women are used to going to the gynecologist , they go for contraception , for pregnancies , " he said .
" men are scared of what the doctor will find , and tend to avoid doctors .
they see it as part of their social role that they have to show they are healthy . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : men are more likely to keep depression to themselves the study also concluded that men are more likely to let psychological problems go untreated .
three times as many men commit suicide than women , even though only half as many men are diagnosed with depression than women .
male menopause but this finding simply confirmed a relatively commonly held theory .
the study also highlighted a less well-known problem - that of male menopause .
dr. stefan kowalik believes that while hormone problems are routinely treated in women , they are too often ignored in men .
" hormone disorders are not just important for sexuality , " he said .
" the male hormone , testosterone , is also important for blood production , bone production , muscle production .
a lot of people do n't even know that . "
german state health insurance only pays for male check-ups over the age of 55 , and one of the study 's recommendations is the introduction of check-up programs for young men , but old-fashioned attitudes need to be changed first .

one british mp said london needs to do more to protect people 's privacy . it 's been a busy week for google lawyers in europe , as the california tech giant became the target of the legal wrath of italy and the united kingdom . prosecutors in rome on wednesday began an investigation against google for potential invasions of privacy in its street view online mapping service . italian authorities , like their counterparts in germany , spain , canada and elsewhere , are concerned that google acquired personal data including e-mails and passwords while " packet sniffing " on open wifi networks while photographing for the street view service . google has previously said that the data acquisition was accidental , and that it has taken measures to ensure that this kind of breach does not happen again . this legal move came as the italian data protection authority also announced more restrictions this week against google . " italian citizens will be informed of the presence of google cars taking pictures of places and individuals to be posted online via the street view service , " the italian privacy authority said in a statement on its website on monday . the authority added that google street view vehicles will have to be obvious to passers-by . " google cars will have to be clearly marked by means of visible stickers or signs to unambiguously signify that pictures are being taken for the purposes of street view , " it said in the statement . other conditions set by the italian authorities included requiring google list what neighborhoods its cars would photograph in local media ahead of time .
the italian dpa added that failure to comply with the new rules would carry a fine of up to 1,800 euros -lrb- $ 2,500 -rrb- . uk privacy investigation has been ' lily-livered ' bildunterschrift : states around the world are investigating google 's privacy policies thursday , in london , a parliamentary committee met to find out why the british government has not done more to investigate privacy concerns over the leaked wifi data situation . earlier this year , the british data protection authority , the information commissioner 's office , had said it had found no wrongdoing on google 's part , but on monday the office re-opened the case after google 's admitted acquiring more data than had been previously disclosed . " the uk information commissioner has been lily-livered , " robert halfon , a conservative parliamentarian , said during the committee hearing . " these corporations need to be taught that advancing the technological wonder that is the internet is one thing , " he added .
" trampling over the individual 's right to privacy is quite another .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de integration -pipe- 29.10.2010 greens propose simplified citizenship laws for retired immigrants großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the proposal would make becoming a citizen easier for some good german is required to get german citizenship .
one lawmaker says it 's time to do long-term immigrants a favor and loosen up that rule . new legislation introduced in the german parliament could allow certain groups to get a german passport more easily and quickly , as well as granting more people the right to hold dual citizenship .
currently , immigrants who want to get german citizenship must take a naturalization test and show that they have a firm grasp of the language .
in addition , they generally have to renounce their previous citizenship .
pensioners who came to the country as immigrants are one of the groups that would benefit most from a change to the law .
if the bill were passed , a person who is over 53 years old and has been living in germany for at least 15 years could apply for a passport without meeting the language requirements .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kilic wants to see an immigrant 's work rewarded " if a person has made a contribution to this society , i want to make it easier for them to become citizens , " green party parliamentarian memet kilic told deutsche welle .
" especially older immigrants - who gave their youth and health to build up this country - should be able to obtain citizenship without a language requirement .
that way , we can win the hearts of their children and grandchildren for this country . "
integration conversation kilic 's bill comes as the integration of immigrants is under the microscope in germany .
chancellor angela merkel , a christian democrat , said earlier this month that multiculturalism had failed in germany .
there have also been repeated calls for immigrants to integrate better into german society by learning the language and customs .
kilic , who was born in turkey , said the legislation he sponsored would be welcome news to immigrants .
" third-generation immigrant children in germany hear three times a day that they do n't belong to this country , " he said .
" what good is that ?
i want to turn the tables . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : integration is hard to define in germany in support of the bill , kilic cited statistics showing that the number of citizens naturalized in germany each year had fallen by 20 percent since 2004 .
this was an indication that becoming a german citizen was simply too difficult , he said .
without citizenship , many of germany 's 6.7 million immigrants do not have the right to vote in the country .
but citizenship goes beyond the legal realm .
" integration means more than simply structural integration , " said guelistan guerbey , a political scientist at berlin 's free university .
" it has a very strong emotional and psychological dimension . "
this is especially true for dual citizens .
if the bill became law , an immigrant would no longer have to give up their passport to become german .
guerbey said this would have a positive effect .
" a person has emotional ties in both directions , " she said , " and dual citizenship is a legal recognition of this emotional state . "
time to learn german but while legal benefits and emotional satisfaction might encourage a retired immigrant with less-than-perfect german to apply for citizenship under the loosened rules of the proposed law , they may never get the chance .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : learning german is essential for integration , says grindel on thursday in the bundestag , reinhard grindel of the governing christian democrats , was clear about what his party thought of the proposal .
" when someone wants to become a german citizen , " grindel said , " then i have to be able to say , as an incentive , that you must learn german if you have n't learned it well enough already .
that 's a part of the integration process - to finally learn german . "
and there is reason to believe that many retired immigrants in germany would n't apply for a german passport if the rules were loosened .
some come from other european union countries , where moving across borders is n't problematic , though they do not have full voting rights in germany .
but kilic says there are some 2,000-3,000 retirees from other countries who would gladly take advantage of the opportunity .

the secret ballot will take place on december 2 .
two members remain provisionally suspended . the election of the 2018 and 2022 world cup hosts will go ahead as planned despite an ongoing corruption probe , fifa president joseph blatter said on friday .
blatter made the announcement after a two-day meeting of the fifa executive committee .
the secret ballot will take place on december 2 at fifa 's headquarters in zurich .
" we are five weeks from the final decision so there was never a question of changing anything in the procedure , " blatter said .
" changing the date would have caused problems for fifa and bidders as well since they plan to bring in high-ranked politicians like bill clinton and vladimir putin . "
executive committee members suspended bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : adamu , left , and temarii are accussed of selling their votes last week , fifa provisionally suspended two of the 24 members of the executive committee , amos adamu of nigeria and reynald temarii of tahiti .
there have been allegations that they offered to sell their votes to undercover reporters from the british sunday times newspaper .
blatter said that the fifa ethics committee will deal with their cases before the election of the host countries takes place . " if and when people are suspended for the vote on december 2 , they will not be replaced , " he said .
alleged deal between spain , portugal and qatar the joint 2018 bidders , spain and portugal , are said to have struck a deal with qatar , a 2022 candidate , for the interchange of votes . the chief of the joint spanish-portugal bid , miguel angel lopez , denied the allegations of collusion with qatar .
blatter said fifa was investigating those allegations as well and said this issue would also be dealt with by the ethics committee .
" let us do our job .
and let us clarify the situation .
and let us do what the people and the fans , the millions , hundred of millions , thousands of millions of fans are expecting : bring back credibility in fifa , " he said .
aside from spain and portugal , the other countries in the running to host the 2018 world cup are england , russia and the netherlands with belgium .
for the 2022 tournament australia , the united states , qatar , japan and south korea are competing .
blatter acknowledged that the recent incidents showed that it was wrong to elect two world cup hosts on one day .
this is the first time such a vote will take place after a decision made by fifa in 2008 .
the scandal is no surprise , experts say jean-paul mean , president of transparency international switzerland , said the fifa scandal should not come as a surprise .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blatter called on fifa to ' bring back credibility ' " we have seen it with the international olympic committee 10 years ago that there were some strange practices , " he said .
" there is just a flair around sport associations that their governance is not the best yet . "
if there is money around , " corruption shows its ugly head , " he added .
according to mean , there is not enough control of international sports organizations since they are not subject to swiss anti-corruption law .
however , according to blatter , fifa will resolve its problems through its ethics committee .
" it 's an uncomfortable situation for fifa , but we have the necessary instruments to react the proper way , " he said .

there 's no need to question a perfectly reasonable on-the-nose prediction - at least not when it comes from afar .
another realm , in this case .
here dw sports forward the spooky ones ' predictions for match day ten . match day nine ’ s predictions saw the dw pundits increase their week-on-week total with six points .
not such a special tally , but one that included a surprising spot-on forecast of werder bremen 's 4-1 victory away to borussia moenchengladbach .
to fight the unsubstantiated and scurrilous accusations of match-fixing that have been swirling , dw 's experts are ready to come clean - the spirits made them do it .
they 're still under their control , in fact : here are their picks for week ten .
friday , oct .
29 bayern - freiburg few would have predicted freiburg being above bayern after nine games but the league table does n't lie .
bayern are suffering a crisis of confidence and fluidity in the bundesliga , while the freiburgers are just enjoying their early season ride .
robin dutt ’ s men have notched points against their mid-table rivals but have come unstuck against the better teams .
ordinarily bayern would be included in that latter category , but right now they 're adrift in mediocrity .
however , at home , with a partisan crowd expecting a return to the status quo , bayern should edge it .
prediction : bayern 2-1 saturday , oct .
30 bremen - nuremberg bremen have managed to steady their ship after a choppy start to the season and are unbeaten in five league games .
they still lie in eighth place but show signs of rediscovering the consistency which could see them climb the table .
but this is werder , remember , and nothing can be taken for granted .
they can win 4-1 one week and get thumped by the same scoreline the next .
nuremberg are experiencing the pendulum of form ; winning one week , losing the next .
if it continues to swing , after beating wolfsburg last week , then bremen should come out on top in this one .
prediction : bremen 3-0 wolfsburg - stuttgart bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : keller has got stuttgart winning again and out of danger jens keller is unbeaten as stuttgart coach after taking over from the sacked christian gross two weeks ago , and the four points his team has eked out in their last two league games have taken them out of the drop zone .
confidence is slowly coming back , boosted by recent europa league and dfb cup wins , and while it is still a nascent recovery , vfb do have some momentum at last .
wolfsburg , on the other hand , have lost theirs .
two defeats and a loss have put the skids under their own revival and coming into this match , stuttgart look to have the edge .
stuttgart : 1-0 cologne - hamburg the enigma that is hamburger sv continues to confound .
after an impressive start followed by a worrying slump , hsv are rebuilding their campaign by going three games unbeaten .
two wins and a goalless draw against bayern could have been seen as a solid base to push on , but their 5-2 cup hammering at the hands of frankfurt in midweek may have released old demons .
cologne , however , appear to have little in their locker which could inflict such a heavy defeat on hamburg - in fact , any kind of defeat looks unlikely .
the bottom club have a solitary win to their name and their second isn ’ t likely to come this weekend , even with the benefit of home advantage .
prediction : hamburg 2-0 kaiserslautern - moenchengladbach kaiserslautern 's last win - the impressive 2-0 defeat of bayern - seems a long time ago .
indeed since those heady days of august , when kaiserslautern notched two wins on the trot , all that has followed is a downward spiral of six reversals and a draw , leaving the red devils hovering perilously over the drop zone .
they got a welcome boost with a midweek cup win - but then again so did gladbach .
however , given that gladbach slipped to second-from-bottom after their sixth defeat of the season last weekend , little should be read into that .
these are two teams in deep , albeit it early , trouble .
their desperation may cancel each other out .
prediction : draw 2-2 st. pauli - frankfurt given they were afforded little chance of staying up this season , st- pauli 's current position in 10th could already be hailed as a triumph .
as long as they do n't start panicking that last week 's defeat to stuttgart and their slight tumble down the league is the start of their predicted demise , st. pauli have the guts to slog it out and remain in the bundesliga .
frankfurt sit a place above them on goal difference with an exact replica of the hamburg club 's record to date .
eintracht come into this game on the back of three wins and a draw so they will be up for it against pauli .
expect a gutsy battle .
prediction : draw 1-1 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : raul did n't expect to swap real madrid for a relegation fight schalke - leverkusen things still look desperate for schalke .
their only victory in the league this season , ground out against freiburg over a month ago , looks increasingly like a false dawn .
a defeat and three draws suggests little has been put right since .
their home form has been pitiful and leverkusen will certainly fancy their chances when they make the journey to gelsenkirchen on saturday .
leverkusen have had plenty of joy on their travels .
unbeaten in four away games with three wins and a draw , it appears to be advantage bayer .
schalke 's revival will have to wait at least another week .
prediction : leverkusen 3-2 sunday , oct .
31 mainz - dortmund halloween came early for dortmund in the dfb cup on wednesday .
instead of the treat they might have expected from a fixture against a third division side , they got tricked in a 4-2 loss on penalties at kickers offenbach .
bvb , who have been on fire in front of goal , will be wondering how they went 120 minutes without scoring and will be hoping they find they find the target ahead of this first-versus-second clash .
mainz , who returned to the summit last weekend , also lost in the cup to alemannia aachen so this game is primed for both teams to put their woes behind them .
dortmund will have the added incentive of going top if they win and could take heart from the fact that mainz 's only league defeat so far has come at home .
prediction : dortmund 3-1 hoffenheim - hanover bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hannover 's players are n't suffering from altitude sickness hanover continues to overachieve this season .
up to third after last week 's victory over cologne , they look to have put the brakes on the minor slide which affected them after losing to st. pauli at the start of october .
hoffenheim , meanwhile , are still challenging at the top end but their own push for the summit has suffered a few hiccups in recent weeks .
after three wins on the bounce at the start of the season , it took hoffenheim until two weeks ago to record their next .
keeping dortmund at bay in last week 's 1-1 draw suggests they 've found their balance again but hanover may edge this to keep their impressive campaign on track .
prediction : hannover 1-0 last week 's results : 6 points hamburg - bayern 0-0 -lrb- dw prediction : 1-2 -rrb- frankfurt - schalke 0-0 -lrb- dw prediction : 2-2 -rrb- moenchengladbach - werder bremen 1-4 -lrb- dw prediction : 1-4 -rrb- freiburg - kaiserslautern 2-1 -lrb- dw prediction : 1-1 -rrb- hanover - cologne 2-1 -lrb- dw prediction : 1-0 -rrb- nuremberg - wolfsburg 2-1 -lrb- dw prediction : 1-2 -rrb- dortmund - hoffenheim 1-1 -lrb- dw prediction : 2-0 -rrb- leverkusen - mainz 0-1 -lrb- dw prediction : 2-1 -rrb- stuttgart - st.pauli 2-0 -lrb- dw prediction : 1-2 -rrb- total for the season : 43 three points for a correct score prediction two points for a correct margin prediction one point for a correct winner prediction author : nick amies editor : matt hermann send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

one british mp said london needs to do more to protect people 's privacy . it 's been a busy week for google lawyers in europe , as the california tech giant became the target of the legal wrath of italy and the united kingdom . prosecutors in rome on wednesday began an investigation against google for potential invasions of privacy in its street view online mapping service . italian authorities , like their counterparts in germany , spain , canada and elsewhere , are concerned that google acquired personal data including e-mails and passwords while " packet sniffing " on open wifi networks while photographing for the street view service . google has previously said that the data acquisition was accidental , and that it has taken measures to ensure that this kind of breach does not happen again . this legal move came as the italian data protection authority also announced more restrictions this week against google . " italian citizens will be informed of the presence of google cars taking pictures of places and individuals to be posted online via the street view service , " the italian privacy authority said in a statement on its website on monday . the authority added that google street view vehicles will have to be obvious to passers-by . " google cars will have to be clearly marked by means of visible stickers or signs to unambiguously signify that pictures are being taken for the purposes of street view , " it said in the statement . other conditions set by the italian authorities included requiring google list what neighborhoods its cars would photograph in local media ahead of time .
the italian dpa added that failure to comply with the new rules would carry a fine of up to 1,800 euros -lrb- $ 2,500 -rrb- . uk privacy investigation has been ' lily-livered ' bildunterschrift : states around the world are investigating google 's privacy policies thursday , in london , a parliamentary committee met to find out why the british government has not done more to investigate privacy concerns over the leaked wifi data situation . earlier this year , the british data protection authority , the information commissioner 's office , had said it had found no wrongdoing on google 's part , but on monday the office re-opened the case after google 's admitted acquiring more data than had been previously disclosed . " the uk information commissioner has been lily-livered , " robert halfon , a conservative parliamentarian , said during the committee hearing . " these corporations need to be taught that advancing the technological wonder that is the internet is one thing , " he added .

dw 's ramon garcia-ziemsen writes about how germany 's history was deliberately repressed . yes , it is shocking how german diplomats were complicit in the holocaust in the second world war , and how they were involved in its implementation .
it 's unbelievable how much continuity there was in the diplomatic personnel after 1945 in germany : men who had participated in the nazi extermination policies later made careers and protected each other , even before their involvement was made public .
but it 's just as incredible how long it has taken : that only now , 65 years on , this has come to the attention of the wider german public .
in 1979 , a book was published by a british historian about the participation of the foreign office in the so called " final solution , " the nazi description for the murder of european jews .
the book describes what the nature of the foreign office 's participation in the holocaust was , how deportation orders were signed there , how the office was a systematic element of the nazi killing machine .
and even back in the 1950s , there was clear evidence showing that the foreign office was certainly not a " school of passive resistance " against hitler , as it liked to present itself in the post-war period .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ramon garcia-ziemsen head of dw 's german culture department a lot was known , a lot was forgotten in short : much was known .
and almost everything was forgotten .
how the germans dealt with the third reich is not as exemplary as it has often been perceived around the world , it is also a history of forgetting and repressing .
the elites have often knowingly prevented a discussion about their past .
and the public allowed this discourse to be prevented .
how could this happen ? after 1945 , german society was always looking for the " good , " for the " other germany " - the " other germany " that had remained innocent , that had perhaps not been openly resistant , but did not allow itself to be sucked into nazi ideology ; which had remained resistant , which had rejected the nazi madness , and of which one might even be proud .
because it wanted a fresh start , the young germany did not think it could live with the weight of such a large feeling of guilt .
myths and collective guilt and in this way the yarn was spun : first came the myth that many germans had only found out about the holocaust in 1945 from the allies .
the myth was born that only a small group around hitler had known what had happened in concentration camps like auschwitz and dachau .
the germans were a nation led astray .
this position was also of course a reaction to the similarly blanket collective guilt theory purported by the allies after the war . then came the myth of the armed forces : that the soldiers had played almost no part in hitler 's atrocities - and besides that everything had been carried out under orders .
both theories were exposed by historians as false only decades later , from the 1970s , through studies , books and exhibitions .
large parts of the population knew not only why jewish friends and neighbors had suddenly disappeared , but they had also assisted with this disappearance .
soldiers took part in shooting jews - voluntarily and not under orders .
but again it took years and decades , well into the 1990s , until this knowledge resulted in a public debate and led to a real demystification . where the myth certainly still existed was in the foreign office , one of the last places where the fairy tale of the " other germany " could live on .
the solidarity of the diplomats worked so well and perhaps the respect for the future german president richard von weizsaecker was too great .
weizsaecker 's father ernst was a top diplomat , who supported the nazi ideology in the foreign office .
but germany 's longing for this " other germany " , which existed much less than most germans had thought , was also too great .

but as andy valvur points out in this postcard , the conspiracy theorists have gone into overdrive . he was just a small town cephalopod , living quietly in an aquarium in oberhausen germany , entertaining children , moving languidly around his tank and generally being ignored .
but , this summer , it all changed and paul , as the octopus was called , became an international superstar by accurately picking the winners of all the games that the german world cup soccer team faced .
and , to finish it off , he accurately picked the winner of the entire world cup .
it all started innocently enough , when he correctly picked the winner of the first game .
people smiled , a lucky guess , said most .
then he picked the winner in the next game .
ah , another lucky guess .
but people took notice .
even better , the media took notice .
by the time he correctly picked the third game result , the media were in full frenzy , as only the media can .
suddenly , the sleepy little german town of oberhausen became media central .
satellite trucks sprouted like mushrooms around the aquarium .
interview requests poured in from around the world , but paul remained silent .
ok .
he ’ s an octopus and not known for his verbal skills , but he was now , as they say in hollywood , hot .
his streak continued , picking the winners of several more games .
when he picked germany to lose against spain , germans thought , well , now he ’ s going to fail , as germany was on a roll , and many thought it seemingly possible that germany might win the whole thing .
but , paul was not to be denied .
by picking spain over germany , there were calls for paul to made into a calamari dish or perhaps served up as sushi … .but aquarium officials demurred and increased security .
in the end , paul amazed everyone and correctly picked the winner of the world cup final between the netherlands and spain .
suddenly , everyone wanted a piece of paul .
rumors spread like wildfire .
it was reported that paul was spotted hanging with squid supermodels at sea world in san diego , california … .
other reports had him accepting a teaching job at woods hole oceanography institute .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dw 's andy valvur is waiting for paul 's return but the truth is that paul , even though he was born in england , had become quite german and decided that all the flash and hoopla were not for him .
he stayed in oberhausen , doing what he did best , languidly moving around a fish tank … seemingly oblivious to everything .
this week , the news that everyone dreaded , was released by aquarium officials in oberhausen .
paul was dead .
murder most foul ?
conspiracy theorists immediately suspected squid play ... i mean … foul play pointing to the rumors of beatle paul mccartney ’ s demise in the 70 ’ s .
their suspicions were fueled by reports that paul had been cremated .
no autopsy , no open casket , no official investigation .
other conspiracy theories suggested that paul was the subject of a mob hit , as his uncanny ability to pick winners was lowering the profits from illegal gambling .
another theory is that museum officials sold paul to a japanese sushi consortium , pointing to a website has that has blurry photos of an alleged sushi chef leaving the aquarium in oberhausen still another claim was that paul was just tired of all the attention , and in a late night dash , escaped from oberhausen to spend the rest of his days relaxing in the mediterranean .
museum officials have been tight lipped saying only that paul is dead .
a memorial has been set up in his tank complete with a replica of the world cup .
so ends a remarkable career .
and in life as in death , paul continues to be a lightning rod for publicity .
personally , i like the relaxing in the mediterranean theory the best .

rumors spread like wildfire .
it was reported that paul was spotted hanging with squid supermodels at sea world in san diego , california … .
other reports had him accepting a teaching job at woods hole oceanography institute .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dw 's andy valvur is waiting for paul 's return but the truth is that paul , even though he was born in england , had become quite german and decided that all the flash and hoopla were not for him .

this week , the news that everyone dreaded , was released by aquarium officials in oberhausen .
paul was dead .
murder most foul ?
conspiracy theorists immediately suspected squid play ... i mean … foul play pointing to the rumors of beatle paul mccartney ’ s demise in the 70 ’ s .
their suspicions were fueled by reports that paul had been cremated .
no autopsy , no open casket , no official investigation .
other conspiracy theories suggested that paul was the subject of a mob hit , as his uncanny ability to pick winners was lowering the profits from illegal gambling .
another theory is that museum officials sold paul to a japanese sushi consortium , pointing to a website has that has blurry photos of an alleged sushi chef leaving the aquarium in oberhausen still another claim was that paul was just tired of all the attention , and in a late night dash , escaped from oberhausen to spend the rest of his days relaxing in the mediterranean .
museum officials have been tight lipped saying only that paul is dead .
a memorial has been set up in his tank complete with a replica of the world cup .

personally , i like the relaxing in the mediterranean theory the best .

eurostar , which operates passenger trains through the channel tunnel recently ordered 10 new trains from siemens , in a deal which threatened to engulf france and germany in a protectionist row .
alstom , which also makes high-speed tgv trains , had been backed by france 's transport ministry in its claim that siemens trains ordered by eurostar do not comply with current safety standards set by the franco-british commission which regulates the tunnel .
the judge said alstom did not have a " serious case " and that granting a suspension " would be against the public interest . "
eurostar said it was pleased the matter had been resolved , adding that it always aimed to conduct a rigorous tender to select the best trains .
deutsche bahn , which plans to introduce services through the channel tunnel from 2013 , linking london directly with frankfurt and amsterdam , has also placed a 500-million-euro order with siemens for 15 new high-speed ice trains .

a pre-summit deal between merkel and sarkozy on how to safeguard the euro annoyed many eu states .
deutsche welle 's brussels correspondent , christoph hasselbach , says that 's why so little progress was achieved . chancellor merkel pushed the right issues , but at this summit , at least , made little concrete progress .
it remains to be seen whether the december summit will in fact bring about the desired effect .
the reason for this lies not least in her advance talks with french president nicolas sarkozy .
through the “ deauville deal ” shortly before the summit , merkel managed to irritate almost everyone in the eu .
those who had supported automatic sanctions for budget sinners noted with horror that the german chancellor had given up on this central goal .
merkel also managed to stab the european commission in the back .
the commission had pursued this aim and , until the deauville conference , could be sure having the support of the germans .
in the end , even european council president herman van rompuy must have felt blindsided .
he was given the task of working out the details of the reforms , and even before he could present his results officially , germany and france declared they 'd already reached a decision .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche welle 's brussels correspondent , christoph hasselbach as a trade-off , merkel had secured assurances from sarkozy that france would echo the german demands for altering the lisbon treaty .
merkel experienced how little that promise was worth when she got to the summit .
rarely has such a wall of resistance built up , above all on the question of taking away voting rights .
this means that early on merkel threw away one of the most important methods of stabilizing the euro , and has - at least so far - has nothing to show for her trade-off .
whether the eu can agree on a so-called small amendment to the treaty by december , is not only down to france .
as far as taking away voting rights is concerned , merkel can forget it .
now she just says she wants to keep the item “ on the agenda ” .
it wo n't go beyond that .
it 's a different story when it comes to the permanent rescue mechanism for financially stricken states .
the participation of the private sectors is popular .
and the fear in the whole eurozone of the collapse of a member state could give the necessary pressure to get through moderate treaty amendments on this issue .
the strange thing is this : had merkel fought for automatic sanctions at the summit , and looked for allies on the issue , she may have saved herself and the whole eu some of the conflict over treaty changes .
because the stricter the disciplinary tools are before a financial crisis , the more unlikely it is , that the whole mechanism will need to be used at all .

a pre-summit deal between merkel and sarkozy on how to safeguard the euro annoyed many eu states .
deutsche welle 's brussels correspondent , christoph hasselbach , says that 's why so little progress was achieved . chancellor merkel pushed the right issues , but at this summit , at least , made little concrete progress .
it remains to be seen whether the december summit will in fact bring about the desired effect .
the reason for this lies not least in her advance talks with french president nicolas sarkozy .
through the “ deauville deal ” shortly before the summit , merkel managed to irritate almost everyone in the eu .
those who had supported automatic sanctions for budget sinners noted with horror that the german chancellor had given up on this central goal .
merkel also managed to stab the european commission in the back .
the commission had pursued this aim and , until the deauville conference , could be sure having the support of the germans .
in the end , even european council president herman van rompuy must have felt blindsided .
he was given the task of working out the details of the reforms , and even before he could present his results officially , germany and france declared they 'd already reached a decision .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche welle 's brussels correspondent , christoph hasselbach as a trade-off , merkel had secured assurances from sarkozy that france would echo the german demands for altering the lisbon treaty .
merkel experienced how little that promise was worth when she got to the summit .
rarely has such a wall of resistance built up , above all on the question of taking away voting rights .
this means that early on merkel threw away one of the most important methods of stabilizing the euro , and has - at least so far - has nothing to show for her trade-off .
whether the eu can agree on a so-called small amendment to the treaty by december , is not only down to france .
as far as taking away voting rights is concerned , merkel can forget it .
now she just says she wants to keep the item “ on the agenda ” .
it wo n't go beyond that .
it 's a different story when it comes to the permanent rescue mechanism for financially stricken states .
the participation of the private sectors is popular .
and the fear in the whole eurozone of the collapse of a member state could give the necessary pressure to get through moderate treaty amendments on this issue .
the strange thing is this : had merkel fought for automatic sanctions at the summit , and looked for allies on the issue , she may have saved herself and the whole eu some of the conflict over treaty changes .
because the stricter the disciplinary tools are before a financial crisis , the more unlikely it is , that the whole mechanism will need to be used at all .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de film -pipe- 29.10.2010 berlin and beyond film festival highlights plight of immigrants großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a still from " home from home " directed by sung hyung-cho 's chancellor angela merkel recently said that multi-culturalism in germany had " utterly failed . "
as the debate rages on , one film festival in san francisco aims to offer a more nuanced portrait of immigration . when 8,000 korean nurses arrived in germany during the 1960s , few of them thought they 'd be staying in the country longer than their three-year contracts allowed . thirty-seven years later , three of these women found themselves retiring to korea with their husbands , the sole german residents of the seaside " german village . "
replete with red-tiled roofs , garden gnomes and black bread for breakfast , the retirement community and its german inhabitants have become a must-see for many korean tourists .
they 've also provided the inspiration for sung hyung-cho 's wistful documentary , " endstation der sehnsuechte " -lrb- " home from home " -rrb- .
cameras followed these three couples through their everyday lives – watching as one man created his own sausages so he could get a taste of home and following another as he learned a traditional korean dance .
the women have different experiences , showing a real wariness toward settling in ; as the movie played on , the discomfort these women feel in their birthland grew acute .
" we have no homeland and that is the tragedy of our lives , " one of the women said .
though she 'd long dreamed of returning to korea , she told the camera , " the longer i live here , the more i think of germany . "
heimat has no plural it 's this cross-cultural nostalgia that director sung-hyung cho wanted to address in her film .
" a lot of people have two heimat s -lrb- homes -rrb- , " she told an audience at the berlin and beyond film festival running this week in san francisco , california .
" in german , there is no possibility to have two homes – the word heimat has no plural .
but i have two homes : korea and germany .
when i finally felt at home in germany , i simultaneously became frightened that i would n't be able to feel at home again in korea . "
it was that feeling that drove cho to make the documentary – to explore the depths of homesickness , the bizarre emotional pull that two very different places can have on migrants .
an emphasis on diversity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : another festival highlight was comedy-drama " wedding fever in campobello " " home from home " was just one of several award-winning films playing at the festival this week that added nuance to the extended immigrant experience while showing the diversity of contemporary germany .
" die fremde " -lrb- " when we leave " -rrb- , the festival 's centerpiece film directed by feo aladag , highlighted the plight of a german-born turk who struggled to survive between two very different worlds in modern-day berlin and istanbul .
it 's quite a different story than that shown in the flashbacks in the romantic comedy " wedding fever in campobello " .
the violence and prejudice that the protagonist encountered just after his arrival in osnabrueck in the 1960s are unflinchingly portrayed .
set alongside the modern-day story of his daughter 's wedding , however , the film showcased what the children of these guest workers have lived through as they 've attempted to balance two worlds , two cultures , two languages .
still , the emphasis on the problems facing immigrants was n't an intentional theme for berlin and beyond , said festival director sophaon sorn .
" we really wanted to empower the festival with a diverse program , one that shows a wide variety of human experience , " said sorn .
" and san francisco is a diverse city , it appreciates diversity , so we tried to find movies that would appeal both within the german community here and extend to a broader community as well . "
rudolf de baey , director of the goethe institute of san francisco , emphasized that diversity and immigration are both powerful elements in german society today .
" the reality of germany is that it 's just not a blonde-haired , blue-eyed country any more .
and i think these films reflect that . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de film -pipe- 29.10.2010 berlin and beyond film festival highlights plight of immigrants großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a still from " home from home " directed by sung hyung-cho 's chancellor angela merkel recently said that multi-culturalism in germany had " utterly failed . "
as the debate rages on , one film festival in san francisco aims to offer a more nuanced portrait of immigration . when 8,000 korean nurses arrived in germany during the 1960s , few of them thought they 'd be staying in the country longer than their three-year contracts allowed . thirty-seven years later , three of these women found themselves retiring to korea with their husbands , the sole german residents of the seaside " german village . "
replete with red-tiled roofs , garden gnomes and black bread for breakfast , the retirement community and its german inhabitants have become a must-see for many korean tourists .
they 've also provided the inspiration for sung hyung-cho 's wistful documentary , " endstation der sehnsuechte " -lrb- " home from home " -rrb- .
cameras followed these three couples through their everyday lives – watching as one man created his own sausages so he could get a taste of home and following another as he learned a traditional korean dance .
the women have different experiences , showing a real wariness toward settling in ; as the movie played on , the discomfort these women feel in their birthland grew acute .
" we have no homeland and that is the tragedy of our lives , " one of the women said .
though she 'd long dreamed of returning to korea , she told the camera , " the longer i live here , the more i think of germany . "
heimat has no plural it 's this cross-cultural nostalgia that director sung-hyung cho wanted to address in her film .
" a lot of people have two heimat s -lrb- homes -rrb- , " she told an audience at the berlin and beyond film festival running this week in san francisco , california .
" in german , there is no possibility to have two homes – the word heimat has no plural .
but i have two homes : korea and germany .
when i finally felt at home in germany , i simultaneously became frightened that i would n't be able to feel at home again in korea . "
it was that feeling that drove cho to make the documentary – to explore the depths of homesickness , the bizarre emotional pull that two very different places can have on migrants .
an emphasis on diversity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : another festival highlight was comedy-drama " wedding fever in campobello " " home from home " was just one of several award-winning films playing at the festival this week that added nuance to the extended immigrant experience while showing the diversity of contemporary germany .
" die fremde " -lrb- " when we leave " -rrb- , the festival 's centerpiece film directed by feo aladag , highlighted the plight of a german-born turk who struggled to survive between two very different worlds in modern-day berlin and istanbul .
it 's quite a different story than that shown in the flashbacks in the romantic comedy " wedding fever in campobello " .
the violence and prejudice that the protagonist encountered just after his arrival in osnabrueck in the 1960s are unflinchingly portrayed .
set alongside the modern-day story of his daughter 's wedding , however , the film showcased what the children of these guest workers have lived through as they 've attempted to balance two worlds , two cultures , two languages .
still , the emphasis on the problems facing immigrants was n't an intentional theme for berlin and beyond , said festival director sophaon sorn .
" we really wanted to empower the festival with a diverse program , one that shows a wide variety of human experience , " said sorn .
" and san francisco is a diverse city , it appreciates diversity , so we tried to find movies that would appeal both within the german community here and extend to a broader community as well . "
rudolf de baey , director of the goethe institute of san francisco , emphasized that diversity and immigration are both powerful elements in german society today .
" the reality of germany is that it 's just not a blonde-haired , blue-eyed country any more .
and i think these films reflect that . "

the secret ballot will take place on december 2 .
two members remain provisionally suspended . the election of the 2018 and 2022 world cup hosts will go ahead as planned despite an ongoing corruption probe , fifa president joseph blatter said on friday .
blatter made the announcement after a two-day meeting of the fifa executive committee .
the secret ballot will take place on december 2 at fifa 's headquarters in zurich .
" we are five weeks from the final decision so there was never a question of changing anything in the procedure , " blatter said .
" changing the date would have caused problems for fifa and bidders as well since they plan to bring in high-ranked politicians like bill clinton and vladimir putin . "
executive committee members suspended bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : adamu , left , and temarii are accussed of selling their votes last week , fifa provisionally suspended two of the 24 members of the executive committee , amos adamu of nigeria and reynald temarii of tahiti .
there have been allegations that they offered to sell their votes to undercover reporters from the british sunday times newspaper .
blatter said that the fifa ethics committee will deal with their cases before the election of the host countries takes place . " if and when people are suspended for the vote on december 2 , they will not be replaced , " he said .
alleged deal between spain , portugal and qatar the joint 2018 bidders , spain and portugal , are said to have struck a deal with qatar , a 2022 candidate , for the interchange of votes . the chief of the joint spanish-portugal bid , miguel angel lopez , denied the allegations of collusion with qatar .
blatter said fifa was investigating those allegations as well and said this issue would also be dealt with by the ethics committee .
" let us do our job .
and let us clarify the situation .
and let us do what the people and the fans , the millions , hundred of millions , thousands of millions of fans are expecting : bring back credibility in fifa , " he said .
aside from spain and portugal , the other countries in the running to host the 2018 world cup are england , russia and the netherlands with belgium .
for the 2022 tournament australia , the united states , qatar , japan and south korea are competing .
blatter acknowledged that the recent incidents showed that it was wrong to elect two world cup hosts on one day .
this is the first time such a vote will take place after a decision made by fifa in 2008 .
the scandal is no surprise , experts say jean-paul mean , president of transparency international switzerland , said the fifa scandal should not come as a surprise .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blatter called on fifa to ' bring back credibility ' " we have seen it with the international olympic committee 10 years ago that there were some strange practices , " he said .
" there is just a flair around sport associations that their governance is not the best yet . "
if there is money around , " corruption shows its ugly head , " he added .
according to mean , there is not enough control of international sports organizations since they are not subject to swiss anti-corruption law .
however , according to blatter , fifa will resolve its problems through its ethics committee .
" it 's an uncomfortable situation for fifa , but we have the necessary instruments to react the proper way , " he said .

traditional gender attitudes could be to blame . a new government-commissioned study conducted by the german society for man and health -lrb- dgmg -rrb- and the men 's health foundation , was released on thursday , nearly a decade after a ground-breaking report on women 's health was conducted in 2001 .
speaking at its launch , family affairs minister kristina schroeder said it was high time : " a men 's health report is vitally necessary , because we still have a difference in life expectancy between men and women of 5.5 years . "

men suffer heart-related problems much earlier and more frequently and more seriously than women .
dr. ursula mueller-werdan , a cardiologist at the halle university heart clinic , spoke of the significant differences .
" heart attacks manifest themselves about 15 years earlier in men than in women , " she said .
" men often have unhealthy cardiovascular risk profiles in younger years .
that means , for example , high blood pressure well before the age of 55 . "
doctor-shy men the causes are manifold , but the study identified one particular social difference that can cause problems .

" women are used to going to the gynecologist , they go for contraception , for pregnancies , " he said .
" men are scared of what the doctor will find , and tend to avoid doctors .
they see it as part of their social role that they have to show they are healthy . "

uefa declared italy the winner by a score of 3-0 . uefa awarded italy a 3-0 win by default and ordered serbia to play at least one home qualifier behind closed doors after rioting fans forced their european championship qualifier in genoa on oct .
12 to be abandoned .
the group c game was stopped after just six minutes after serbian fans threw fireworks onto the pitch .
uefa 's decision was more lenient than many had expected .
" compared to what had been speculated , it is not a bad decision , " serbia 's coach vladimir petrovic told belgrade 's b92 telelvision .
serbia 's one-match crowd ban comes with the threat that a second soccer game would be played to an empty stadium if there is more crowd trouble at any of its games over the next two years .
uefa 's control and disciplinary body has ordered serbia 's soccer association to refrain from ordering tickets for serbian supporters for all of the away matches of the serbian team during the remainder of euro 2012 qualifying .

italy was also hit with a suspended sentence of one game behind closed doors because the italian security operation failed on oct .

" if we had intervened , we would have risked a catastrophe , " italian soccer association director-general antonello valentini told reporters in nyon when asked why riot police had not entered the away end .
the match in genoa was abandoned after six minutes when masked serbian fans threw flares onto the pitch and at italian supporters having climbed up a perimeter fence and cut a hole in netting meant to prevent objects being thrown .
the kick-off had already been delayed by 35 minutes due to crowd trouble , which followed serbia 's goalkeeper vladimir stojkovic pulling out of the game because of threats from his own fans over a domestic club dispute .
away fans , who had made political gestures in the ground and tried to smash a barrier to get into the home end , also clashed with police after the abandonment and there were 17 arrests .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italian police were criticized for not preventing the violence nationalist violence shortly after the abandoned match , serbian officials expressed fear of a right-wing extremist plot against their country 's entry to the european union .
" obviously somebody wants to demonstrate that serbia is neither ready , nor mature enough to enter europe , " the state secretary for justice , slobodan homen , said in a interview with b92 .
both associations have three days to appeal uefa 's decision .
serbian officials have accepted most of the sanctions , but plan to appeal the decision to award italy a 3-0 victory .
" we are not happy with that part of the uefa verdict and we will appeal for a replay of the match because we think the only fair decision is to have a winner determined on the playing field , " the president of the serbian soccer association , tomislav karadzic , told the reuters news agency .
if the 3-0 win stands after an appeal , italy would lead group c with 10 points from four games .
serbia would be in fifth place in the six-nation group with four points .
their next game , a home match against northern ireland on mar .
25 , 2011 , will be played behind closed doors .

uefa declared italy the winner by a score of 3-0 . uefa awarded italy a 3-0 win by default and ordered serbia to play at least one home qualifier behind closed doors after rioting fans forced their european championship qualifier in genoa on oct .
12 to be abandoned .
the group c game was stopped after just six minutes after serbian fans threw fireworks onto the pitch .
uefa 's decision was more lenient than many had expected .
" compared to what had been speculated , it is not a bad decision , " serbia 's coach vladimir petrovic told belgrade 's b92 telelvision .
serbia 's one-match crowd ban comes with the threat that a second soccer game would be played to an empty stadium if there is more crowd trouble at any of its games over the next two years .
uefa 's control and disciplinary body has ordered serbia 's soccer association to refrain from ordering tickets for serbian supporters for all of the away matches of the serbian team during the remainder of euro 2012 qualifying .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : serbian hooligans may have had political motives italy punished too the italian soccer association was fined 100,000 euros -lrb- $ 139,000 -rrb- and the serbian association 120,000 euros .
italy was also hit with a suspended sentence of one game behind closed doors because the italian security operation failed on oct .
12 to stop serbian fans from entering the stadium in genoa with an arsenal of fireworks and flares .
" if we had intervened , we would have risked a catastrophe , " italian soccer association director-general antonello valentini told reporters in nyon when asked why riot police had not entered the away end .
the match in genoa was abandoned after six minutes when masked serbian fans threw flares onto the pitch and at italian supporters having climbed up a perimeter fence and cut a hole in netting meant to prevent objects being thrown .
the kick-off had already been delayed by 35 minutes due to crowd trouble , which followed serbia 's goalkeeper vladimir stojkovic pulling out of the game because of threats from his own fans over a domestic club dispute .
away fans , who had made political gestures in the ground and tried to smash a barrier to get into the home end , also clashed with police after the abandonment and there were 17 arrests .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italian police were criticized for not preventing the violence nationalist violence shortly after the abandoned match , serbian officials expressed fear of a right-wing extremist plot against their country 's entry to the european union .
" obviously somebody wants to demonstrate that serbia is neither ready , nor mature enough to enter europe , " the state secretary for justice , slobodan homen , said in a interview with b92 .
both associations have three days to appeal uefa 's decision .
serbian officials have accepted most of the sanctions , but plan to appeal the decision to award italy a 3-0 victory .
" we are not happy with that part of the uefa verdict and we will appeal for a replay of the match because we think the only fair decision is to have a winner determined on the playing field , " the president of the serbian soccer association , tomislav karadzic , told the reuters news agency .
if the 3-0 win stands after an appeal , italy would lead group c with 10 points from four games .
serbia would be in fifth place in the six-nation group with four points .
their next game , a home match against northern ireland on mar .
25 , 2011 , will be played behind closed doors .

under pressure from german chancellor angela merkel and french president nicolas sarkozy , european union leaders set in motion plans to amend the lisbon treaty to create a system to ward off financial crises .
they also endorsed tougher sanctions on states that do not keep their public debt in check .
merkel had insisted on suspending voting rights for member states which breach the rules , but failed to win widespread support for this demand .
smaller eu states in particular were opposed to this idea .
overcoming hostility bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : initially merkel only had the support of sarkozy initially germany and france faced strong hostility to their proposals to change the lisbon treaty .
a number of states rejected the idea of far-reaching amendments that would have forced them to hold referendums , which would have been expected to fail .
chancellor merkel was forced to back down on this issue .
the german chancellor had been battling for weeks to push through changes that would provide the eurozone with greater stability .
at home , she has faced public hostility to the bailout of greece and the creation of a massive rescue fund designed to protect the euro .
merkel wanted to write the creation of the rescue fund into the treaty .
europe 's biggest economy contributed the bulk of the 750-billion-euro -lrb- $ 1 trillion -rrb- european financial stability fund , which was hastily established in may to save greece from financial collapse .
the fund is now to be turned into a " permanent crisis mechanism . "
at the eu summit in brussels , which started on thursday , merkel fought into the night to push through her proposals , winning agreement only in the early hours of friday morning .
the german chancellor said she was satisfied with the outcome of the summit : " we have put forward our essential points , " she said .
" everyone is in agreement that a limited change to the lisbon treaty is necessary . "
merkel stressed the new crisis mechanism would only be " valid for cases in which the stability of the euro as a whole is at risk . "
" should a country ever need to make use of this , it would be faced with very strict requirements , " she said .
cautious welcome from the german media the german business daily handelsblatt said the agreement was a significant achievement , calling it a " breakthrough " for merkel , whose center-right coalition has suffered a drop in support in the polls in recent months .
however , because merkel 's more far-reaching treaty changes were put on the backburner , the german newspaper hannoversche allgemeine zeitung said the deal amounted to a " light solution " to the problem of imposing budgetary discipline .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : van rompuy is now charged with drafting the changes guenther kirschbaum , a member of merkel 's christian democrats , who chairs the european affairs committee in the lower house , said the agreement amounted to real progress .
" it is a great step forward because we now have a crisis mechanism so that in future we will not have to deal with problems like the greek crisis on an ad hoc basis , " kirschbaum said .
the proposed changes to the lisbon treaty are to be drafted in time for another eu summit in december .
the changes are to be agreed and implemented by 2013 , when the current rescue fund expires .
european council president herman van rompuy told a news conference in brussels that " important decisions to strengthen the eurozone " had been taken .
" we recommend a robust and credible permanent crisis resolution mechanism to safeguard the financial stability of the eurozone as a whole , " he added .

under pressure from german chancellor angela merkel and french president nicolas sarkozy , european union leaders set in motion plans to amend the lisbon treaty to create a system to ward off financial crises .
they also endorsed tougher sanctions on states that do not keep their public debt in check .
merkel had insisted on suspending voting rights for member states which breach the rules , but failed to win widespread support for this demand .
smaller eu states in particular were opposed to this idea .
overcoming hostility bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : initially merkel only had the support of sarkozy initially germany and france faced strong hostility to their proposals to change the lisbon treaty .
a number of states rejected the idea of far-reaching amendments that would have forced them to hold referendums , which would have been expected to fail .
chancellor merkel was forced to back down on this issue .
the german chancellor had been battling for weeks to push through changes that would provide the eurozone with greater stability .
at home , she has faced public hostility to the bailout of greece and the creation of a massive rescue fund designed to protect the euro .
merkel wanted to write the creation of the rescue fund into the treaty .
europe 's biggest economy contributed the bulk of the 750-billion-euro -lrb- $ 1 trillion -rrb- european financial stability fund , which was hastily established in may to save greece from financial collapse .
the fund is now to be turned into a " permanent crisis mechanism . "
at the eu summit in brussels , which started on thursday , merkel fought into the night to push through her proposals , winning agreement only in the early hours of friday morning .
the german chancellor said she was satisfied with the outcome of the summit : " we have put forward our essential points , " she said .
" everyone is in agreement that a limited change to the lisbon treaty is necessary . "
merkel stressed the new crisis mechanism would only be " valid for cases in which the stability of the euro as a whole is at risk . "
" should a country ever need to make use of this , it would be faced with very strict requirements , " she said .
cautious welcome from the german media the german business daily handelsblatt said the agreement was a significant achievement , calling it a " breakthrough " for merkel , whose center-right coalition has suffered a drop in support in the polls in recent months .
however , because merkel 's more far-reaching treaty changes were put on the backburner , the german newspaper hannoversche allgemeine zeitung said the deal amounted to a " light solution " to the problem of imposing budgetary discipline .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : van rompuy is now charged with drafting the changes guenther kirschbaum , a member of merkel 's christian democrats , who chairs the european affairs committee in the lower house , said the agreement amounted to real progress .
" it is a great step forward because we now have a crisis mechanism so that in future we will not have to deal with problems like the greek crisis on an ad hoc basis , " kirschbaum said .
the proposed changes to the lisbon treaty are to be drafted in time for another eu summit in december .
the changes are to be agreed and implemented by 2013 , when the current rescue fund expires .
european council president herman van rompuy told a news conference in brussels that " important decisions to strengthen the eurozone " had been taken .
" we recommend a robust and credible permanent crisis resolution mechanism to safeguard the financial stability of the eurozone as a whole , " he added .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de history -pipe- 29.10.2010 opinion : germany 's nazi history is clouded by myths großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the study of the foreign office 's crimes under hitler shows that memories of the nazi period are still dominated by myths .
dw 's ramon garcia-ziemsen writes about how germany 's history was deliberately repressed . yes , it is shocking how german diplomats were complicit in the holocaust in the second world war , and how they were involved in its implementation .
it 's unbelievable how much continuity there was in the diplomatic personnel after 1945 in germany : men who had participated in the nazi extermination policies later made careers and protected each other , even before their involvement was made public .
but it 's just as incredible how long it has taken : that only now , 65 years on , this has come to the attention of the wider german public .
in 1979 , a book was published by a british historian about the participation of the foreign office in the so called " final solution , " the nazi description for the murder of european jews .
the book describes what the nature of the foreign office 's participation in the holocaust was , how deportation orders were signed there , how the office was a systematic element of the nazi killing machine .
and even back in the 1950s , there was clear evidence showing that the foreign office was certainly not a " school of passive resistance " against hitler , as it liked to present itself in the post-war period .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ramon garcia-ziemsen head of dw 's german culture department a lot was known , a lot was forgotten in short : much was known .
and almost everything was forgotten .
how the germans dealt with the third reich is not as exemplary as it has often been perceived around the world , it is also a history of forgetting and repressing .
the elites have often knowingly prevented a discussion about their past .
and the public allowed this discourse to be prevented .
how could this happen ? after 1945 , german society was always looking for the " good , " for the " other germany " - the " other germany " that had remained innocent , that had perhaps not been openly resistant , but did not allow itself to be sucked into nazi ideology ; which had remained resistant , which had rejected the nazi madness , and of which one might even be proud .
because it wanted a fresh start , the young germany did not think it could live with the weight of such a large feeling of guilt .
myths and collective guilt and in this way the yarn was spun : first came the myth that many germans had only found out about the holocaust in 1945 from the allies .
the myth was born that only a small group around hitler had known what had happened in concentration camps like auschwitz and dachau .
the germans were a nation led astray .
this position was also of course a reaction to the similarly blanket collective guilt theory purported by the allies after the war . then came the myth of the armed forces : that the soldiers had played almost no part in hitler 's atrocities - and besides that everything had been carried out under orders .
both theories were exposed by historians as false only decades later , from the 1970s , through studies , books and exhibitions .
large parts of the population knew not only why jewish friends and neighbors had suddenly disappeared , but they had also assisted with this disappearance .
soldiers took part in shooting jews - voluntarily and not under orders .
but again it took years and decades , well into the 1990s , until this knowledge resulted in a public debate and led to a real demystification . where the myth certainly still existed was in the foreign office , one of the last places where the fairy tale of the " other germany " could live on .
the solidarity of the diplomats worked so well and perhaps the respect for the future german president richard von weizsaecker was too great .
weizsaecker 's father ernst was a top diplomat , who supported the nazi ideology in the foreign office .
but germany 's longing for this " other germany " , which existed much less than most germans had thought , was also too great .

not such a special tally , but one that included a surprising spot-on forecast of werder bremen 's 4-1 victory away to borussia moenchengladbach .
to fight the unsubstantiated and scurrilous accusations of match-fixing that have been swirling , dw 's experts are ready to come clean - the spirits made them do it .
they 're still under their control , in fact : here are their picks for week ten .
friday , oct .
29 bayern - freiburg few would have predicted freiburg being above bayern after nine games but the league table does n't lie .
bayern are suffering a crisis of confidence and fluidity in the bundesliga , while the freiburgers are just enjoying their early season ride .
robin dutt ’ s men have notched points against their mid-table rivals but have come unstuck against the better teams .
ordinarily bayern would be included in that latter category , but right now they 're adrift in mediocrity .
however , at home , with a partisan crowd expecting a return to the status quo , bayern should edge it .
prediction : bayern 2-1 saturday , oct .
30 bremen - nuremberg bremen have managed to steady their ship after a choppy start to the season and are unbeaten in five league games .
they still lie in eighth place but show signs of rediscovering the consistency which could see them climb the table .
but this is werder , remember , and nothing can be taken for granted .
they can win 4-1 one week and get thumped by the same scoreline the next .
nuremberg are experiencing the pendulum of form ; winning one week , losing the next .
if it continues to swing , after beating wolfsburg last week , then bremen should come out on top in this one .
prediction : bremen 3-0 wolfsburg - stuttgart bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : keller has got stuttgart winning again and out of danger jens keller is unbeaten as stuttgart coach after taking over from the sacked christian gross two weeks ago , and the four points his team has eked out in their last two league games have taken them out of the drop zone .
confidence is slowly coming back , boosted by recent europa league and dfb cup wins , and while it is still a nascent recovery , vfb do have some momentum at last .
wolfsburg , on the other hand , have lost theirs .
two defeats and a loss have put the skids under their own revival and coming into this match , stuttgart look to have the edge .
stuttgart : 1-0 cologne - hamburg the enigma that is hamburger sv continues to confound .
after an impressive start followed by a worrying slump , hsv are rebuilding their campaign by going three games unbeaten .
two wins and a goalless draw against bayern could have been seen as a solid base to push on , but their 5-2 cup hammering at the hands of frankfurt in midweek may have released old demons .
cologne , however , appear to have little in their locker which could inflict such a heavy defeat on hamburg - in fact , any kind of defeat looks unlikely .
the bottom club have a solitary win to their name and their second isn ’ t likely to come this weekend , even with the benefit of home advantage .
prediction : hamburg 2-0 kaiserslautern - moenchengladbach kaiserslautern 's last win - the impressive 2-0 defeat of bayern - seems a long time ago .
indeed since those heady days of august , when kaiserslautern notched two wins on the trot , all that has followed is a downward spiral of six reversals and a draw , leaving the red devils hovering perilously over the drop zone .
they got a welcome boost with a midweek cup win - but then again so did gladbach .
however , given that gladbach slipped to second-from-bottom after their sixth defeat of the season last weekend , little should be read into that .
these are two teams in deep , albeit it early , trouble .
their desperation may cancel each other out .
prediction : draw 2-2 st. pauli - frankfurt given they were afforded little chance of staying up this season , st- pauli 's current position in 10th could already be hailed as a triumph .
as long as they do n't start panicking that last week 's defeat to stuttgart and their slight tumble down the league is the start of their predicted demise , st. pauli have the guts to slog it out and remain in the bundesliga .
frankfurt sit a place above them on goal difference with an exact replica of the hamburg club 's record to date .
eintracht come into this game on the back of three wins and a draw so they will be up for it against pauli .
expect a gutsy battle .
prediction : draw 1-1 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : raul did n't expect to swap real madrid for a relegation fight schalke - leverkusen things still look desperate for schalke .
their only victory in the league this season , ground out against freiburg over a month ago , looks increasingly like a false dawn .
a defeat and three draws suggests little has been put right since .
their home form has been pitiful and leverkusen will certainly fancy their chances when they make the journey to gelsenkirchen on saturday .
leverkusen have had plenty of joy on their travels .
unbeaten in four away games with three wins and a draw , it appears to be advantage bayer .
schalke 's revival will have to wait at least another week .
prediction : leverkusen 3-2 sunday , oct .
31 mainz - dortmund halloween came early for dortmund in the dfb cup on wednesday .
instead of the treat they might have expected from a fixture against a third division side , they got tricked in a 4-2 loss on penalties at kickers offenbach .
bvb , who have been on fire in front of goal , will be wondering how they went 120 minutes without scoring and will be hoping they find they find the target ahead of this first-versus-second clash .
mainz , who returned to the summit last weekend , also lost in the cup to alemannia aachen so this game is primed for both teams to put their woes behind them .
dortmund will have the added incentive of going top if they win and could take heart from the fact that mainz 's only league defeat so far has come at home .
prediction : dortmund 3-1 hoffenheim - hanover bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hannover 's players are n't suffering from altitude sickness hanover continues to overachieve this season .
up to third after last week 's victory over cologne , they look to have put the brakes on the minor slide which affected them after losing to st. pauli at the start of october .
hoffenheim , meanwhile , are still challenging at the top end but their own push for the summit has suffered a few hiccups in recent weeks .
after three wins on the bounce at the start of the season , it took hoffenheim until two weeks ago to record their next .
keeping dortmund at bay in last week 's 1-1 draw suggests they 've found their balance again but hanover may edge this to keep their impressive campaign on track .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de history -pipe- 29.10.2010 opinion : germany 's nazi history is clouded by myths großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the study of the foreign office 's crimes under hitler shows that memories of the nazi period are still dominated by myths .
dw 's ramon garcia-ziemsen writes about how germany 's history was deliberately repressed . yes , it is shocking how german diplomats were complicit in the holocaust in the second world war , and how they were involved in its implementation .
it 's unbelievable how much continuity there was in the diplomatic personnel after 1945 in germany : men who had participated in the nazi extermination policies later made careers and protected each other , even before their involvement was made public .
but it 's just as incredible how long it has taken : that only now , 65 years on , this has come to the attention of the wider german public .
in 1979 , a book was published by a british historian about the participation of the foreign office in the so called " final solution , " the nazi description for the murder of european jews .
the book describes what the nature of the foreign office 's participation in the holocaust was , how deportation orders were signed there , how the office was a systematic element of the nazi killing machine .
and even back in the 1950s , there was clear evidence showing that the foreign office was certainly not a " school of passive resistance " against hitler , as it liked to present itself in the post-war period .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ramon garcia-ziemsen head of dw 's german culture department a lot was known , a lot was forgotten in short : much was known .
and almost everything was forgotten .
how the germans dealt with the third reich is not as exemplary as it has often been perceived around the world , it is also a history of forgetting and repressing .
the elites have often knowingly prevented a discussion about their past .
and the public allowed this discourse to be prevented .
how could this happen ? after 1945 , german society was always looking for the " good , " for the " other germany " - the " other germany " that had remained innocent , that had perhaps not been openly resistant , but did not allow itself to be sucked into nazi ideology ; which had remained resistant , which had rejected the nazi madness , and of which one might even be proud .
because it wanted a fresh start , the young germany did not think it could live with the weight of such a large feeling of guilt .
myths and collective guilt and in this way the yarn was spun : first came the myth that many germans had only found out about the holocaust in 1945 from the allies .
the myth was born that only a small group around hitler had known what had happened in concentration camps like auschwitz and dachau .
the germans were a nation led astray .
this position was also of course a reaction to the similarly blanket collective guilt theory purported by the allies after the war . then came the myth of the armed forces : that the soldiers had played almost no part in hitler 's atrocities - and besides that everything had been carried out under orders .
both theories were exposed by historians as false only decades later , from the 1970s , through studies , books and exhibitions .
large parts of the population knew not only why jewish friends and neighbors had suddenly disappeared , but they had also assisted with this disappearance .
soldiers took part in shooting jews - voluntarily and not under orders .
but again it took years and decades , well into the 1990s , until this knowledge resulted in a public debate and led to a real demystification . where the myth certainly still existed was in the foreign office , one of the last places where the fairy tale of the " other germany " could live on .
the solidarity of the diplomats worked so well and perhaps the respect for the future german president richard von weizsaecker was too great .
weizsaecker 's father ernst was a top diplomat , who supported the nazi ideology in the foreign office .
but germany 's longing for this " other germany " , which existed much less than most germans had thought , was also too great .

however , the outcome might well have an impact on washington 's relations with the rest of the world . when american voters head to the polls to elect a new house of representatives and 37 new senators , there is perhaps nothing that sums up their sentiment better than the old adage from bill clinton 's 1992 presidential campaign : " it 's the economy , stupid . " and with unemployment hovering at close to 10 percent , a collapsed housing market and a stuttering economy , there certainly is ample reason for voters to worry about their personal well-being . to be sure , there are definitely enough foreign policy issues that would merit the electorate 's attention too : a war in afghanistan , now in its ninth year , which is not going well , a tense situation in the middle east with us-sponsored negotiations between israelis and palestinians always on the verge of collapse , iran 's alleged efforts to acquire nuclear weapons still unresolved and north korea in the middle of a leadership handover .
but all of that does n't really matter , says thomas e. mann , a congressional scholar at the brookings institution in washington : " for the most part the public is so distressed and pessimistic about the economy that that is what 's dominating the campaigns , " he told deutsche welle . international issues on the sidelines the only way foreign policy gets any traction as an election topic is when it relates to a domestic issue , adds mann .
china , for example , plays a role in certain campaigns when trade issues or the currency imbalances are discussed .
and mexico is addressed when illegal immigration and its effect on the economy is debated .
other than that , domestic issues , especially the economy , dominate the midterm elections almost completely .
while foreign policy issues have no impact on the election , the results of the elections could well have an impact on us foreign policy .
if , as most pollsters predict , the republicans win back the house of representatives and stand a small chance of also retaking the senate , this will have implications for the way washington carries out international relations . " there are a lot of republican candidates running for the house who are tea party candidates , who are very hard-right candidates , " douglas foyle , a professor at wesleyan university who has researched about the impact of domestic issues on international relations , told deutsche welle .
" they have n't said too much about foreign policy and so it 's anybody 's guess what they are going to do once they get into office . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president barack obama wo n't be able to get a climate change treaty through the new congress what the tea party candidates have said very clearly however , is that they want to balance the budget .
" if they are going to balance the budget , they will have to cut defense spending because that 's about half of all discretionary federal spending , " notes foyle .
" and pulling back in foreign policy in terms of the military is not something that traditionally the republicans would do . "
future of the republican party his colleague mann also sees a chance of a " significant number of tea party-based republicans coming in to the senate with rather extreme views on the limited role for government and really hostile sentiments toward globalization and international organizations . "
he adds : " if this group were to gain the upper hand in the republican party we would have one center-left party and one extreme-right party in the country .
that 's not reassuring . "
regardless how the soul searching of the republican party ends , the party 's majority in one or both chambers of congress would have an impact on us foreign policy in any case . while the president has considerably more leeway to pursue his own course in international affairs than on the domestic front and also serves as the commander-in-chief of the military , he ca n't disregard congress entirely .
first , congress approves the budget and through that can influence policy as well . " let 's look at afghanistan for example , " juergen chrobog , germany 's former ambassador in washington who now heads the bmw foundation herbert quandt , told deutsche welle : " the troops and the war must be financed .
and here the members of congress have an enormous lever : they can give more or less . "
treaties face tough obstacles what 's more , congress is also needed to ratify international treaties .
even with a sizeable majority in both chambers during the first half of his term , president barack obama could n't get a climate change treaty through congress .
with a republican majority in one or both chambers of congress , predict the experts , a climate change treaty which must be ratified by a two-thirds majority in the senate is all but dead .
the fate of the new start treaty , the follow-up to the original nuclear disarmament pact signed by republican icon ronald reagan and soviet leader mikhail gorbachev , is also uncertain . the lame duck senate will vote on the issue in the middle of november . whether it goes through is still unclear .
if it does n't , it seems rather unlikely that it will have an easier time in the new senate . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us voters worry primarily about the economy and about losing their jobs " i do n't see any major treaties like these being ratified , at least not easily , " says chrobog .
" i hope that president obama and the democrats at least keep their majority in the senate . "
the likely swing to the right in the midterm elections could make us foreign policy less predictable and more complicated , argue the experts .
still , they add , europeans should n't fret too much about the outcome of the polls . " i think the most important thing for those looking from abroad at this election is to realize this is not fundamentally about ideology , " says mann .
" this is about americans being scared and sour and pessimistic about our economic well-being and instinctively voting against the party in power . "

one lawmaker says it 's time to do long-term immigrants a favor and loosen up that rule . new legislation introduced in the german parliament could allow certain groups to get a german passport more easily and quickly , as well as granting more people the right to hold dual citizenship .
currently , immigrants who want to get german citizenship must take a naturalization test and show that they have a firm grasp of the language .
in addition , they generally have to renounce their previous citizenship .
pensioners who came to the country as immigrants are one of the groups that would benefit most from a change to the law .
if the bill were passed , a person who is over 53 years old and has been living in germany for at least 15 years could apply for a passport without meeting the language requirements .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kilic wants to see an immigrant 's work rewarded " if a person has made a contribution to this society , i want to make it easier for them to become citizens , " green party parliamentarian memet kilic told deutsche welle .
" especially older immigrants - who gave their youth and health to build up this country - should be able to obtain citizenship without a language requirement .
that way , we can win the hearts of their children and grandchildren for this country . "
integration conversation kilic 's bill comes as the integration of immigrants is under the microscope in germany .
chancellor angela merkel , a christian democrat , said earlier this month that multiculturalism had failed in germany .
there have also been repeated calls for immigrants to integrate better into german society by learning the language and customs .
kilic , who was born in turkey , said the legislation he sponsored would be welcome news to immigrants .
" third-generation immigrant children in germany hear three times a day that they do n't belong to this country , " he said .
" what good is that ?
i want to turn the tables . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : integration is hard to define in germany in support of the bill , kilic cited statistics showing that the number of citizens naturalized in germany each year had fallen by 20 percent since 2004 .
this was an indication that becoming a german citizen was simply too difficult , he said .
without citizenship , many of germany 's 6.7 million immigrants do not have the right to vote in the country .
but citizenship goes beyond the legal realm .
" integration means more than simply structural integration , " said guelistan guerbey , a political scientist at berlin 's free university .
" it has a very strong emotional and psychological dimension . "
this is especially true for dual citizens .
if the bill became law , an immigrant would no longer have to give up their passport to become german .
guerbey said this would have a positive effect .
" a person has emotional ties in both directions , " she said , " and dual citizenship is a legal recognition of this emotional state . "
time to learn german but while legal benefits and emotional satisfaction might encourage a retired immigrant with less-than-perfect german to apply for citizenship under the loosened rules of the proposed law , they may never get the chance .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : learning german is essential for integration , says grindel on thursday in the bundestag , reinhard grindel of the governing christian democrats , was clear about what his party thought of the proposal .
" when someone wants to become a german citizen , " grindel said , " then i have to be able to say , as an incentive , that you must learn german if you have n't learned it well enough already .
that 's a part of the integration process - to finally learn german . "
and there is reason to believe that many retired immigrants in germany would n't apply for a german passport if the rules were loosened .
some come from other european union countries , where moving across borders is n't problematic , though they do not have full voting rights in germany .
but kilic says there are some 2,000-3,000 retirees from other countries who would gladly take advantage of the opportunity .

however , the outcome might well have an impact on washington 's relations with the rest of the world . when american voters head to the polls to elect a new house of representatives and 37 new senators , there is perhaps nothing that sums up their sentiment better than the old adage from bill clinton 's 1992 presidential campaign : " it 's the economy , stupid . " and with unemployment hovering at close to 10 percent , a collapsed housing market and a stuttering economy , there certainly is ample reason for voters to worry about their personal well-being . to be sure , there are definitely enough foreign policy issues that would merit the electorate 's attention too : a war in afghanistan , now in its ninth year , which is not going well , a tense situation in the middle east with us-sponsored negotiations between israelis and palestinians always on the verge of collapse , iran 's alleged efforts to acquire nuclear weapons still unresolved and north korea in the middle of a leadership handover .
but all of that does n't really matter , says thomas e. mann , a congressional scholar at the brookings institution in washington : " for the most part the public is so distressed and pessimistic about the economy that that is what 's dominating the campaigns , " he told deutsche welle . international issues on the sidelines the only way foreign policy gets any traction as an election topic is when it relates to a domestic issue , adds mann .
china , for example , plays a role in certain campaigns when trade issues or the currency imbalances are discussed .
and mexico is addressed when illegal immigration and its effect on the economy is debated .
other than that , domestic issues , especially the economy , dominate the midterm elections almost completely .
while foreign policy issues have no impact on the election , the results of the elections could well have an impact on us foreign policy .
if , as most pollsters predict , the republicans win back the house of representatives and stand a small chance of also retaking the senate , this will have implications for the way washington carries out international relations . " there are a lot of republican candidates running for the house who are tea party candidates , who are very hard-right candidates , " douglas foyle , a professor at wesleyan university who has researched about the impact of domestic issues on international relations , told deutsche welle .
" they have n't said too much about foreign policy and so it 's anybody 's guess what they are going to do once they get into office . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president barack obama wo n't be able to get a climate change treaty through the new congress what the tea party candidates have said very clearly however , is that they want to balance the budget .
" if they are going to balance the budget , they will have to cut defense spending because that 's about half of all discretionary federal spending , " notes foyle .
" and pulling back in foreign policy in terms of the military is not something that traditionally the republicans would do . "
future of the republican party his colleague mann also sees a chance of a " significant number of tea party-based republicans coming in to the senate with rather extreme views on the limited role for government and really hostile sentiments toward globalization and international organizations . "
he adds : " if this group were to gain the upper hand in the republican party we would have one center-left party and one extreme-right party in the country .
that 's not reassuring . "
regardless how the soul searching of the republican party ends , the party 's majority in one or both chambers of congress would have an impact on us foreign policy in any case . while the president has considerably more leeway to pursue his own course in international affairs than on the domestic front and also serves as the commander-in-chief of the military , he ca n't disregard congress entirely .
first , congress approves the budget and through that can influence policy as well . " let 's look at afghanistan for example , " juergen chrobog , germany 's former ambassador in washington who now heads the bmw foundation herbert quandt , told deutsche welle : " the troops and the war must be financed .
and here the members of congress have an enormous lever : they can give more or less . "
treaties face tough obstacles what 's more , congress is also needed to ratify international treaties .
even with a sizeable majority in both chambers during the first half of his term , president barack obama could n't get a climate change treaty through congress .
with a republican majority in one or both chambers of congress , predict the experts , a climate change treaty which must be ratified by a two-thirds majority in the senate is all but dead .
the fate of the new start treaty , the follow-up to the original nuclear disarmament pact signed by republican icon ronald reagan and soviet leader mikhail gorbachev , is also uncertain . the lame duck senate will vote on the issue in the middle of november . whether it goes through is still unclear .
if it does n't , it seems rather unlikely that it will have an easier time in the new senate . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us voters worry primarily about the economy and about losing their jobs " i do n't see any major treaties like these being ratified , at least not easily , " says chrobog .
" i hope that president obama and the democrats at least keep their majority in the senate . "
the likely swing to the right in the midterm elections could make us foreign policy less predictable and more complicated , argue the experts .
still , they add , europeans should n't fret too much about the outcome of the polls . " i think the most important thing for those looking from abroad at this election is to realize this is not fundamentally about ideology , " says mann .
" this is about americans being scared and sour and pessimistic about our economic well-being and instinctively voting against the party in power . "

kfor has been in the territory for more than a decade . citing progress in the breakaway former serbian province , nato secretary general anders fogh rasmussen made the announcement in a statement released to the media on friday .
" the security conditions in kosovo continue to improve , which is a positive sign , not only for kosovo , but for the whole region , " the statement said .
rasmussen added that local institutions were increasingly capable of assuming responsibility for security tasks , and that the kosovo force -lrb- kfor -rrb- , which had already been reduced from 15,000 to 10,000 soldiers earlier this year , would continue to be a deterrent to violence .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the kosovo force is made up of soldiers from a dozen nations " kfor will remain able to deploy forces quickly and effectively whenever and wherever necessary , including with robust reserves .
kfor 's mission to guarantee a safe and secure environment in kosovo remains unchanged . "
the german commander of the nato forces in kosovo , major general erhard buehler , said the decision was taken " because the security situation is calm , " but he said kosovo 's serb-inhabited north remained an area of concern .
international peacekeeping forces arrived in kosovo in 1999 , following a 78-day nato bombing campaign to end a conflict between serbian forces and fighters from the ethnic albanian majority in what was then a province of serbia .
kosovo unilaterally declared independence from serbia in feb .
2008 , paving the way for a reduction in the number of peacekeepers , although ethnic tensions have persisted .
in recent weeks , belgrade , which refuses to recognize kosovo as an independent state , has also signaled a softening of its approach to kosovo , a move which was welcomed by nato .

eurostar , which operates passenger trains through the channel tunnel recently ordered 10 new trains from siemens , in a deal which threatened to engulf france and germany in a protectionist row .
alstom , which also makes high-speed tgv trains , had been backed by france 's transport ministry in its claim that siemens trains ordered by eurostar do not comply with current safety standards set by the franco-british commission which regulates the tunnel .
the judge said alstom did not have a " serious case " and that granting a suspension " would be against the public interest . "
eurostar said it was pleased the matter had been resolved , adding that it always aimed to conduct a rigorous tender to select the best trains .
deutsche bahn , which plans to introduce services through the channel tunnel from 2013 , linking london directly with frankfurt and amsterdam , has also placed a 500-million-euro order with siemens for 15 new high-speed ice trains .

one british mp said london needs to do more to protect people 's privacy . it 's been a busy week for google lawyers in europe , as the california tech giant became the target of the legal wrath of italy and the united kingdom . prosecutors in rome on wednesday began an investigation against google for potential invasions of privacy in its street view online mapping service . italian authorities , like their counterparts in germany , spain , canada and elsewhere , are concerned that google acquired personal data including e-mails and passwords while " packet sniffing " on open wifi networks while photographing for the street view service . google has previously said that the data acquisition was accidental , and that it has taken measures to ensure that this kind of breach does not happen again . this legal move came as the italian data protection authority also announced more restrictions this week against google . " italian citizens will be informed of the presence of google cars taking pictures of places and individuals to be posted online via the street view service , " the italian privacy authority said in a statement on its website on monday . the authority added that google street view vehicles will have to be obvious to passers-by . " google cars will have to be clearly marked by means of visible stickers or signs to unambiguously signify that pictures are being taken for the purposes of street view , " it said in the statement . other conditions set by the italian authorities included requiring google list what neighborhoods its cars would photograph in local media ahead of time .
the italian dpa added that failure to comply with the new rules would carry a fine of up to 1,800 euros -lrb- $ 2,500 -rrb- . uk privacy investigation has been ' lily-livered ' bildunterschrift : states around the world are investigating google 's privacy policies thursday , in london , a parliamentary committee met to find out why the british government has not done more to investigate privacy concerns over the leaked wifi data situation . earlier this year , the british data protection authority , the information commissioner 's office , had said it had found no wrongdoing on google 's part , but on monday the office re-opened the case after google 's admitted acquiring more data than had been previously disclosed . " the uk information commissioner has been lily-livered , " robert halfon , a conservative parliamentarian , said during the committee hearing . " these corporations need to be taught that advancing the technological wonder that is the internet is one thing , " he added .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de history -pipe- 29.10.2010 opinion : germany 's nazi history is clouded by myths großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the study of the foreign office 's crimes under hitler shows that memories of the nazi period are still dominated by myths .
dw 's ramon garcia-ziemsen writes about how germany 's history was deliberately repressed . yes , it is shocking how german diplomats were complicit in the holocaust in the second world war , and how they were involved in its implementation .
it 's unbelievable how much continuity there was in the diplomatic personnel after 1945 in germany : men who had participated in the nazi extermination policies later made careers and protected each other , even before their involvement was made public .
but it 's just as incredible how long it has taken : that only now , 65 years on , this has come to the attention of the wider german public .
in 1979 , a book was published by a british historian about the participation of the foreign office in the so called " final solution , " the nazi description for the murder of european jews .
the book describes what the nature of the foreign office 's participation in the holocaust was , how deportation orders were signed there , how the office was a systematic element of the nazi killing machine .
and even back in the 1950s , there was clear evidence showing that the foreign office was certainly not a " school of passive resistance " against hitler , as it liked to present itself in the post-war period .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ramon garcia-ziemsen head of dw 's german culture department a lot was known , a lot was forgotten in short : much was known .
and almost everything was forgotten .
how the germans dealt with the third reich is not as exemplary as it has often been perceived around the world , it is also a history of forgetting and repressing .
the elites have often knowingly prevented a discussion about their past .
and the public allowed this discourse to be prevented .
how could this happen ? after 1945 , german society was always looking for the " good , " for the " other germany " - the " other germany " that had remained innocent , that had perhaps not been openly resistant , but did not allow itself to be sucked into nazi ideology ; which had remained resistant , which had rejected the nazi madness , and of which one might even be proud .
because it wanted a fresh start , the young germany did not think it could live with the weight of such a large feeling of guilt .
myths and collective guilt and in this way the yarn was spun : first came the myth that many germans had only found out about the holocaust in 1945 from the allies .
the myth was born that only a small group around hitler had known what had happened in concentration camps like auschwitz and dachau .
the germans were a nation led astray .
this position was also of course a reaction to the similarly blanket collective guilt theory purported by the allies after the war . then came the myth of the armed forces : that the soldiers had played almost no part in hitler 's atrocities - and besides that everything had been carried out under orders .
both theories were exposed by historians as false only decades later , from the 1970s , through studies , books and exhibitions .
large parts of the population knew not only why jewish friends and neighbors had suddenly disappeared , but they had also assisted with this disappearance .
soldiers took part in shooting jews - voluntarily and not under orders .
but again it took years and decades , well into the 1990s , until this knowledge resulted in a public debate and led to a real demystification . where the myth certainly still existed was in the foreign office , one of the last places where the fairy tale of the " other germany " could live on .
the solidarity of the diplomats worked so well and perhaps the respect for the future german president richard von weizsaecker was too great .
weizsaecker 's father ernst was a top diplomat , who supported the nazi ideology in the foreign office .
but germany 's longing for this " other germany " , which existed much less than most germans had thought , was also too great .

eurostar , which operates passenger trains through the channel tunnel recently ordered 10 new trains from siemens , in a deal which threatened to engulf france and germany in a protectionist row .
alstom , which also makes high-speed tgv trains , had been backed by france 's transport ministry in its claim that siemens trains ordered by eurostar do not comply with current safety standards set by the franco-british commission which regulates the tunnel .
the judge said alstom did not have a " serious case " and that granting a suspension " would be against the public interest . "
eurostar said it was pleased the matter had been resolved , adding that it always aimed to conduct a rigorous tender to select the best trains .
deutsche bahn , which plans to introduce services through the channel tunnel from 2013 , linking london directly with frankfurt and amsterdam , has also placed a 500-million-euro order with siemens for 15 new high-speed ice trains .

one british mp said london needs to do more to protect people 's privacy . it 's been a busy week for google lawyers in europe , as the california tech giant became the target of the legal wrath of italy and the united kingdom . prosecutors in rome on wednesday began an investigation against google for potential invasions of privacy in its street view online mapping service . italian authorities , like their counterparts in germany , spain , canada and elsewhere , are concerned that google acquired personal data including e-mails and passwords while " packet sniffing " on open wifi networks while photographing for the street view service . google has previously said that the data acquisition was accidental , and that it has taken measures to ensure that this kind of breach does not happen again . this legal move came as the italian data protection authority also announced more restrictions this week against google . " italian citizens will be informed of the presence of google cars taking pictures of places and individuals to be posted online via the street view service , " the italian privacy authority said in a statement on its website on monday . the authority added that google street view vehicles will have to be obvious to passers-by . " google cars will have to be clearly marked by means of visible stickers or signs to unambiguously signify that pictures are being taken for the purposes of street view , " it said in the statement . other conditions set by the italian authorities included requiring google list what neighborhoods its cars would photograph in local media ahead of time .
the italian dpa added that failure to comply with the new rules would carry a fine of up to 1,800 euros -lrb- $ 2,500 -rrb- . uk privacy investigation has been ' lily-livered ' bildunterschrift : states around the world are investigating google 's privacy policies thursday , in london , a parliamentary committee met to find out why the british government has not done more to investigate privacy concerns over the leaked wifi data situation . earlier this year , the british data protection authority , the information commissioner 's office , had said it had found no wrongdoing on google 's part , but on monday the office re-opened the case after google 's admitted acquiring more data than had been previously disclosed . " the uk information commissioner has been lily-livered , " robert halfon , a conservative parliamentarian , said during the committee hearing . " these corporations need to be taught that advancing the technological wonder that is the internet is one thing , " he added .
" trampling over the individual 's right to privacy is quite another . " american authorities at the federal trade commission on thursday announced that they dropped their inquiry into google 's potential privacy violation . author : cyrus farivar -lrb- afp , ap -rrb- editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but as andy valvur points out in this postcard , the conspiracy theorists have gone into overdrive . he was just a small town cephalopod , living quietly in an aquarium in oberhausen germany , entertaining children , moving languidly around his tank and generally being ignored .
but , this summer , it all changed and paul , as the octopus was called , became an international superstar by accurately picking the winners of all the games that the german world cup soccer team faced .
and , to finish it off , he accurately picked the winner of the entire world cup .
it all started innocently enough , when he correctly picked the winner of the first game .
people smiled , a lucky guess , said most .
then he picked the winner in the next game .
ah , another lucky guess .
but people took notice .
even better , the media took notice .
by the time he correctly picked the third game result , the media were in full frenzy , as only the media can .
suddenly , the sleepy little german town of oberhausen became media central .
satellite trucks sprouted like mushrooms around the aquarium .
interview requests poured in from around the world , but paul remained silent .
ok .
he ’ s an octopus and not known for his verbal skills , but he was now , as they say in hollywood , hot .
his streak continued , picking the winners of several more games .
when he picked germany to lose against spain , germans thought , well , now he ’ s going to fail , as germany was on a roll , and many thought it seemingly possible that germany might win the whole thing .
but , paul was not to be denied .
by picking spain over germany , there were calls for paul to made into a calamari dish or perhaps served up as sushi … .but aquarium officials demurred and increased security .
in the end , paul amazed everyone and correctly picked the winner of the world cup final between the netherlands and spain .
suddenly , everyone wanted a piece of paul .
rumors spread like wildfire .
it was reported that paul was spotted hanging with squid supermodels at sea world in san diego , california … .
other reports had him accepting a teaching job at woods hole oceanography institute .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dw 's andy valvur is waiting for paul 's return but the truth is that paul , even though he was born in england , had become quite german and decided that all the flash and hoopla were not for him .
he stayed in oberhausen , doing what he did best , languidly moving around a fish tank … seemingly oblivious to everything .
this week , the news that everyone dreaded , was released by aquarium officials in oberhausen .
paul was dead .
murder most foul ?
conspiracy theorists immediately suspected squid play ... i mean … foul play pointing to the rumors of beatle paul mccartney ’ s demise in the 70 ’ s .
their suspicions were fueled by reports that paul had been cremated .
no autopsy , no open casket , no official investigation .
other conspiracy theories suggested that paul was the subject of a mob hit , as his uncanny ability to pick winners was lowering the profits from illegal gambling .
another theory is that museum officials sold paul to a japanese sushi consortium , pointing to a website has that has blurry photos of an alleged sushi chef leaving the aquarium in oberhausen still another claim was that paul was just tired of all the attention , and in a late night dash , escaped from oberhausen to spend the rest of his days relaxing in the mediterranean .
museum officials have been tight lipped saying only that paul is dead .
a memorial has been set up in his tank complete with a replica of the world cup .
so ends a remarkable career .
and in life as in death , paul continues to be a lightning rod for publicity .
personally , i like the relaxing in the mediterranean theory the best .

there 's no need to question a perfectly reasonable on-the-nose prediction - at least not when it comes from afar .
another realm , in this case .
here dw sports forward the spooky ones ' predictions for match day ten . match day nine ’ s predictions saw the dw pundits increase their week-on-week total with six points .
not such a special tally , but one that included a surprising spot-on forecast of werder bremen 's 4-1 victory away to borussia moenchengladbach .
to fight the unsubstantiated and scurrilous accusations of match-fixing that have been swirling , dw 's experts are ready to come clean - the spirits made them do it .
they 're still under their control , in fact : here are their picks for week ten .
friday , oct .
29 bayern - freiburg few would have predicted freiburg being above bayern after nine games but the league table does n't lie .
bayern are suffering a crisis of confidence and fluidity in the bundesliga , while the freiburgers are just enjoying their early season ride .
robin dutt ’ s men have notched points against their mid-table rivals but have come unstuck against the better teams .
ordinarily bayern would be included in that latter category , but right now they 're adrift in mediocrity .
however , at home , with a partisan crowd expecting a return to the status quo , bayern should edge it .
prediction : bayern 2-1 saturday , oct .
30 bremen - nuremberg bremen have managed to steady their ship after a choppy start to the season and are unbeaten in five league games .
they still lie in eighth place but show signs of rediscovering the consistency which could see them climb the table .
but this is werder , remember , and nothing can be taken for granted .
they can win 4-1 one week and get thumped by the same scoreline the next .
nuremberg are experiencing the pendulum of form ; winning one week , losing the next .
if it continues to swing , after beating wolfsburg last week , then bremen should come out on top in this one .
prediction : bremen 3-0 wolfsburg - stuttgart bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : keller has got stuttgart winning again and out of danger jens keller is unbeaten as stuttgart coach after taking over from the sacked christian gross two weeks ago , and the four points his team has eked out in their last two league games have taken them out of the drop zone .
confidence is slowly coming back , boosted by recent europa league and dfb cup wins , and while it is still a nascent recovery , vfb do have some momentum at last .
wolfsburg , on the other hand , have lost theirs .
two defeats and a loss have put the skids under their own revival and coming into this match , stuttgart look to have the edge .
stuttgart : 1-0 cologne - hamburg the enigma that is hamburger sv continues to confound .
after an impressive start followed by a worrying slump , hsv are rebuilding their campaign by going three games unbeaten .
two wins and a goalless draw against bayern could have been seen as a solid base to push on , but their 5-2 cup hammering at the hands of frankfurt in midweek may have released old demons .
cologne , however , appear to have little in their locker which could inflict such a heavy defeat on hamburg - in fact , any kind of defeat looks unlikely .
the bottom club have a solitary win to their name and their second isn ’ t likely to come this weekend , even with the benefit of home advantage .
prediction : hamburg 2-0 kaiserslautern - moenchengladbach kaiserslautern 's last win - the impressive 2-0 defeat of bayern - seems a long time ago .
indeed since those heady days of august , when kaiserslautern notched two wins on the trot , all that has followed is a downward spiral of six reversals and a draw , leaving the red devils hovering perilously over the drop zone .
they got a welcome boost with a midweek cup win - but then again so did gladbach .
however , given that gladbach slipped to second-from-bottom after their sixth defeat of the season last weekend , little should be read into that .
these are two teams in deep , albeit it early , trouble .
their desperation may cancel each other out .
prediction : draw 2-2 st. pauli - frankfurt given they were afforded little chance of staying up this season , st- pauli 's current position in 10th could already be hailed as a triumph .
as long as they do n't start panicking that last week 's defeat to stuttgart and their slight tumble down the league is the start of their predicted demise , st. pauli have the guts to slog it out and remain in the bundesliga .
frankfurt sit a place above them on goal difference with an exact replica of the hamburg club 's record to date .
eintracht come into this game on the back of three wins and a draw so they will be up for it against pauli .
expect a gutsy battle .
prediction : draw 1-1 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : raul did n't expect to swap real madrid for a relegation fight schalke - leverkusen things still look desperate for schalke .
their only victory in the league this season , ground out against freiburg over a month ago , looks increasingly like a false dawn .
a defeat and three draws suggests little has been put right since .
their home form has been pitiful and leverkusen will certainly fancy their chances when they make the journey to gelsenkirchen on saturday .
leverkusen have had plenty of joy on their travels .
unbeaten in four away games with three wins and a draw , it appears to be advantage bayer .
schalke 's revival will have to wait at least another week .
prediction : leverkusen 3-2 sunday , oct .
31 mainz - dortmund halloween came early for dortmund in the dfb cup on wednesday .
instead of the treat they might have expected from a fixture against a third division side , they got tricked in a 4-2 loss on penalties at kickers offenbach .
bvb , who have been on fire in front of goal , will be wondering how they went 120 minutes without scoring and will be hoping they find they find the target ahead of this first-versus-second clash .
mainz , who returned to the summit last weekend , also lost in the cup to alemannia aachen so this game is primed for both teams to put their woes behind them .
dortmund will have the added incentive of going top if they win and could take heart from the fact that mainz 's only league defeat so far has come at home .
prediction : dortmund 3-1 hoffenheim - hanover bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hannover 's players are n't suffering from altitude sickness hanover continues to overachieve this season .
up to third after last week 's victory over cologne , they look to have put the brakes on the minor slide which affected them after losing to st. pauli at the start of october .
hoffenheim , meanwhile , are still challenging at the top end but their own push for the summit has suffered a few hiccups in recent weeks .
after three wins on the bounce at the start of the season , it took hoffenheim until two weeks ago to record their next .
keeping dortmund at bay in last week 's 1-1 draw suggests they 've found their balance again but hanover may edge this to keep their impressive campaign on track .

another theory is that museum officials sold paul to a japanese sushi consortium , pointing to a website has that has blurry photos of an alleged sushi chef leaving the aquarium in oberhausen still another claim was that paul was just tired of all the attention , and in a late night dash , escaped from oberhausen to spend the rest of his days relaxing in the mediterranean .
museum officials have been tight lipped saying only that paul is dead .
a memorial has been set up in his tank complete with a replica of the world cup .
so ends a remarkable career .
and in life as in death , paul continues to be a lightning rod for publicity .
personally , i like the relaxing in the mediterranean theory the best .

kfor has been in the territory for more than a decade . citing progress in the breakaway former serbian province , nato secretary general anders fogh rasmussen made the announcement in a statement released to the media on friday .
" the security conditions in kosovo continue to improve , which is a positive sign , not only for kosovo , but for the whole region , " the statement said .
rasmussen added that local institutions were increasingly capable of assuming responsibility for security tasks , and that the kosovo force -lrb- kfor -rrb- , which had already been reduced from 15,000 to 10,000 soldiers earlier this year , would continue to be a deterrent to violence .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the kosovo force is made up of soldiers from a dozen nations " kfor will remain able to deploy forces quickly and effectively whenever and wherever necessary , including with robust reserves .
kfor 's mission to guarantee a safe and secure environment in kosovo remains unchanged . "
the german commander of the nato forces in kosovo , major general erhard buehler , said the decision was taken " because the security situation is calm , " but he said kosovo 's serb-inhabited north remained an area of concern .
international peacekeeping forces arrived in kosovo in 1999 , following a 78-day nato bombing campaign to end a conflict between serbian forces and fighters from the ethnic albanian majority in what was then a province of serbia .
kosovo unilaterally declared independence from serbia in feb .
2008 , paving the way for a reduction in the number of peacekeepers , although ethnic tensions have persisted .
in recent weeks , belgrade , which refuses to recognize kosovo as an independent state , has also signaled a softening of its approach to kosovo , a move which was welcomed by nato .

dw 's ramon garcia-ziemsen writes about how germany 's history was deliberately repressed . yes , it is shocking how german diplomats were complicit in the holocaust in the second world war , and how they were involved in its implementation .
it 's unbelievable how much continuity there was in the diplomatic personnel after 1945 in germany : men who had participated in the nazi extermination policies later made careers and protected each other , even before their involvement was made public .
but it 's just as incredible how long it has taken : that only now , 65 years on , this has come to the attention of the wider german public .
in 1979 , a book was published by a british historian about the participation of the foreign office in the so called " final solution , " the nazi description for the murder of european jews .
the book describes what the nature of the foreign office 's participation in the holocaust was , how deportation orders were signed there , how the office was a systematic element of the nazi killing machine .
and even back in the 1950s , there was clear evidence showing that the foreign office was certainly not a " school of passive resistance " against hitler , as it liked to present itself in the post-war period .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ramon garcia-ziemsen head of dw 's german culture department a lot was known , a lot was forgotten in short : much was known .
and almost everything was forgotten .
how the germans dealt with the third reich is not as exemplary as it has often been perceived around the world , it is also a history of forgetting and repressing .
the elites have often knowingly prevented a discussion about their past .
and the public allowed this discourse to be prevented .
how could this happen ? after 1945 , german society was always looking for the " good , " for the " other germany " - the " other germany " that had remained innocent , that had perhaps not been openly resistant , but did not allow itself to be sucked into nazi ideology ; which had remained resistant , which had rejected the nazi madness , and of which one might even be proud .
because it wanted a fresh start , the young germany did not think it could live with the weight of such a large feeling of guilt .
myths and collective guilt and in this way the yarn was spun : first came the myth that many germans had only found out about the holocaust in 1945 from the allies .
the myth was born that only a small group around hitler had known what had happened in concentration camps like auschwitz and dachau .
the germans were a nation led astray .
this position was also of course a reaction to the similarly blanket collective guilt theory purported by the allies after the war . then came the myth of the armed forces : that the soldiers had played almost no part in hitler 's atrocities - and besides that everything had been carried out under orders .
both theories were exposed by historians as false only decades later , from the 1970s , through studies , books and exhibitions .
large parts of the population knew not only why jewish friends and neighbors had suddenly disappeared , but they had also assisted with this disappearance .
soldiers took part in shooting jews - voluntarily and not under orders .
but again it took years and decades , well into the 1990s , until this knowledge resulted in a public debate and led to a real demystification . where the myth certainly still existed was in the foreign office , one of the last places where the fairy tale of the " other germany " could live on .
the solidarity of the diplomats worked so well and perhaps the respect for the future german president richard von weizsaecker was too great .
weizsaecker 's father ernst was a top diplomat , who supported the nazi ideology in the foreign office .
but germany 's longing for this " other germany " , which existed much less than most germans had thought , was also too great .

but as andy valvur points out in this postcard , the conspiracy theorists have gone into overdrive . he was just a small town cephalopod , living quietly in an aquarium in oberhausen germany , entertaining children , moving languidly around his tank and generally being ignored .
but , this summer , it all changed and paul , as the octopus was called , became an international superstar by accurately picking the winners of all the games that the german world cup soccer team faced .
and , to finish it off , he accurately picked the winner of the entire world cup .
it all started innocently enough , when he correctly picked the winner of the first game .
people smiled , a lucky guess , said most .
then he picked the winner in the next game .
ah , another lucky guess .
but people took notice .
even better , the media took notice .
by the time he correctly picked the third game result , the media were in full frenzy , as only the media can .
suddenly , the sleepy little german town of oberhausen became media central .
satellite trucks sprouted like mushrooms around the aquarium .
interview requests poured in from around the world , but paul remained silent .
ok .
he ’ s an octopus and not known for his verbal skills , but he was now , as they say in hollywood , hot .
his streak continued , picking the winners of several more games .
when he picked germany to lose against spain , germans thought , well , now he ’ s going to fail , as germany was on a roll , and many thought it seemingly possible that germany might win the whole thing .
but , paul was not to be denied .
by picking spain over germany , there were calls for paul to made into a calamari dish or perhaps served up as sushi … .but aquarium officials demurred and increased security .
in the end , paul amazed everyone and correctly picked the winner of the world cup final between the netherlands and spain .
suddenly , everyone wanted a piece of paul .
rumors spread like wildfire .
it was reported that paul was spotted hanging with squid supermodels at sea world in san diego , california … .
other reports had him accepting a teaching job at woods hole oceanography institute .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dw 's andy valvur is waiting for paul 's return but the truth is that paul , even though he was born in england , had become quite german and decided that all the flash and hoopla were not for him .
he stayed in oberhausen , doing what he did best , languidly moving around a fish tank … seemingly oblivious to everything .
this week , the news that everyone dreaded , was released by aquarium officials in oberhausen .
paul was dead .
murder most foul ?
conspiracy theorists immediately suspected squid play ... i mean … foul play pointing to the rumors of beatle paul mccartney ’ s demise in the 70 ’ s .
their suspicions were fueled by reports that paul had been cremated .
no autopsy , no open casket , no official investigation .
other conspiracy theories suggested that paul was the subject of a mob hit , as his uncanny ability to pick winners was lowering the profits from illegal gambling .
another theory is that museum officials sold paul to a japanese sushi consortium , pointing to a website has that has blurry photos of an alleged sushi chef leaving the aquarium in oberhausen still another claim was that paul was just tired of all the attention , and in a late night dash , escaped from oberhausen to spend the rest of his days relaxing in the mediterranean .
museum officials have been tight lipped saying only that paul is dead .
a memorial has been set up in his tank complete with a replica of the world cup .
so ends a remarkable career .
and in life as in death , paul continues to be a lightning rod for publicity .
personally , i like the relaxing in the mediterranean theory the best .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 29.10.2010 merkel and sarkozy achieve only a minor success in brussels großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : did merkel undermine the eu deal by making a pact with france ?
a pre-summit deal between merkel and sarkozy on how to safeguard the euro annoyed many eu states .
deutsche welle 's brussels correspondent , christoph hasselbach , says that 's why so little progress was achieved . chancellor merkel pushed the right issues , but at this summit , at least , made little concrete progress .
it remains to be seen whether the december summit will in fact bring about the desired effect .
the reason for this lies not least in her advance talks with french president nicolas sarkozy .
through the “ deauville deal ” shortly before the summit , merkel managed to irritate almost everyone in the eu .
those who had supported automatic sanctions for budget sinners noted with horror that the german chancellor had given up on this central goal .
merkel also managed to stab the european commission in the back .
the commission had pursued this aim and , until the deauville conference , could be sure having the support of the germans .
in the end , even european council president herman van rompuy must have felt blindsided .
he was given the task of working out the details of the reforms , and even before he could present his results officially , germany and france declared they 'd already reached a decision .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche welle 's brussels correspondent , christoph hasselbach as a trade-off , merkel had secured assurances from sarkozy that france would echo the german demands for altering the lisbon treaty .
merkel experienced how little that promise was worth when she got to the summit .
rarely has such a wall of resistance built up , above all on the question of taking away voting rights .
this means that early on merkel threw away one of the most important methods of stabilizing the euro , and has - at least so far - has nothing to show for her trade-off .
whether the eu can agree on a so-called small amendment to the treaty by december , is not only down to france .
as far as taking away voting rights is concerned , merkel can forget it .
now she just says she wants to keep the item “ on the agenda ” .
it wo n't go beyond that .
it 's a different story when it comes to the permanent rescue mechanism for financially stricken states .
the participation of the private sectors is popular .
and the fear in the whole eurozone of the collapse of a member state could give the necessary pressure to get through moderate treaty amendments on this issue .
the strange thing is this : had merkel fought for automatic sanctions at the summit , and looked for allies on the issue , she may have saved herself and the whole eu some of the conflict over treaty changes .
because the stricter the disciplinary tools are before a financial crisis , the more unlikely it is , that the whole mechanism will need to be used at all .

dw-world.de partial victory for merkel at european union summit chancellor angela merkel was successful in her bid to get changes made to the european union 's main treaty , after eu leaders agreed in brussels to make " limited " amendments designed to keep budget deficits in check .
-lrb- 29.10.2010 -rrb- merkel defends german-french call for changes to eu treaty german chancellor angela merkel has reiterated her call for key changes to be made to the lisbon treaty at this week 's eu summit in brussels .

there 's no need to question a perfectly reasonable on-the-nose prediction - at least not when it comes from afar .
another realm , in this case .
here dw sports forward the spooky ones ' predictions for match day ten . match day nine ’ s predictions saw the dw pundits increase their week-on-week total with six points .
not such a special tally , but one that included a surprising spot-on forecast of werder bremen 's 4-1 victory away to borussia moenchengladbach .
to fight the unsubstantiated and scurrilous accusations of match-fixing that have been swirling , dw 's experts are ready to come clean - the spirits made them do it .
they 're still under their control , in fact : here are their picks for week ten .
friday , oct .
29 bayern - freiburg few would have predicted freiburg being above bayern after nine games but the league table does n't lie .
bayern are suffering a crisis of confidence and fluidity in the bundesliga , while the freiburgers are just enjoying their early season ride .
robin dutt ’ s men have notched points against their mid-table rivals but have come unstuck against the better teams .
ordinarily bayern would be included in that latter category , but right now they 're adrift in mediocrity .
however , at home , with a partisan crowd expecting a return to the status quo , bayern should edge it .
prediction : bayern 2-1 saturday , oct .
30 bremen - nuremberg bremen have managed to steady their ship after a choppy start to the season and are unbeaten in five league games .
they still lie in eighth place but show signs of rediscovering the consistency which could see them climb the table .
but this is werder , remember , and nothing can be taken for granted .
they can win 4-1 one week and get thumped by the same scoreline the next .
nuremberg are experiencing the pendulum of form ; winning one week , losing the next .
if it continues to swing , after beating wolfsburg last week , then bremen should come out on top in this one .
prediction : bremen 3-0 wolfsburg - stuttgart bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : keller has got stuttgart winning again and out of danger jens keller is unbeaten as stuttgart coach after taking over from the sacked christian gross two weeks ago , and the four points his team has eked out in their last two league games have taken them out of the drop zone .
confidence is slowly coming back , boosted by recent europa league and dfb cup wins , and while it is still a nascent recovery , vfb do have some momentum at last .
wolfsburg , on the other hand , have lost theirs .
two defeats and a loss have put the skids under their own revival and coming into this match , stuttgart look to have the edge .
stuttgart : 1-0 cologne - hamburg the enigma that is hamburger sv continues to confound .
after an impressive start followed by a worrying slump , hsv are rebuilding their campaign by going three games unbeaten .
two wins and a goalless draw against bayern could have been seen as a solid base to push on , but their 5-2 cup hammering at the hands of frankfurt in midweek may have released old demons .
cologne , however , appear to have little in their locker which could inflict such a heavy defeat on hamburg - in fact , any kind of defeat looks unlikely .
the bottom club have a solitary win to their name and their second isn ’ t likely to come this weekend , even with the benefit of home advantage .
prediction : hamburg 2-0 kaiserslautern - moenchengladbach kaiserslautern 's last win - the impressive 2-0 defeat of bayern - seems a long time ago .
indeed since those heady days of august , when kaiserslautern notched two wins on the trot , all that has followed is a downward spiral of six reversals and a draw , leaving the red devils hovering perilously over the drop zone .
they got a welcome boost with a midweek cup win - but then again so did gladbach .
however , given that gladbach slipped to second-from-bottom after their sixth defeat of the season last weekend , little should be read into that .
these are two teams in deep , albeit it early , trouble .
their desperation may cancel each other out .
prediction : draw 2-2 st. pauli - frankfurt given they were afforded little chance of staying up this season , st- pauli 's current position in 10th could already be hailed as a triumph .
as long as they do n't start panicking that last week 's defeat to stuttgart and their slight tumble down the league is the start of their predicted demise , st. pauli have the guts to slog it out and remain in the bundesliga .
frankfurt sit a place above them on goal difference with an exact replica of the hamburg club 's record to date .
eintracht come into this game on the back of three wins and a draw so they will be up for it against pauli .
expect a gutsy battle .
prediction : draw 1-1 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : raul did n't expect to swap real madrid for a relegation fight schalke - leverkusen things still look desperate for schalke .
their only victory in the league this season , ground out against freiburg over a month ago , looks increasingly like a false dawn .
a defeat and three draws suggests little has been put right since .
their home form has been pitiful and leverkusen will certainly fancy their chances when they make the journey to gelsenkirchen on saturday .
leverkusen have had plenty of joy on their travels .
unbeaten in four away games with three wins and a draw , it appears to be advantage bayer .
schalke 's revival will have to wait at least another week .
prediction : leverkusen 3-2 sunday , oct .
31 mainz - dortmund halloween came early for dortmund in the dfb cup on wednesday .
instead of the treat they might have expected from a fixture against a third division side , they got tricked in a 4-2 loss on penalties at kickers offenbach .
bvb , who have been on fire in front of goal , will be wondering how they went 120 minutes without scoring and will be hoping they find they find the target ahead of this first-versus-second clash .
mainz , who returned to the summit last weekend , also lost in the cup to alemannia aachen so this game is primed for both teams to put their woes behind them .
dortmund will have the added incentive of going top if they win and could take heart from the fact that mainz 's only league defeat so far has come at home .
prediction : dortmund 3-1 hoffenheim - hanover bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hannover 's players are n't suffering from altitude sickness hanover continues to overachieve this season .
up to third after last week 's victory over cologne , they look to have put the brakes on the minor slide which affected them after losing to st. pauli at the start of october .
hoffenheim , meanwhile , are still challenging at the top end but their own push for the summit has suffered a few hiccups in recent weeks .
after three wins on the bounce at the start of the season , it took hoffenheim until two weeks ago to record their next .
keeping dortmund at bay in last week 's 1-1 draw suggests they 've found their balance again but hanover may edge this to keep their impressive campaign on track .

eurostar , which operates passenger trains through the channel tunnel recently ordered 10 new trains from siemens , in a deal which threatened to engulf france and germany in a protectionist row .
alstom , which also makes high-speed tgv trains , had been backed by france 's transport ministry in its claim that siemens trains ordered by eurostar do not comply with current safety standards set by the franco-british commission which regulates the tunnel .
the judge said alstom did not have a " serious case " and that granting a suspension " would be against the public interest . "
eurostar said it was pleased the matter had been resolved , adding that it always aimed to conduct a rigorous tender to select the best trains .
deutsche bahn , which plans to introduce services through the channel tunnel from 2013 , linking london directly with frankfurt and amsterdam , has also placed a 500-million-euro order with siemens for 15 new high-speed ice trains .

however , the outcome might well have an impact on washington 's relations with the rest of the world . when american voters head to the polls to elect a new house of representatives and 37 new senators , there is perhaps nothing that sums up their sentiment better than the old adage from bill clinton 's 1992 presidential campaign : " it 's the economy , stupid . " and with unemployment hovering at close to 10 percent , a collapsed housing market and a stuttering economy , there certainly is ample reason for voters to worry about their personal well-being . to be sure , there are definitely enough foreign policy issues that would merit the electorate 's attention too : a war in afghanistan , now in its ninth year , which is not going well , a tense situation in the middle east with us-sponsored negotiations between israelis and palestinians always on the verge of collapse , iran 's alleged efforts to acquire nuclear weapons still unresolved and north korea in the middle of a leadership handover .
but all of that does n't really matter , says thomas e. mann , a congressional scholar at the brookings institution in washington : " for the most part the public is so distressed and pessimistic about the economy that that is what 's dominating the campaigns , " he told deutsche welle . international issues on the sidelines the only way foreign policy gets any traction as an election topic is when it relates to a domestic issue , adds mann .
china , for example , plays a role in certain campaigns when trade issues or the currency imbalances are discussed .
and mexico is addressed when illegal immigration and its effect on the economy is debated .
other than that , domestic issues , especially the economy , dominate the midterm elections almost completely .

however , the outcome might well have an impact on washington 's relations with the rest of the world . when american voters head to the polls to elect a new house of representatives and 37 new senators , there is perhaps nothing that sums up their sentiment better than the old adage from bill clinton 's 1992 presidential campaign : " it 's the economy , stupid . " and with unemployment hovering at close to 10 percent , a collapsed housing market and a stuttering economy , there certainly is ample reason for voters to worry about their personal well-being . to be sure , there are definitely enough foreign policy issues that would merit the electorate 's attention too : a war in afghanistan , now in its ninth year , which is not going well , a tense situation in the middle east with us-sponsored negotiations between israelis and palestinians always on the verge of collapse , iran 's alleged efforts to acquire nuclear weapons still unresolved and north korea in the middle of a leadership handover .
but all of that does n't really matter , says thomas e. mann , a congressional scholar at the brookings institution in washington : " for the most part the public is so distressed and pessimistic about the economy that that is what 's dominating the campaigns , " he told deutsche welle . international issues on the sidelines the only way foreign policy gets any traction as an election topic is when it relates to a domestic issue , adds mann .
china , for example , plays a role in certain campaigns when trade issues or the currency imbalances are discussed .
and mexico is addressed when illegal immigration and its effect on the economy is debated .
other than that , domestic issues , especially the economy , dominate the midterm elections almost completely .

but now the eu wants to make patent protection easier and less expensive for the bloc 's inventors . the economic crisis has n't put european companies and independent inventors off investing into research and development .
judged by the some 60,000 patents issued so far this year in germany , the country 's is on track to meet 2009 's total . " companies followed experts ' advice and continued investing in new products - even though we were in the middle of a crisis , " bettina berner of the german patent and trade mark office -lrb- dpma -rrb- said on thursday at the opening ceremony of the 62nd edition of the inventors ' trade fair iena in nuremberg . hoping for a break through bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some 800 products , like an unpoppable tire , are on display at the iena trade fair inventors from 37 countries are currently presenting some 800 new products at the fair , which the organizers said is the largest of its kind in the world . rollerblades , the folding bicycle and inflatable water wings are some of products that went on to conquer the world after being presented in nuremberg .
like their successful predecessors , many inventors at this year 's fair are hoping for break-through deals with the industry so their products can be mass-produced . shaky hands ?
no problem ! bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the willomat tray lets the clumsy wait tables - without worrying guests bernhard haehnsen is one such inventor .
the former ship 's captain grew tired moping up after glasses spilled their contents as his ship pitched on the high seas .
his neighbor barbara willomat designed a way to stabilize glasses and cups on trays .
special suction cups which can be fixed on a tray hold retainers in different shapes and sizes . " when you 're carrying beer glasses on a tray across wobbly grass in a beer garden , the glasses break easily if you do n't attach them , " haehnsen said , adding that the willomat tray could also facilitate work in hospitals and help anyone with shaky hands . register first , then show it bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moreau 's idea came when he saw a report about delayed flights other products on display at iena this year include a foldable chair attached to a suitcase , invented by 12-year-old johannes von moreau , and a remote control for model sports cars which can be used with one hand rather than two . the two inventors kevin hummel and nicolas rathauser have registered their product with the munich-based german patent office -lrb- dpma -rrb- already .
that 's a step experts strongly recommend . " many independent inventors do n't have their products registered before they present them at a trade fair , " said dpma spokesperson berner . lengthy , costly patent process but inventors who want to protect their product in more than one european country currently have to undergo a tedious and costly process that begins with registration at the european patent office . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : inventors register their products here : the european patent office in munich " you have to decide in how many countries you want to have your patent validated , " heinrich dornbusch , a consultant with german patent marketing agency provendis , told deutsche welle .
" currently you have to do that separately in every single member state .
this means you have to invest a lot of time and money . " the costs for registering a product in 13 of the eu 's 27 countries , for instance , can easily amount to more than 20,000 euros -lrb- $ 28,000 -rrb- - 10 times the cost of a patent in the united states , according to dornbusch three languages sufficient the laborious validation process needs simplification , said stefaan de rynck from the internal market and services division at the european commission . " we want to get rid of the procedure where you have to translate a patent into all languages in order for it to be valid , " he told deutsche welle .
" patents should be valid across the eu if they are in english , french or german . " this would considerably lower registration costs as the largest part currently goes into translating the relevant documents into the individual countries ' languages . authors : nina haase , brigitta moll -lrb- dpa , ap -rrb- editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

eurostar , which operates passenger trains through the channel tunnel recently ordered 10 new trains from siemens , in a deal which threatened to engulf france and germany in a protectionist row .
alstom , which also makes high-speed tgv trains , had been backed by france 's transport ministry in its claim that siemens trains ordered by eurostar do not comply with current safety standards set by the franco-british commission which regulates the tunnel .
the judge said alstom did not have a " serious case " and that granting a suspension " would be against the public interest . "
eurostar said it was pleased the matter had been resolved , adding that it always aimed to conduct a rigorous tender to select the best trains .
deutsche bahn , which plans to introduce services through the channel tunnel from 2013 , linking london directly with frankfurt and amsterdam , has also placed a 500-million-euro order with siemens for 15 new high-speed ice trains .

there 's no need to question a perfectly reasonable on-the-nose prediction - at least not when it comes from afar .
another realm , in this case .
here dw sports forward the spooky ones ' predictions for match day ten . match day nine ’ s predictions saw the dw pundits increase their week-on-week total with six points .
not such a special tally , but one that included a surprising spot-on forecast of werder bremen 's 4-1 victory away to borussia moenchengladbach .
to fight the unsubstantiated and scurrilous accusations of match-fixing that have been swirling , dw 's experts are ready to come clean - the spirits made them do it .
they 're still under their control , in fact : here are their picks for week ten .
friday , oct .
29 bayern - freiburg few would have predicted freiburg being above bayern after nine games but the league table does n't lie .
bayern are suffering a crisis of confidence and fluidity in the bundesliga , while the freiburgers are just enjoying their early season ride .
robin dutt ’ s men have notched points against their mid-table rivals but have come unstuck against the better teams .
ordinarily bayern would be included in that latter category , but right now they 're adrift in mediocrity .
however , at home , with a partisan crowd expecting a return to the status quo , bayern should edge it .
prediction : bayern 2-1 saturday , oct .
30 bremen - nuremberg bremen have managed to steady their ship after a choppy start to the season and are unbeaten in five league games .
they still lie in eighth place but show signs of rediscovering the consistency which could see them climb the table .
but this is werder , remember , and nothing can be taken for granted .
they can win 4-1 one week and get thumped by the same scoreline the next .
nuremberg are experiencing the pendulum of form ; winning one week , losing the next .
if it continues to swing , after beating wolfsburg last week , then bremen should come out on top in this one .
prediction : bremen 3-0 wolfsburg - stuttgart bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : keller has got stuttgart winning again and out of danger jens keller is unbeaten as stuttgart coach after taking over from the sacked christian gross two weeks ago , and the four points his team has eked out in their last two league games have taken them out of the drop zone .
confidence is slowly coming back , boosted by recent europa league and dfb cup wins , and while it is still a nascent recovery , vfb do have some momentum at last .
wolfsburg , on the other hand , have lost theirs .
two defeats and a loss have put the skids under their own revival and coming into this match , stuttgart look to have the edge .
stuttgart : 1-0 cologne - hamburg the enigma that is hamburger sv continues to confound .
after an impressive start followed by a worrying slump , hsv are rebuilding their campaign by going three games unbeaten .
two wins and a goalless draw against bayern could have been seen as a solid base to push on , but their 5-2 cup hammering at the hands of frankfurt in midweek may have released old demons .
cologne , however , appear to have little in their locker which could inflict such a heavy defeat on hamburg - in fact , any kind of defeat looks unlikely .
the bottom club have a solitary win to their name and their second isn ’ t likely to come this weekend , even with the benefit of home advantage .
prediction : hamburg 2-0 kaiserslautern - moenchengladbach kaiserslautern 's last win - the impressive 2-0 defeat of bayern - seems a long time ago .
indeed since those heady days of august , when kaiserslautern notched two wins on the trot , all that has followed is a downward spiral of six reversals and a draw , leaving the red devils hovering perilously over the drop zone .
they got a welcome boost with a midweek cup win - but then again so did gladbach .
however , given that gladbach slipped to second-from-bottom after their sixth defeat of the season last weekend , little should be read into that .
these are two teams in deep , albeit it early , trouble .
their desperation may cancel each other out .
prediction : draw 2-2 st. pauli - frankfurt given they were afforded little chance of staying up this season , st- pauli 's current position in 10th could already be hailed as a triumph .
as long as they do n't start panicking that last week 's defeat to stuttgart and their slight tumble down the league is the start of their predicted demise , st. pauli have the guts to slog it out and remain in the bundesliga .
frankfurt sit a place above them on goal difference with an exact replica of the hamburg club 's record to date .
eintracht come into this game on the back of three wins and a draw so they will be up for it against pauli .
expect a gutsy battle .
prediction : draw 1-1 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : raul did n't expect to swap real madrid for a relegation fight schalke - leverkusen things still look desperate for schalke .
their only victory in the league this season , ground out against freiburg over a month ago , looks increasingly like a false dawn .
a defeat and three draws suggests little has been put right since .
their home form has been pitiful and leverkusen will certainly fancy their chances when they make the journey to gelsenkirchen on saturday .
leverkusen have had plenty of joy on their travels .
unbeaten in four away games with three wins and a draw , it appears to be advantage bayer .
schalke 's revival will have to wait at least another week .
prediction : leverkusen 3-2 sunday , oct .
31 mainz - dortmund halloween came early for dortmund in the dfb cup on wednesday .
instead of the treat they might have expected from a fixture against a third division side , they got tricked in a 4-2 loss on penalties at kickers offenbach .
bvb , who have been on fire in front of goal , will be wondering how they went 120 minutes without scoring and will be hoping they find they find the target ahead of this first-versus-second clash .
mainz , who returned to the summit last weekend , also lost in the cup to alemannia aachen so this game is primed for both teams to put their woes behind them .
dortmund will have the added incentive of going top if they win and could take heart from the fact that mainz 's only league defeat so far has come at home .
prediction : dortmund 3-1 hoffenheim - hanover bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hannover 's players are n't suffering from altitude sickness hanover continues to overachieve this season .
up to third after last week 's victory over cologne , they look to have put the brakes on the minor slide which affected them after losing to st. pauli at the start of october .
hoffenheim , meanwhile , are still challenging at the top end but their own push for the summit has suffered a few hiccups in recent weeks .
after three wins on the bounce at the start of the season , it took hoffenheim until two weeks ago to record their next .
keeping dortmund at bay in last week 's 1-1 draw suggests they 've found their balance again but hanover may edge this to keep their impressive campaign on track .

kfor has been in the territory for more than a decade . citing progress in the breakaway former serbian province , nato secretary general anders fogh rasmussen made the announcement in a statement released to the media on friday .
" the security conditions in kosovo continue to improve , which is a positive sign , not only for kosovo , but for the whole region , " the statement said .
rasmussen added that local institutions were increasingly capable of assuming responsibility for security tasks , and that the kosovo force -lrb- kfor -rrb- , which had already been reduced from 15,000 to 10,000 soldiers earlier this year , would continue to be a deterrent to violence .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the kosovo force is made up of soldiers from a dozen nations " kfor will remain able to deploy forces quickly and effectively whenever and wherever necessary , including with robust reserves .
kfor 's mission to guarantee a safe and secure environment in kosovo remains unchanged . "
the german commander of the nato forces in kosovo , major general erhard buehler , said the decision was taken " because the security situation is calm , " but he said kosovo 's serb-inhabited north remained an area of concern .
international peacekeeping forces arrived in kosovo in 1999 , following a 78-day nato bombing campaign to end a conflict between serbian forces and fighters from the ethnic albanian majority in what was then a province of serbia .
kosovo unilaterally declared independence from serbia in feb .
2008 , paving the way for a reduction in the number of peacekeepers , although ethnic tensions have persisted .
in recent weeks , belgrade , which refuses to recognize kosovo as an independent state , has also signaled a softening of its approach to kosovo , a move which was welcomed by nato .

but now the eu wants to make patent protection easier and less expensive for the bloc 's inventors . the economic crisis has n't put european companies and independent inventors off investing into research and development .
judged by the some 60,000 patents issued so far this year in germany , the country 's is on track to meet 2009 's total . " companies followed experts ' advice and continued investing in new products - even though we were in the middle of a crisis , " bettina berner of the german patent and trade mark office -lrb- dpma -rrb- said on thursday at the opening ceremony of the 62nd edition of the inventors ' trade fair iena in nuremberg . hoping for a break through bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some 800 products , like an unpoppable tire , are on display at the iena trade fair inventors from 37 countries are currently presenting some 800 new products at the fair , which the organizers said is the largest of its kind in the world . rollerblades , the folding bicycle and inflatable water wings are some of products that went on to conquer the world after being presented in nuremberg .
like their successful predecessors , many inventors at this year 's fair are hoping for break-through deals with the industry so their products can be mass-produced . shaky hands ?
no problem ! bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the willomat tray lets the clumsy wait tables - without worrying guests bernhard haehnsen is one such inventor .
the former ship 's captain grew tired moping up after glasses spilled their contents as his ship pitched on the high seas .
his neighbor barbara willomat designed a way to stabilize glasses and cups on trays .
special suction cups which can be fixed on a tray hold retainers in different shapes and sizes . " when you 're carrying beer glasses on a tray across wobbly grass in a beer garden , the glasses break easily if you do n't attach them , " haehnsen said , adding that the willomat tray could also facilitate work in hospitals and help anyone with shaky hands . register first , then show it bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moreau 's idea came when he saw a report about delayed flights other products on display at iena this year include a foldable chair attached to a suitcase , invented by 12-year-old johannes von moreau , and a remote control for model sports cars which can be used with one hand rather than two . the two inventors kevin hummel and nicolas rathauser have registered their product with the munich-based german patent office -lrb- dpma -rrb- already .
that 's a step experts strongly recommend . " many independent inventors do n't have their products registered before they present them at a trade fair , " said dpma spokesperson berner . lengthy , costly patent process but inventors who want to protect their product in more than one european country currently have to undergo a tedious and costly process that begins with registration at the european patent office . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : inventors register their products here : the european patent office in munich " you have to decide in how many countries you want to have your patent validated , " heinrich dornbusch , a consultant with german patent marketing agency provendis , told deutsche welle .
" currently you have to do that separately in every single member state .
this means you have to invest a lot of time and money . " the costs for registering a product in 13 of the eu 's 27 countries , for instance , can easily amount to more than 20,000 euros -lrb- $ 28,000 -rrb- - 10 times the cost of a patent in the united states , according to dornbusch three languages sufficient the laborious validation process needs simplification , said stefaan de rynck from the internal market and services division at the european commission . " we want to get rid of the procedure where you have to translate a patent into all languages in order for it to be valid , " he told deutsche welle .
" patents should be valid across the eu if they are in english , french or german . " this would considerably lower registration costs as the largest part currently goes into translating the relevant documents into the individual countries ' languages . authors : nina haase , brigitta moll -lrb- dpa , ap -rrb- editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but as andy valvur points out in this postcard , the conspiracy theorists have gone into overdrive . he was just a small town cephalopod , living quietly in an aquarium in oberhausen germany , entertaining children , moving languidly around his tank and generally being ignored .
but , this summer , it all changed and paul , as the octopus was called , became an international superstar by accurately picking the winners of all the games that the german world cup soccer team faced .
and , to finish it off , he accurately picked the winner of the entire world cup .
it all started innocently enough , when he correctly picked the winner of the first game .
people smiled , a lucky guess , said most .
then he picked the winner in the next game .
ah , another lucky guess .
but people took notice .
even better , the media took notice .
by the time he correctly picked the third game result , the media were in full frenzy , as only the media can .
suddenly , the sleepy little german town of oberhausen became media central .
satellite trucks sprouted like mushrooms around the aquarium .
interview requests poured in from around the world , but paul remained silent .
ok .
he ’ s an octopus and not known for his verbal skills , but he was now , as they say in hollywood , hot .
his streak continued , picking the winners of several more games .
when he picked germany to lose against spain , germans thought , well , now he ’ s going to fail , as germany was on a roll , and many thought it seemingly possible that germany might win the whole thing .
but , paul was not to be denied .
by picking spain over germany , there were calls for paul to made into a calamari dish or perhaps served up as sushi … .but aquarium officials demurred and increased security .
in the end , paul amazed everyone and correctly picked the winner of the world cup final between the netherlands and spain .
suddenly , everyone wanted a piece of paul .
rumors spread like wildfire .
it was reported that paul was spotted hanging with squid supermodels at sea world in san diego , california … .
other reports had him accepting a teaching job at woods hole oceanography institute .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dw 's andy valvur is waiting for paul 's return but the truth is that paul , even though he was born in england , had become quite german and decided that all the flash and hoopla were not for him .
he stayed in oberhausen , doing what he did best , languidly moving around a fish tank … seemingly oblivious to everything .
this week , the news that everyone dreaded , was released by aquarium officials in oberhausen .
paul was dead .
murder most foul ?
conspiracy theorists immediately suspected squid play ... i mean … foul play pointing to the rumors of beatle paul mccartney ’ s demise in the 70 ’ s .
their suspicions were fueled by reports that paul had been cremated .
no autopsy , no open casket , no official investigation .
other conspiracy theories suggested that paul was the subject of a mob hit , as his uncanny ability to pick winners was lowering the profits from illegal gambling .
another theory is that museum officials sold paul to a japanese sushi consortium , pointing to a website has that has blurry photos of an alleged sushi chef leaving the aquarium in oberhausen still another claim was that paul was just tired of all the attention , and in a late night dash , escaped from oberhausen to spend the rest of his days relaxing in the mediterranean .
museum officials have been tight lipped saying only that paul is dead .
a memorial has been set up in his tank complete with a replica of the world cup .
so ends a remarkable career .
and in life as in death , paul continues to be a lightning rod for publicity .
personally , i like the relaxing in the mediterranean theory the best .

one british mp said london needs to do more to protect people 's privacy . it 's been a busy week for google lawyers in europe , as the california tech giant became the target of the legal wrath of italy and the united kingdom . prosecutors in rome on wednesday began an investigation against google for potential invasions of privacy in its street view online mapping service . italian authorities , like their counterparts in germany , spain , canada and elsewhere , are concerned that google acquired personal data including e-mails and passwords while " packet sniffing " on open wifi networks while photographing for the street view service . google has previously said that the data acquisition was accidental , and that it has taken measures to ensure that this kind of breach does not happen again . this legal move came as the italian data protection authority also announced more restrictions this week against google . " italian citizens will be informed of the presence of google cars taking pictures of places and individuals to be posted online via the street view service , " the italian privacy authority said in a statement on its website on monday . the authority added that google street view vehicles will have to be obvious to passers-by . " google cars will have to be clearly marked by means of visible stickers or signs to unambiguously signify that pictures are being taken for the purposes of street view , " it said in the statement . other conditions set by the italian authorities included requiring google list what neighborhoods its cars would photograph in local media ahead of time .
the italian dpa added that failure to comply with the new rules would carry a fine of up to 1,800 euros -lrb- $ 2,500 -rrb- . uk privacy investigation has been ' lily-livered ' bildunterschrift : states around the world are investigating google 's privacy policies thursday , in london , a parliamentary committee met to find out why the british government has not done more to investigate privacy concerns over the leaked wifi data situation . earlier this year , the british data protection authority , the information commissioner 's office , had said it had found no wrongdoing on google 's part , but on monday the office re-opened the case after google 's admitted acquiring more data than had been previously disclosed . " the uk information commissioner has been lily-livered , " robert halfon , a conservative parliamentarian , said during the committee hearing . " these corporations need to be taught that advancing the technological wonder that is the internet is one thing , " he added .
" trampling over the individual 's right to privacy is quite another .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de integration -pipe- 29.10.2010 greens propose simplified citizenship laws for retired immigrants großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the proposal would make becoming a citizen easier for some good german is required to get german citizenship .
one lawmaker says it 's time to do long-term immigrants a favor and loosen up that rule . new legislation introduced in the german parliament could allow certain groups to get a german passport more easily and quickly , as well as granting more people the right to hold dual citizenship .
currently , immigrants who want to get german citizenship must take a naturalization test and show that they have a firm grasp of the language .
in addition , they generally have to renounce their previous citizenship .
pensioners who came to the country as immigrants are one of the groups that would benefit most from a change to the law .
if the bill were passed , a person who is over 53 years old and has been living in germany for at least 15 years could apply for a passport without meeting the language requirements .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kilic wants to see an immigrant 's work rewarded " if a person has made a contribution to this society , i want to make it easier for them to become citizens , " green party parliamentarian memet kilic told deutsche welle .
" especially older immigrants - who gave their youth and health to build up this country - should be able to obtain citizenship without a language requirement .
that way , we can win the hearts of their children and grandchildren for this country . "
integration conversation kilic 's bill comes as the integration of immigrants is under the microscope in germany .
chancellor angela merkel , a christian democrat , said earlier this month that multiculturalism had failed in germany .
there have also been repeated calls for immigrants to integrate better into german society by learning the language and customs .
kilic , who was born in turkey , said the legislation he sponsored would be welcome news to immigrants .
" third-generation immigrant children in germany hear three times a day that they do n't belong to this country , " he said .
" what good is that ?
i want to turn the tables . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : integration is hard to define in germany in support of the bill , kilic cited statistics showing that the number of citizens naturalized in germany each year had fallen by 20 percent since 2004 .
this was an indication that becoming a german citizen was simply too difficult , he said .
without citizenship , many of germany 's 6.7 million immigrants do not have the right to vote in the country .
but citizenship goes beyond the legal realm .
" integration means more than simply structural integration , " said guelistan guerbey , a political scientist at berlin 's free university .
" it has a very strong emotional and psychological dimension . "
this is especially true for dual citizens .
if the bill became law , an immigrant would no longer have to give up their passport to become german .
guerbey said this would have a positive effect .
" a person has emotional ties in both directions , " she said , " and dual citizenship is a legal recognition of this emotional state . "
time to learn german but while legal benefits and emotional satisfaction might encourage a retired immigrant with less-than-perfect german to apply for citizenship under the loosened rules of the proposed law , they may never get the chance .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : learning german is essential for integration , says grindel on thursday in the bundestag , reinhard grindel of the governing christian democrats , was clear about what his party thought of the proposal .
" when someone wants to become a german citizen , " grindel said , " then i have to be able to say , as an incentive , that you must learn german if you have n't learned it well enough already .
that 's a part of the integration process - to finally learn german . "
and there is reason to believe that many retired immigrants in germany would n't apply for a german passport if the rules were loosened .
some come from other european union countries , where moving across borders is n't problematic , though they do not have full voting rights in germany .
but kilic says there are some 2,000-3,000 retirees from other countries who would gladly take advantage of the opportunity .

but as andy valvur points out in this postcard , the conspiracy theorists have gone into overdrive . he was just a small town cephalopod , living quietly in an aquarium in oberhausen germany , entertaining children , moving languidly around his tank and generally being ignored .
but , this summer , it all changed and paul , as the octopus was called , became an international superstar by accurately picking the winners of all the games that the german world cup soccer team faced .
and , to finish it off , he accurately picked the winner of the entire world cup .
it all started innocently enough , when he correctly picked the winner of the first game .
people smiled , a lucky guess , said most .
then he picked the winner in the next game .
ah , another lucky guess .
but people took notice .
even better , the media took notice .
by the time he correctly picked the third game result , the media were in full frenzy , as only the media can .
suddenly , the sleepy little german town of oberhausen became media central .
satellite trucks sprouted like mushrooms around the aquarium .
interview requests poured in from around the world , but paul remained silent .
ok .
he ’ s an octopus and not known for his verbal skills , but he was now , as they say in hollywood , hot .
his streak continued , picking the winners of several more games .
when he picked germany to lose against spain , germans thought , well , now he ’ s going to fail , as germany was on a roll , and many thought it seemingly possible that germany might win the whole thing .
but , paul was not to be denied .
by picking spain over germany , there were calls for paul to made into a calamari dish or perhaps served up as sushi … .but aquarium officials demurred and increased security .
in the end , paul amazed everyone and correctly picked the winner of the world cup final between the netherlands and spain .
suddenly , everyone wanted a piece of paul .
rumors spread like wildfire .
it was reported that paul was spotted hanging with squid supermodels at sea world in san diego , california … .
other reports had him accepting a teaching job at woods hole oceanography institute .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dw 's andy valvur is waiting for paul 's return but the truth is that paul , even though he was born in england , had become quite german and decided that all the flash and hoopla were not for him .
he stayed in oberhausen , doing what he did best , languidly moving around a fish tank … seemingly oblivious to everything .
this week , the news that everyone dreaded , was released by aquarium officials in oberhausen .
paul was dead .
murder most foul ?
conspiracy theorists immediately suspected squid play ... i mean … foul play pointing to the rumors of beatle paul mccartney ’ s demise in the 70 ’ s .
their suspicions were fueled by reports that paul had been cremated .
no autopsy , no open casket , no official investigation .
other conspiracy theories suggested that paul was the subject of a mob hit , as his uncanny ability to pick winners was lowering the profits from illegal gambling .
another theory is that museum officials sold paul to a japanese sushi consortium , pointing to a website has that has blurry photos of an alleged sushi chef leaving the aquarium in oberhausen still another claim was that paul was just tired of all the attention , and in a late night dash , escaped from oberhausen to spend the rest of his days relaxing in the mediterranean .
museum officials have been tight lipped saying only that paul is dead .
a memorial has been set up in his tank complete with a replica of the world cup .

a pre-summit deal between merkel and sarkozy on how to safeguard the euro annoyed many eu states .
deutsche welle 's brussels correspondent , christoph hasselbach , says that 's why so little progress was achieved . chancellor merkel pushed the right issues , but at this summit , at least , made little concrete progress .
it remains to be seen whether the december summit will in fact bring about the desired effect .
the reason for this lies not least in her advance talks with french president nicolas sarkozy .
through the “ deauville deal ” shortly before the summit , merkel managed to irritate almost everyone in the eu .
those who had supported automatic sanctions for budget sinners noted with horror that the german chancellor had given up on this central goal .
merkel also managed to stab the european commission in the back .
the commission had pursued this aim and , until the deauville conference , could be sure having the support of the germans .
in the end , even european council president herman van rompuy must have felt blindsided .
he was given the task of working out the details of the reforms , and even before he could present his results officially , germany and france declared they 'd already reached a decision .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche welle 's brussels correspondent , christoph hasselbach as a trade-off , merkel had secured assurances from sarkozy that france would echo the german demands for altering the lisbon treaty .
merkel experienced how little that promise was worth when she got to the summit .
rarely has such a wall of resistance built up , above all on the question of taking away voting rights .
this means that early on merkel threw away one of the most important methods of stabilizing the euro , and has - at least so far - has nothing to show for her trade-off .
whether the eu can agree on a so-called small amendment to the treaty by december , is not only down to france .
as far as taking away voting rights is concerned , merkel can forget it .
now she just says she wants to keep the item “ on the agenda ” .
it wo n't go beyond that .
it 's a different story when it comes to the permanent rescue mechanism for financially stricken states .
the participation of the private sectors is popular .
and the fear in the whole eurozone of the collapse of a member state could give the necessary pressure to get through moderate treaty amendments on this issue .
the strange thing is this : had merkel fought for automatic sanctions at the summit , and looked for allies on the issue , she may have saved herself and the whole eu some of the conflict over treaty changes .
because the stricter the disciplinary tools are before a financial crisis , the more unlikely it is , that the whole mechanism will need to be used at all .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de integration -pipe- 29.10.2010 greens propose simplified citizenship laws for retired immigrants großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the proposal would make becoming a citizen easier for some good german is required to get german citizenship .
one lawmaker says it 's time to do long-term immigrants a favor and loosen up that rule . new legislation introduced in the german parliament could allow certain groups to get a german passport more easily and quickly , as well as granting more people the right to hold dual citizenship .
currently , immigrants who want to get german citizenship must take a naturalization test and show that they have a firm grasp of the language .
in addition , they generally have to renounce their previous citizenship .
pensioners who came to the country as immigrants are one of the groups that would benefit most from a change to the law .
if the bill were passed , a person who is over 53 years old and has been living in germany for at least 15 years could apply for a passport without meeting the language requirements .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kilic wants to see an immigrant 's work rewarded " if a person has made a contribution to this society , i want to make it easier for them to become citizens , " green party parliamentarian memet kilic told deutsche welle .
" especially older immigrants - who gave their youth and health to build up this country - should be able to obtain citizenship without a language requirement .
that way , we can win the hearts of their children and grandchildren for this country . "
integration conversation kilic 's bill comes as the integration of immigrants is under the microscope in germany .
chancellor angela merkel , a christian democrat , said earlier this month that multiculturalism had failed in germany .
there have also been repeated calls for immigrants to integrate better into german society by learning the language and customs .
kilic , who was born in turkey , said the legislation he sponsored would be welcome news to immigrants .
" third-generation immigrant children in germany hear three times a day that they do n't belong to this country , " he said .
" what good is that ?
i want to turn the tables . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : integration is hard to define in germany in support of the bill , kilic cited statistics showing that the number of citizens naturalized in germany each year had fallen by 20 percent since 2004 .
this was an indication that becoming a german citizen was simply too difficult , he said .
without citizenship , many of germany 's 6.7 million immigrants do not have the right to vote in the country .
but citizenship goes beyond the legal realm .
" integration means more than simply structural integration , " said guelistan guerbey , a political scientist at berlin 's free university .
" it has a very strong emotional and psychological dimension . "
this is especially true for dual citizens .
if the bill became law , an immigrant would no longer have to give up their passport to become german .
guerbey said this would have a positive effect .
" a person has emotional ties in both directions , " she said , " and dual citizenship is a legal recognition of this emotional state . "
time to learn german but while legal benefits and emotional satisfaction might encourage a retired immigrant with less-than-perfect german to apply for citizenship under the loosened rules of the proposed law , they may never get the chance .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : learning german is essential for integration , says grindel on thursday in the bundestag , reinhard grindel of the governing christian democrats , was clear about what his party thought of the proposal .
" when someone wants to become a german citizen , " grindel said , " then i have to be able to say , as an incentive , that you must learn german if you have n't learned it well enough already .
that 's a part of the integration process - to finally learn german . "
and there is reason to believe that many retired immigrants in germany would n't apply for a german passport if the rules were loosened .
some come from other european union countries , where moving across borders is n't problematic , though they do not have full voting rights in germany .
but kilic says there are some 2,000-3,000 retirees from other countries who would gladly take advantage of the opportunity .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de history -pipe- 29.10.2010 opinion : germany 's nazi history is clouded by myths großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the study of the foreign office 's crimes under hitler shows that memories of the nazi period are still dominated by myths .
dw 's ramon garcia-ziemsen writes about how germany 's history was deliberately repressed . yes , it is shocking how german diplomats were complicit in the holocaust in the second world war , and how they were involved in its implementation .
it 's unbelievable how much continuity there was in the diplomatic personnel after 1945 in germany : men who had participated in the nazi extermination policies later made careers and protected each other , even before their involvement was made public .
but it 's just as incredible how long it has taken : that only now , 65 years on , this has come to the attention of the wider german public .
in 1979 , a book was published by a british historian about the participation of the foreign office in the so called " final solution , " the nazi description for the murder of european jews .
the book describes what the nature of the foreign office 's participation in the holocaust was , how deportation orders were signed there , how the office was a systematic element of the nazi killing machine .
and even back in the 1950s , there was clear evidence showing that the foreign office was certainly not a " school of passive resistance " against hitler , as it liked to present itself in the post-war period .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ramon garcia-ziemsen head of dw 's german culture department a lot was known , a lot was forgotten in short : much was known .
and almost everything was forgotten .
how the germans dealt with the third reich is not as exemplary as it has often been perceived around the world , it is also a history of forgetting and repressing .
the elites have often knowingly prevented a discussion about their past .
and the public allowed this discourse to be prevented .
how could this happen ? after 1945 , german society was always looking for the " good , " for the " other germany " - the " other germany " that had remained innocent , that had perhaps not been openly resistant , but did not allow itself to be sucked into nazi ideology ; which had remained resistant , which had rejected the nazi madness , and of which one might even be proud .
because it wanted a fresh start , the young germany did not think it could live with the weight of such a large feeling of guilt .
myths and collective guilt and in this way the yarn was spun : first came the myth that many germans had only found out about the holocaust in 1945 from the allies .
the myth was born that only a small group around hitler had known what had happened in concentration camps like auschwitz and dachau .
the germans were a nation led astray .
this position was also of course a reaction to the similarly blanket collective guilt theory purported by the allies after the war . then came the myth of the armed forces : that the soldiers had played almost no part in hitler 's atrocities - and besides that everything had been carried out under orders .
both theories were exposed by historians as false only decades later , from the 1970s , through studies , books and exhibitions .
large parts of the population knew not only why jewish friends and neighbors had suddenly disappeared , but they had also assisted with this disappearance .
soldiers took part in shooting jews - voluntarily and not under orders .
but again it took years and decades , well into the 1990s , until this knowledge resulted in a public debate and led to a real demystification . where the myth certainly still existed was in the foreign office , one of the last places where the fairy tale of the " other germany " could live on .
the solidarity of the diplomats worked so well and perhaps the respect for the future german president richard von weizsaecker was too great .
weizsaecker 's father ernst was a top diplomat , who supported the nazi ideology in the foreign office .
but germany 's longing for this " other germany " , which existed much less than most germans had thought , was also too great .

but it 's just as incredible how long it has taken : that only now , 65 years on , this has come to the attention of the wider german public .
in 1979 , a book was published by a british historian about the participation of the foreign office in the so called " final solution , " the nazi description for the murder of european jews .
the book describes what the nature of the foreign office 's participation in the holocaust was , how deportation orders were signed there , how the office was a systematic element of the nazi killing machine .
and even back in the 1950s , there was clear evidence showing that the foreign office was certainly not a " school of passive resistance " against hitler , as it liked to present itself in the post-war period .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ramon garcia-ziemsen head of dw 's german culture department a lot was known , a lot was forgotten in short : much was known .
and almost everything was forgotten .
how the germans dealt with the third reich is not as exemplary as it has often been perceived around the world , it is also a history of forgetting and repressing .
the elites have often knowingly prevented a discussion about their past .
and the public allowed this discourse to be prevented .
how could this happen ? after 1945 , german society was always looking for the " good , " for the " other germany " - the " other germany " that had remained innocent , that had perhaps not been openly resistant , but did not allow itself to be sucked into nazi ideology ; which had remained resistant , which had rejected the nazi madness , and of which one might even be proud .
because it wanted a fresh start , the young germany did not think it could live with the weight of such a large feeling of guilt .
myths and collective guilt and in this way the yarn was spun : first came the myth that many germans had only found out about the holocaust in 1945 from the allies .
the myth was born that only a small group around hitler had known what had happened in concentration camps like auschwitz and dachau .
the germans were a nation led astray .
this position was also of course a reaction to the similarly blanket collective guilt theory purported by the allies after the war . then came the myth of the armed forces : that the soldiers had played almost no part in hitler 's atrocities - and besides that everything had been carried out under orders .
both theories were exposed by historians as false only decades later , from the 1970s , through studies , books and exhibitions .
large parts of the population knew not only why jewish friends and neighbors had suddenly disappeared , but they had also assisted with this disappearance .
soldiers took part in shooting jews - voluntarily and not under orders .
but again it took years and decades , well into the 1990s , until this knowledge resulted in a public debate and led to a real demystification . where the myth certainly still existed was in the foreign office , one of the last places where the fairy tale of the " other germany " could live on .
the solidarity of the diplomats worked so well and perhaps the respect for the future german president richard von weizsaecker was too great .
weizsaecker 's father ernst was a top diplomat , who supported the nazi ideology in the foreign office .
but germany 's longing for this " other germany " , which existed much less than most germans had thought , was also too great .

german chancellor angela merkel said the leaders had had a " profound and difficult discussion , " and other participants described the discussions as heated and emotional . merkel added that she was satisfied with the outcome of the debate : " we have promoted our essential points , " she said .
" everyone is in agreement that a limited change to the lisbon treaty is necessary . " eu council president herman van rompuy told a news conference that " important decisions to strengthen the eurozone " had been taken .
" we recommend a robust and credible permanent crisis resolution mechanism to safeguard the financial stability of the eurozone as a whole , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : van rompuy is now charged with proposing the amendments merkel stressed that the current , limited protection of loan guarantees for euro states was not a permanent solution under the current treaty conditions .
she said the new crisis mechanism would only be " valid for cases where the stability of the euro as a whole is at risk . " " we said once more that ... should a country ever need to make use of this , it would be faced with very strict requirements , " she said . opposition to budget increase some non-eurozone states threw around their weight in the discussions , like the united kingdom , which sought to cap the eu 's budget next year , and poland , which wants the calculation of its national debt to take into account costly pension reforms . merkel chimed in , saying , " if we have to reduce our budget at home - we do this at the federal level by more than 3 percent - it can not be that the european budget rises by nearly 6 percent . " the leaders asked van rompuy to prepare potential changes to the lisbon treaty ahead of another eu summit in december .
the changes are to be agreed on by mid-2013 , the expiration date of a 750-billion euro -lrb- $ 1 trillion -rrb- fund set up last may to reassure markets that greece 's debt crisis would not spill over to the rest of the continent . tough reform process bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy and merkel jointly proposed tough sanctions on overspenders germany , europe 's largest economy , led the calls at the summit for tougher penalties on states that exceed the eurozone 's limit on budget deficits of 3 percent of gross domestic product . merkel and french president nicolas sarkozy had called for the suspension of voting rights of members who flout budget rules , but such a reform was unpopular with several smaller states . " if treaty change is to reduce the rights of member states on voting , i find it unacceptable , and , frankly speaking , it is not realistic , " european commission president jose manuel barroso said . it would also likely turn into a political nightmare for national governments .
the lisbon treaty took 10 years of wrangling to enact , after challenges in national courts and referendum failures in france , ireland and the netherlands . " many countries do not want a huge treaty reform , and therefore we are trying to narrow it down to a very limited treaty change that should be acceptable for countries without having to face referendums , " swedish prime minister fredrik reinfeldt said . although the proposals were weaker than merkel had pushed for , she said the eu had underlined that " private investors will not be able to make money or speculate against the euro .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de integration -pipe- 29.10.2010 greens propose simplified citizenship laws for retired immigrants großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the proposal would make becoming a citizen easier for some good german is required to get german citizenship .
one lawmaker says it 's time to do long-term immigrants a favor and loosen up that rule . new legislation introduced in the german parliament could allow certain groups to get a german passport more easily and quickly , as well as granting more people the right to hold dual citizenship .
currently , immigrants who want to get german citizenship must take a naturalization test and show that they have a firm grasp of the language .
in addition , they generally have to renounce their previous citizenship .
pensioners who came to the country as immigrants are one of the groups that would benefit most from a change to the law .
if the bill were passed , a person who is over 53 years old and has been living in germany for at least 15 years could apply for a passport without meeting the language requirements .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kilic wants to see an immigrant 's work rewarded " if a person has made a contribution to this society , i want to make it easier for them to become citizens , " green party parliamentarian memet kilic told deutsche welle .
" especially older immigrants - who gave their youth and health to build up this country - should be able to obtain citizenship without a language requirement .
that way , we can win the hearts of their children and grandchildren for this country . "
integration conversation kilic 's bill comes as the integration of immigrants is under the microscope in germany .
chancellor angela merkel , a christian democrat , said earlier this month that multiculturalism had failed in germany .
there have also been repeated calls for immigrants to integrate better into german society by learning the language and customs .
kilic , who was born in turkey , said the legislation he sponsored would be welcome news to immigrants .
" third-generation immigrant children in germany hear three times a day that they do n't belong to this country , " he said .
" what good is that ?
i want to turn the tables . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : integration is hard to define in germany in support of the bill , kilic cited statistics showing that the number of citizens naturalized in germany each year had fallen by 20 percent since 2004 .
this was an indication that becoming a german citizen was simply too difficult , he said .
without citizenship , many of germany 's 6.7 million immigrants do not have the right to vote in the country .
but citizenship goes beyond the legal realm .
" integration means more than simply structural integration , " said guelistan guerbey , a political scientist at berlin 's free university .
" it has a very strong emotional and psychological dimension . "
this is especially true for dual citizens .
if the bill became law , an immigrant would no longer have to give up their passport to become german .
guerbey said this would have a positive effect .
" a person has emotional ties in both directions , " she said , " and dual citizenship is a legal recognition of this emotional state . "
time to learn german but while legal benefits and emotional satisfaction might encourage a retired immigrant with less-than-perfect german to apply for citizenship under the loosened rules of the proposed law , they may never get the chance .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : learning german is essential for integration , says grindel on thursday in the bundestag , reinhard grindel of the governing christian democrats , was clear about what his party thought of the proposal .
" when someone wants to become a german citizen , " grindel said , " then i have to be able to say , as an incentive , that you must learn german if you have n't learned it well enough already .
that 's a part of the integration process - to finally learn german . "
and there is reason to believe that many retired immigrants in germany would n't apply for a german passport if the rules were loosened .
some come from other european union countries , where moving across borders is n't problematic , though they do not have full voting rights in germany .
but kilic says there are some 2,000-3,000 retirees from other countries who would gladly take advantage of the opportunity .

kfor has been in the territory for more than a decade . citing progress in the breakaway former serbian province , nato secretary general anders fogh rasmussen made the announcement in a statement released to the media on friday .
" the security conditions in kosovo continue to improve , which is a positive sign , not only for kosovo , but for the whole region , " the statement said .
rasmussen added that local institutions were increasingly capable of assuming responsibility for security tasks , and that the kosovo force -lrb- kfor -rrb- , which had already been reduced from 15,000 to 10,000 soldiers earlier this year , would continue to be a deterrent to violence .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the kosovo force is made up of soldiers from a dozen nations " kfor will remain able to deploy forces quickly and effectively whenever and wherever necessary , including with robust reserves .
kfor 's mission to guarantee a safe and secure environment in kosovo remains unchanged . "
the german commander of the nato forces in kosovo , major general erhard buehler , said the decision was taken " because the security situation is calm , " but he said kosovo 's serb-inhabited north remained an area of concern .
international peacekeeping forces arrived in kosovo in 1999 , following a 78-day nato bombing campaign to end a conflict between serbian forces and fighters from the ethnic albanian majority in what was then a province of serbia .
kosovo unilaterally declared independence from serbia in feb .
2008 , paving the way for a reduction in the number of peacekeepers , although ethnic tensions have persisted .
in recent weeks , belgrade , which refuses to recognize kosovo as an independent state , has also signaled a softening of its approach to kosovo , a move which was welcomed by nato .

a pre-summit deal between merkel and sarkozy on how to safeguard the euro annoyed many eu states .
deutsche welle 's brussels correspondent , christoph hasselbach , says that 's why so little progress was achieved . chancellor merkel pushed the right issues , but at this summit , at least , made little concrete progress .
it remains to be seen whether the december summit will in fact bring about the desired effect .
the reason for this lies not least in her advance talks with french president nicolas sarkozy .
through the “ deauville deal ” shortly before the summit , merkel managed to irritate almost everyone in the eu .
those who had supported automatic sanctions for budget sinners noted with horror that the german chancellor had given up on this central goal .
merkel also managed to stab the european commission in the back .
the commission had pursued this aim and , until the deauville conference , could be sure having the support of the germans .
in the end , even european council president herman van rompuy must have felt blindsided .
he was given the task of working out the details of the reforms , and even before he could present his results officially , germany and france declared they 'd already reached a decision .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche welle 's brussels correspondent , christoph hasselbach as a trade-off , merkel had secured assurances from sarkozy that france would echo the german demands for altering the lisbon treaty .
merkel experienced how little that promise was worth when she got to the summit .
rarely has such a wall of resistance built up , above all on the question of taking away voting rights .
this means that early on merkel threw away one of the most important methods of stabilizing the euro , and has - at least so far - has nothing to show for her trade-off .
whether the eu can agree on a so-called small amendment to the treaty by december , is not only down to france .
as far as taking away voting rights is concerned , merkel can forget it .
now she just says she wants to keep the item “ on the agenda ” .
it wo n't go beyond that .
it 's a different story when it comes to the permanent rescue mechanism for financially stricken states .
the participation of the private sectors is popular .
and the fear in the whole eurozone of the collapse of a member state could give the necessary pressure to get through moderate treaty amendments on this issue .
the strange thing is this : had merkel fought for automatic sanctions at the summit , and looked for allies on the issue , she may have saved herself and the whole eu some of the conflict over treaty changes .
because the stricter the disciplinary tools are before a financial crisis , the more unlikely it is , that the whole mechanism will need to be used at all .

under pressure from german chancellor angela merkel and french president nicolas sarkozy , european union leaders set in motion plans to amend the lisbon treaty to create a system to ward off financial crises .
they also endorsed tougher sanctions on states that do not keep their public debt in check .
merkel had insisted on suspending voting rights for member states which breach the rules , but failed to win widespread support for this demand .
smaller eu states in particular were opposed to this idea .
overcoming hostility bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : initially merkel only had the support of sarkozy initially germany and france faced strong hostility to their proposals to change the lisbon treaty .
a number of states rejected the idea of far-reaching amendments that would have forced them to hold referendums , which would have been expected to fail .
chancellor merkel was forced to back down on this issue .
the german chancellor had been battling for weeks to push through changes that would provide the eurozone with greater stability .
at home , she has faced public hostility to the bailout of greece and the creation of a massive rescue fund designed to protect the euro .
merkel wanted to write the creation of the rescue fund into the treaty .
europe 's biggest economy contributed the bulk of the 750-billion-euro -lrb- $ 1 trillion -rrb- european financial stability fund , which was hastily established in may to save greece from financial collapse .
the fund is now to be turned into a " permanent crisis mechanism . "
at the eu summit in brussels , which started on thursday , merkel fought into the night to push through her proposals , winning agreement only in the early hours of friday morning .
the german chancellor said she was satisfied with the outcome of the summit : " we have put forward our essential points , " she said .
" everyone is in agreement that a limited change to the lisbon treaty is necessary . "
merkel stressed the new crisis mechanism would only be " valid for cases in which the stability of the euro as a whole is at risk . "
" should a country ever need to make use of this , it would be faced with very strict requirements , " she said .
cautious welcome from the german media the german business daily handelsblatt said the agreement was a significant achievement , calling it a " breakthrough " for merkel , whose center-right coalition has suffered a drop in support in the polls in recent months .
however , because merkel 's more far-reaching treaty changes were put on the backburner , the german newspaper hannoversche allgemeine zeitung said the deal amounted to a " light solution " to the problem of imposing budgetary discipline .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : van rompuy is now charged with drafting the changes guenther kirschbaum , a member of merkel 's christian democrats , who chairs the european affairs committee in the lower house , said the agreement amounted to real progress .
" it is a great step forward because we now have a crisis mechanism so that in future we will not have to deal with problems like the greek crisis on an ad hoc basis , " kirschbaum said .
the proposed changes to the lisbon treaty are to be drafted in time for another eu summit in december .
the changes are to be agreed and implemented by 2013 , when the current rescue fund expires .
european council president herman van rompuy told a news conference in brussels that " important decisions to strengthen the eurozone " had been taken .
" we recommend a robust and credible permanent crisis resolution mechanism to safeguard the financial stability of the eurozone as a whole , " he added .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de obituary -pipe- 29.10.2010 postcard from europe : the demise of an oracle großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : soccer fans used to tremble when paul made his move german aquarium officials announced the death of paul the octopus earlier this week .
but as andy valvur points out in this postcard , the conspiracy theorists have gone into overdrive . he was just a small town cephalopod , living quietly in an aquarium in oberhausen germany , entertaining children , moving languidly around his tank and generally being ignored .
but , this summer , it all changed and paul , as the octopus was called , became an international superstar by accurately picking the winners of all the games that the german world cup soccer team faced .
and , to finish it off , he accurately picked the winner of the entire world cup .
it all started innocently enough , when he correctly picked the winner of the first game .
people smiled , a lucky guess , said most .
then he picked the winner in the next game .
ah , another lucky guess .
but people took notice .
even better , the media took notice .
by the time he correctly picked the third game result , the media were in full frenzy , as only the media can .
suddenly , the sleepy little german town of oberhausen became media central .
satellite trucks sprouted like mushrooms around the aquarium .
interview requests poured in from around the world , but paul remained silent .
ok .
he ’ s an octopus and not known for his verbal skills , but he was now , as they say in hollywood , hot .
his streak continued , picking the winners of several more games .
when he picked germany to lose against spain , germans thought , well , now he ’ s going to fail , as germany was on a roll , and many thought it seemingly possible that germany might win the whole thing .
but , paul was not to be denied .
by picking spain over germany , there were calls for paul to made into a calamari dish or perhaps served up as sushi … .but aquarium officials demurred and increased security .
in the end , paul amazed everyone and correctly picked the winner of the world cup final between the netherlands and spain .
suddenly , everyone wanted a piece of paul .
rumors spread like wildfire .
it was reported that paul was spotted hanging with squid supermodels at sea world in san diego , california … .
other reports had him accepting a teaching job at woods hole oceanography institute .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dw 's andy valvur is waiting for paul 's return but the truth is that paul , even though he was born in england , had become quite german and decided that all the flash and hoopla were not for him .
he stayed in oberhausen , doing what he did best , languidly moving around a fish tank … seemingly oblivious to everything .
this week , the news that everyone dreaded , was released by aquarium officials in oberhausen .
paul was dead .
murder most foul ?
conspiracy theorists immediately suspected squid play ... i mean … foul play pointing to the rumors of beatle paul mccartney ’ s demise in the 70 ’ s .
their suspicions were fueled by reports that paul had been cremated .
no autopsy , no open casket , no official investigation .
other conspiracy theories suggested that paul was the subject of a mob hit , as his uncanny ability to pick winners was lowering the profits from illegal gambling .
another theory is that museum officials sold paul to a japanese sushi consortium , pointing to a website has that has blurry photos of an alleged sushi chef leaving the aquarium in oberhausen still another claim was that paul was just tired of all the attention , and in a late night dash , escaped from oberhausen to spend the rest of his days relaxing in the mediterranean .
museum officials have been tight lipped saying only that paul is dead .
a memorial has been set up in his tank complete with a replica of the world cup .
so ends a remarkable career .
and in life as in death , paul continues to be a lightning rod for publicity .
personally , i like the relaxing in the mediterranean theory the best .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de integration -pipe- 29.10.2010 greens propose simplified citizenship laws for retired immigrants großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the proposal would make becoming a citizen easier for some good german is required to get german citizenship .
one lawmaker says it 's time to do long-term immigrants a favor and loosen up that rule . new legislation introduced in the german parliament could allow certain groups to get a german passport more easily and quickly , as well as granting more people the right to hold dual citizenship .
currently , immigrants who want to get german citizenship must take a naturalization test and show that they have a firm grasp of the language .
in addition , they generally have to renounce their previous citizenship .
pensioners who came to the country as immigrants are one of the groups that would benefit most from a change to the law .
if the bill were passed , a person who is over 53 years old and has been living in germany for at least 15 years could apply for a passport without meeting the language requirements .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kilic wants to see an immigrant 's work rewarded " if a person has made a contribution to this society , i want to make it easier for them to become citizens , " green party parliamentarian memet kilic told deutsche welle .
" especially older immigrants - who gave their youth and health to build up this country - should be able to obtain citizenship without a language requirement .
that way , we can win the hearts of their children and grandchildren for this country . "
integration conversation kilic 's bill comes as the integration of immigrants is under the microscope in germany .
chancellor angela merkel , a christian democrat , said earlier this month that multiculturalism had failed in germany .
there have also been repeated calls for immigrants to integrate better into german society by learning the language and customs .
kilic , who was born in turkey , said the legislation he sponsored would be welcome news to immigrants .
" third-generation immigrant children in germany hear three times a day that they do n't belong to this country , " he said .
" what good is that ?
i want to turn the tables . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : integration is hard to define in germany in support of the bill , kilic cited statistics showing that the number of citizens naturalized in germany each year had fallen by 20 percent since 2004 .
this was an indication that becoming a german citizen was simply too difficult , he said .
without citizenship , many of germany 's 6.7 million immigrants do not have the right to vote in the country .
but citizenship goes beyond the legal realm .
" integration means more than simply structural integration , " said guelistan guerbey , a political scientist at berlin 's free university .
" it has a very strong emotional and psychological dimension . "
this is especially true for dual citizens .
if the bill became law , an immigrant would no longer have to give up their passport to become german .
guerbey said this would have a positive effect .
" a person has emotional ties in both directions , " she said , " and dual citizenship is a legal recognition of this emotional state . "
time to learn german but while legal benefits and emotional satisfaction might encourage a retired immigrant with less-than-perfect german to apply for citizenship under the loosened rules of the proposed law , they may never get the chance .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : learning german is essential for integration , says grindel on thursday in the bundestag , reinhard grindel of the governing christian democrats , was clear about what his party thought of the proposal .
" when someone wants to become a german citizen , " grindel said , " then i have to be able to say , as an incentive , that you must learn german if you have n't learned it well enough already .
that 's a part of the integration process - to finally learn german . "
and there is reason to believe that many retired immigrants in germany would n't apply for a german passport if the rules were loosened .
some come from other european union countries , where moving across borders is n't problematic , though they do not have full voting rights in germany .
but kilic says there are some 2,000-3,000 retirees from other countries who would gladly take advantage of the opportunity .

kfor has been in the territory for more than a decade . citing progress in the breakaway former serbian province , nato secretary general anders fogh rasmussen made the announcement in a statement released to the media on friday .
" the security conditions in kosovo continue to improve , which is a positive sign , not only for kosovo , but for the whole region , " the statement said .
rasmussen added that local institutions were increasingly capable of assuming responsibility for security tasks , and that the kosovo force -lrb- kfor -rrb- , which had already been reduced from 15,000 to 10,000 soldiers earlier this year , would continue to be a deterrent to violence .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the kosovo force is made up of soldiers from a dozen nations " kfor will remain able to deploy forces quickly and effectively whenever and wherever necessary , including with robust reserves .
kfor 's mission to guarantee a safe and secure environment in kosovo remains unchanged . "
the german commander of the nato forces in kosovo , major general erhard buehler , said the decision was taken " because the security situation is calm , " but he said kosovo 's serb-inhabited north remained an area of concern .
international peacekeeping forces arrived in kosovo in 1999 , following a 78-day nato bombing campaign to end a conflict between serbian forces and fighters from the ethnic albanian majority in what was then a province of serbia .
kosovo unilaterally declared independence from serbia in feb .
2008 , paving the way for a reduction in the number of peacekeepers , although ethnic tensions have persisted .
in recent weeks , belgrade , which refuses to recognize kosovo as an independent state , has also signaled a softening of its approach to kosovo , a move which was welcomed by nato .

a pre-summit deal between merkel and sarkozy on how to safeguard the euro annoyed many eu states .
deutsche welle 's brussels correspondent , christoph hasselbach , says that 's why so little progress was achieved . chancellor merkel pushed the right issues , but at this summit , at least , made little concrete progress .
it remains to be seen whether the december summit will in fact bring about the desired effect .
the reason for this lies not least in her advance talks with french president nicolas sarkozy .
through the “ deauville deal ” shortly before the summit , merkel managed to irritate almost everyone in the eu .
those who had supported automatic sanctions for budget sinners noted with horror that the german chancellor had given up on this central goal .
merkel also managed to stab the european commission in the back .
the commission had pursued this aim and , until the deauville conference , could be sure having the support of the germans .
in the end , even european council president herman van rompuy must have felt blindsided .
he was given the task of working out the details of the reforms , and even before he could present his results officially , germany and france declared they 'd already reached a decision .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche welle 's brussels correspondent , christoph hasselbach as a trade-off , merkel had secured assurances from sarkozy that france would echo the german demands for altering the lisbon treaty .
merkel experienced how little that promise was worth when she got to the summit .
rarely has such a wall of resistance built up , above all on the question of taking away voting rights .
this means that early on merkel threw away one of the most important methods of stabilizing the euro , and has - at least so far - has nothing to show for her trade-off .
whether the eu can agree on a so-called small amendment to the treaty by december , is not only down to france .
as far as taking away voting rights is concerned , merkel can forget it .
now she just says she wants to keep the item “ on the agenda ” .
it wo n't go beyond that .
it 's a different story when it comes to the permanent rescue mechanism for financially stricken states .
the participation of the private sectors is popular .
and the fear in the whole eurozone of the collapse of a member state could give the necessary pressure to get through moderate treaty amendments on this issue .
the strange thing is this : had merkel fought for automatic sanctions at the summit , and looked for allies on the issue , she may have saved herself and the whole eu some of the conflict over treaty changes .
because the stricter the disciplinary tools are before a financial crisis , the more unlikely it is , that the whole mechanism will need to be used at all .

a pre-summit deal between merkel and sarkozy on how to safeguard the euro annoyed many eu states .
deutsche welle 's brussels correspondent , christoph hasselbach , says that 's why so little progress was achieved . chancellor merkel pushed the right issues , but at this summit , at least , made little concrete progress .
it remains to be seen whether the december summit will in fact bring about the desired effect .
the reason for this lies not least in her advance talks with french president nicolas sarkozy .
through the “ deauville deal ” shortly before the summit , merkel managed to irritate almost everyone in the eu .
those who had supported automatic sanctions for budget sinners noted with horror that the german chancellor had given up on this central goal .
merkel also managed to stab the european commission in the back .
the commission had pursued this aim and , until the deauville conference , could be sure having the support of the germans .
in the end , even european council president herman van rompuy must have felt blindsided .
he was given the task of working out the details of the reforms , and even before he could present his results officially , germany and france declared they 'd already reached a decision .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche welle 's brussels correspondent , christoph hasselbach as a trade-off , merkel had secured assurances from sarkozy that france would echo the german demands for altering the lisbon treaty .
merkel experienced how little that promise was worth when she got to the summit .
rarely has such a wall of resistance built up , above all on the question of taking away voting rights .
this means that early on merkel threw away one of the most important methods of stabilizing the euro , and has - at least so far - has nothing to show for her trade-off .
whether the eu can agree on a so-called small amendment to the treaty by december , is not only down to france .
as far as taking away voting rights is concerned , merkel can forget it .
now she just says she wants to keep the item “ on the agenda ” .
it wo n't go beyond that .

the secret ballot will take place on december 2 .
two members remain provisionally suspended . the election of the 2018 and 2022 world cup hosts will go ahead as planned despite an ongoing corruption probe , fifa president joseph blatter said on friday .
blatter made the announcement after a two-day meeting of the fifa executive committee .
the secret ballot will take place on december 2 at fifa 's headquarters in zurich .
" we are five weeks from the final decision so there was never a question of changing anything in the procedure , " blatter said .
" changing the date would have caused problems for fifa and bidders as well since they plan to bring in high-ranked politicians like bill clinton and vladimir putin . "
executive committee members suspended bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : adamu , left , and temarii are accussed of selling their votes last week , fifa provisionally suspended two of the 24 members of the executive committee , amos adamu of nigeria and reynald temarii of tahiti .
there have been allegations that they offered to sell their votes to undercover reporters from the british sunday times newspaper .
blatter said that the fifa ethics committee will deal with their cases before the election of the host countries takes place . " if and when people are suspended for the vote on december 2 , they will not be replaced , " he said .
alleged deal between spain , portugal and qatar the joint 2018 bidders , spain and portugal , are said to have struck a deal with qatar , a 2022 candidate , for the interchange of votes . the chief of the joint spanish-portugal bid , miguel angel lopez , denied the allegations of collusion with qatar .
blatter said fifa was investigating those allegations as well and said this issue would also be dealt with by the ethics committee .
" let us do our job .
and let us clarify the situation .
and let us do what the people and the fans , the millions , hundred of millions , thousands of millions of fans are expecting : bring back credibility in fifa , " he said .
aside from spain and portugal , the other countries in the running to host the 2018 world cup are england , russia and the netherlands with belgium .
for the 2022 tournament australia , the united states , qatar , japan and south korea are competing .
blatter acknowledged that the recent incidents showed that it was wrong to elect two world cup hosts on one day .
this is the first time such a vote will take place after a decision made by fifa in 2008 .
the scandal is no surprise , experts say jean-paul mean , president of transparency international switzerland , said the fifa scandal should not come as a surprise .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blatter called on fifa to ' bring back credibility ' " we have seen it with the international olympic committee 10 years ago that there were some strange practices , " he said .
" there is just a flair around sport associations that their governance is not the best yet . "
if there is money around , " corruption shows its ugly head , " he added .
according to mean , there is not enough control of international sports organizations since they are not subject to swiss anti-corruption law .
however , according to blatter , fifa will resolve its problems through its ethics committee .
" it 's an uncomfortable situation for fifa , but we have the necessary instruments to react the proper way , " he said .

but as andy valvur points out in this postcard , the conspiracy theorists have gone into overdrive . he was just a small town cephalopod , living quietly in an aquarium in oberhausen germany , entertaining children , moving languidly around his tank and generally being ignored .
but , this summer , it all changed and paul , as the octopus was called , became an international superstar by accurately picking the winners of all the games that the german world cup soccer team faced .
and , to finish it off , he accurately picked the winner of the entire world cup .
it all started innocently enough , when he correctly picked the winner of the first game .
people smiled , a lucky guess , said most .
then he picked the winner in the next game .
ah , another lucky guess .
but people took notice .
even better , the media took notice .
by the time he correctly picked the third game result , the media were in full frenzy , as only the media can .
suddenly , the sleepy little german town of oberhausen became media central .
satellite trucks sprouted like mushrooms around the aquarium .
interview requests poured in from around the world , but paul remained silent .
ok .
he ’ s an octopus and not known for his verbal skills , but he was now , as they say in hollywood , hot .
his streak continued , picking the winners of several more games .
when he picked germany to lose against spain , germans thought , well , now he ’ s going to fail , as germany was on a roll , and many thought it seemingly possible that germany might win the whole thing .
but , paul was not to be denied .
by picking spain over germany , there were calls for paul to made into a calamari dish or perhaps served up as sushi … .but aquarium officials demurred and increased security .
in the end , paul amazed everyone and correctly picked the winner of the world cup final between the netherlands and spain .
suddenly , everyone wanted a piece of paul .
rumors spread like wildfire .
it was reported that paul was spotted hanging with squid supermodels at sea world in san diego , california … .
other reports had him accepting a teaching job at woods hole oceanography institute .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dw 's andy valvur is waiting for paul 's return but the truth is that paul , even though he was born in england , had become quite german and decided that all the flash and hoopla were not for him .

this week , the news that everyone dreaded , was released by aquarium officials in oberhausen .
paul was dead .
murder most foul ?
conspiracy theorists immediately suspected squid play ... i mean … foul play pointing to the rumors of beatle paul mccartney ’ s demise in the 70 ’ s .
their suspicions were fueled by reports that paul had been cremated .
no autopsy , no open casket , no official investigation .
other conspiracy theories suggested that paul was the subject of a mob hit , as his uncanny ability to pick winners was lowering the profits from illegal gambling .
another theory is that museum officials sold paul to a japanese sushi consortium , pointing to a website has that has blurry photos of an alleged sushi chef leaving the aquarium in oberhausen still another claim was that paul was just tired of all the attention , and in a late night dash , escaped from oberhausen to spend the rest of his days relaxing in the mediterranean .
museum officials have been tight lipped saying only that paul is dead .
a memorial has been set up in his tank complete with a replica of the world cup .
so ends a remarkable career .

personally , i like the relaxing in the mediterranean theory the best .

one british mp said london needs to do more to protect people 's privacy . it 's been a busy week for google lawyers in europe , as the california tech giant became the target of the legal wrath of italy and the united kingdom . prosecutors in rome on wednesday began an investigation against google for potential invasions of privacy in its street view online mapping service . italian authorities , like their counterparts in germany , spain , canada and elsewhere , are concerned that google acquired personal data including e-mails and passwords while " packet sniffing " on open wifi networks while photographing for the street view service . google has previously said that the data acquisition was accidental , and that it has taken measures to ensure that this kind of breach does not happen again . this legal move came as the italian data protection authority also announced more restrictions this week against google . " italian citizens will be informed of the presence of google cars taking pictures of places and individuals to be posted online via the street view service , " the italian privacy authority said in a statement on its website on monday . the authority added that google street view vehicles will have to be obvious to passers-by . " google cars will have to be clearly marked by means of visible stickers or signs to unambiguously signify that pictures are being taken for the purposes of street view , " it said in the statement . other conditions set by the italian authorities included requiring google list what neighborhoods its cars would photograph in local media ahead of time .

kfor has been in the territory for more than a decade . citing progress in the breakaway former serbian province , nato secretary general anders fogh rasmussen made the announcement in a statement released to the media on friday .
" the security conditions in kosovo continue to improve , which is a positive sign , not only for kosovo , but for the whole region , " the statement said .
rasmussen added that local institutions were increasingly capable of assuming responsibility for security tasks , and that the kosovo force -lrb- kfor -rrb- , which had already been reduced from 15,000 to 10,000 soldiers earlier this year , would continue to be a deterrent to violence .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the kosovo force is made up of soldiers from a dozen nations " kfor will remain able to deploy forces quickly and effectively whenever and wherever necessary , including with robust reserves .
kfor 's mission to guarantee a safe and secure environment in kosovo remains unchanged . "
the german commander of the nato forces in kosovo , major general erhard buehler , said the decision was taken " because the security situation is calm , " but he said kosovo 's serb-inhabited north remained an area of concern .
international peacekeeping forces arrived in kosovo in 1999 , following a 78-day nato bombing campaign to end a conflict between serbian forces and fighters from the ethnic albanian majority in what was then a province of serbia .
kosovo unilaterally declared independence from serbia in feb .
2008 , paving the way for a reduction in the number of peacekeepers , although ethnic tensions have persisted .
in recent weeks , belgrade , which refuses to recognize kosovo as an independent state , has also signaled a softening of its approach to kosovo , a move which was welcomed by nato .

under pressure from german chancellor angela merkel and french president nicolas sarkozy , european union leaders set in motion plans to amend the lisbon treaty to create a system to ward off financial crises .
they also endorsed tougher sanctions on states that do not keep their public debt in check .
merkel had insisted on suspending voting rights for member states which breach the rules , but failed to win widespread support for this demand .
smaller eu states in particular were opposed to this idea .
overcoming hostility bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : initially merkel only had the support of sarkozy initially germany and france faced strong hostility to their proposals to change the lisbon treaty .
a number of states rejected the idea of far-reaching amendments that would have forced them to hold referendums , which would have been expected to fail .
chancellor merkel was forced to back down on this issue .
the german chancellor had been battling for weeks to push through changes that would provide the eurozone with greater stability .
at home , she has faced public hostility to the bailout of greece and the creation of a massive rescue fund designed to protect the euro .
merkel wanted to write the creation of the rescue fund into the treaty .
europe 's biggest economy contributed the bulk of the 750-billion-euro -lrb- $ 1 trillion -rrb- european financial stability fund , which was hastily established in may to save greece from financial collapse .
the fund is now to be turned into a " permanent crisis mechanism . "
at the eu summit in brussels , which started on thursday , merkel fought into the night to push through her proposals , winning agreement only in the early hours of friday morning .
the german chancellor said she was satisfied with the outcome of the summit : " we have put forward our essential points , " she said .
" everyone is in agreement that a limited change to the lisbon treaty is necessary . "
merkel stressed the new crisis mechanism would only be " valid for cases in which the stability of the euro as a whole is at risk . "
" should a country ever need to make use of this , it would be faced with very strict requirements , " she said .
cautious welcome from the german media the german business daily handelsblatt said the agreement was a significant achievement , calling it a " breakthrough " for merkel , whose center-right coalition has suffered a drop in support in the polls in recent months .
however , because merkel 's more far-reaching treaty changes were put on the backburner , the german newspaper hannoversche allgemeine zeitung said the deal amounted to a " light solution " to the problem of imposing budgetary discipline .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : van rompuy is now charged with drafting the changes guenther kirschbaum , a member of merkel 's christian democrats , who chairs the european affairs committee in the lower house , said the agreement amounted to real progress .
" it is a great step forward because we now have a crisis mechanism so that in future we will not have to deal with problems like the greek crisis on an ad hoc basis , " kirschbaum said .
the proposed changes to the lisbon treaty are to be drafted in time for another eu summit in december .
the changes are to be agreed and implemented by 2013 , when the current rescue fund expires .
european council president herman van rompuy told a news conference in brussels that " important decisions to strengthen the eurozone " had been taken .
" we recommend a robust and credible permanent crisis resolution mechanism to safeguard the financial stability of the eurozone as a whole , " he added .

traditional gender attitudes could be to blame . a new government-commissioned study conducted by the german society for man and health -lrb- dgmg -rrb- and the men 's health foundation , was released on thursday , nearly a decade after a ground-breaking report on women 's health was conducted in 2001 .
speaking at its launch , family affairs minister kristina schroeder said it was high time : " a men 's health report is vitally necessary , because we still have a difference in life expectancy between men and women of 5.5 years . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de work -pipe- 29.10.2010 berlin : home of the poor , unpaid intern großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's mayor , klaus wowereit , once proudly announced that his city was " poor but sexy , " but with this rather chic poverty comes a cynical exploitation of eager young workers . the uk media was recently full of reports about the national union of journalists ' new campaign , cashback for interns , in which the union encouraged people who had completed internships to sue their former employers for unpaid wages .
while some thought the move was silly and a rather pitiful example of the nanny state , many others supported the campaign , claiming a fair wage was a rather obvious basic reward for a hard day 's work . while the nuj campaign undoubtedly gathers momentum over in england , one can only hope that something similar starts here in berlin ; a movement dedicated to reigning in the blatant exploitation of students and new graduates in the workplace .
poor and sexy berlin may be but it is also rife with stinginess when it comes to doling out the wages . a typical internship - or praktikum as they 're known - in berlin runs for around six months , during which time the " successful " applicant is expected to work from monday to friday , often putting in shifts of over eight hours , for no money whatsoever .
the employer therefore only needs to take on two keen young workers and he or she has extra much-needed manpower for a whole year and it does n't cost a nickel . my former flatmate once got an actual job in a shop and was put on a six-month trial period during which time she received a lower-than-average trainee wage while her employer was not legally obliged to make any health insurance or social security contributions .
lo and behold once the trial was over , the employer decided she was n't right for the job and let her go .
when she returned to pick up some bits and pieces she 'd left behind , there was a new girl doing exactly the same job in her place , presumably on yet another trial run .
little wonder that berlin city magazine , zitty , recently ran with " generation praktikant " -lrb- generation intern -rrb- as their cover story . bildunterschrift : interns need to juggle many tasks at the same time to impress potential employers - but how are they expected to pay the bills ? call me mr jump-to-conclusions but i would imagine as an employer that i could pretty accurately assess a person 's suitability for a job after two or three days ; a trial period of six months does seem rather excessive but it is yet another way to milk a year 's hard graft out of two poor saps without having to cough up for the privilege . a friend of a friend told me a tale of a girl who had re-located to berlin from the states on the promise of a job at a local radio station only to be on the phone to her parents in tears three months later as she 'd still not received any money .
she had , however , very promptly received an eviction notice on her flat , given that she had n't paid any rent .
everyone has some internship-related horror story that either happened to them or a friend . now it is n't , of course , all doom and gloom .
a good number of students and graduates take on internship positions fully aware that they are n't going to receive any money and do so with other funding behind them -lrb- savings or money from their parents , for example -rrb- and use their six months with the company to gain some valuable work experience .
sadly though , internships never seem to be offered on the basis that the employer is scouting for hot new talent to add to his or her company .
interns seem to be cynically picked like cherries just so there is always someone there to answer the phone and take the mail to the post office . this exploitation of workers really does need to be addressed , especially in berlin , a city which exists on the labors of the intern and those who do either one-euro-an-hour job while also receiving welfare money .
it 's all very well gaining industry experience but if no one in the industry is prepared to give you a proper job you might as well sign up for unemployment benefit and spend your day doing crosswords . since i would n't be in the least bit surprised if even the city 's decision-makers were themselves a rotating army of interns , it seems unlikely that the problem will be tackled at an official level anytime soon .
so it 's time for a revolution .
berlin 's interns need to strike , even just for a day , for fair pay , while employers look on in horror as virtually every business in the city grinds to an absolute halt . of course , if revolution is n't your thing , just do the unpaid berlin internship and head off to munich .
after all , that 's where all the money is . gavin blackburn has happily never done an unpaid internship , despite working in the media . editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

sadly though , internships never seem to be offered on the basis that the employer is scouting for hot new talent to add to his or her company .
interns seem to be cynically picked like cherries just so there is always someone there to answer the phone and take the mail to the post office . this exploitation of workers really does need to be addressed , especially in berlin , a city which exists on the labors of the intern and those who do either one-euro-an-hour job while also receiving welfare money .
it 's all very well gaining industry experience but if no one in the industry is prepared to give you a proper job you might as well sign up for unemployment benefit and spend your day doing crosswords . since i would n't be in the least bit surprised if even the city 's decision-makers were themselves a rotating army of interns , it seems unlikely that the problem will be tackled at an official level anytime soon .
so it 's time for a revolution .
berlin 's interns need to strike , even just for a day , for fair pay , while employers look on in horror as virtually every business in the city grinds to an absolute halt . of course , if revolution is n't your thing , just do the unpaid berlin internship and head off to munich .
after all , that 's where all the money is . neale lytollis has happily never done an unpaid internship , despite working in the media . editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

while some thought the move was silly and a rather pitiful example of the nanny state , many others supported the campaign , claiming a fair wage was a rather obvious basic reward for a hard day 's work . while the nuj campaign undoubtedly gathers momentum over in england , one can only hope that something similar starts here in berlin ; a movement dedicated to reigning in the blatant exploitation of students and new graduates in the workplace .
poor and sexy berlin may be but it is also rife with stinginess when it comes to doling out the wages . a typical internship - or praktikum as they 're known - in berlin runs for around six months , during which time the " successful " applicant is expected to work from monday to friday , often putting in shifts of over eight hours , for no money whatsoever .
the employer therefore only needs to take on two keen young workers and he or she has extra much-needed manpower for a whole year and it does n't cost a nickel . my former flatmate once got an actual job in a shop and was put on a six-month trial period during which time she received a lower-than-average trainee wage while her employer was not legally obliged to make any health insurance or social security contributions .
lo and behold once the trial was over , the employer decided she was n't right for the job and let her go .
when she returned to pick up some bits and pieces she 'd left behind , there was a new girl doing exactly the same job in her place , presumably on yet another trial run .
little wonder that berlin city magazine , zitty , recently ran with " generation praktikant " -lrb- generation intern -rrb- as their cover story . bildunterschrift : interns need to juggle many tasks at the same time to impress potential employers - but how are they expected to pay the bills ? call me mr jump-to-conclusions but i would imagine as an employer that i could pretty accurately assess a person 's suitability for a job after two or three days ; a trial period of six months does seem rather excessive but it is yet another way to milk a year 's hard graft out of two poor saps without having to cough up for the privilege . a friend of a friend told me a tale of a girl who had re-located to berlin from the states on the promise of a job at a local radio station only to be on the phone to her parents in tears three months later as she 'd still not received any money .
she had , however , very promptly received an eviction notice on her flat , given that she had n't paid any rent .

there 's no need to question a perfectly reasonable on-the-nose prediction - at least not when it comes from afar .
another realm , in this case .
here dw sports forward the spooky ones ' predictions for match day ten . match day nine ’ s predictions saw the dw pundits increase their week-on-week total with six points .
not such a special tally , but one that included a surprising spot-on forecast of werder bremen 's 4-1 victory away to borussia moenchengladbach .
to fight the unsubstantiated and scurrilous accusations of match-fixing that have been swirling , dw 's experts are ready to come clean - the spirits made them do it .
they 're still under their control , in fact : here are their picks for week ten .
friday , oct .
29 bayern - freiburg few would have predicted freiburg being above bayern after nine games but the league table does n't lie .
bayern are suffering a crisis of confidence and fluidity in the bundesliga , while the freiburgers are just enjoying their early season ride .
robin dutt ’ s men have notched points against their mid-table rivals but have come unstuck against the better teams .
ordinarily bayern would be included in that latter category , but right now they 're adrift in mediocrity .
however , at home , with a partisan crowd expecting a return to the status quo , bayern should edge it .
prediction : bayern 2-1 saturday , oct .
30 bremen - nuremberg bremen have managed to steady their ship after a choppy start to the season and are unbeaten in five league games .
they still lie in eighth place but show signs of rediscovering the consistency which could see them climb the table .
but this is werder , remember , and nothing can be taken for granted .
they can win 4-1 one week and get thumped by the same scoreline the next .
nuremberg are experiencing the pendulum of form ; winning one week , losing the next .
if it continues to swing , after beating wolfsburg last week , then bremen should come out on top in this one .
prediction : bremen 3-0 wolfsburg - stuttgart bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : keller has got stuttgart winning again and out of danger jens keller is unbeaten as stuttgart coach after taking over from the sacked christian gross two weeks ago , and the four points his team has eked out in their last two league games have taken them out of the drop zone .
confidence is slowly coming back , boosted by recent europa league and dfb cup wins , and while it is still a nascent recovery , vfb do have some momentum at last .
wolfsburg , on the other hand , have lost theirs .
two defeats and a loss have put the skids under their own revival and coming into this match , stuttgart look to have the edge .
stuttgart : 1-0 cologne - hamburg the enigma that is hamburger sv continues to confound .
after an impressive start followed by a worrying slump , hsv are rebuilding their campaign by going three games unbeaten .
two wins and a goalless draw against bayern could have been seen as a solid base to push on , but their 5-2 cup hammering at the hands of frankfurt in midweek may have released old demons .
cologne , however , appear to have little in their locker which could inflict such a heavy defeat on hamburg - in fact , any kind of defeat looks unlikely .
the bottom club have a solitary win to their name and their second isn ’ t likely to come this weekend , even with the benefit of home advantage .
prediction : hamburg 2-0 kaiserslautern - moenchengladbach kaiserslautern 's last win - the impressive 2-0 defeat of bayern - seems a long time ago .
indeed since those heady days of august , when kaiserslautern notched two wins on the trot , all that has followed is a downward spiral of six reversals and a draw , leaving the red devils hovering perilously over the drop zone .
they got a welcome boost with a midweek cup win - but then again so did gladbach .
however , given that gladbach slipped to second-from-bottom after their sixth defeat of the season last weekend , little should be read into that .
these are two teams in deep , albeit it early , trouble .
their desperation may cancel each other out .
prediction : draw 2-2 st. pauli - frankfurt given they were afforded little chance of staying up this season , st- pauli 's current position in 10th could already be hailed as a triumph .
as long as they do n't start panicking that last week 's defeat to stuttgart and their slight tumble down the league is the start of their predicted demise , st. pauli have the guts to slog it out and remain in the bundesliga .
frankfurt sit a place above them on goal difference with an exact replica of the hamburg club 's record to date .
eintracht come into this game on the back of three wins and a draw so they will be up for it against pauli .
expect a gutsy battle .
prediction : draw 1-1 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : raul did n't expect to swap real madrid for a relegation fight schalke - leverkusen things still look desperate for schalke .
their only victory in the league this season , ground out against freiburg over a month ago , looks increasingly like a false dawn .
a defeat and three draws suggests little has been put right since .
their home form has been pitiful and leverkusen will certainly fancy their chances when they make the journey to gelsenkirchen on saturday .
leverkusen have had plenty of joy on their travels .
unbeaten in four away games with three wins and a draw , it appears to be advantage bayer .
schalke 's revival will have to wait at least another week .
prediction : leverkusen 3-2 sunday , oct .
31 mainz - dortmund halloween came early for dortmund in the dfb cup on wednesday .
instead of the treat they might have expected from a fixture against a third division side , they got tricked in a 4-2 loss on penalties at kickers offenbach .
bvb , who have been on fire in front of goal , will be wondering how they went 120 minutes without scoring and will be hoping they find they find the target ahead of this first-versus-second clash .
mainz , who returned to the summit last weekend , also lost in the cup to alemannia aachen so this game is primed for both teams to put their woes behind them .
dortmund will have the added incentive of going top if they win and could take heart from the fact that mainz 's only league defeat so far has come at home .
prediction : dortmund 3-1 hoffenheim - hanover bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hannover 's players are n't suffering from altitude sickness hanover continues to overachieve this season .
up to third after last week 's victory over cologne , they look to have put the brakes on the minor slide which affected them after losing to st. pauli at the start of october .
hoffenheim , meanwhile , are still challenging at the top end but their own push for the summit has suffered a few hiccups in recent weeks .
after three wins on the bounce at the start of the season , it took hoffenheim until two weeks ago to record their next .

there 's no need to question a perfectly reasonable on-the-nose prediction - at least not when it comes from afar .
another realm , in this case .
here dw sports forward the spooky ones ' predictions for match day ten . match day nine ’ s predictions saw the dw pundits increase their week-on-week total with six points .
not such a special tally , but one that included a surprising spot-on forecast of werder bremen 's 4-1 victory away to borussia moenchengladbach .
to fight the unsubstantiated and scurrilous accusations of match-fixing that have been swirling , dw 's experts are ready to come clean - the spirits made them do it .
they 're still under their control , in fact : here are their picks for week ten .
friday , oct .
29 bayern - freiburg few would have predicted freiburg being above bayern after nine games but the league table does n't lie .
bayern are suffering a crisis of confidence and fluidity in the bundesliga , while the freiburgers are just enjoying their early season ride .
robin dutt ’ s men have notched points against their mid-table rivals but have come unstuck against the better teams .
ordinarily bayern would be included in that latter category , but right now they 're adrift in mediocrity .
however , at home , with a partisan crowd expecting a return to the status quo , bayern should edge it .
prediction : bayern 2-1 saturday , oct .
30 bremen - nuremberg bremen have managed to steady their ship after a choppy start to the season and are unbeaten in five league games .
they still lie in eighth place but show signs of rediscovering the consistency which could see them climb the table .
but this is werder , remember , and nothing can be taken for granted .
they can win 4-1 one week and get thumped by the same scoreline the next .
nuremberg are experiencing the pendulum of form ; winning one week , losing the next .
if it continues to swing , after beating wolfsburg last week , then bremen should come out on top in this one .
prediction : bremen 3-0 wolfsburg - stuttgart bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : keller has got stuttgart winning again and out of danger jens keller is unbeaten as stuttgart coach after taking over from the sacked christian gross two weeks ago , and the four points his team has eked out in their last two league games have taken them out of the drop zone .
confidence is slowly coming back , boosted by recent europa league and dfb cup wins , and while it is still a nascent recovery , vfb do have some momentum at last .
wolfsburg , on the other hand , have lost theirs .
two defeats and a loss have put the skids under their own revival and coming into this match , stuttgart look to have the edge .
stuttgart : 1-0 cologne - hamburg the enigma that is hamburger sv continues to confound .
after an impressive start followed by a worrying slump , hsv are rebuilding their campaign by going three games unbeaten .
two wins and a goalless draw against bayern could have been seen as a solid base to push on , but their 5-2 cup hammering at the hands of frankfurt in midweek may have released old demons .
cologne , however , appear to have little in their locker which could inflict such a heavy defeat on hamburg - in fact , any kind of defeat looks unlikely .
the bottom club have a solitary win to their name and their second isn ’ t likely to come this weekend , even with the benefit of home advantage .
prediction : hamburg 2-0 kaiserslautern - moenchengladbach kaiserslautern 's last win - the impressive 2-0 defeat of bayern - seems a long time ago .
indeed since those heady days of august , when kaiserslautern notched two wins on the trot , all that has followed is a downward spiral of six reversals and a draw , leaving the red devils hovering perilously over the drop zone .
they got a welcome boost with a midweek cup win - but then again so did gladbach .
however , given that gladbach slipped to second-from-bottom after their sixth defeat of the season last weekend , little should be read into that .
these are two teams in deep , albeit it early , trouble .
their desperation may cancel each other out .
prediction : draw 2-2 st. pauli - frankfurt given they were afforded little chance of staying up this season , st- pauli 's current position in 10th could already be hailed as a triumph .
as long as they do n't start panicking that last week 's defeat to stuttgart and their slight tumble down the league is the start of their predicted demise , st. pauli have the guts to slog it out and remain in the bundesliga .
frankfurt sit a place above them on goal difference with an exact replica of the hamburg club 's record to date .
eintracht come into this game on the back of three wins and a draw so they will be up for it against pauli .
expect a gutsy battle .
prediction : draw 1-1 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : raul did n't expect to swap real madrid for a relegation fight schalke - leverkusen things still look desperate for schalke .
their only victory in the league this season , ground out against freiburg over a month ago , looks increasingly like a false dawn .
a defeat and three draws suggests little has been put right since .
their home form has been pitiful and leverkusen will certainly fancy their chances when they make the journey to gelsenkirchen on saturday .
leverkusen have had plenty of joy on their travels .
unbeaten in four away games with three wins and a draw , it appears to be advantage bayer .
schalke 's revival will have to wait at least another week .
prediction : leverkusen 3-2 sunday , oct .
31 mainz - dortmund halloween came early for dortmund in the dfb cup on wednesday .
instead of the treat they might have expected from a fixture against a third division side , they got tricked in a 4-2 loss on penalties at kickers offenbach .
bvb , who have been on fire in front of goal , will be wondering how they went 120 minutes without scoring and will be hoping they find they find the target ahead of this first-versus-second clash .
mainz , who returned to the summit last weekend , also lost in the cup to alemannia aachen so this game is primed for both teams to put their woes behind them .
dortmund will have the added incentive of going top if they win and could take heart from the fact that mainz 's only league defeat so far has come at home .
prediction : dortmund 3-1 hoffenheim - hanover bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hannover 's players are n't suffering from altitude sickness hanover continues to overachieve this season .
up to third after last week 's victory over cologne , they look to have put the brakes on the minor slide which affected them after losing to st. pauli at the start of october .
hoffenheim , meanwhile , are still challenging at the top end but their own push for the summit has suffered a few hiccups in recent weeks .
after three wins on the bounce at the start of the season , it took hoffenheim until two weeks ago to record their next .
keeping dortmund at bay in last week 's 1-1 draw suggests they 've found their balance again but hanover may edge this to keep their impressive campaign on track .

however , the outcome might well have an impact on washington 's relations with the rest of the world . when american voters head to the polls to elect a new house of representatives and 37 new senators , there is perhaps nothing that sums up their sentiment better than the old adage from bill clinton 's 1992 presidential campaign : " it 's the economy , stupid . " and with unemployment hovering at close to 10 percent , a collapsed housing market and a stuttering economy , there certainly is ample reason for voters to worry about their personal well-being . to be sure , there are definitely enough foreign policy issues that would merit the electorate 's attention too : a war in afghanistan , now in its ninth year , which is not going well , a tense situation in the middle east with us-sponsored negotiations between israelis and palestinians always on the verge of collapse , iran 's alleged efforts to acquire nuclear weapons still unresolved and north korea in the middle of a leadership handover .
but all of that does n't really matter , says thomas e. mann , a congressional scholar at the brookings institution in washington : " for the most part the public is so distressed and pessimistic about the economy that that is what 's dominating the campaigns , " he told deutsche welle . international issues on the sidelines the only way foreign policy gets any traction as an election topic is when it relates to a domestic issue , adds mann .
china , for example , plays a role in certain campaigns when trade issues or the currency imbalances are discussed .
and mexico is addressed when illegal immigration and its effect on the economy is debated .
other than that , domestic issues , especially the economy , dominate the midterm elections almost completely .
while foreign policy issues have no impact on the election , the results of the elections could well have an impact on us foreign policy .
if , as most pollsters predict , the republicans win back the house of representatives and stand a small chance of also retaking the senate , this will have implications for the way washington carries out international relations .

" they have n't said too much about foreign policy and so it 's anybody 's guess what they are going to do once they get into office . "

" and pulling back in foreign policy in terms of the military is not something that traditionally the republicans would do . "
future of the republican party his colleague mann also sees a chance of a " significant number of tea party-based republicans coming in to the senate with rather extreme views on the limited role for government and really hostile sentiments toward globalization and international organizations . "
he adds : " if this group were to gain the upper hand in the republican party we would have one center-left party and one extreme-right party in the country .
that 's not reassuring . "
regardless how the soul searching of the republican party ends , the party 's majority in one or both chambers of congress would have an impact on us foreign policy in any case . while the president has considerably more leeway to pursue his own course in international affairs than on the domestic front and also serves as the commander-in-chief of the military , he ca n't disregard congress entirely .

" let 's look at afghanistan for example , " juergen chrobog , germany 's former ambassador in washington who now heads the bmw foundation herbert quandt , told deutsche welle : " the troops and the war must be financed .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : focus : midterm elections in the us eu and us ' must work together , ' says diplomat obama seeks to mobilize disappointed voters foreign donations spark row ahead of us midterm elections european companies back climate skeptics in us senate race , report says elections -pipe- 29.10.2010 shift to the right in midterm elections could affect us foreign policy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the foreign policy leanings of many tea party candidates are unclear the issue of us foreign policy has hardly played a role in the congressional midterm elections campaign .
however , the outcome might well have an impact on washington 's relations with the rest of the world . when american voters head to the polls to elect a new house of representatives and 37 new senators , there is perhaps nothing that sums up their sentiment better than the old adage from bill clinton 's 1992 presidential campaign : " it 's the economy , stupid . " and with unemployment hovering at close to 10 percent , a collapsed housing market and a stuttering economy , there certainly is ample reason for voters to worry about their personal well-being . to be sure , there are definitely enough foreign policy issues that would merit the electorate 's attention too : a war in afghanistan , now in its ninth year , which is not going well , a tense situation in the middle east with us-sponsored negotiations between israelis and palestinians always on the verge of collapse , iran 's alleged efforts to acquire nuclear weapons still unresolved and north korea in the middle of a leadership handover .
but all of that does n't really matter , says thomas e. mann , a congressional scholar at the brookings institution in washington : " for the most part the public is so distressed and pessimistic about the economy that that is what 's dominating the campaigns , " he told deutsche welle . international issues on the sidelines the only way foreign policy gets any traction as an election topic is when it relates to a domestic issue , adds mann .
china , for example , plays a role in certain campaigns when trade issues or the currency imbalances are discussed .
and mexico is addressed when illegal immigration and its effect on the economy is debated .
other than that , domestic issues , especially the economy , dominate the midterm elections almost completely .
while foreign policy issues have no impact on the election , the results of the elections could well have an impact on us foreign policy .
if , as most pollsters predict , the republicans win back the house of representatives and stand a small chance of also retaking the senate , this will have implications for the way washington carries out international relations . " there are a lot of republican candidates running for the house who are tea party candidates , who are very hard-right candidates , " douglas foyle , a professor at wesleyan university who has researched about the impact of domestic issues on international relations , told deutsche welle .
" they have n't said too much about foreign policy and so it 's anybody 's guess what they are going to do once they get into office . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president barack obama wo n't be able to get a climate change treaty through the new congress what the tea party candidates have said very clearly however , is that they want to balance the budget .
" if they are going to balance the budget , they will have to cut defense spending because that 's about half of all discretionary federal spending , " notes foyle .
" and pulling back in foreign policy in terms of the military is not something that traditionally the republicans would do . "
future of the republican party his colleague mann also sees a chance of a " significant number of tea party-based republicans coming in to the senate with rather extreme views on the limited role for government and really hostile sentiments toward globalization and international organizations . "
he adds : " if this group were to gain the upper hand in the republican party we would have one center-left party and one extreme-right party in the country .
that 's not reassuring . "
regardless how the soul searching of the republican party ends , the party 's majority in one or both chambers of congress would have an impact on us foreign policy in any case . while the president has considerably more leeway to pursue his own course in international affairs than on the domestic front and also serves as the commander-in-chief of the military , he ca n't disregard congress entirely .
first , congress approves the budget and through that can influence policy as well . " let 's look at afghanistan for example , " juergen chrobog , germany 's former ambassador in washington who now heads the bmw foundation herbert quandt , told deutsche welle : " the troops and the war must be financed .
and here the members of congress have an enormous lever : they can give more or less . "
treaties face tough obstacles what 's more , congress is also needed to ratify international treaties .
even with a sizeable majority in both chambers during the first half of his term , president barack obama could n't get a climate change treaty through congress .
with a republican majority in one or both chambers of congress , predict the experts , a climate change treaty which must be ratified by a two-thirds majority in the senate is all but dead .
the fate of the new start treaty , the follow-up to the original nuclear disarmament pact signed by republican icon ronald reagan and soviet leader mikhail gorbachev , is also uncertain . the lame duck senate will vote on the issue in the middle of november . whether it goes through is still unclear .
if it does n't , it seems rather unlikely that it will have an easier time in the new senate . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us voters worry primarily about the economy and about losing their jobs " i do n't see any major treaties like these being ratified , at least not easily , " says chrobog .
" i hope that president obama and the democrats at least keep their majority in the senate . "
the likely swing to the right in the midterm elections could make us foreign policy less predictable and more complicated , argue the experts .
still , they add , europeans should n't fret too much about the outcome of the polls . " i think the most important thing for those looking from abroad at this election is to realize this is not fundamentally about ideology , " says mann .
" this is about americans being scared and sour and pessimistic about our economic well-being and instinctively voting against the party in power . "

there 's no need to question a perfectly reasonable on-the-nose prediction - at least not when it comes from afar .
another realm , in this case .
here dw sports forward the spooky ones ' predictions for match day ten . match day nine ’ s predictions saw the dw pundits increase their week-on-week total with six points .
not such a special tally , but one that included a surprising spot-on forecast of werder bremen 's 4-1 victory away to borussia moenchengladbach .
to fight the unsubstantiated and scurrilous accusations of match-fixing that have been swirling , dw 's experts are ready to come clean - the spirits made them do it .
they 're still under their control , in fact : here are their picks for week ten .
friday , oct .
29 bayern - freiburg few would have predicted freiburg being above bayern after nine games but the league table does n't lie .
bayern are suffering a crisis of confidence and fluidity in the bundesliga , while the freiburgers are just enjoying their early season ride .
robin dutt ’ s men have notched points against their mid-table rivals but have come unstuck against the better teams .
ordinarily bayern would be included in that latter category , but right now they 're adrift in mediocrity .
however , at home , with a partisan crowd expecting a return to the status quo , bayern should edge it .
prediction : bayern 2-1 saturday , oct .
30 bremen - nuremberg bremen have managed to steady their ship after a choppy start to the season and are unbeaten in five league games .
they still lie in eighth place but show signs of rediscovering the consistency which could see them climb the table .
but this is werder , remember , and nothing can be taken for granted .
they can win 4-1 one week and get thumped by the same scoreline the next .
nuremberg are experiencing the pendulum of form ; winning one week , losing the next .
if it continues to swing , after beating wolfsburg last week , then bremen should come out on top in this one .
prediction : bremen 3-0 wolfsburg - stuttgart bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : keller has got stuttgart winning again and out of danger jens keller is unbeaten as stuttgart coach after taking over from the sacked christian gross two weeks ago , and the four points his team has eked out in their last two league games have taken them out of the drop zone .
confidence is slowly coming back , boosted by recent europa league and dfb cup wins , and while it is still a nascent recovery , vfb do have some momentum at last .
wolfsburg , on the other hand , have lost theirs .
two defeats and a loss have put the skids under their own revival and coming into this match , stuttgart look to have the edge .
stuttgart : 1-0 cologne - hamburg the enigma that is hamburger sv continues to confound .
after an impressive start followed by a worrying slump , hsv are rebuilding their campaign by going three games unbeaten .
two wins and a goalless draw against bayern could have been seen as a solid base to push on , but their 5-2 cup hammering at the hands of frankfurt in midweek may have released old demons .
cologne , however , appear to have little in their locker which could inflict such a heavy defeat on hamburg - in fact , any kind of defeat looks unlikely .
the bottom club have a solitary win to their name and their second isn ’ t likely to come this weekend , even with the benefit of home advantage .
prediction : hamburg 2-0 kaiserslautern - moenchengladbach kaiserslautern 's last win - the impressive 2-0 defeat of bayern - seems a long time ago .
indeed since those heady days of august , when kaiserslautern notched two wins on the trot , all that has followed is a downward spiral of six reversals and a draw , leaving the red devils hovering perilously over the drop zone .
they got a welcome boost with a midweek cup win - but then again so did gladbach .
however , given that gladbach slipped to second-from-bottom after their sixth defeat of the season last weekend , little should be read into that .
these are two teams in deep , albeit it early , trouble .
their desperation may cancel each other out .
prediction : draw 2-2 st. pauli - frankfurt given they were afforded little chance of staying up this season , st- pauli 's current position in 10th could already be hailed as a triumph .
as long as they do n't start panicking that last week 's defeat to stuttgart and their slight tumble down the league is the start of their predicted demise , st. pauli have the guts to slog it out and remain in the bundesliga .
frankfurt sit a place above them on goal difference with an exact replica of the hamburg club 's record to date .
eintracht come into this game on the back of three wins and a draw so they will be up for it against pauli .
expect a gutsy battle .
prediction : draw 1-1 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : raul did n't expect to swap real madrid for a relegation fight schalke - leverkusen things still look desperate for schalke .
their only victory in the league this season , ground out against freiburg over a month ago , looks increasingly like a false dawn .
a defeat and three draws suggests little has been put right since .
their home form has been pitiful and leverkusen will certainly fancy their chances when they make the journey to gelsenkirchen on saturday .
leverkusen have had plenty of joy on their travels .
unbeaten in four away games with three wins and a draw , it appears to be advantage bayer .
schalke 's revival will have to wait at least another week .
prediction : leverkusen 3-2 sunday , oct .
31 mainz - dortmund halloween came early for dortmund in the dfb cup on wednesday .
instead of the treat they might have expected from a fixture against a third division side , they got tricked in a 4-2 loss on penalties at kickers offenbach .
bvb , who have been on fire in front of goal , will be wondering how they went 120 minutes without scoring and will be hoping they find they find the target ahead of this first-versus-second clash .
mainz , who returned to the summit last weekend , also lost in the cup to alemannia aachen so this game is primed for both teams to put their woes behind them .
dortmund will have the added incentive of going top if they win and could take heart from the fact that mainz 's only league defeat so far has come at home .
prediction : dortmund 3-1 hoffenheim - hanover bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hannover 's players are n't suffering from altitude sickness hanover continues to overachieve this season .
up to third after last week 's victory over cologne , they look to have put the brakes on the minor slide which affected them after losing to st. pauli at the start of october .
hoffenheim , meanwhile , are still challenging at the top end but their own push for the summit has suffered a few hiccups in recent weeks .
after three wins on the bounce at the start of the season , it took hoffenheim until two weeks ago to record their next .
keeping dortmund at bay in last week 's 1-1 draw suggests they 've found their balance again but hanover may edge this to keep their impressive campaign on track .

new president dilma rousseff may now push for dominance in the arena of regional nuclear supremacy . workers ' party candidate dilma rousseff was elected as brazil 's first female president on sunday , succeeding her mentor luiz inacio lula da silva . lula has been championing rousseff at least in part to maintain continuity in the country , where he has presided over a period of financial stability , welfare reform , booming consumption , and strong exports of brazil 's abundant natural resources . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dilma will inherit brazil 's nuclear program if elected many observers believe it is lula 's policies - which rousseff is expected to follow - that are boosting her candidacy among the populace .
it appears that the president is not the only one eager to see his legacy continue .
expectations for a new president however , one policy that dilma will inherit - and be expected to expand upon - may draw unwanted international attention .
brazil has been actively seeking to expand its nuclear power structure under lula 's tenure as president and it is expected to develop further under his successor .
" dilma will continue lula 's vision but nuclear ambitions were not a big theme in the electoral campaigns and it will not be a big theme during her administration , " thiago de aragao , the director for latin american political risk analysis at arko advice , a political think-tank in brazil , told deutsche welle . " the brazilians have a single goal : to have the best nuclear capability the country can have , but one step lower , without the atomic bomb . "
brazil has the most advanced nuclear capabilities in latin america with two nuclear power plants - angra i and angra ii - in operation .
a third , angra iii , is under construction .
it has highly skilled scientists , advanced technologies for enriching uranium , and a dependable raw material base .
only argentina provides brazil with any serious competition . ambition : reliable exporter " brazil has a very modern capability of enriching uranium , " de aragao said . according to government sources , brazilian technology is unique and very advanced compared to others , he said .
alongside that , the country has one of the top five uranium reserves in the world . " as an aspiring power , brazil is able to control , or close to controlling , all areas of nuclear capability .
the major ambition is to become a reliable exporter of enriched uranium in the near future . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brazil is building a third angra reactor the advanced state of brazil 's nuclear industry raises the question of whether progress will stop there .
despite being a signatory to a number of relevant accords , brazil 's increased levels of uranium enrichment lend themselves to defense-related applications and technologies .
should it choose to , brazil could become an even more powerful force on the continent , backed with an arsenal of atomic weapons . however , thiago de aragao believes that brazil can assert regional power through its nuclear program without developing weapons . " the brazilian society and the major stakeholders in brazilian politics are still very firm on their positions that brazil should not have a bomb , " he said . " brazil wants to tell the world : ' we have all the capability and technology to have a bomb , but we choose not to , and this should be seen as an example to follow . '
politically , brazil could gain more with this behavior than from having an atomic bomb and causing problems with weaker allies . " civil advances raise possibility of new bomb program whether dilma pursues a weapons program to go along with the potential expansion of civilian nuclear activities remains to be seen .
but while south america currently remains a-bomb free - rumors of a secret weapons program in argentina aside - experts believe that the continent will eventually be forced to accept a nuclear-armed power . that may well be a long time in the future .
but as one of the leaders in most arenas in south america , no-one would bet against brazil taking the lead . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the un 's nuclear watchdog has been refused full access according to a report published by the global security.org think-tank , brazil pursued a covert nuclear weapons program in the mid-1970s , siphoning off material and expertise from its growing civilian projects into parallel military programs .
the pursuit of nuclear weapons accelerated in the 1980s in response to the suspected rival program in argentina , before the secret operation was finally made public in 1988 .
the official stance at the time was that brazil had failed to develop a weapon from its research . to read more about brazil 's nuclear capacities , read below 1/2 ahead send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

new president dilma rousseff may now push for dominance in the arena of regional nuclear supremacy . workers ' party candidate dilma rousseff was elected as brazil 's first female president on sunday , succeeding her mentor luiz inacio lula da silva . lula has been championing rousseff at least in part to maintain continuity in the country , where he has presided over a period of financial stability , welfare reform , booming consumption , and strong exports of brazil 's abundant natural resources . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dilma will inherit brazil 's nuclear program if elected many observers believe it is lula 's policies - which rousseff is expected to follow - that are boosting her candidacy among the populace .
it appears that the president is not the only one eager to see his legacy continue .
expectations for a new president however , one policy that dilma will inherit - and be expected to expand upon - may draw unwanted international attention .
brazil has been actively seeking to expand its nuclear power structure under lula 's tenure as president and it is expected to develop further under his successor .
" dilma will continue lula 's vision but nuclear ambitions were not a big theme in the electoral campaigns and it will not be a big theme during her administration , " thiago de aragao , the director for latin american political risk analysis at arko advice , a political think-tank in brazil , told deutsche welle . " the brazilians have a single goal : to have the best nuclear capability the country can have , but one step lower , without the atomic bomb . "
brazil has the most advanced nuclear capabilities in latin america with two nuclear power plants - angra i and angra ii - in operation .
a third , angra iii , is under construction .
it has highly skilled scientists , advanced technologies for enriching uranium , and a dependable raw material base .
only argentina provides brazil with any serious competition . ambition : reliable exporter " brazil has a very modern capability of enriching uranium , " de aragao said . according to government sources , brazilian technology is unique and very advanced compared to others , he said .
alongside that , the country has one of the top five uranium reserves in the world . " as an aspiring power , brazil is able to control , or close to controlling , all areas of nuclear capability .
the major ambition is to become a reliable exporter of enriched uranium in the near future . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brazil is building a third angra reactor the advanced state of brazil 's nuclear industry raises the question of whether progress will stop there .
despite being a signatory to a number of relevant accords , brazil 's increased levels of uranium enrichment lend themselves to defense-related applications and technologies .
should it choose to , brazil could become an even more powerful force on the continent , backed with an arsenal of atomic weapons . however , thiago de aragao believes that brazil can assert regional power through its nuclear program without developing weapons . " the brazilian society and the major stakeholders in brazilian politics are still very firm on their positions that brazil should not have a bomb , " he said . " brazil wants to tell the world : ' we have all the capability and technology to have a bomb , but we choose not to , and this should be seen as an example to follow . '

" what 's worrying about brazil at the moment is that it ’ s not allowing international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- inspectors to visit all the sites related to its submarine programme and that ’ s raising a lot of questions , bearing in mind their history of trying to start a weapons program , " anthony seaboyer , a nuclear proliferation expert with the german council for foreign relations , told deutsche welle . " we know that technologically and financially , brazil could pursue an arms program , but questions remain , " seaboyer said .
" in reality , they have little to gain from pursuing the bomb .
but if they did , we would n't hear about it until they had already succeeded , which makes the iaea situation all the more worrying . " fears over latin american arms race misplaced brazil 's rise in prominence and confidence is certainly beginning to have an effect on its regional rivals .
argentina 's president cristina fernandez de kirchner has already stated that her country 's own nuclear program will not be allowed to trail behind brazil 's in the race for regional nuclear supremacy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : de kirchner is unwilling to let brazil lead in latin america suspicions remain that buenos aires may have some secret trump cards up its sleeve should the right moment in the power play arise .
brazil , the us and other western states claim that the dictatorial junta which ruled argentina during the1980s was actively pursuing a nuclear weapons program , and that it had required us intervention to prevent it developing into a live deterrent .
some military analysts believe a secret program is still active . " a nuclear brazil would divide latin america , bringing regional integration to a stalemate , " said thiago de aragao .
" its neighbors would not react well and could start a quest on their own for similar technology . " this would n't suit brazil , since there are currently no strategic issues in dispute in the region , de aragao said .
therefore the country has " absolutely no need " to flex its nuclear muscles .
currently in latin america , brazil can gain whatever it wants " without going down the nuclear road , " he said . anthony seaboyer believes that with brazil the preeminent power on the continent at the moment , few of its rivals are currently able to mount a challenge . " argentina is way behind in financial terms , " he said . " it 's massively expensive to finance an arms program and argentina just does n't have the money .
argentina has also been very cooperative with the iaea and has no problem with giving it full access so i think it is unlikely that argentina would engage in any competition with brazil . " as for a latin american arms race , seaboyer considers it " very unlikely " that one will begin at the moment , but added : " if it did happen , it would be a long way down the road .

" what 's worrying about brazil at the moment is that it ’ s not allowing international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- inspectors to visit all the sites related to its submarine programme and that ’ s raising a lot of questions , bearing in mind their history of trying to start a weapons program , " anthony seaboyer , a nuclear proliferation expert with the german council for foreign relations , told deutsche welle . " we know that technologically and financially , brazil could pursue an arms program , but questions remain , " seaboyer said .
" in reality , they have little to gain from pursuing the bomb .
but if they did , we would n't hear about it until they had already succeeded , which makes the iaea situation all the more worrying . " fears over latin american arms race misplaced brazil 's rise in prominence and confidence is certainly beginning to have an effect on its regional rivals .
argentina 's president cristina fernandez de kirchner has already stated that her country 's own nuclear program will not be allowed to trail behind brazil 's in the race for regional nuclear supremacy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : de kirchner is unwilling to let brazil lead in latin america suspicions remain that buenos aires may have some secret trump cards up its sleeve should the right moment in the power play arise .
brazil , the us and other western states claim that the dictatorial junta which ruled argentina during the1980s was actively pursuing a nuclear weapons program , and that it had required us intervention to prevent it developing into a live deterrent .
some military analysts believe a secret program is still active . " a nuclear brazil would divide latin america , bringing regional integration to a stalemate , " said thiago de aragao .
" its neighbors would not react well and could start a quest on their own for similar technology . " this would n't suit brazil , since there are currently no strategic issues in dispute in the region , de aragao said .
therefore the country has " absolutely no need " to flex its nuclear muscles .
currently in latin america , brazil can gain whatever it wants " without going down the nuclear road , " he said . anthony seaboyer believes that with brazil the preeminent power on the continent at the moment , few of its rivals are currently able to mount a challenge . " argentina is way behind in financial terms , " he said . " it 's massively expensive to finance an arms program and argentina just does n't have the money .
argentina has also been very cooperative with the iaea and has no problem with giving it full access so i think it is unlikely that argentina would engage in any competition with brazil . " as for a latin american arms race , seaboyer considers it " very unlikely " that one will begin at the moment , but added : " if it did happen , it would be a long way down the road .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de latin america -pipe- 29.10.2010 brazil 's presidential result revives concerns over nuclear ambitions 1/2 ahead großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dilma rousseff will be expected to continue lula 's policies brazil has become the preeminent latin american nation in recent years , leading in most areas of industry and commerce .
new president dilma rousseff may now push for dominance in the arena of regional nuclear supremacy . workers ' party candidate dilma rousseff was elected as brazil 's first female president on sunday , succeeding her mentor luiz inacio lula da silva . lula has been championing rousseff at least in part to maintain continuity in the country , where he has presided over a period of financial stability , welfare reform , booming consumption , and strong exports of brazil 's abundant natural resources . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dilma will inherit brazil 's nuclear program if elected many observers believe it is lula 's policies - which rousseff is expected to follow - that are boosting her candidacy among the populace .
it appears that the president is not the only one eager to see his legacy continue .
expectations for a new president however , one policy that dilma will inherit - and be expected to expand upon - may draw unwanted international attention .
brazil has been actively seeking to expand its nuclear power structure under lula 's tenure as president and it is expected to develop further under his successor .
" dilma will continue lula 's vision but nuclear ambitions were not a big theme in the electoral campaigns and it will not be a big theme during her administration , " thiago de aragao , the director for latin american political risk analysis at arko advice , a political think-tank in brazil , told deutsche welle . " the brazilians have a single goal : to have the best nuclear capability the country can have , but one step lower , without the atomic bomb . "
brazil has the most advanced nuclear capabilities in latin america with two nuclear power plants - angra i and angra ii - in operation .
a third , angra iii , is under construction .
it has highly skilled scientists , advanced technologies for enriching uranium , and a dependable raw material base .
only argentina provides brazil with any serious competition . ambition : reliable exporter " brazil has a very modern capability of enriching uranium , " de aragao said . according to government sources , brazilian technology is unique and very advanced compared to others , he said .
alongside that , the country has one of the top five uranium reserves in the world . " as an aspiring power , brazil is able to control , or close to controlling , all areas of nuclear capability .
the major ambition is to become a reliable exporter of enriched uranium in the near future . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brazil is building a third angra reactor the advanced state of brazil 's nuclear industry raises the question of whether progress will stop there .
despite being a signatory to a number of relevant accords , brazil 's increased levels of uranium enrichment lend themselves to defense-related applications and technologies .
should it choose to , brazil could become an even more powerful force on the continent , backed with an arsenal of atomic weapons . however , thiago de aragao believes that brazil can assert regional power through its nuclear program without developing weapons . " the brazilian society and the major stakeholders in brazilian politics are still very firm on their positions that brazil should not have a bomb , " he said . " brazil wants to tell the world : ' we have all the capability and technology to have a bomb , but we choose not to , and this should be seen as an example to follow . '
politically , brazil could gain more with this behavior than from having an atomic bomb and causing problems with weaker allies . " civil advances raise possibility of new bomb program whether dilma pursues a weapons program to go along with the potential expansion of civilian nuclear activities remains to be seen .
but while south america currently remains a-bomb free - rumors of a secret weapons program in argentina aside - experts believe that the continent will eventually be forced to accept a nuclear-armed power . that may well be a long time in the future .
but as one of the leaders in most arenas in south america , no-one would bet against brazil taking the lead . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the un 's nuclear watchdog has been refused full access according to a report published by the global security.org think-tank , brazil pursued a covert nuclear weapons program in the mid-1970s , siphoning off material and expertise from its growing civilian projects into parallel military programs .
the pursuit of nuclear weapons accelerated in the 1980s in response to the suspected rival program in argentina , before the secret operation was finally made public in 1988 .
the official stance at the time was that brazil had failed to develop a weapon from its research . to read more about brazil 's nuclear capacities , read below 1/2 ahead send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

there 's no need to question a perfectly reasonable on-the-nose prediction - at least not when it comes from afar .
another realm , in this case .
here dw sports forward the spooky ones ' predictions for match day ten . match day nine ’ s predictions saw the dw pundits increase their week-on-week total with six points .
not such a special tally , but one that included a surprising spot-on forecast of werder bremen 's 4-1 victory away to borussia moenchengladbach .
to fight the unsubstantiated and scurrilous accusations of match-fixing that have been swirling , dw 's experts are ready to come clean - the spirits made them do it .
they 're still under their control , in fact : here are their picks for week ten .
friday , oct .
29 bayern - freiburg few would have predicted freiburg being above bayern after nine games but the league table does n't lie .
bayern are suffering a crisis of confidence and fluidity in the bundesliga , while the freiburgers are just enjoying their early season ride .
robin dutt ’ s men have notched points against their mid-table rivals but have come unstuck against the better teams .
ordinarily bayern would be included in that latter category , but right now they 're adrift in mediocrity .
however , at home , with a partisan crowd expecting a return to the status quo , bayern should edge it .
prediction : bayern 2-1 saturday , oct .
30 bremen - nuremberg bremen have managed to steady their ship after a choppy start to the season and are unbeaten in five league games .
they still lie in eighth place but show signs of rediscovering the consistency which could see them climb the table .
but this is werder , remember , and nothing can be taken for granted .
they can win 4-1 one week and get thumped by the same scoreline the next .
nuremberg are experiencing the pendulum of form ; winning one week , losing the next .
if it continues to swing , after beating wolfsburg last week , then bremen should come out on top in this one .
prediction : bremen 3-0 wolfsburg - stuttgart bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : keller has got stuttgart winning again and out of danger jens keller is unbeaten as stuttgart coach after taking over from the sacked christian gross two weeks ago , and the four points his team has eked out in their last two league games have taken them out of the drop zone .
confidence is slowly coming back , boosted by recent europa league and dfb cup wins , and while it is still a nascent recovery , vfb do have some momentum at last .
wolfsburg , on the other hand , have lost theirs .
two defeats and a loss have put the skids under their own revival and coming into this match , stuttgart look to have the edge .
stuttgart : 1-0 cologne - hamburg the enigma that is hamburger sv continues to confound .
after an impressive start followed by a worrying slump , hsv are rebuilding their campaign by going three games unbeaten .
two wins and a goalless draw against bayern could have been seen as a solid base to push on , but their 5-2 cup hammering at the hands of frankfurt in midweek may have released old demons .
cologne , however , appear to have little in their locker which could inflict such a heavy defeat on hamburg - in fact , any kind of defeat looks unlikely .
the bottom club have a solitary win to their name and their second isn ’ t likely to come this weekend , even with the benefit of home advantage .
prediction : hamburg 2-0 kaiserslautern - moenchengladbach kaiserslautern 's last win - the impressive 2-0 defeat of bayern - seems a long time ago .
indeed since those heady days of august , when kaiserslautern notched two wins on the trot , all that has followed is a downward spiral of six reversals and a draw , leaving the red devils hovering perilously over the drop zone .
they got a welcome boost with a midweek cup win - but then again so did gladbach .
however , given that gladbach slipped to second-from-bottom after their sixth defeat of the season last weekend , little should be read into that .
these are two teams in deep , albeit it early , trouble .
their desperation may cancel each other out .
prediction : draw 2-2 st. pauli - frankfurt given they were afforded little chance of staying up this season , st- pauli 's current position in 10th could already be hailed as a triumph .
as long as they do n't start panicking that last week 's defeat to stuttgart and their slight tumble down the league is the start of their predicted demise , st. pauli have the guts to slog it out and remain in the bundesliga .
frankfurt sit a place above them on goal difference with an exact replica of the hamburg club 's record to date .
eintracht come into this game on the back of three wins and a draw so they will be up for it against pauli .
expect a gutsy battle .
prediction : draw 1-1 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : raul did n't expect to swap real madrid for a relegation fight schalke - leverkusen things still look desperate for schalke .
their only victory in the league this season , ground out against freiburg over a month ago , looks increasingly like a false dawn .
a defeat and three draws suggests little has been put right since .
their home form has been pitiful and leverkusen will certainly fancy their chances when they make the journey to gelsenkirchen on saturday .
leverkusen have had plenty of joy on their travels .
unbeaten in four away games with three wins and a draw , it appears to be advantage bayer .
schalke 's revival will have to wait at least another week .
prediction : leverkusen 3-2 sunday , oct .
31 mainz - dortmund halloween came early for dortmund in the dfb cup on wednesday .
instead of the treat they might have expected from a fixture against a third division side , they got tricked in a 4-2 loss on penalties at kickers offenbach .
bvb , who have been on fire in front of goal , will be wondering how they went 120 minutes without scoring and will be hoping they find they find the target ahead of this first-versus-second clash .
mainz , who returned to the summit last weekend , also lost in the cup to alemannia aachen so this game is primed for both teams to put their woes behind them .
dortmund will have the added incentive of going top if they win and could take heart from the fact that mainz 's only league defeat so far has come at home .
prediction : dortmund 3-1 hoffenheim - hanover bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hannover 's players are n't suffering from altitude sickness hanover continues to overachieve this season .
up to third after last week 's victory over cologne , they look to have put the brakes on the minor slide which affected them after losing to st. pauli at the start of october .
hoffenheim , meanwhile , are still challenging at the top end but their own push for the summit has suffered a few hiccups in recent weeks .
after three wins on the bounce at the start of the season , it took hoffenheim until two weeks ago to record their next .
keeping dortmund at bay in last week 's 1-1 draw suggests they 've found their balance again but hanover may edge this to keep their impressive campaign on track .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : focus : midterm elections in the us eu and us ' must work together , ' says diplomat obama seeks to mobilize disappointed voters foreign donations spark row ahead of us midterm elections european companies back climate skeptics in us senate race , report says elections -pipe- 29.10.2010 shift to the right in midterm elections could affect us foreign policy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the foreign policy leanings of many tea party candidates are unclear the issue of us foreign policy has hardly played a role in the congressional midterm elections campaign .
however , the outcome might well have an impact on washington 's relations with the rest of the world . when american voters head to the polls to elect a new house of representatives and 37 new senators , there is perhaps nothing that sums up their sentiment better than the old adage from bill clinton 's 1992 presidential campaign : " it 's the economy , stupid . " and with unemployment hovering at close to 10 percent , a collapsed housing market and a stuttering economy , there certainly is ample reason for voters to worry about their personal well-being . to be sure , there are definitely enough foreign policy issues that would merit the electorate 's attention too : a war in afghanistan , now in its ninth year , which is not going well , a tense situation in the middle east with us-sponsored negotiations between israelis and palestinians always on the verge of collapse , iran 's alleged efforts to acquire nuclear weapons still unresolved and north korea in the middle of a leadership handover .
but all of that does n't really matter , says thomas e. mann , a congressional scholar at the brookings institution in washington : " for the most part the public is so distressed and pessimistic about the economy that that is what 's dominating the campaigns , " he told deutsche welle . international issues on the sidelines the only way foreign policy gets any traction as an election topic is when it relates to a domestic issue , adds mann .
china , for example , plays a role in certain campaigns when trade issues or the currency imbalances are discussed .
and mexico is addressed when illegal immigration and its effect on the economy is debated .
other than that , domestic issues , especially the economy , dominate the midterm elections almost completely .
while foreign policy issues have no impact on the election , the results of the elections could well have an impact on us foreign policy .
if , as most pollsters predict , the republicans win back the house of representatives and stand a small chance of also retaking the senate , this will have implications for the way washington carries out international relations . " there are a lot of republican candidates running for the house who are tea party candidates , who are very hard-right candidates , " douglas foyle , a professor at wesleyan university who has researched about the impact of domestic issues on international relations , told deutsche welle .
" they have n't said too much about foreign policy and so it 's anybody 's guess what they are going to do once they get into office . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president barack obama wo n't be able to get a climate change treaty through the new congress what the tea party candidates have said very clearly however , is that they want to balance the budget .
" if they are going to balance the budget , they will have to cut defense spending because that 's about half of all discretionary federal spending , " notes foyle .
" and pulling back in foreign policy in terms of the military is not something that traditionally the republicans would do . "
future of the republican party his colleague mann also sees a chance of a " significant number of tea party-based republicans coming in to the senate with rather extreme views on the limited role for government and really hostile sentiments toward globalization and international organizations . "
he adds : " if this group were to gain the upper hand in the republican party we would have one center-left party and one extreme-right party in the country .
that 's not reassuring . "
regardless how the soul searching of the republican party ends , the party 's majority in one or both chambers of congress would have an impact on us foreign policy in any case . while the president has considerably more leeway to pursue his own course in international affairs than on the domestic front and also serves as the commander-in-chief of the military , he ca n't disregard congress entirely .
first , congress approves the budget and through that can influence policy as well . " let 's look at afghanistan for example , " juergen chrobog , germany 's former ambassador in washington who now heads the bmw foundation herbert quandt , told deutsche welle : " the troops and the war must be financed .
and here the members of congress have an enormous lever : they can give more or less . "
treaties face tough obstacles what 's more , congress is also needed to ratify international treaties .
even with a sizeable majority in both chambers during the first half of his term , president barack obama could n't get a climate change treaty through congress .
with a republican majority in one or both chambers of congress , predict the experts , a climate change treaty which must be ratified by a two-thirds majority in the senate is all but dead .
the fate of the new start treaty , the follow-up to the original nuclear disarmament pact signed by republican icon ronald reagan and soviet leader mikhail gorbachev , is also uncertain . the lame duck senate will vote on the issue in the middle of november . whether it goes through is still unclear .
if it does n't , it seems rather unlikely that it will have an easier time in the new senate . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us voters worry primarily about the economy and about losing their jobs " i do n't see any major treaties like these being ratified , at least not easily , " says chrobog .
" i hope that president obama and the democrats at least keep their majority in the senate . "
the likely swing to the right in the midterm elections could make us foreign policy less predictable and more complicated , argue the experts .
still , they add , europeans should n't fret too much about the outcome of the polls . " i think the most important thing for those looking from abroad at this election is to realize this is not fundamentally about ideology , " says mann .
" this is about americans being scared and sour and pessimistic about our economic well-being and instinctively voting against the party in power . "

but now the eu wants to make patent protection easier and less expensive for the bloc 's inventors . the economic crisis has n't put european companies and independent inventors off investing into research and development .
judged by the some 60,000 patents issued so far this year in germany , the country 's is on track to meet 2009 's total . " companies followed experts ' advice and continued investing in new products - even though we were in the middle of a crisis , " bettina berner of the german patent and trade mark office -lrb- dpma -rrb- said on thursday at the opening ceremony of the 62nd edition of the inventors ' trade fair iena in nuremberg . hoping for a break through bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some 800 products , like an unpoppable tire , are on display at the iena trade fair inventors from 37 countries are currently presenting some 800 new products at the fair , which the organizers said is the largest of its kind in the world . rollerblades , the folding bicycle and inflatable water wings are some of products that went on to conquer the world after being presented in nuremberg .
like their successful predecessors , many inventors at this year 's fair are hoping for break-through deals with the industry so their products can be mass-produced . shaky hands ?

" when you 're carrying beer glasses on a tray across wobbly grass in a beer garden , the glasses break easily if you do n't attach them , " haehnsen said , adding that the willomat tray could also facilitate work in hospitals and help anyone with shaky hands . register first , then show it bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moreau 's idea came when he saw a report about delayed flights other products on display at iena this year include a foldable chair attached to a suitcase , invented by 12-year-old johannes von moreau , and a remote control for model sports cars which can be used with one hand rather than two . the two inventors kevin hummel and nicolas rathauser have registered their product with the munich-based german patent office -lrb- dpma -rrb- already .
that 's a step experts strongly recommend . " many independent inventors do n't have their products registered before they present them at a trade fair , " said dpma spokesperson berner . lengthy , costly patent process but inventors who want to protect their product in more than one european country currently have to undergo a tedious and costly process that begins with registration at the european patent office . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : inventors register their products here : the european patent office in munich " you have to decide in how many countries you want to have your patent validated , " heinrich dornbusch , a consultant with german patent marketing agency provendis , told deutsche welle .
" currently you have to do that separately in every single member state .
this means you have to invest a lot of time and money . " the costs for registering a product in 13 of the eu 's 27 countries , for instance , can easily amount to more than 20,000 euros -lrb- $ 28,000 -rrb- - 10 times the cost of a patent in the united states , according to dornbusch three languages sufficient the laborious validation process needs simplification , said stefaan de rynck from the internal market and services division at the european commission . " we want to get rid of the procedure where you have to translate a patent into all languages in order for it to be valid , " he told deutsche welle .
" patents should be valid across the eu if they are in english , french or german . " this would considerably lower registration costs as the largest part currently goes into translating the relevant documents into the individual countries ' languages . authors : nina haase , brigitta moll -lrb- dpa , ap -rrb- editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

judged by the some 60,000 patents issued so far this year in germany , the country 's is on track to meet 2009 's total .

here dw sports forward the spooky ones ' predictions for match day ten . match day nine ’ s predictions saw the dw pundits increase their week-on-week total with six points .
not such a special tally , but one that included a surprising spot-on forecast of werder bremen 's 4-1 victory away to borussia moenchengladbach .
to fight the unsubstantiated and scurrilous accusations of match-fixing that have been swirling , dw 's experts are ready to come clean - the spirits made them do it .
they 're still under their control , in fact : here are their picks for week ten .
friday , oct .
29 bayern - freiburg few would have predicted freiburg being above bayern after nine games but the league table does n't lie .
bayern are suffering a crisis of confidence and fluidity in the bundesliga , while the freiburgers are just enjoying their early season ride .
robin dutt ’ s men have notched points against their mid-table rivals but have come unstuck against the better teams .
ordinarily bayern would be included in that latter category , but right now they 're adrift in mediocrity .
however , at home , with a partisan crowd expecting a return to the status quo , bayern should edge it .
prediction : bayern 2-1 saturday , oct .
30 bremen - nuremberg bremen have managed to steady their ship after a choppy start to the season and are unbeaten in five league games .
they still lie in eighth place but show signs of rediscovering the consistency which could see them climb the table .
but this is werder , remember , and nothing can be taken for granted .
they can win 4-1 one week and get thumped by the same scoreline the next .
nuremberg are experiencing the pendulum of form ; winning one week , losing the next .
if it continues to swing , after beating wolfsburg last week , then bremen should come out on top in this one .
prediction : bremen 3-0 wolfsburg - stuttgart bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : keller has got stuttgart winning again and out of danger jens keller is unbeaten as stuttgart coach after taking over from the sacked christian gross two weeks ago , and the four points his team has eked out in their last two league games have taken them out of the drop zone .
confidence is slowly coming back , boosted by recent europa league and dfb cup wins , and while it is still a nascent recovery , vfb do have some momentum at last .
wolfsburg , on the other hand , have lost theirs .
two defeats and a loss have put the skids under their own revival and coming into this match , stuttgart look to have the edge .
stuttgart : 1-0 cologne - hamburg the enigma that is hamburger sv continues to confound .
after an impressive start followed by a worrying slump , hsv are rebuilding their campaign by going three games unbeaten .
two wins and a goalless draw against bayern could have been seen as a solid base to push on , but their 5-2 cup hammering at the hands of frankfurt in midweek may have released old demons .
cologne , however , appear to have little in their locker which could inflict such a heavy defeat on hamburg - in fact , any kind of defeat looks unlikely .
the bottom club have a solitary win to their name and their second isn ’ t likely to come this weekend , even with the benefit of home advantage .
prediction : hamburg 2-0 kaiserslautern - moenchengladbach kaiserslautern 's last win - the impressive 2-0 defeat of bayern - seems a long time ago .
indeed since those heady days of august , when kaiserslautern notched two wins on the trot , all that has followed is a downward spiral of six reversals and a draw , leaving the red devils hovering perilously over the drop zone .
they got a welcome boost with a midweek cup win - but then again so did gladbach .
however , given that gladbach slipped to second-from-bottom after their sixth defeat of the season last weekend , little should be read into that .
these are two teams in deep , albeit it early , trouble .
their desperation may cancel each other out .
prediction : draw 2-2 st. pauli - frankfurt given they were afforded little chance of staying up this season , st- pauli 's current position in 10th could already be hailed as a triumph .
as long as they do n't start panicking that last week 's defeat to stuttgart and their slight tumble down the league is the start of their predicted demise , st. pauli have the guts to slog it out and remain in the bundesliga .
frankfurt sit a place above them on goal difference with an exact replica of the hamburg club 's record to date .
eintracht come into this game on the back of three wins and a draw so they will be up for it against pauli .
expect a gutsy battle .
prediction : draw 1-1 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : raul did n't expect to swap real madrid for a relegation fight schalke - leverkusen things still look desperate for schalke .
their only victory in the league this season , ground out against freiburg over a month ago , looks increasingly like a false dawn .
a defeat and three draws suggests little has been put right since .
their home form has been pitiful and leverkusen will certainly fancy their chances when they make the journey to gelsenkirchen on saturday .
leverkusen have had plenty of joy on their travels .
unbeaten in four away games with three wins and a draw , it appears to be advantage bayer .
schalke 's revival will have to wait at least another week .
prediction : leverkusen 3-2 sunday , oct .
31 mainz - dortmund halloween came early for dortmund in the dfb cup on wednesday .
instead of the treat they might have expected from a fixture against a third division side , they got tricked in a 4-2 loss on penalties at kickers offenbach .
bvb , who have been on fire in front of goal , will be wondering how they went 120 minutes without scoring and will be hoping they find they find the target ahead of this first-versus-second clash .
mainz , who returned to the summit last weekend , also lost in the cup to alemannia aachen so this game is primed for both teams to put their woes behind them .
dortmund will have the added incentive of going top if they win and could take heart from the fact that mainz 's only league defeat so far has come at home .
prediction : dortmund 3-1 hoffenheim - hanover bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hannover 's players are n't suffering from altitude sickness hanover continues to overachieve this season .
up to third after last week 's victory over cologne , they look to have put the brakes on the minor slide which affected them after losing to st. pauli at the start of october .
hoffenheim , meanwhile , are still challenging at the top end but their own push for the summit has suffered a few hiccups in recent weeks .
after three wins on the bounce at the start of the season , it took hoffenheim until two weeks ago to record their next .
keeping dortmund at bay in last week 's 1-1 draw suggests they 've found their balance again but hanover may edge this to keep their impressive campaign on track .

however , the outcome might well have an impact on washington 's relations with the rest of the world . when american voters head to the polls to elect a new house of representatives and 37 new senators , there is perhaps nothing that sums up their sentiment better than the old adage from bill clinton 's 1992 presidential campaign : " it 's the economy , stupid . " and with unemployment hovering at close to 10 percent , a collapsed housing market and a stuttering economy , there certainly is ample reason for voters to worry about their personal well-being . to be sure , there are definitely enough foreign policy issues that would merit the electorate 's attention too : a war in afghanistan , now in its ninth year , which is not going well , a tense situation in the middle east with us-sponsored negotiations between israelis and palestinians always on the verge of collapse , iran 's alleged efforts to acquire nuclear weapons still unresolved and north korea in the middle of a leadership handover .
but all of that does n't really matter , says thomas e. mann , a congressional scholar at the brookings institution in washington : " for the most part the public is so distressed and pessimistic about the economy that that is what 's dominating the campaigns , " he told deutsche welle . international issues on the sidelines the only way foreign policy gets any traction as an election topic is when it relates to a domestic issue , adds mann .
china , for example , plays a role in certain campaigns when trade issues or the currency imbalances are discussed .

other than that , domestic issues , especially the economy , dominate the midterm elections almost completely .
while foreign policy issues have no impact on the election , the results of the elections could well have an impact on us foreign policy .

" and pulling back in foreign policy in terms of the military is not something that traditionally the republicans would do . "
future of the republican party his colleague mann also sees a chance of a " significant number of tea party-based republicans coming in to the senate with rather extreme views on the limited role for government and really hostile sentiments toward globalization and international organizations . "
he adds : " if this group were to gain the upper hand in the republican party we would have one center-left party and one extreme-right party in the country .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president barack obama wo n't be able to get a climate change treaty through the new congress what the tea party candidates have said very clearly however , is that they want to balance the budget .
" if they are going to balance the budget , they will have to cut defense spending because that 's about half of all discretionary federal spending , " notes foyle .
" and pulling back in foreign policy in terms of the military is not something that traditionally the republicans would do . "
future of the republican party his colleague mann also sees a chance of a " significant number of tea party-based republicans coming in to the senate with rather extreme views on the limited role for government and really hostile sentiments toward globalization and international organizations . "
he adds : " if this group were to gain the upper hand in the republican party we would have one center-left party and one extreme-right party in the country .
that 's not reassuring . "
regardless how the soul searching of the republican party ends , the party 's majority in one or both chambers of congress would have an impact on us foreign policy in any case . while the president has considerably more leeway to pursue his own course in international affairs than on the domestic front and also serves as the commander-in-chief of the military , he ca n't disregard congress entirely .
first , congress approves the budget and through that can influence policy as well . " let 's look at afghanistan for example , " juergen chrobog , germany 's former ambassador in washington who now heads the bmw foundation herbert quandt , told deutsche welle : " the troops and the war must be financed .
and here the members of congress have an enormous lever : they can give more or less . "
treaties face tough obstacles what 's more , congress is also needed to ratify international treaties .
even with a sizeable majority in both chambers during the first half of his term , president barack obama could n't get a climate change treaty through congress .
with a republican majority in one or both chambers of congress , predict the experts , a climate change treaty which must be ratified by a two-thirds majority in the senate is all but dead .
the fate of the new start treaty , the follow-up to the original nuclear disarmament pact signed by republican icon ronald reagan and soviet leader mikhail gorbachev , is also uncertain . the lame duck senate will vote on the issue in the middle of november . whether it goes through is still unclear .
if it does n't , it seems rather unlikely that it will have an easier time in the new senate . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us voters worry primarily about the economy and about losing their jobs " i do n't see any major treaties like these being ratified , at least not easily , " says chrobog .
" i hope that president obama and the democrats at least keep their majority in the senate . "
the likely swing to the right in the midterm elections could make us foreign policy less predictable and more complicated , argue the experts .
still , they add , europeans should n't fret too much about the outcome of the polls . " i think the most important thing for those looking from abroad at this election is to realize this is not fundamentally about ideology , " says mann .
" this is about americans being scared and sour and pessimistic about our economic well-being and instinctively voting against the party in power . "

but now the eu wants to make patent protection easier and less expensive for the bloc 's inventors . the economic crisis has n't put european companies and independent inventors off investing into research and development .
judged by the some 60,000 patents issued so far this year in germany , the country 's is on track to meet 2009 's total . " companies followed experts ' advice and continued investing in new products - even though we were in the middle of a crisis , " bettina berner of the german patent and trade mark office -lrb- dpma -rrb- said on thursday at the opening ceremony of the 62nd edition of the inventors ' trade fair iena in nuremberg . hoping for a break through bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some 800 products , like an unpoppable tire , are on display at the iena trade fair inventors from 37 countries are currently presenting some 800 new products at the fair , which the organizers said is the largest of its kind in the world . rollerblades , the folding bicycle and inflatable water wings are some of products that went on to conquer the world after being presented in nuremberg .
like their successful predecessors , many inventors at this year 's fair are hoping for break-through deals with the industry so their products can be mass-produced . shaky hands ?
no problem ! bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the willomat tray lets the clumsy wait tables - without worrying guests bernhard haehnsen is one such inventor .
the former ship 's captain grew tired moping up after glasses spilled their contents as his ship pitched on the high seas .
his neighbor barbara willomat designed a way to stabilize glasses and cups on trays .
special suction cups which can be fixed on a tray hold retainers in different shapes and sizes . " when you 're carrying beer glasses on a tray across wobbly grass in a beer garden , the glasses break easily if you do n't attach them , " haehnsen said , adding that the willomat tray could also facilitate work in hospitals and help anyone with shaky hands . register first , then show it bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moreau 's idea came when he saw a report about delayed flights other products on display at iena this year include a foldable chair attached to a suitcase , invented by 12-year-old johannes von moreau , and a remote control for model sports cars which can be used with one hand rather than two . the two inventors kevin hummel and nicolas rathauser have registered their product with the munich-based german patent office -lrb- dpma -rrb- already .
that 's a step experts strongly recommend . " many independent inventors do n't have their products registered before they present them at a trade fair , " said dpma spokesperson berner . lengthy , costly patent process but inventors who want to protect their product in more than one european country currently have to undergo a tedious and costly process that begins with registration at the european patent office . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : inventors register their products here : the european patent office in munich " you have to decide in how many countries you want to have your patent validated , " heinrich dornbusch , a consultant with german patent marketing agency provendis , told deutsche welle .
" currently you have to do that separately in every single member state .
this means you have to invest a lot of time and money . " the costs for registering a product in 13 of the eu 's 27 countries , for instance , can easily amount to more than 20,000 euros -lrb- $ 28,000 -rrb- - 10 times the cost of a patent in the united states , according to dornbusch three languages sufficient the laborious validation process needs simplification , said stefaan de rynck from the internal market and services division at the european commission . " we want to get rid of the procedure where you have to translate a patent into all languages in order for it to be valid , " he told deutsche welle .
" patents should be valid across the eu if they are in english , french or german .

there 's no need to question a perfectly reasonable on-the-nose prediction - at least not when it comes from afar .
another realm , in this case .
here dw sports forward the spooky ones ' predictions for match day ten . match day nine ’ s predictions saw the dw pundits increase their week-on-week total with six points .
not such a special tally , but one that included a surprising spot-on forecast of werder bremen 's 4-1 victory away to borussia moenchengladbach .
to fight the unsubstantiated and scurrilous accusations of match-fixing that have been swirling , dw 's experts are ready to come clean - the spirits made them do it .
they 're still under their control , in fact : here are their picks for week ten .
friday , oct .
29 bayern - freiburg few would have predicted freiburg being above bayern after nine games but the league table does n't lie .
bayern are suffering a crisis of confidence and fluidity in the bundesliga , while the freiburgers are just enjoying their early season ride .
robin dutt ’ s men have notched points against their mid-table rivals but have come unstuck against the better teams .
ordinarily bayern would be included in that latter category , but right now they 're adrift in mediocrity .
however , at home , with a partisan crowd expecting a return to the status quo , bayern should edge it .
prediction : bayern 2-1 saturday , oct .
30 bremen - nuremberg bremen have managed to steady their ship after a choppy start to the season and are unbeaten in five league games .
they still lie in eighth place but show signs of rediscovering the consistency which could see them climb the table .
but this is werder , remember , and nothing can be taken for granted .
they can win 4-1 one week and get thumped by the same scoreline the next .
nuremberg are experiencing the pendulum of form ; winning one week , losing the next .
if it continues to swing , after beating wolfsburg last week , then bremen should come out on top in this one .
prediction : bremen 3-0 wolfsburg - stuttgart bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : keller has got stuttgart winning again and out of danger jens keller is unbeaten as stuttgart coach after taking over from the sacked christian gross two weeks ago , and the four points his team has eked out in their last two league games have taken them out of the drop zone .
confidence is slowly coming back , boosted by recent europa league and dfb cup wins , and while it is still a nascent recovery , vfb do have some momentum at last .
wolfsburg , on the other hand , have lost theirs .
two defeats and a loss have put the skids under their own revival and coming into this match , stuttgart look to have the edge .
stuttgart : 1-0 cologne - hamburg the enigma that is hamburger sv continues to confound .
after an impressive start followed by a worrying slump , hsv are rebuilding their campaign by going three games unbeaten .
two wins and a goalless draw against bayern could have been seen as a solid base to push on , but their 5-2 cup hammering at the hands of frankfurt in midweek may have released old demons .
cologne , however , appear to have little in their locker which could inflict such a heavy defeat on hamburg - in fact , any kind of defeat looks unlikely .
the bottom club have a solitary win to their name and their second isn ’ t likely to come this weekend , even with the benefit of home advantage .
prediction : hamburg 2-0 kaiserslautern - moenchengladbach kaiserslautern 's last win - the impressive 2-0 defeat of bayern - seems a long time ago .
indeed since those heady days of august , when kaiserslautern notched two wins on the trot , all that has followed is a downward spiral of six reversals and a draw , leaving the red devils hovering perilously over the drop zone .
they got a welcome boost with a midweek cup win - but then again so did gladbach .
however , given that gladbach slipped to second-from-bottom after their sixth defeat of the season last weekend , little should be read into that .
these are two teams in deep , albeit it early , trouble .
their desperation may cancel each other out .
prediction : draw 2-2 st. pauli - frankfurt given they were afforded little chance of staying up this season , st- pauli 's current position in 10th could already be hailed as a triumph .
as long as they do n't start panicking that last week 's defeat to stuttgart and their slight tumble down the league is the start of their predicted demise , st. pauli have the guts to slog it out and remain in the bundesliga .
frankfurt sit a place above them on goal difference with an exact replica of the hamburg club 's record to date .
eintracht come into this game on the back of three wins and a draw so they will be up for it against pauli .
expect a gutsy battle .
prediction : draw 1-1 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : raul did n't expect to swap real madrid for a relegation fight schalke - leverkusen things still look desperate for schalke .
their only victory in the league this season , ground out against freiburg over a month ago , looks increasingly like a false dawn .
a defeat and three draws suggests little has been put right since .
their home form has been pitiful and leverkusen will certainly fancy their chances when they make the journey to gelsenkirchen on saturday .
leverkusen have had plenty of joy on their travels .
unbeaten in four away games with three wins and a draw , it appears to be advantage bayer .
schalke 's revival will have to wait at least another week .
prediction : leverkusen 3-2 sunday , oct .
31 mainz - dortmund halloween came early for dortmund in the dfb cup on wednesday .
instead of the treat they might have expected from a fixture against a third division side , they got tricked in a 4-2 loss on penalties at kickers offenbach .
bvb , who have been on fire in front of goal , will be wondering how they went 120 minutes without scoring and will be hoping they find they find the target ahead of this first-versus-second clash .
mainz , who returned to the summit last weekend , also lost in the cup to alemannia aachen so this game is primed for both teams to put their woes behind them .
dortmund will have the added incentive of going top if they win and could take heart from the fact that mainz 's only league defeat so far has come at home .
prediction : dortmund 3-1 hoffenheim - hanover bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hannover 's players are n't suffering from altitude sickness hanover continues to overachieve this season .
up to third after last week 's victory over cologne , they look to have put the brakes on the minor slide which affected them after losing to st. pauli at the start of october .
hoffenheim , meanwhile , are still challenging at the top end but their own push for the summit has suffered a few hiccups in recent weeks .
after three wins on the bounce at the start of the season , it took hoffenheim until two weeks ago to record their next .
keeping dortmund at bay in last week 's 1-1 draw suggests they 've found their balance again but hanover may edge this to keep their impressive campaign on track .
prediction : hannover 1-0 last week 's results : 6 points hamburg - bayern 0-0 -lrb- dw prediction : 1-2 -rrb- frankfurt - schalke 0-0 -lrb- dw prediction : 2-2 -rrb- moenchengladbach - werder bremen 1-4 -lrb- dw prediction : 1-4 -rrb- freiburg - kaiserslautern 2-1 -lrb- dw prediction : 1-1 -rrb- hanover - cologne 2-1 -lrb- dw prediction : 1-0 -rrb- nuremberg - wolfsburg 2-1 -lrb- dw prediction : 1-2 -rrb- dortmund - hoffenheim 1-1 -lrb- dw prediction : 2-0 -rrb- leverkusen - mainz 0-1 -lrb- dw prediction : 2-1 -rrb- stuttgart - st.pauli 2-0 -lrb- dw prediction : 1-2 -rrb- total for the season : 43 three points for a correct score prediction two points for a correct margin prediction one point for a correct winner prediction author : nick amies editor : matt hermann send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

dw 's ramon garcia-ziemsen writes about how germany 's history was deliberately repressed . yes , it is shocking how german diplomats were complicit in the holocaust in the second world war , and how they were involved in its implementation .
it 's unbelievable how much continuity there was in the diplomatic personnel after 1945 in germany : men who had participated in the nazi extermination policies later made careers and protected each other , even before their involvement was made public .
but it 's just as incredible how long it has taken : that only now , 65 years on , this has come to the attention of the wider german public .
in 1979 , a book was published by a british historian about the participation of the foreign office in the so called " final solution , " the nazi description for the murder of european jews .
the book describes what the nature of the foreign office 's participation in the holocaust was , how deportation orders were signed there , how the office was a systematic element of the nazi killing machine .
and even back in the 1950s , there was clear evidence showing that the foreign office was certainly not a " school of passive resistance " against hitler , as it liked to present itself in the post-war period .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ramon garcia-ziemsen head of dw 's german culture department a lot was known , a lot was forgotten in short : much was known .
and almost everything was forgotten .
how the germans dealt with the third reich is not as exemplary as it has often been perceived around the world , it is also a history of forgetting and repressing .
the elites have often knowingly prevented a discussion about their past .
and the public allowed this discourse to be prevented .
how could this happen ? after 1945 , german society was always looking for the " good , " for the " other germany " - the " other germany " that had remained innocent , that had perhaps not been openly resistant , but did not allow itself to be sucked into nazi ideology ; which had remained resistant , which had rejected the nazi madness , and of which one might even be proud .
because it wanted a fresh start , the young germany did not think it could live with the weight of such a large feeling of guilt .
myths and collective guilt and in this way the yarn was spun : first came the myth that many germans had only found out about the holocaust in 1945 from the allies .
the myth was born that only a small group around hitler had known what had happened in concentration camps like auschwitz and dachau .
the germans were a nation led astray .
this position was also of course a reaction to the similarly blanket collective guilt theory purported by the allies after the war . then came the myth of the armed forces : that the soldiers had played almost no part in hitler 's atrocities - and besides that everything had been carried out under orders .
both theories were exposed by historians as false only decades later , from the 1970s , through studies , books and exhibitions .
large parts of the population knew not only why jewish friends and neighbors had suddenly disappeared , but they had also assisted with this disappearance .
soldiers took part in shooting jews - voluntarily and not under orders .
but again it took years and decades , well into the 1990s , until this knowledge resulted in a public debate and led to a real demystification . where the myth certainly still existed was in the foreign office , one of the last places where the fairy tale of the " other germany " could live on .
the solidarity of the diplomats worked so well and perhaps the respect for the future german president richard von weizsaecker was too great .
weizsaecker 's father ernst was a top diplomat , who supported the nazi ideology in the foreign office .
but germany 's longing for this " other germany " , which existed much less than most germans had thought , was also too great .

dw 's ramon garcia-ziemsen writes about how germany 's history was deliberately repressed . yes , it is shocking how german diplomats were complicit in the holocaust in the second world war , and how they were involved in its implementation .
it 's unbelievable how much continuity there was in the diplomatic personnel after 1945 in germany : men who had participated in the nazi extermination policies later made careers and protected each other , even before their involvement was made public .
but it 's just as incredible how long it has taken : that only now , 65 years on , this has come to the attention of the wider german public .
in 1979 , a book was published by a british historian about the participation of the foreign office in the so called " final solution , " the nazi description for the murder of european jews .
the book describes what the nature of the foreign office 's participation in the holocaust was , how deportation orders were signed there , how the office was a systematic element of the nazi killing machine .
and even back in the 1950s , there was clear evidence showing that the foreign office was certainly not a " school of passive resistance " against hitler , as it liked to present itself in the post-war period .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ramon garcia-ziemsen head of dw 's german culture department a lot was known , a lot was forgotten in short : much was known .
and almost everything was forgotten .
how the germans dealt with the third reich is not as exemplary as it has often been perceived around the world , it is also a history of forgetting and repressing .
the elites have often knowingly prevented a discussion about their past .
and the public allowed this discourse to be prevented .
how could this happen ? after 1945 , german society was always looking for the " good , " for the " other germany " - the " other germany " that had remained innocent , that had perhaps not been openly resistant , but did not allow itself to be sucked into nazi ideology ; which had remained resistant , which had rejected the nazi madness , and of which one might even be proud .
because it wanted a fresh start , the young germany did not think it could live with the weight of such a large feeling of guilt .
myths and collective guilt and in this way the yarn was spun : first came the myth that many germans had only found out about the holocaust in 1945 from the allies .
the myth was born that only a small group around hitler had known what had happened in concentration camps like auschwitz and dachau .
the germans were a nation led astray .
this position was also of course a reaction to the similarly blanket collective guilt theory purported by the allies after the war . then came the myth of the armed forces : that the soldiers had played almost no part in hitler 's atrocities - and besides that everything had been carried out under orders .
both theories were exposed by historians as false only decades later , from the 1970s , through studies , books and exhibitions .
large parts of the population knew not only why jewish friends and neighbors had suddenly disappeared , but they had also assisted with this disappearance .
soldiers took part in shooting jews - voluntarily and not under orders .
but again it took years and decades , well into the 1990s , until this knowledge resulted in a public debate and led to a real demystification . where the myth certainly still existed was in the foreign office , one of the last places where the fairy tale of the " other germany " could live on .
the solidarity of the diplomats worked so well and perhaps the respect for the future german president richard von weizsaecker was too great .
weizsaecker 's father ernst was a top diplomat , who supported the nazi ideology in the foreign office .
but germany 's longing for this " other germany " , which existed much less than most germans had thought , was also too great .

but as andy valvur points out in this postcard , the conspiracy theorists have gone into overdrive . he was just a small town cephalopod , living quietly in an aquarium in oberhausen germany , entertaining children , moving languidly around his tank and generally being ignored .
but , this summer , it all changed and paul , as the octopus was called , became an international superstar by accurately picking the winners of all the games that the german world cup soccer team faced .
and , to finish it off , he accurately picked the winner of the entire world cup .
it all started innocently enough , when he correctly picked the winner of the first game .
people smiled , a lucky guess , said most .
then he picked the winner in the next game .
ah , another lucky guess .
but people took notice .
even better , the media took notice .
by the time he correctly picked the third game result , the media were in full frenzy , as only the media can .
suddenly , the sleepy little german town of oberhausen became media central .
satellite trucks sprouted like mushrooms around the aquarium .
interview requests poured in from around the world , but paul remained silent .
ok .
he ’ s an octopus and not known for his verbal skills , but he was now , as they say in hollywood , hot .
his streak continued , picking the winners of several more games .
when he picked germany to lose against spain , germans thought , well , now he ’ s going to fail , as germany was on a roll , and many thought it seemingly possible that germany might win the whole thing .
but , paul was not to be denied .
by picking spain over germany , there were calls for paul to made into a calamari dish or perhaps served up as sushi … .but aquarium officials demurred and increased security .
in the end , paul amazed everyone and correctly picked the winner of the world cup final between the netherlands and spain .
suddenly , everyone wanted a piece of paul .
rumors spread like wildfire .
it was reported that paul was spotted hanging with squid supermodels at sea world in san diego , california … .
other reports had him accepting a teaching job at woods hole oceanography institute .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dw 's andy valvur is waiting for paul 's return but the truth is that paul , even though he was born in england , had become quite german and decided that all the flash and hoopla were not for him .
he stayed in oberhausen , doing what he did best , languidly moving around a fish tank … seemingly oblivious to everything .
this week , the news that everyone dreaded , was released by aquarium officials in oberhausen .
paul was dead .
murder most foul ?
conspiracy theorists immediately suspected squid play ... i mean … foul play pointing to the rumors of beatle paul mccartney ’ s demise in the 70 ’ s .
their suspicions were fueled by reports that paul had been cremated .
no autopsy , no open casket , no official investigation .
other conspiracy theories suggested that paul was the subject of a mob hit , as his uncanny ability to pick winners was lowering the profits from illegal gambling .
another theory is that museum officials sold paul to a japanese sushi consortium , pointing to a website has that has blurry photos of an alleged sushi chef leaving the aquarium in oberhausen still another claim was that paul was just tired of all the attention , and in a late night dash , escaped from oberhausen to spend the rest of his days relaxing in the mediterranean .
museum officials have been tight lipped saying only that paul is dead .
a memorial has been set up in his tank complete with a replica of the world cup .
so ends a remarkable career .
and in life as in death , paul continues to be a lightning rod for publicity .
personally , i like the relaxing in the mediterranean theory the best .

under pressure from german chancellor angela merkel and french president nicolas sarkozy , european union leaders set in motion plans to amend the lisbon treaty to create a system to ward off financial crises .
they also endorsed tougher sanctions on states that do not keep their public debt in check .
merkel had insisted on suspending voting rights for member states which breach the rules , but failed to win widespread support for this demand .
smaller eu states in particular were opposed to this idea .
overcoming hostility bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : initially merkel only had the support of sarkozy initially germany and france faced strong hostility to their proposals to change the lisbon treaty .
a number of states rejected the idea of far-reaching amendments that would have forced them to hold referendums , which would have been expected to fail .
chancellor merkel was forced to back down on this issue .
the german chancellor had been battling for weeks to push through changes that would provide the eurozone with greater stability .
at home , she has faced public hostility to the bailout of greece and the creation of a massive rescue fund designed to protect the euro .
merkel wanted to write the creation of the rescue fund into the treaty .
europe 's biggest economy contributed the bulk of the 750-billion-euro -lrb- $ 1 trillion -rrb- european financial stability fund , which was hastily established in may to save greece from financial collapse .
the fund is now to be turned into a " permanent crisis mechanism . "
at the eu summit in brussels , which started on thursday , merkel fought into the night to push through her proposals , winning agreement only in the early hours of friday morning .
the german chancellor said she was satisfied with the outcome of the summit : " we have put forward our essential points , " she said .
" everyone is in agreement that a limited change to the lisbon treaty is necessary . "
merkel stressed the new crisis mechanism would only be " valid for cases in which the stability of the euro as a whole is at risk . "
" should a country ever need to make use of this , it would be faced with very strict requirements , " she said .
cautious welcome from the german media the german business daily handelsblatt said the agreement was a significant achievement , calling it a " breakthrough " for merkel , whose center-right coalition has suffered a drop in support in the polls in recent months .
however , because merkel 's more far-reaching treaty changes were put on the backburner , the german newspaper hannoversche allgemeine zeitung said the deal amounted to a " light solution " to the problem of imposing budgetary discipline .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : van rompuy is now charged with drafting the changes guenther kirschbaum , a member of merkel 's christian democrats , who chairs the european affairs committee in the lower house , said the agreement amounted to real progress .
" it is a great step forward because we now have a crisis mechanism so that in future we will not have to deal with problems like the greek crisis on an ad hoc basis , " kirschbaum said .
the proposed changes to the lisbon treaty are to be drafted in time for another eu summit in december .
the changes are to be agreed and implemented by 2013 , when the current rescue fund expires .
european council president herman van rompuy told a news conference in brussels that " important decisions to strengthen the eurozone " had been taken .
" we recommend a robust and credible permanent crisis resolution mechanism to safeguard the financial stability of the eurozone as a whole , " he added .

under pressure from german chancellor angela merkel and french president nicolas sarkozy , european union leaders set in motion plans to amend the lisbon treaty to create a system to ward off financial crises .
they also endorsed tougher sanctions on states that do not keep their public debt in check .
merkel had insisted on suspending voting rights for member states which breach the rules , but failed to win widespread support for this demand .
smaller eu states in particular were opposed to this idea .
overcoming hostility bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : initially merkel only had the support of sarkozy initially germany and france faced strong hostility to their proposals to change the lisbon treaty .
a number of states rejected the idea of far-reaching amendments that would have forced them to hold referendums , which would have been expected to fail .
chancellor merkel was forced to back down on this issue .
the german chancellor had been battling for weeks to push through changes that would provide the eurozone with greater stability .
at home , she has faced public hostility to the bailout of greece and the creation of a massive rescue fund designed to protect the euro .
merkel wanted to write the creation of the rescue fund into the treaty .
europe 's biggest economy contributed the bulk of the 750-billion-euro -lrb- $ 1 trillion -rrb- european financial stability fund , which was hastily established in may to save greece from financial collapse .
the fund is now to be turned into a " permanent crisis mechanism . "
at the eu summit in brussels , which started on thursday , merkel fought into the night to push through her proposals , winning agreement only in the early hours of friday morning .
the german chancellor said she was satisfied with the outcome of the summit : " we have put forward our essential points , " she said .
" everyone is in agreement that a limited change to the lisbon treaty is necessary . "
merkel stressed the new crisis mechanism would only be " valid for cases in which the stability of the euro as a whole is at risk . "
" should a country ever need to make use of this , it would be faced with very strict requirements , " she said .
cautious welcome from the german media the german business daily handelsblatt said the agreement was a significant achievement , calling it a " breakthrough " for merkel , whose center-right coalition has suffered a drop in support in the polls in recent months .
however , because merkel 's more far-reaching treaty changes were put on the backburner , the german newspaper hannoversche allgemeine zeitung said the deal amounted to a " light solution " to the problem of imposing budgetary discipline .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : van rompuy is now charged with drafting the changes guenther kirschbaum , a member of merkel 's christian democrats , who chairs the european affairs committee in the lower house , said the agreement amounted to real progress .
" it is a great step forward because we now have a crisis mechanism so that in future we will not have to deal with problems like the greek crisis on an ad hoc basis , " kirschbaum said .
the proposed changes to the lisbon treaty are to be drafted in time for another eu summit in december .
the changes are to be agreed and implemented by 2013 , when the current rescue fund expires .
european council president herman van rompuy told a news conference in brussels that " important decisions to strengthen the eurozone " had been taken .
" we recommend a robust and credible permanent crisis resolution mechanism to safeguard the financial stability of the eurozone as a whole , " he added .

eurostar , which operates passenger trains through the channel tunnel recently ordered 10 new trains from siemens , in a deal which threatened to engulf france and germany in a protectionist row .
alstom , which also makes high-speed tgv trains , had been backed by france 's transport ministry in its claim that siemens trains ordered by eurostar do not comply with current safety standards set by the franco-british commission which regulates the tunnel .
the judge said alstom did not have a " serious case " and that granting a suspension " would be against the public interest . "
eurostar said it was pleased the matter had been resolved , adding that it always aimed to conduct a rigorous tender to select the best trains .
deutsche bahn , which plans to introduce services through the channel tunnel from 2013 , linking london directly with frankfurt and amsterdam , has also placed a 500-million-euro order with siemens for 15 new high-speed ice trains .

eurostar , which operates passenger trains through the channel tunnel recently ordered 10 new trains from siemens , in a deal which threatened to engulf france and germany in a protectionist row .
alstom , which also makes high-speed tgv trains , had been backed by france 's transport ministry in its claim that siemens trains ordered by eurostar do not comply with current safety standards set by the franco-british commission which regulates the tunnel .
the judge said alstom did not have a " serious case " and that granting a suspension " would be against the public interest . "
eurostar said it was pleased the matter had been resolved , adding that it always aimed to conduct a rigorous tender to select the best trains .
deutsche bahn , which plans to introduce services through the channel tunnel from 2013 , linking london directly with frankfurt and amsterdam , has also placed a 500-million-euro order with siemens for 15 new high-speed ice trains .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de work -pipe- 29.10.2010 berlin : home of the poor , unpaid intern großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's mayor , klaus wowereit , once proudly announced that his city was " poor but sexy , " but with this rather chic poverty comes a cynical exploitation of eager young workers . the uk media was recently full of reports about the national union of journalists ' new campaign , cashback for interns , in which the union encouraged people who had completed internships to sue their former employers for unpaid wages .
while some thought the move was silly and a rather pitiful example of the nanny state , many others supported the campaign , claiming a fair wage was a rather obvious basic reward for a hard day 's work . while the nuj campaign undoubtedly gathers momentum over in england , one can only hope that something similar starts here in berlin ; a movement dedicated to reigning in the blatant exploitation of students and new graduates in the workplace .
poor and sexy berlin may be but it is also rife with stinginess when it comes to doling out the wages . a typical internship - or praktikum as they 're known - in berlin runs for around six months , during which time the " successful " applicant is expected to work from monday to friday , often putting in shifts of over eight hours , for no money whatsoever .
the employer therefore only needs to take on two keen young workers and he or she has extra much-needed manpower for a whole year and it does n't cost a nickel . my former flatmate once got an actual job in a shop and was put on a six-month trial period during which time she received a lower-than-average trainee wage while her employer was not legally obliged to make any health insurance or social security contributions .
lo and behold once the trial was over , the employer decided she was n't right for the job and let her go .
when she returned to pick up some bits and pieces she 'd left behind , there was a new girl doing exactly the same job in her place , presumably on yet another trial run .
little wonder that berlin city magazine , zitty , recently ran with " generation praktikant " -lrb- generation intern -rrb- as their cover story . bildunterschrift : interns need to juggle many tasks at the same time to impress potential employers - but how are they expected to pay the bills ? call me mr jump-to-conclusions but i would imagine as an employer that i could pretty accurately assess a person 's suitability for a job after two or three days ; a trial period of six months does seem rather excessive but it is yet another way to milk a year 's hard graft out of two poor saps without having to cough up for the privilege . a friend of a friend told me a tale of a girl who had re-located to berlin from the states on the promise of a job at a local radio station only to be on the phone to her parents in tears three months later as she 'd still not received any money .
she had , however , very promptly received an eviction notice on her flat , given that she had n't paid any rent .
everyone has some internship-related horror story that either happened to them or a friend . now it is n't , of course , all doom and gloom .
a good number of students and graduates take on internship positions fully aware that they are n't going to receive any money and do so with other funding behind them -lrb- savings or money from their parents , for example -rrb- and use their six months with the company to gain some valuable work experience .
sadly though , internships never seem to be offered on the basis that the employer is scouting for hot new talent to add to his or her company .
interns seem to be cynically picked like cherries just so there is always someone there to answer the phone and take the mail to the post office . this exploitation of workers really does need to be addressed , especially in berlin , a city which exists on the labors of the intern and those who do either one-euro-an-hour job while also receiving welfare money .
it 's all very well gaining industry experience but if no one in the industry is prepared to give you a proper job you might as well sign up for unemployment benefit and spend your day doing crosswords . since i would n't be in the least bit surprised if even the city 's decision-makers were themselves a rotating army of interns , it seems unlikely that the problem will be tackled at an official level anytime soon .
so it 's time for a revolution .
berlin 's interns need to strike , even just for a day , for fair pay , while employers look on in horror as virtually every business in the city grinds to an absolute halt . of course , if revolution is n't your thing , just do the unpaid berlin internship and head off to munich .
after all , that 's where all the money is . neale lytollis has happily never done an unpaid internship , despite working in the media . editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

while some thought the move was silly and a rather pitiful example of the nanny state , many others supported the campaign , claiming a fair wage was a rather obvious basic reward for a hard day 's work . while the nuj campaign undoubtedly gathers momentum over in england , one can only hope that something similar starts here in berlin ; a movement dedicated to reigning in the blatant exploitation of students and new graduates in the workplace .
poor and sexy berlin may be but it is also rife with stinginess when it comes to doling out the wages . a typical internship - or praktikum as they 're known - in berlin runs for around six months , during which time the " successful " applicant is expected to work from monday to friday , often putting in shifts of over eight hours , for no money whatsoever .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de nuclear power -pipe- 29.10.2010 brazil 's presidential result revives concerns over nuclear ambitions 1/2 ahead großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dilma rousseff will be expected to continue lula 's policies brazil has become the preeminent latin american nation in recent years , leading in most areas of industry and commerce .
new president dilma rousseff may now push for dominance in the arena of regional nuclear supremacy . workers ' party candidate dilma rousseff was elected as brazil 's first female president on sunday , succeeding her mentor luiz inacio lula da silva . lula has been championing rousseff at least in part to maintain continuity in the country , where he has presided over a period of financial stability , welfare reform , booming consumption , and strong exports of brazil 's abundant natural resources . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dilma will inherit brazil 's nuclear program if elected many observers believe it is lula 's policies - which rousseff is expected to follow - that are boosting her candidacy among the populace .
it appears that the president is not the only one eager to see his legacy continue .
expectations for a new president however , one policy that dilma will inherit - and be expected to expand upon - may draw unwanted international attention .
brazil has been actively seeking to expand its nuclear power structure under lula 's tenure as president and it is expected to develop further under his successor .
" dilma will continue lula 's vision but nuclear ambitions were not a big theme in the electoral campaigns and it will not be a big theme during her administration , " thiago de aragao , the director for latin american political risk analysis at arko advice , a political think-tank in brazil , told deutsche welle . " the brazilians have a single goal : to have the best nuclear capability the country can have , but one step lower , without the atomic bomb . "
brazil has the most advanced nuclear capabilities in latin america with two nuclear power plants - angra i and angra ii - in operation .
a third , angra iii , is under construction .
it has highly skilled scientists , advanced technologies for enriching uranium , and a dependable raw material base .
only argentina provides brazil with any serious competition . ambition : reliable exporter " brazil has a very modern capability of enriching uranium , " de aragao said . according to government sources , brazilian technology is unique and very advanced compared to others , he said .
alongside that , the country has one of the top five uranium reserves in the world . " as an aspiring power , brazil is able to control , or close to controlling , all areas of nuclear capability .
the major ambition is to become a reliable exporter of enriched uranium in the near future . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brazil is building a third angra reactor the advanced state of brazil 's nuclear industry raises the question of whether progress will stop there .
despite being a signatory to a number of relevant accords , brazil 's increased levels of uranium enrichment lend themselves to defense-related applications and technologies .
should it choose to , brazil could become an even more powerful force on the continent , backed with an arsenal of atomic weapons . however , thiago de aragao believes that brazil can assert regional power through its nuclear program without developing weapons . " the brazilian society and the major stakeholders in brazilian politics are still very firm on their positions that brazil should not have a bomb , " he said . " brazil wants to tell the world : ' we have all the capability and technology to have a bomb , but we choose not to , and this should be seen as an example to follow . '
politically , brazil could gain more with this behavior than from having an atomic bomb and causing problems with weaker allies . " civil advances raise possibility of new bomb program whether dilma pursues a weapons program to go along with the potential expansion of civilian nuclear activities remains to be seen .
but while south america currently remains a-bomb free - rumors of a secret weapons program in argentina aside - experts believe that the continent will eventually be forced to accept a nuclear-armed power . that may well be a long time in the future .
but as one of the leaders in most arenas in south america , no-one would bet against brazil taking the lead . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the un 's nuclear watchdog has been refused full access according to a report published by the global security.org think-tank , brazil pursued a covert nuclear weapons program in the mid-1970s , siphoning off material and expertise from its growing civilian projects into parallel military programs .
the pursuit of nuclear weapons accelerated in the 1980s in response to the suspected rival program in argentina , before the secret operation was finally made public in 1988 .
the official stance at the time was that brazil had failed to develop a weapon from its research . to read more about brazil 's nuclear capacities , read below 1/2 ahead send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

new president dilma rousseff may now push for dominance in the arena of regional nuclear supremacy . workers ' party candidate dilma rousseff was elected as brazil 's first female president on sunday , succeeding her mentor luiz inacio lula da silva . lula has been championing rousseff at least in part to maintain continuity in the country , where he has presided over a period of financial stability , welfare reform , booming consumption , and strong exports of brazil 's abundant natural resources . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dilma will inherit brazil 's nuclear program if elected many observers believe it is lula 's policies - which rousseff is expected to follow - that are boosting her candidacy among the populace .
it appears that the president is not the only one eager to see his legacy continue .
expectations for a new president however , one policy that dilma will inherit - and be expected to expand upon - may draw unwanted international attention .
brazil has been actively seeking to expand its nuclear power structure under lula 's tenure as president and it is expected to develop further under his successor .
" dilma will continue lula 's vision but nuclear ambitions were not a big theme in the electoral campaigns and it will not be a big theme during her administration , " thiago de aragao , the director for latin american political risk analysis at arko advice , a political think-tank in brazil , told deutsche welle . " the brazilians have a single goal : to have the best nuclear capability the country can have , but one step lower , without the atomic bomb . "
brazil has the most advanced nuclear capabilities in latin america with two nuclear power plants - angra i and angra ii - in operation .
a third , angra iii , is under construction .
it has highly skilled scientists , advanced technologies for enriching uranium , and a dependable raw material base .
only argentina provides brazil with any serious competition . ambition : reliable exporter " brazil has a very modern capability of enriching uranium , " de aragao said . according to government sources , brazilian technology is unique and very advanced compared to others , he said .
alongside that , the country has one of the top five uranium reserves in the world . " as an aspiring power , brazil is able to control , or close to controlling , all areas of nuclear capability .
the major ambition is to become a reliable exporter of enriched uranium in the near future . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brazil is building a third angra reactor the advanced state of brazil 's nuclear industry raises the question of whether progress will stop there .
despite being a signatory to a number of relevant accords , brazil 's increased levels of uranium enrichment lend themselves to defense-related applications and technologies .
should it choose to , brazil could become an even more powerful force on the continent , backed with an arsenal of atomic weapons . however , thiago de aragao believes that brazil can assert regional power through its nuclear program without developing weapons . " the brazilian society and the major stakeholders in brazilian politics are still very firm on their positions that brazil should not have a bomb , " he said . " brazil wants to tell the world : ' we have all the capability and technology to have a bomb , but we choose not to , and this should be seen as an example to follow . '
politically , brazil could gain more with this behavior than from having an atomic bomb and causing problems with weaker allies . " civil advances raise possibility of new bomb program whether dilma pursues a weapons program to go along with the potential expansion of civilian nuclear activities remains to be seen .
but while south america currently remains a-bomb free - rumors of a secret weapons program in argentina aside - experts believe that the continent will eventually be forced to accept a nuclear-armed power . that may well be a long time in the future .
but as one of the leaders in most arenas in south america , no-one would bet against brazil taking the lead . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the un 's nuclear watchdog has been refused full access according to a report published by the global security.org think-tank , brazil pursued a covert nuclear weapons program in the mid-1970s , siphoning off material and expertise from its growing civilian projects into parallel military programs .
the pursuit of nuclear weapons accelerated in the 1980s in response to the suspected rival program in argentina , before the secret operation was finally made public in 1988 .

new president dilma rousseff may now push for dominance in the arena of regional nuclear supremacy . workers ' party candidate dilma rousseff was elected as brazil 's first female president on sunday , succeeding her mentor luiz inacio lula da silva . lula has been championing rousseff at least in part to maintain continuity in the country , where he has presided over a period of financial stability , welfare reform , booming consumption , and strong exports of brazil 's abundant natural resources . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dilma will inherit brazil 's nuclear program if elected many observers believe it is lula 's policies - which rousseff is expected to follow - that are boosting her candidacy among the populace .
it appears that the president is not the only one eager to see his legacy continue .
expectations for a new president however , one policy that dilma will inherit - and be expected to expand upon - may draw unwanted international attention .
brazil has been actively seeking to expand its nuclear power structure under lula 's tenure as president and it is expected to develop further under his successor .
" dilma will continue lula 's vision but nuclear ambitions were not a big theme in the electoral campaigns and it will not be a big theme during her administration , " thiago de aragao , the director for latin american political risk analysis at arko advice , a political think-tank in brazil , told deutsche welle . " the brazilians have a single goal : to have the best nuclear capability the country can have , but one step lower , without the atomic bomb . "
brazil has the most advanced nuclear capabilities in latin america with two nuclear power plants - angra i and angra ii - in operation .
a third , angra iii , is under construction .
it has highly skilled scientists , advanced technologies for enriching uranium , and a dependable raw material base .
only argentina provides brazil with any serious competition . ambition : reliable exporter " brazil has a very modern capability of enriching uranium , " de aragao said . according to government sources , brazilian technology is unique and very advanced compared to others , he said .
alongside that , the country has one of the top five uranium reserves in the world . " as an aspiring power , brazil is able to control , or close to controlling , all areas of nuclear capability .
the major ambition is to become a reliable exporter of enriched uranium in the near future . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brazil is building a third angra reactor the advanced state of brazil 's nuclear industry raises the question of whether progress will stop there .
despite being a signatory to a number of relevant accords , brazil 's increased levels of uranium enrichment lend themselves to defense-related applications and technologies .
should it choose to , brazil could become an even more powerful force on the continent , backed with an arsenal of atomic weapons . however , thiago de aragao believes that brazil can assert regional power through its nuclear program without developing weapons . " the brazilian society and the major stakeholders in brazilian politics are still very firm on their positions that brazil should not have a bomb , " he said . " brazil wants to tell the world : ' we have all the capability and technology to have a bomb , but we choose not to , and this should be seen as an example to follow . '
politically , brazil could gain more with this behavior than from having an atomic bomb and causing problems with weaker allies . " civil advances raise possibility of new bomb program whether dilma pursues a weapons program to go along with the potential expansion of civilian nuclear activities remains to be seen .
but while south america currently remains a-bomb free - rumors of a secret weapons program in argentina aside - experts believe that the continent will eventually be forced to accept a nuclear-armed power . that may well be a long time in the future .
but as one of the leaders in most arenas in south america , no-one would bet against brazil taking the lead . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the un 's nuclear watchdog has been refused full access according to a report published by the global security.org think-tank , brazil pursued a covert nuclear weapons program in the mid-1970s , siphoning off material and expertise from its growing civilian projects into parallel military programs .
the pursuit of nuclear weapons accelerated in the 1980s in response to the suspected rival program in argentina , before the secret operation was finally made public in 1988 .
the official stance at the time was that brazil had failed to develop a weapon from its research . to read more about brazil 's nuclear capacities , read below 1/2 ahead send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

new president dilma rousseff may now push for dominance in the arena of regional nuclear supremacy . workers ' party candidate dilma rousseff was elected as brazil 's first female president on sunday , succeeding her mentor luiz inacio lula da silva . lula has been championing rousseff at least in part to maintain continuity in the country , where he has presided over a period of financial stability , welfare reform , booming consumption , and strong exports of brazil 's abundant natural resources . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dilma will inherit brazil 's nuclear program if elected many observers believe it is lula 's policies - which rousseff is expected to follow - that are boosting her candidacy among the populace .
it appears that the president is not the only one eager to see his legacy continue .
expectations for a new president however , one policy that dilma will inherit - and be expected to expand upon - may draw unwanted international attention .
brazil has been actively seeking to expand its nuclear power structure under lula 's tenure as president and it is expected to develop further under his successor .
" dilma will continue lula 's vision but nuclear ambitions were not a big theme in the electoral campaigns and it will not be a big theme during her administration , " thiago de aragao , the director for latin american political risk analysis at arko advice , a political think-tank in brazil , told deutsche welle . " the brazilians have a single goal : to have the best nuclear capability the country can have , but one step lower , without the atomic bomb . "
brazil has the most advanced nuclear capabilities in latin america with two nuclear power plants - angra i and angra ii - in operation .
a third , angra iii , is under construction .
it has highly skilled scientists , advanced technologies for enriching uranium , and a dependable raw material base .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de work -pipe- 29.10.2010 berlin : home of the poor , unpaid intern großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's mayor , klaus wowereit , once proudly announced that his city was " poor but sexy , " but with this rather chic poverty comes a cynical exploitation of eager young workers . the uk media was recently full of reports about the national union of journalists ' new campaign , cashback for interns , in which the union encouraged people who had completed internships to sue their former employers for unpaid wages .
while some thought the move was silly and a rather pitiful example of the nanny state , many others supported the campaign , claiming a fair wage was a rather obvious basic reward for a hard day 's work . while the nuj campaign undoubtedly gathers momentum over in england , one can only hope that something similar starts here in berlin ; a movement dedicated to reigning in the blatant exploitation of students and new graduates in the workplace .
poor and sexy berlin may be but it is also rife with stinginess when it comes to doling out the wages . a typical internship - or praktikum as they 're known - in berlin runs for around six months , during which time the " successful " applicant is expected to work from monday to friday , often putting in shifts of over eight hours , for no money whatsoever .
the employer therefore only needs to take on two keen young workers and he or she has extra much-needed manpower for a whole year and it does n't cost a nickel . my former flatmate once got an actual job in a shop and was put on a six-month trial period during which time she received a lower-than-average trainee wage while her employer was not legally obliged to make any health insurance or social security contributions .
lo and behold once the trial was over , the employer decided she was n't right for the job and let her go .
when she returned to pick up some bits and pieces she 'd left behind , there was a new girl doing exactly the same job in her place , presumably on yet another trial run .
little wonder that berlin city magazine , zitty , recently ran with " generation praktikant " -lrb- generation intern -rrb- as their cover story . bildunterschrift : interns need to juggle many tasks at the same time to impress potential employers - but how are they expected to pay the bills ? call me mr jump-to-conclusions but i would imagine as an employer that i could pretty accurately assess a person 's suitability for a job after two or three days ; a trial period of six months does seem rather excessive but it is yet another way to milk a year 's hard graft out of two poor saps without having to cough up for the privilege . a friend of a friend told me a tale of a girl who had re-located to berlin from the states on the promise of a job at a local radio station only to be on the phone to her parents in tears three months later as she 'd still not received any money .
she had , however , very promptly received an eviction notice on her flat , given that she had n't paid any rent .
everyone has some internship-related horror story that either happened to them or a friend . now it is n't , of course , all doom and gloom .
a good number of students and graduates take on internship positions fully aware that they are n't going to receive any money and do so with other funding behind them -lrb- savings or money from their parents , for example -rrb- and use their six months with the company to gain some valuable work experience .
sadly though , internships never seem to be offered on the basis that the employer is scouting for hot new talent to add to his or her company .
interns seem to be cynically picked like cherries just so there is always someone there to answer the phone and take the mail to the post office . this exploitation of workers really does need to be addressed , especially in berlin , a city which exists on the labors of the intern and those who do either one-euro-an-hour job while also receiving welfare money .
it 's all very well gaining industry experience but if no one in the industry is prepared to give you a proper job you might as well sign up for unemployment benefit and spend your day doing crosswords . since i would n't be in the least bit surprised if even the city 's decision-makers were themselves a rotating army of interns , it seems unlikely that the problem will be tackled at an official level anytime soon .
so it 's time for a revolution .
berlin 's interns need to strike , even just for a day , for fair pay , while employers look on in horror as virtually every business in the city grinds to an absolute halt . of course , if revolution is n't your thing , just do the unpaid berlin internship and head off to munich .
after all , that 's where all the money is . neale lytollis has happily never done an unpaid internship , despite working in the media . editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de work -pipe- 29.10.2010 berlin : home of the poor , unpaid intern großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's mayor , klaus wowereit , once proudly announced that his city was " poor but sexy , " but with this rather chic poverty comes a cynical exploitation of eager young workers . the uk media was recently full of reports about the national union of journalists ' new campaign , cashback for interns , in which the union encouraged people who had completed internships to sue their former employers for unpaid wages .
while some thought the move was silly and a rather pitiful example of the nanny state , many others supported the campaign , claiming a fair wage was a rather obvious basic reward for a hard day 's work . while the nuj campaign undoubtedly gathers momentum over in england , one can only hope that something similar starts here in berlin ; a movement dedicated to reigning in the blatant exploitation of students and new graduates in the workplace .
poor and sexy berlin may be but it is also rife with stinginess when it comes to doling out the wages . a typical internship - or praktikum as they 're known - in berlin runs for around six months , during which time the " successful " applicant is expected to work from monday to friday , often putting in shifts of over eight hours , for no money whatsoever .
the employer therefore only needs to take on two keen young workers and he or she has extra much-needed manpower for a whole year and it does n't cost a nickel . my former flatmate once got an actual job in a shop and was put on a six-month trial period during which time she received a lower-than-average trainee wage while her employer was not legally obliged to make any health insurance or social security contributions .
lo and behold once the trial was over , the employer decided she was n't right for the job and let her go .
when she returned to pick up some bits and pieces she 'd left behind , there was a new girl doing exactly the same job in her place , presumably on yet another trial run .
little wonder that berlin city magazine , zitty , recently ran with " generation praktikant " -lrb- generation intern -rrb- as their cover story . bildunterschrift : interns need to juggle many tasks at the same time to impress potential employers - but how are they expected to pay the bills ? call me mr jump-to-conclusions but i would imagine as an employer that i could pretty accurately assess a person 's suitability for a job after two or three days ; a trial period of six months does seem rather excessive but it is yet another way to milk a year 's hard graft out of two poor saps without having to cough up for the privilege . a friend of a friend told me a tale of a girl who had re-located to berlin from the states on the promise of a job at a local radio station only to be on the phone to her parents in tears three months later as she 'd still not received any money .
she had , however , very promptly received an eviction notice on her flat , given that she had n't paid any rent .
everyone has some internship-related horror story that either happened to them or a friend . now it is n't , of course , all doom and gloom .
a good number of students and graduates take on internship positions fully aware that they are n't going to receive any money and do so with other funding behind them -lrb- savings or money from their parents , for example -rrb- and use their six months with the company to gain some valuable work experience .
sadly though , internships never seem to be offered on the basis that the employer is scouting for hot new talent to add to his or her company .
interns seem to be cynically picked like cherries just so there is always someone there to answer the phone and take the mail to the post office . this exploitation of workers really does need to be addressed , especially in berlin , a city which exists on the labors of the intern and those who do either one-euro-an-hour job while also receiving welfare money .
it 's all very well gaining industry experience but if no one in the industry is prepared to give you a proper job you might as well sign up for unemployment benefit and spend your day doing crosswords . since i would n't be in the least bit surprised if even the city 's decision-makers were themselves a rotating army of interns , it seems unlikely that the problem will be tackled at an official level anytime soon .
so it 's time for a revolution .
berlin 's interns need to strike , even just for a day , for fair pay , while employers look on in horror as virtually every business in the city grinds to an absolute halt . of course , if revolution is n't your thing , just do the unpaid berlin internship and head off to munich .
after all , that 's where all the money is . gavin blackburn has happily never done an unpaid internship , despite working in the media . editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

new president dilma rousseff may now push for dominance in the arena of regional nuclear supremacy . workers ' party candidate dilma rousseff was elected as brazil 's first female president on sunday , succeeding her mentor luiz inacio lula da silva . lula has been championing rousseff at least in part to maintain continuity in the country , where he has presided over a period of financial stability , welfare reform , booming consumption , and strong exports of brazil 's abundant natural resources . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dilma will inherit brazil 's nuclear program if elected many observers believe it is lula 's policies - which rousseff is expected to follow - that are boosting her candidacy among the populace .
it appears that the president is not the only one eager to see his legacy continue .
expectations for a new president however , one policy that dilma will inherit - and be expected to expand upon - may draw unwanted international attention .
brazil has been actively seeking to expand its nuclear power structure under lula 's tenure as president and it is expected to develop further under his successor .
" dilma will continue lula 's vision but nuclear ambitions were not a big theme in the electoral campaigns and it will not be a big theme during her administration , " thiago de aragao , the director for latin american political risk analysis at arko advice , a political think-tank in brazil , told deutsche welle . " the brazilians have a single goal : to have the best nuclear capability the country can have , but one step lower , without the atomic bomb . "
brazil has the most advanced nuclear capabilities in latin america with two nuclear power plants - angra i and angra ii - in operation .
a third , angra iii , is under construction .
it has highly skilled scientists , advanced technologies for enriching uranium , and a dependable raw material base .
only argentina provides brazil with any serious competition . ambition : reliable exporter " brazil has a very modern capability of enriching uranium , " de aragao said . according to government sources , brazilian technology is unique and very advanced compared to others , he said .
alongside that , the country has one of the top five uranium reserves in the world . " as an aspiring power , brazil is able to control , or close to controlling , all areas of nuclear capability .
the major ambition is to become a reliable exporter of enriched uranium in the near future . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brazil is building a third angra reactor the advanced state of brazil 's nuclear industry raises the question of whether progress will stop there .
despite being a signatory to a number of relevant accords , brazil 's increased levels of uranium enrichment lend themselves to defense-related applications and technologies .
should it choose to , brazil could become an even more powerful force on the continent , backed with an arsenal of atomic weapons . however , thiago de aragao believes that brazil can assert regional power through its nuclear program without developing weapons . " the brazilian society and the major stakeholders in brazilian politics are still very firm on their positions that brazil should not have a bomb , " he said . " brazil wants to tell the world : ' we have all the capability and technology to have a bomb , but we choose not to , and this should be seen as an example to follow . '
politically , brazil could gain more with this behavior than from having an atomic bomb and causing problems with weaker allies . " civil advances raise possibility of new bomb program whether dilma pursues a weapons program to go along with the potential expansion of civilian nuclear activities remains to be seen .
but while south america currently remains a-bomb free - rumors of a secret weapons program in argentina aside - experts believe that the continent will eventually be forced to accept a nuclear-armed power . that may well be a long time in the future .
but as one of the leaders in most arenas in south america , no-one would bet against brazil taking the lead . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the un 's nuclear watchdog has been refused full access according to a report published by the global security.org think-tank , brazil pursued a covert nuclear weapons program in the mid-1970s , siphoning off material and expertise from its growing civilian projects into parallel military programs .
the pursuit of nuclear weapons accelerated in the 1980s in response to the suspected rival program in argentina , before the secret operation was finally made public in 1988 .
the official stance at the time was that brazil had failed to develop a weapon from its research . to read more about brazil 's nuclear capacities , read below 1/2 ahead send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

new president dilma rousseff may now push for dominance in the arena of regional nuclear supremacy . workers ' party candidate dilma rousseff was elected as brazil 's first female president on sunday , succeeding her mentor luiz inacio lula da silva . lula has been championing rousseff at least in part to maintain continuity in the country , where he has presided over a period of financial stability , welfare reform , booming consumption , and strong exports of brazil 's abundant natural resources . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dilma will inherit brazil 's nuclear program if elected many observers believe it is lula 's policies - which rousseff is expected to follow - that are boosting her candidacy among the populace .
it appears that the president is not the only one eager to see his legacy continue .
expectations for a new president however , one policy that dilma will inherit - and be expected to expand upon - may draw unwanted international attention .
brazil has been actively seeking to expand its nuclear power structure under lula 's tenure as president and it is expected to develop further under his successor .
" dilma will continue lula 's vision but nuclear ambitions were not a big theme in the electoral campaigns and it will not be a big theme during her administration , " thiago de aragao , the director for latin american political risk analysis at arko advice , a political think-tank in brazil , told deutsche welle . " the brazilians have a single goal : to have the best nuclear capability the country can have , but one step lower , without the atomic bomb . "
brazil has the most advanced nuclear capabilities in latin america with two nuclear power plants - angra i and angra ii - in operation .
a third , angra iii , is under construction .
it has highly skilled scientists , advanced technologies for enriching uranium , and a dependable raw material base .
only argentina provides brazil with any serious competition . ambition : reliable exporter " brazil has a very modern capability of enriching uranium , " de aragao said . according to government sources , brazilian technology is unique and very advanced compared to others , he said .
alongside that , the country has one of the top five uranium reserves in the world . " as an aspiring power , brazil is able to control , or close to controlling , all areas of nuclear capability .
the major ambition is to become a reliable exporter of enriched uranium in the near future . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brazil is building a third angra reactor the advanced state of brazil 's nuclear industry raises the question of whether progress will stop there .
despite being a signatory to a number of relevant accords , brazil 's increased levels of uranium enrichment lend themselves to defense-related applications and technologies .
should it choose to , brazil could become an even more powerful force on the continent , backed with an arsenal of atomic weapons . however , thiago de aragao believes that brazil can assert regional power through its nuclear program without developing weapons . " the brazilian society and the major stakeholders in brazilian politics are still very firm on their positions that brazil should not have a bomb , " he said .

" what 's worrying about brazil at the moment is that it ’ s not allowing international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- inspectors to visit all the sites related to its submarine programme and that ’ s raising a lot of questions , bearing in mind their history of trying to start a weapons program , " anthony seaboyer , a nuclear proliferation expert with the german council for foreign relations , told deutsche welle . " we know that technologically and financially , brazil could pursue an arms program , but questions remain , " seaboyer said .
" in reality , they have little to gain from pursuing the bomb .
but if they did , we would n't hear about it until they had already succeeded , which makes the iaea situation all the more worrying . " fears over latin american arms race misplaced brazil 's rise in prominence and confidence is certainly beginning to have an effect on its regional rivals .
argentina 's president cristina fernandez de kirchner has already stated that her country 's own nuclear program will not be allowed to trail behind brazil 's in the race for regional nuclear supremacy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : de kirchner is unwilling to let brazil lead in latin america suspicions remain that buenos aires may have some secret trump cards up its sleeve should the right moment in the power play arise .
brazil , the us and other western states claim that the dictatorial junta which ruled argentina during the1980s was actively pursuing a nuclear weapons program , and that it had required us intervention to prevent it developing into a live deterrent .
some military analysts believe a secret program is still active . " a nuclear brazil would divide latin america , bringing regional integration to a stalemate , " said thiago de aragao .
" its neighbors would not react well and could start a quest on their own for similar technology . " this would n't suit brazil , since there are currently no strategic issues in dispute in the region , de aragao said .
therefore the country has " absolutely no need " to flex its nuclear muscles .
currently in latin america , brazil can gain whatever it wants " without going down the nuclear road , " he said . anthony seaboyer believes that with brazil the preeminent power on the continent at the moment , few of its rivals are currently able to mount a challenge . " argentina is way behind in financial terms , " he said . " it 's massively expensive to finance an arms program and argentina just does n't have the money .
argentina has also been very cooperative with the iaea and has no problem with giving it full access so i think it is unlikely that argentina would engage in any competition with brazil . " as for a latin american arms race , seaboyer considers it " very unlikely " that one will begin at the moment , but added : " if it did happen , it would be a long way down the road .

" what 's worrying about brazil at the moment is that it ’ s not allowing international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- inspectors to visit all the sites related to its submarine programme and that ’ s raising a lot of questions , bearing in mind their history of trying to start a weapons program , " anthony seaboyer , a nuclear proliferation expert with the german council for foreign relations , told deutsche welle . " we know that technologically and financially , brazil could pursue an arms program , but questions remain , " seaboyer said .
" in reality , they have little to gain from pursuing the bomb .
but if they did , we would n't hear about it until they had already succeeded , which makes the iaea situation all the more worrying . " fears over latin american arms race misplaced brazil 's rise in prominence and confidence is certainly beginning to have an effect on its regional rivals .
argentina 's president cristina fernandez de kirchner has already stated that her country 's own nuclear program will not be allowed to trail behind brazil 's in the race for regional nuclear supremacy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : de kirchner is unwilling to let brazil lead in latin america suspicions remain that buenos aires may have some secret trump cards up its sleeve should the right moment in the power play arise .
brazil , the us and other western states claim that the dictatorial junta which ruled argentina during the1980s was actively pursuing a nuclear weapons program , and that it had required us intervention to prevent it developing into a live deterrent .
some military analysts believe a secret program is still active . " a nuclear brazil would divide latin america , bringing regional integration to a stalemate , " said thiago de aragao .
" its neighbors would not react well and could start a quest on their own for similar technology . " this would n't suit brazil , since there are currently no strategic issues in dispute in the region , de aragao said .
therefore the country has " absolutely no need " to flex its nuclear muscles .
currently in latin america , brazil can gain whatever it wants " without going down the nuclear road , " he said . anthony seaboyer believes that with brazil the preeminent power on the continent at the moment , few of its rivals are currently able to mount a challenge . " argentina is way behind in financial terms , " he said . " it 's massively expensive to finance an arms program and argentina just does n't have the money .
argentina has also been very cooperative with the iaea and has no problem with giving it full access so i think it is unlikely that argentina would engage in any competition with brazil . " as for a latin american arms race , seaboyer considers it " very unlikely " that one will begin at the moment , but added : " if it did happen , it would be a long way down the road .

but as andy valvur points out in this postcard , the conspiracy theorists have gone into overdrive . he was just a small town cephalopod , living quietly in an aquarium in oberhausen germany , entertaining children , moving languidly around his tank and generally being ignored .
but , this summer , it all changed and paul , as the octopus was called , became an international superstar by accurately picking the winners of all the games that the german world cup soccer team faced .
and , to finish it off , he accurately picked the winner of the entire world cup .
it all started innocently enough , when he correctly picked the winner of the first game .
people smiled , a lucky guess , said most .
then he picked the winner in the next game .
ah , another lucky guess .
but people took notice .
even better , the media took notice .
by the time he correctly picked the third game result , the media were in full frenzy , as only the media can .
suddenly , the sleepy little german town of oberhausen became media central .
satellite trucks sprouted like mushrooms around the aquarium .
interview requests poured in from around the world , but paul remained silent .
ok .
he ’ s an octopus and not known for his verbal skills , but he was now , as they say in hollywood , hot .
his streak continued , picking the winners of several more games .
when he picked germany to lose against spain , germans thought , well , now he ’ s going to fail , as germany was on a roll , and many thought it seemingly possible that germany might win the whole thing .
but , paul was not to be denied .
by picking spain over germany , there were calls for paul to made into a calamari dish or perhaps served up as sushi … .but aquarium officials demurred and increased security .
in the end , paul amazed everyone and correctly picked the winner of the world cup final between the netherlands and spain .
suddenly , everyone wanted a piece of paul .
rumors spread like wildfire .
it was reported that paul was spotted hanging with squid supermodels at sea world in san diego , california … .
other reports had him accepting a teaching job at woods hole oceanography institute .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dw 's andy valvur is waiting for paul 's return but the truth is that paul , even though he was born in england , had become quite german and decided that all the flash and hoopla were not for him .
he stayed in oberhausen , doing what he did best , languidly moving around a fish tank … seemingly oblivious to everything .
this week , the news that everyone dreaded , was released by aquarium officials in oberhausen .
paul was dead .
murder most foul ?
conspiracy theorists immediately suspected squid play ... i mean … foul play pointing to the rumors of beatle paul mccartney ’ s demise in the 70 ’ s .
their suspicions were fueled by reports that paul had been cremated .
no autopsy , no open casket , no official investigation .
other conspiracy theories suggested that paul was the subject of a mob hit , as his uncanny ability to pick winners was lowering the profits from illegal gambling .
another theory is that museum officials sold paul to a japanese sushi consortium , pointing to a website has that has blurry photos of an alleged sushi chef leaving the aquarium in oberhausen still another claim was that paul was just tired of all the attention , and in a late night dash , escaped from oberhausen to spend the rest of his days relaxing in the mediterranean .
museum officials have been tight lipped saying only that paul is dead .
a memorial has been set up in his tank complete with a replica of the world cup .
so ends a remarkable career .
and in life as in death , paul continues to be a lightning rod for publicity .
personally , i like the relaxing in the mediterranean theory the best .

a pre-summit deal between merkel and sarkozy on how to safeguard the euro annoyed many eu states .
deutsche welle 's brussels correspondent , christoph hasselbach , says that 's why so little progress was achieved . chancellor merkel pushed the right issues , but at this summit , at least , made little concrete progress .
it remains to be seen whether the december summit will in fact bring about the desired effect .
the reason for this lies not least in her advance talks with french president nicolas sarkozy .
through the “ deauville deal ” shortly before the summit , merkel managed to irritate almost everyone in the eu .
those who had supported automatic sanctions for budget sinners noted with horror that the german chancellor had given up on this central goal .
merkel also managed to stab the european commission in the back .
the commission had pursued this aim and , until the deauville conference , could be sure having the support of the germans .
in the end , even european council president herman van rompuy must have felt blindsided .
he was given the task of working out the details of the reforms , and even before he could present his results officially , germany and france declared they 'd already reached a decision .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche welle 's brussels correspondent , christoph hasselbach as a trade-off , merkel had secured assurances from sarkozy that france would echo the german demands for altering the lisbon treaty .
merkel experienced how little that promise was worth when she got to the summit .
rarely has such a wall of resistance built up , above all on the question of taking away voting rights .
this means that early on merkel threw away one of the most important methods of stabilizing the euro , and has - at least so far - has nothing to show for her trade-off .
whether the eu can agree on a so-called small amendment to the treaty by december , is not only down to france .
as far as taking away voting rights is concerned , merkel can forget it .
now she just says she wants to keep the item “ on the agenda ” .
it wo n't go beyond that .
it 's a different story when it comes to the permanent rescue mechanism for financially stricken states .
the participation of the private sectors is popular .
and the fear in the whole eurozone of the collapse of a member state could give the necessary pressure to get through moderate treaty amendments on this issue .
the strange thing is this : had merkel fought for automatic sanctions at the summit , and looked for allies on the issue , she may have saved herself and the whole eu some of the conflict over treaty changes .
because the stricter the disciplinary tools are before a financial crisis , the more unlikely it is , that the whole mechanism will need to be used at all .

the secret ballot will take place on december 2 .
two members remain provisionally suspended . the election of the 2018 and 2022 world cup hosts will go ahead as planned despite an ongoing corruption probe , fifa president joseph blatter said on friday .
blatter made the announcement after a two-day meeting of the fifa executive committee .
the secret ballot will take place on december 2 at fifa 's headquarters in zurich .
" we are five weeks from the final decision so there was never a question of changing anything in the procedure , " blatter said .
" changing the date would have caused problems for fifa and bidders as well since they plan to bring in high-ranked politicians like bill clinton and vladimir putin . "
executive committee members suspended bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : adamu , left , and temarii are accussed of selling their votes last week , fifa provisionally suspended two of the 24 members of the executive committee , amos adamu of nigeria and reynald temarii of tahiti .
there have been allegations that they offered to sell their votes to undercover reporters from the british sunday times newspaper .
blatter said that the fifa ethics committee will deal with their cases before the election of the host countries takes place . " if and when people are suspended for the vote on december 2 , they will not be replaced , " he said .
alleged deal between spain , portugal and qatar the joint 2018 bidders , spain and portugal , are said to have struck a deal with qatar , a 2022 candidate , for the interchange of votes . the chief of the joint spanish-portugal bid , miguel angel lopez , denied the allegations of collusion with qatar .
blatter said fifa was investigating those allegations as well and said this issue would also be dealt with by the ethics committee .
" let us do our job .
and let us clarify the situation .
and let us do what the people and the fans , the millions , hundred of millions , thousands of millions of fans are expecting : bring back credibility in fifa , " he said .
aside from spain and portugal , the other countries in the running to host the 2018 world cup are england , russia and the netherlands with belgium .
for the 2022 tournament australia , the united states , qatar , japan and south korea are competing .
blatter acknowledged that the recent incidents showed that it was wrong to elect two world cup hosts on one day .
this is the first time such a vote will take place after a decision made by fifa in 2008 .
the scandal is no surprise , experts say jean-paul mean , president of transparency international switzerland , said the fifa scandal should not come as a surprise .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blatter called on fifa to ' bring back credibility ' " we have seen it with the international olympic committee 10 years ago that there were some strange practices , " he said .
" there is just a flair around sport associations that their governance is not the best yet . "
if there is money around , " corruption shows its ugly head , " he added .
according to mean , there is not enough control of international sports organizations since they are not subject to swiss anti-corruption law .
however , according to blatter , fifa will resolve its problems through its ethics committee .
" it 's an uncomfortable situation for fifa , but we have the necessary instruments to react the proper way , " he said .

friday , oct .
29 bayern - freiburg few would have predicted freiburg being above bayern after nine games but the league table does n't lie .
bayern are suffering a crisis of confidence and fluidity in the bundesliga , while the freiburgers are just enjoying their early season ride .
robin dutt ’ s men have notched points against their mid-table rivals but have come unstuck against the better teams .
ordinarily bayern would be included in that latter category , but right now they 're adrift in mediocrity .
however , at home , with a partisan crowd expecting a return to the status quo , bayern should edge it .
prediction : bayern 2-1 saturday , oct .
30 bremen - nuremberg bremen have managed to steady their ship after a choppy start to the season and are unbeaten in five league games .
they still lie in eighth place but show signs of rediscovering the consistency which could see them climb the table .
but this is werder , remember , and nothing can be taken for granted .
they can win 4-1 one week and get thumped by the same scoreline the next .
nuremberg are experiencing the pendulum of form ; winning one week , losing the next .
if it continues to swing , after beating wolfsburg last week , then bremen should come out on top in this one .
prediction : bremen 3-0 wolfsburg - stuttgart bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : keller has got stuttgart winning again and out of danger jens keller is unbeaten as stuttgart coach after taking over from the sacked christian gross two weeks ago , and the four points his team has eked out in their last two league games have taken them out of the drop zone .
confidence is slowly coming back , boosted by recent europa league and dfb cup wins , and while it is still a nascent recovery , vfb do have some momentum at last .
wolfsburg , on the other hand , have lost theirs .
two defeats and a loss have put the skids under their own revival and coming into this match , stuttgart look to have the edge .
stuttgart : 1-0 cologne - hamburg the enigma that is hamburger sv continues to confound .
after an impressive start followed by a worrying slump , hsv are rebuilding their campaign by going three games unbeaten .
two wins and a goalless draw against bayern could have been seen as a solid base to push on , but their 5-2 cup hammering at the hands of frankfurt in midweek may have released old demons .
cologne , however , appear to have little in their locker which could inflict such a heavy defeat on hamburg - in fact , any kind of defeat looks unlikely .
the bottom club have a solitary win to their name and their second isn ’ t likely to come this weekend , even with the benefit of home advantage .
prediction : hamburg 2-0 kaiserslautern - moenchengladbach kaiserslautern 's last win - the impressive 2-0 defeat of bayern - seems a long time ago .
indeed since those heady days of august , when kaiserslautern notched two wins on the trot , all that has followed is a downward spiral of six reversals and a draw , leaving the red devils hovering perilously over the drop zone .
they got a welcome boost with a midweek cup win - but then again so did gladbach .
however , given that gladbach slipped to second-from-bottom after their sixth defeat of the season last weekend , little should be read into that .
these are two teams in deep , albeit it early , trouble .
their desperation may cancel each other out .
prediction : draw 2-2 st. pauli - frankfurt given they were afforded little chance of staying up this season , st- pauli 's current position in 10th could already be hailed as a triumph .
as long as they do n't start panicking that last week 's defeat to stuttgart and their slight tumble down the league is the start of their predicted demise , st. pauli have the guts to slog it out and remain in the bundesliga .
frankfurt sit a place above them on goal difference with an exact replica of the hamburg club 's record to date .
eintracht come into this game on the back of three wins and a draw so they will be up for it against pauli .
expect a gutsy battle .
prediction : draw 1-1 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : raul did n't expect to swap real madrid for a relegation fight schalke - leverkusen things still look desperate for schalke .
their only victory in the league this season , ground out against freiburg over a month ago , looks increasingly like a false dawn .
a defeat and three draws suggests little has been put right since .
their home form has been pitiful and leverkusen will certainly fancy their chances when they make the journey to gelsenkirchen on saturday .
leverkusen have had plenty of joy on their travels .
unbeaten in four away games with three wins and a draw , it appears to be advantage bayer .
schalke 's revival will have to wait at least another week .
prediction : leverkusen 3-2 sunday , oct .
31 mainz - dortmund halloween came early for dortmund in the dfb cup on wednesday .
instead of the treat they might have expected from a fixture against a third division side , they got tricked in a 4-2 loss on penalties at kickers offenbach .
bvb , who have been on fire in front of goal , will be wondering how they went 120 minutes without scoring and will be hoping they find they find the target ahead of this first-versus-second clash .
mainz , who returned to the summit last weekend , also lost in the cup to alemannia aachen so this game is primed for both teams to put their woes behind them .
dortmund will have the added incentive of going top if they win and could take heart from the fact that mainz 's only league defeat so far has come at home .
prediction : dortmund 3-1 hoffenheim - hanover bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hannover 's players are n't suffering from altitude sickness hanover continues to overachieve this season .
up to third after last week 's victory over cologne , they look to have put the brakes on the minor slide which affected them after losing to st. pauli at the start of october .
hoffenheim , meanwhile , are still challenging at the top end but their own push for the summit has suffered a few hiccups in recent weeks .
after three wins on the bounce at the start of the season , it took hoffenheim until two weeks ago to record their next .
keeping dortmund at bay in last week 's 1-1 draw suggests they 've found their balance again but hanover may edge this to keep their impressive campaign on track .

bvb , who have been on fire in front of goal , will be wondering how they went 120 minutes without scoring and will be hoping they find they find the target ahead of this first-versus-second clash .
mainz , who returned to the summit last weekend , also lost in the cup to alemannia aachen so this game is primed for both teams to put their woes behind them .
dortmund will have the added incentive of going top if they win and could take heart from the fact that mainz 's only league defeat so far has come at home .
prediction : dortmund 3-1 hoffenheim - hanover bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hannover 's players are n't suffering from altitude sickness hanover continues to overachieve this season .
up to third after last week 's victory over cologne , they look to have put the brakes on the minor slide which affected them after losing to st. pauli at the start of october .
hoffenheim , meanwhile , are still challenging at the top end but their own push for the summit has suffered a few hiccups in recent weeks .
after three wins on the bounce at the start of the season , it took hoffenheim until two weeks ago to record their next .
keeping dortmund at bay in last week 's 1-1 draw suggests they 've found their balance again but hanover may edge this to keep their impressive campaign on track .

a pre-summit deal between merkel and sarkozy on how to safeguard the euro annoyed many eu states .
deutsche welle 's brussels correspondent , christoph hasselbach , says that 's why so little progress was achieved . chancellor merkel pushed the right issues , but at this summit , at least , made little concrete progress .
it remains to be seen whether the december summit will in fact bring about the desired effect .
the reason for this lies not least in her advance talks with french president nicolas sarkozy .
through the “ deauville deal ” shortly before the summit , merkel managed to irritate almost everyone in the eu .
those who had supported automatic sanctions for budget sinners noted with horror that the german chancellor had given up on this central goal .
merkel also managed to stab the european commission in the back .
the commission had pursued this aim and , until the deauville conference , could be sure having the support of the germans .
in the end , even european council president herman van rompuy must have felt blindsided .
he was given the task of working out the details of the reforms , and even before he could present his results officially , germany and france declared they 'd already reached a decision .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche welle 's brussels correspondent , christoph hasselbach as a trade-off , merkel had secured assurances from sarkozy that france would echo the german demands for altering the lisbon treaty .
merkel experienced how little that promise was worth when she got to the summit .
rarely has such a wall of resistance built up , above all on the question of taking away voting rights .
this means that early on merkel threw away one of the most important methods of stabilizing the euro , and has - at least so far - has nothing to show for her trade-off .
whether the eu can agree on a so-called small amendment to the treaty by december , is not only down to france .
as far as taking away voting rights is concerned , merkel can forget it .
now she just says she wants to keep the item “ on the agenda ” .
it wo n't go beyond that .
it 's a different story when it comes to the permanent rescue mechanism for financially stricken states .
the participation of the private sectors is popular .
and the fear in the whole eurozone of the collapse of a member state could give the necessary pressure to get through moderate treaty amendments on this issue .
the strange thing is this : had merkel fought for automatic sanctions at the summit , and looked for allies on the issue , she may have saved herself and the whole eu some of the conflict over treaty changes .
because the stricter the disciplinary tools are before a financial crisis , the more unlikely it is , that the whole mechanism will need to be used at all .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de film -pipe- 29.10.2010 berlin and beyond film festival highlights plight of immigrants großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a still from " home from home " directed by sung hyung-cho 's chancellor angela merkel recently said that multi-culturalism in germany had " utterly failed . "
as the debate rages on , one film festival in san francisco aims to offer a more nuanced portrait of immigration . when 8,000 korean nurses arrived in germany during the 1960s , few of them thought they 'd be staying in the country longer than their three-year contracts allowed . thirty-seven years later , three of these women found themselves retiring to korea with their husbands , the sole german residents of the seaside " german village . "
replete with red-tiled roofs , garden gnomes and black bread for breakfast , the retirement community and its german inhabitants have become a must-see for many korean tourists .
they 've also provided the inspiration for sung hyung-cho 's wistful documentary , " endstation der sehnsuechte " -lrb- " home from home " -rrb- .
cameras followed these three couples through their everyday lives – watching as one man created his own sausages so he could get a taste of home and following another as he learned a traditional korean dance .
the women have different experiences , showing a real wariness toward settling in ; as the movie played on , the discomfort these women feel in their birthland grew acute .
" we have no homeland and that is the tragedy of our lives , " one of the women said .
though she 'd long dreamed of returning to korea , she told the camera , " the longer i live here , the more i think of germany . "
heimat has no plural it 's this cross-cultural nostalgia that director sung-hyung cho wanted to address in her film .
" a lot of people have two heimat s -lrb- homes -rrb- , " she told an audience at the berlin and beyond film festival running this week in san francisco , california .
" in german , there is no possibility to have two homes – the word heimat has no plural .
but i have two homes : korea and germany .
when i finally felt at home in germany , i simultaneously became frightened that i would n't be able to feel at home again in korea . "
it was that feeling that drove cho to make the documentary – to explore the depths of homesickness , the bizarre emotional pull that two very different places can have on migrants .
an emphasis on diversity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : another festival highlight was comedy-drama " wedding fever in campobello " " home from home " was just one of several award-winning films playing at the festival this week that added nuance to the extended immigrant experience while showing the diversity of contemporary germany .
" die fremde " -lrb- " when we leave " -rrb- , the festival 's centerpiece film directed by feo aladag , highlighted the plight of a german-born turk who struggled to survive between two very different worlds in modern-day berlin and istanbul .
it 's quite a different story than that shown in the flashbacks in the romantic comedy " wedding fever in campobello " .
the violence and prejudice that the protagonist encountered just after his arrival in osnabrueck in the 1960s are unflinchingly portrayed .
set alongside the modern-day story of his daughter 's wedding , however , the film showcased what the children of these guest workers have lived through as they 've attempted to balance two worlds , two cultures , two languages .
still , the emphasis on the problems facing immigrants was n't an intentional theme for berlin and beyond , said festival director sophaon sorn .
" we really wanted to empower the festival with a diverse program , one that shows a wide variety of human experience , " said sorn .
" and san francisco is a diverse city , it appreciates diversity , so we tried to find movies that would appeal both within the german community here and extend to a broader community as well . "
rudolf de baey , director of the goethe institute of san francisco , emphasized that diversity and immigration are both powerful elements in german society today .
" the reality of germany is that it 's just not a blonde-haired , blue-eyed country any more .
and i think these films reflect that . "

traditional gender attitudes could be to blame . a new government-commissioned study conducted by the german society for man and health -lrb- dgmg -rrb- and the men 's health foundation , was released on thursday , nearly a decade after a ground-breaking report on women 's health was conducted in 2001 .
speaking at its launch , family affairs minister kristina schroeder said it was high time : " a men 's health report is vitally necessary , because we still have a difference in life expectancy between men and women of 5.5 years . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kristina schroeder said the study was urgently needed one of the main causes for concern is the heart .
men suffer heart-related problems much earlier and more frequently and more seriously than women .
dr. ursula mueller-werdan , a cardiologist at the halle university heart clinic , spoke of the significant differences .
" heart attacks manifest themselves about 15 years earlier in men than in women , " she said .
" men often have unhealthy cardiovascular risk profiles in younger years .
that means , for example , high blood pressure well before the age of 55 . "
doctor-shy men the causes are manifold , but the study identified one particular social difference that can cause problems .
men are much less likely to take their ailments to the doctor , and so serious problems often go unnoticed for too long .
on top of this , only two out of 10 german men go to the doctor for precautionary check-ups .
elmar braehler , professor of medicinal psychology at the university of leipzig says men simply need to get over their fears .
" women are used to going to the gynecologist , they go for contraception , for pregnancies , " he said .
" men are scared of what the doctor will find , and tend to avoid doctors .
they see it as part of their social role that they have to show they are healthy . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : men are more likely to keep depression to themselves the study also concluded that men are more likely to let psychological problems go untreated .
three times as many men commit suicide than women , even though only half as many men are diagnosed with depression than women .
male menopause but this finding simply confirmed a relatively commonly held theory .
the study also highlighted a less well-known problem - that of male menopause .
dr. stefan kowalik believes that while hormone problems are routinely treated in women , they are too often ignored in men .
" hormone disorders are not just important for sexuality , " he said .
" the male hormone , testosterone , is also important for blood production , bone production , muscle production .
a lot of people do n't even know that . "
german state health insurance only pays for male check-ups over the age of 55 , and one of the study 's recommendations is the introduction of check-up programs for young men , but old-fashioned attitudes need to be changed first .

the secret ballot will take place on december 2 .
two members remain provisionally suspended . the election of the 2018 and 2022 world cup hosts will go ahead as planned despite an ongoing corruption probe , fifa president joseph blatter said on friday .
blatter made the announcement after a two-day meeting of the fifa executive committee .
the secret ballot will take place on december 2 at fifa 's headquarters in zurich .
" we are five weeks from the final decision so there was never a question of changing anything in the procedure , " blatter said .
" changing the date would have caused problems for fifa and bidders as well since they plan to bring in high-ranked politicians like bill clinton and vladimir putin . "
executive committee members suspended bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : adamu , left , and temarii are accussed of selling their votes last week , fifa provisionally suspended two of the 24 members of the executive committee , amos adamu of nigeria and reynald temarii of tahiti .
there have been allegations that they offered to sell their votes to undercover reporters from the british sunday times newspaper .
blatter said that the fifa ethics committee will deal with their cases before the election of the host countries takes place . " if and when people are suspended for the vote on december 2 , they will not be replaced , " he said .
alleged deal between spain , portugal and qatar the joint 2018 bidders , spain and portugal , are said to have struck a deal with qatar , a 2022 candidate , for the interchange of votes . the chief of the joint spanish-portugal bid , miguel angel lopez , denied the allegations of collusion with qatar .
blatter said fifa was investigating those allegations as well and said this issue would also be dealt with by the ethics committee .
" let us do our job .
and let us clarify the situation .
and let us do what the people and the fans , the millions , hundred of millions , thousands of millions of fans are expecting : bring back credibility in fifa , " he said .
aside from spain and portugal , the other countries in the running to host the 2018 world cup are england , russia and the netherlands with belgium .
for the 2022 tournament australia , the united states , qatar , japan and south korea are competing .
blatter acknowledged that the recent incidents showed that it was wrong to elect two world cup hosts on one day .
this is the first time such a vote will take place after a decision made by fifa in 2008 .
the scandal is no surprise , experts say jean-paul mean , president of transparency international switzerland , said the fifa scandal should not come as a surprise .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blatter called on fifa to ' bring back credibility ' " we have seen it with the international olympic committee 10 years ago that there were some strange practices , " he said .
" there is just a flair around sport associations that their governance is not the best yet . "
if there is money around , " corruption shows its ugly head , " he added .
according to mean , there is not enough control of international sports organizations since they are not subject to swiss anti-corruption law .
however , according to blatter , fifa will resolve its problems through its ethics committee .
" it 's an uncomfortable situation for fifa , but we have the necessary instruments to react the proper way , " he said .

but now the eu wants to make patent protection easier and less expensive for the bloc 's inventors . the economic crisis has n't put european companies and independent inventors off investing into research and development .
judged by the some 60,000 patents issued so far this year in germany , the country 's is on track to meet 2009 's total . " companies followed experts ' advice and continued investing in new products - even though we were in the middle of a crisis , " bettina berner of the german patent and trade mark office -lrb- dpma -rrb- said on thursday at the opening ceremony of the 62nd edition of the inventors ' trade fair iena in nuremberg . hoping for a break through bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some 800 products , like an unpoppable tire , are on display at the iena trade fair inventors from 37 countries are currently presenting some 800 new products at the fair , which the organizers said is the largest of its kind in the world . rollerblades , the folding bicycle and inflatable water wings are some of products that went on to conquer the world after being presented in nuremberg .
like their successful predecessors , many inventors at this year 's fair are hoping for break-through deals with the industry so their products can be mass-produced . shaky hands ?
no problem ! bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the willomat tray lets the clumsy wait tables - without worrying guests bernhard haehnsen is one such inventor .
the former ship 's captain grew tired moping up after glasses spilled their contents as his ship pitched on the high seas .
his neighbor barbara willomat designed a way to stabilize glasses and cups on trays .
special suction cups which can be fixed on a tray hold retainers in different shapes and sizes . " when you 're carrying beer glasses on a tray across wobbly grass in a beer garden , the glasses break easily if you do n't attach them , " haehnsen said , adding that the willomat tray could also facilitate work in hospitals and help anyone with shaky hands . register first , then show it bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moreau 's idea came when he saw a report about delayed flights other products on display at iena this year include a foldable chair attached to a suitcase , invented by 12-year-old johannes von moreau , and a remote control for model sports cars which can be used with one hand rather than two . the two inventors kevin hummel and nicolas rathauser have registered their product with the munich-based german patent office -lrb- dpma -rrb- already .
that 's a step experts strongly recommend . " many independent inventors do n't have their products registered before they present them at a trade fair , " said dpma spokesperson berner . lengthy , costly patent process but inventors who want to protect their product in more than one european country currently have to undergo a tedious and costly process that begins with registration at the european patent office . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : inventors register their products here : the european patent office in munich " you have to decide in how many countries you want to have your patent validated , " heinrich dornbusch , a consultant with german patent marketing agency provendis , told deutsche welle .
" currently you have to do that separately in every single member state .
this means you have to invest a lot of time and money . " the costs for registering a product in 13 of the eu 's 27 countries , for instance , can easily amount to more than 20,000 euros -lrb- $ 28,000 -rrb- - 10 times the cost of a patent in the united states , according to dornbusch three languages sufficient the laborious validation process needs simplification , said stefaan de rynck from the internal market and services division at the european commission . " we want to get rid of the procedure where you have to translate a patent into all languages in order for it to be valid , " he told deutsche welle .
" patents should be valid across the eu if they are in english , french or german . " this would considerably lower registration costs as the largest part currently goes into translating the relevant documents into the individual countries ' languages . authors : nina haase , brigitta moll -lrb- dpa , ap -rrb- editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

under pressure from german chancellor angela merkel and french president nicolas sarkozy , european union leaders set in motion plans to amend the lisbon treaty to create a system to ward off financial crises .
they also endorsed tougher sanctions on states that do not keep their public debt in check .
merkel had insisted on suspending voting rights for member states which breach the rules , but failed to win widespread support for this demand .
smaller eu states in particular were opposed to this idea .
overcoming hostility bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : initially merkel only had the support of sarkozy initially germany and france faced strong hostility to their proposals to change the lisbon treaty .
a number of states rejected the idea of far-reaching amendments that would have forced them to hold referendums , which would have been expected to fail .
chancellor merkel was forced to back down on this issue .
the german chancellor had been battling for weeks to push through changes that would provide the eurozone with greater stability .
at home , she has faced public hostility to the bailout of greece and the creation of a massive rescue fund designed to protect the euro .
merkel wanted to write the creation of the rescue fund into the treaty .
europe 's biggest economy contributed the bulk of the 750-billion-euro -lrb- $ 1 trillion -rrb- european financial stability fund , which was hastily established in may to save greece from financial collapse .
the fund is now to be turned into a " permanent crisis mechanism . "
at the eu summit in brussels , which started on thursday , merkel fought into the night to push through her proposals , winning agreement only in the early hours of friday morning .
the german chancellor said she was satisfied with the outcome of the summit : " we have put forward our essential points , " she said .
" everyone is in agreement that a limited change to the lisbon treaty is necessary . "
merkel stressed the new crisis mechanism would only be " valid for cases in which the stability of the euro as a whole is at risk . "
" should a country ever need to make use of this , it would be faced with very strict requirements , " she said .
cautious welcome from the german media the german business daily handelsblatt said the agreement was a significant achievement , calling it a " breakthrough " for merkel , whose center-right coalition has suffered a drop in support in the polls in recent months .
however , because merkel 's more far-reaching treaty changes were put on the backburner , the german newspaper hannoversche allgemeine zeitung said the deal amounted to a " light solution " to the problem of imposing budgetary discipline .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : van rompuy is now charged with drafting the changes guenther kirschbaum , a member of merkel 's christian democrats , who chairs the european affairs committee in the lower house , said the agreement amounted to real progress .
" it is a great step forward because we now have a crisis mechanism so that in future we will not have to deal with problems like the greek crisis on an ad hoc basis , " kirschbaum said .
the proposed changes to the lisbon treaty are to be drafted in time for another eu summit in december .
the changes are to be agreed and implemented by 2013 , when the current rescue fund expires .
european council president herman van rompuy told a news conference in brussels that " important decisions to strengthen the eurozone " had been taken .

german chancellor angela merkel said the leaders had had a " profound and difficult discussion , " and other participants described the discussions as heated and emotional . merkel added that she was satisfied with the outcome of the debate : " we have promoted our essential points , " she said .
" everyone is in agreement that a limited change to the lisbon treaty is necessary . " eu council president herman van rompuy told a news conference that " important decisions to strengthen the eurozone " had been taken .
" we recommend a robust and credible permanent crisis resolution mechanism to safeguard the financial stability of the eurozone as a whole , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : van rompuy is now charged with proposing the amendments merkel stressed that the current , limited protection of loan guarantees for euro states was not a permanent solution under the current treaty conditions .
she said the new crisis mechanism would only be " valid for cases where the stability of the euro as a whole is at risk . " " we said once more that ... should a country ever need to make use of this , it would be faced with very strict requirements , " she said . opposition to budget increase some non-eurozone states threw around their weight in the discussions , like the united kingdom , which sought to cap the eu 's budget next year , and poland , which wants the calculation of its national debt to take into account costly pension reforms . merkel chimed in , saying , " if we have to reduce our budget at home - we do this at the federal level by more than 3 percent - it can not be that the european budget rises by nearly 6 percent . " the leaders asked van rompuy to prepare potential changes to the lisbon treaty ahead of another eu summit in december .
the changes are to be agreed on by mid-2013 , the expiration date of a 750-billion euro -lrb- $ 1 trillion -rrb- fund set up last may to reassure markets that greece 's debt crisis would not spill over to the rest of the continent . tough reform process bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy and merkel jointly proposed tough sanctions on overspenders germany , europe 's largest economy , led the calls at the summit for tougher penalties on states that exceed the eurozone 's limit on budget deficits of 3 percent of gross domestic product . merkel and french president nicolas sarkozy had called for the suspension of voting rights of members who flout budget rules , but such a reform was unpopular with several smaller states . " if treaty change is to reduce the rights of member states on voting , i find it unacceptable , and , frankly speaking , it is not realistic , " european commission president jose manuel barroso said . it would also likely turn into a political nightmare for national governments .
the lisbon treaty took 10 years of wrangling to enact , after challenges in national courts and referendum failures in france , ireland and the netherlands . " many countries do not want a huge treaty reform , and therefore we are trying to narrow it down to a very limited treaty change that should be acceptable for countries without having to face referendums , " swedish prime minister fredrik reinfeldt said . although the proposals were weaker than merkel had pushed for , she said the eu had underlined that " private investors will not be able to make money or speculate against the euro .

dw 's ramon garcia-ziemsen writes about how germany 's history was deliberately repressed . yes , it is shocking how german diplomats were complicit in the holocaust in the second world war , and how they were involved in its implementation .
it 's unbelievable how much continuity there was in the diplomatic personnel after 1945 in germany : men who had participated in the nazi extermination policies later made careers and protected each other , even before their involvement was made public .
but it 's just as incredible how long it has taken : that only now , 65 years on , this has come to the attention of the wider german public .
in 1979 , a book was published by a british historian about the participation of the foreign office in the so called " final solution , " the nazi description for the murder of european jews .
the book describes what the nature of the foreign office 's participation in the holocaust was , how deportation orders were signed there , how the office was a systematic element of the nazi killing machine .
and even back in the 1950s , there was clear evidence showing that the foreign office was certainly not a " school of passive resistance " against hitler , as it liked to present itself in the post-war period .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ramon garcia-ziemsen head of dw 's german culture department a lot was known , a lot was forgotten in short : much was known .
and almost everything was forgotten .
how the germans dealt with the third reich is not as exemplary as it has often been perceived around the world , it is also a history of forgetting and repressing .
the elites have often knowingly prevented a discussion about their past .
and the public allowed this discourse to be prevented .
how could this happen ? after 1945 , german society was always looking for the " good , " for the " other germany " - the " other germany " that had remained innocent , that had perhaps not been openly resistant , but did not allow itself to be sucked into nazi ideology ; which had remained resistant , which had rejected the nazi madness , and of which one might even be proud .
because it wanted a fresh start , the young germany did not think it could live with the weight of such a large feeling of guilt .
myths and collective guilt and in this way the yarn was spun : first came the myth that many germans had only found out about the holocaust in 1945 from the allies .
the myth was born that only a small group around hitler had known what had happened in concentration camps like auschwitz and dachau .
the germans were a nation led astray .
this position was also of course a reaction to the similarly blanket collective guilt theory purported by the allies after the war . then came the myth of the armed forces : that the soldiers had played almost no part in hitler 's atrocities - and besides that everything had been carried out under orders .
both theories were exposed by historians as false only decades later , from the 1970s , through studies , books and exhibitions .
large parts of the population knew not only why jewish friends and neighbors had suddenly disappeared , but they had also assisted with this disappearance .
soldiers took part in shooting jews - voluntarily and not under orders .
but again it took years and decades , well into the 1990s , until this knowledge resulted in a public debate and led to a real demystification . where the myth certainly still existed was in the foreign office , one of the last places where the fairy tale of the " other germany " could live on .
the solidarity of the diplomats worked so well and perhaps the respect for the future german president richard von weizsaecker was too great .
weizsaecker 's father ernst was a top diplomat , who supported the nazi ideology in the foreign office .
but germany 's longing for this " other germany " , which existed much less than most germans had thought , was also too great .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de competition -pipe- 29.10.2010 eu pushes to simplify patents for new bright ideas großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protecting your product across the eu is costly and complex european inventors currently spend 10 times as much protecting their ideas as their us counterparts .
but now the eu wants to make patent protection easier and less expensive for the bloc 's inventors . the economic crisis has n't put european companies and independent inventors off investing into research and development .
judged by the some 60,000 patents issued so far this year in germany , the country 's is on track to meet 2009 's total . " companies followed experts ' advice and continued investing in new products - even though we were in the middle of a crisis , " bettina berner of the german patent and trade mark office -lrb- dpma -rrb- said on thursday at the opening ceremony of the 62nd edition of the inventors ' trade fair iena in nuremberg . hoping for a break through bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some 800 products , like an unpoppable tire , are on display at the iena trade fair inventors from 37 countries are currently presenting some 800 new products at the fair , which the organizers said is the largest of its kind in the world . rollerblades , the folding bicycle and inflatable water wings are some of products that went on to conquer the world after being presented in nuremberg .
like their successful predecessors , many inventors at this year 's fair are hoping for break-through deals with the industry so their products can be mass-produced . shaky hands ?
no problem ! bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the willomat tray lets the clumsy wait tables - without worrying guests bernhard haehnsen is one such inventor .
the former ship 's captain grew tired moping up after glasses spilled their contents as his ship pitched on the high seas .
his neighbor barbara willomat designed a way to stabilize glasses and cups on trays .
special suction cups which can be fixed on a tray hold retainers in different shapes and sizes . " when you 're carrying beer glasses on a tray across wobbly grass in a beer garden , the glasses break easily if you do n't attach them , " haehnsen said , adding that the willomat tray could also facilitate work in hospitals and help anyone with shaky hands . register first , then show it bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moreau 's idea came when he saw a report about delayed flights other products on display at iena this year include a foldable chair attached to a suitcase , invented by 12-year-old johannes von moreau , and a remote control for model sports cars which can be used with one hand rather than two . the two inventors kevin hummel and nicolas rathauser have registered their product with the munich-based german patent office -lrb- dpma -rrb- already .
that 's a step experts strongly recommend . " many independent inventors do n't have their products registered before they present them at a trade fair , " said dpma spokesperson berner . lengthy , costly patent process but inventors who want to protect their product in more than one european country currently have to undergo a tedious and costly process that begins with registration at the european patent office . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : inventors register their products here : the european patent office in munich " you have to decide in how many countries you want to have your patent validated , " heinrich dornbusch , a consultant with german patent marketing agency provendis , told deutsche welle .
" currently you have to do that separately in every single member state .
this means you have to invest a lot of time and money . " the costs for registering a product in 13 of the eu 's 27 countries , for instance , can easily amount to more than 20,000 euros -lrb- $ 28,000 -rrb- - 10 times the cost of a patent in the united states , according to dornbusch three languages sufficient the laborious validation process needs simplification , said stefaan de rynck from the internal market and services division at the european commission . " we want to get rid of the procedure where you have to translate a patent into all languages in order for it to be valid , " he told deutsche welle .
" patents should be valid across the eu if they are in english , french or german . " this would considerably lower registration costs as the largest part currently goes into translating the relevant documents into the individual countries ' languages . authors : nina haase , brigitta moll -lrb- dpa , ap -rrb- editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

where does the work go from here ?
teeb is a project , but its also a kind of approach we have designed .
we hope countries will adopt that approach .
countries like brazil and india have already endorsed this … also , the european union is interested in moving this forward .
and i just learned that the adb is interested in supporting an asian teeb implementation .

national accounting is one of our recommendations .
and i hope that donor countries -lrb- present in nagoya -rrb- will be able to support building capacity in developing countries where it does n't exist .
what do you mean exactly , when you say ' building capacity ' ?
capacity as in , human capacity .
to have teeb type research , environmental economics .
and capacity as in , data collection and gathering and analysis .
these capacities have to be built in countries , and people have to support that .
finally , and most importantly , i believe there is a need for a teeb foundation , whose main purpose is to research and establish externalities of corporations , sector by sector .
to show that this is possible , we in teeb have already done the calculations for the construction sector in china and its impacts on forests .
and for the cotton industry in central asia and its impacts on the aral sea .
but of course we need 500 to 1000 such studies , because you need it literally in every big country or in every big biome for every major sector .
the teeb foundation should work closely with the individual national accountancy bodies , and the international accounting standards board , to work out methodologies and standardizing them .
this would enable leading corporations to actually disclose these in their annual reports and accounts .
that is the end game - the holy grail .
but we need to start working toward this now .

where does the work go from here ?
teeb is a project , but its also a kind of approach we have designed .
we hope countries will adopt that approach .
countries like brazil and india have already endorsed this … also , the european union is interested in moving this forward .
and i just learned that the adb is interested in supporting an asian teeb implementation .
but i think what is interesting is to see what needs to be done .
national accounting is one of our recommendations .
and i hope that donor countries -lrb- present in nagoya -rrb- will be able to support building capacity in developing countries where it does n't exist .
what do you mean exactly , when you say ' building capacity ' ?
capacity as in , human capacity .
to have teeb type research , environmental economics .
and capacity as in , data collection and gathering and analysis .
these capacities have to be built in countries , and people have to support that .
finally , and most importantly , i believe there is a need for a teeb foundation , whose main purpose is to research and establish externalities of corporations , sector by sector .
to show that this is possible , we in teeb have already done the calculations for the construction sector in china and its impacts on forests .
and for the cotton industry in central asia and its impacts on the aral sea .
but of course we need 500 to 1000 such studies , because you need it literally in every big country or in every big biome for every major sector .
the teeb foundation should work closely with the individual national accountancy bodies , and the international accounting standards board , to work out methodologies and standardizing them .
this would enable leading corporations to actually disclose these in their annual reports and accounts .
that is the end game - the holy grail .
but we need to start working toward this now .

the study outlined a path for a radical rethink of economics . pavan sukhdev currently heads up the un environment programme 's green economy initiative .
he led the groundbreaking study " the economics of ecosystems and biodiversity , " or teeb , which was launched by germany and the european commission in 2007 .
the last of the study 's volumes was delivered at this year 's biodiversity summit in nagoya , japan , which wrapped up on oct .
29 , 2010 .
the report laid out " opportunities for solutions " on accounting for biodiversity .
deutsche welle : pavan sukhdev , you describe your study results and recommendations for accounting for biodiversity as ' opportunities . '
but i 'm sure that in these stretched economic times , a lot of businesses might be thinking , ' i do n't want more regulations , more contingencies to cope with . '
how would you answer them ?
pavan sukhdev : one of the main problems with biodiversity is that because it 's nature , its many services are delivered free .
i call this ' the economic invisibility of nature . '
because of this , we have a tendency not to value what we receive from them – be it clean air , fresh water , or nutrients that come from forests to the fields , or some other benefit , like pollination .
i mean , you never see a bee sending you an invoice , or a tree sending you an invoice , either for pollination or for air cleaning , but that 's what they do .
these are valuable economic services .
without pollination from insects , you 'd be out of pocket perhaps 200 billion dollars per annum if you tried to do these things manually .
so you need to recognize the reality that our economic compass is defective .
it 's partial ; it looks at some things and not at others .
it looks mainly at goods and services that are traded and priced in markets , but not those which are not traded and priced in markets .
and almost everything that comes from nature is neither traded nor priced in markets .
specifically , how would a sector or industry start incorporating biodiversity into their accounts ?
the reality is that today 's corporation is not compelled to do anything .
they only have to optimize shareholder benefits and profits .
and unless they see things from a long-term perspective , then the drive to externalize costs is n't very strong . but when you have a long term perspective , then it becomes a relationship with your shareholders , your customers , your local society , your local governments .
and when you take that longer term perspective on business , that 's when you begin to say : " aha … well we do have cost externalities . "
could you explain externalities ?
that is the economic term for the costs to a third party of an economic transaction between two other parties .
if i sell you a car , then there are costs , in terms of carbon emissions and maybe air pollution , suffered by third parties .
who do you believe should bear these external costs ?
ideally , a combination of you and me .
i made the car , you drove the car .
so somewhere there is a line between you and me who should be internalizing the costs .
but as of today with our current economic system , and with its compass , which does not measure externalities , neither of us is paying for this .
so you are talking about a radical shakeup of the economics of how businesses look at profit and loss , really .
yes , we are talking about a radical shakeup of how they look at third-party costs .
today they do n't need to look at it because regulations do n't require it .
what we 're saying in teeb is that there is a long-term self interest here , for businesses , in terms of shareholders , looking towards customers , and effectively getting a social license to operate as a business .
the coca cola corporation has already decided that by 2020 , they are going to be freshwater neutral .
and for a them - for whom fresh water is a key resource input into production - that is a huge decision .
i see the economic wisdom in that , because at the end f the day , they are effectively saying : ' look , we are aware of the risk of freshwater scarcity .
we know that the pricing of freshwater is going to be changed .
let us design our product in a way that it makes itself freshwater neutral . let us already anticipate the future risks to our business so that we can survive and make profits into the future . '
well , coke is an enormous multinational .
what about smaller companies ?
all we are saying , is : be aware of it .
be conscious of it .
and what we hope will happen is that some companies will take leadership and start quantifying their externalities , and then start managing them .
take rio tinto , a mining company .
they 're an international company .
they 've got a five stage plan where , location by location , they are looking at how to first mitigate their impact on biodiversity , then offset them , or also avoid certain cases - you can just decide not mine in a certain area if you know it to be bio-diversely rich - and to educating their staff and other people . their intention is by 2015 , to be biodiversity positive .
they are among the first signatories to this concept of net positive impact on biodiversity .
it 's a positive thinking strategy .
lets look at how countries will deal with this idea .
the strategic plan that is part of cop 10 contains a clause about incorporating biodiversity loss into international accounts in the future .
what should countries be ready to do by 2020 ?
i think they should get the important aspects of natural capital into national accounts . .
currently , every country in the world does not report or disclose its biggest asset - natural capital .
national balance sheets are based on a system of accounts which do not capture natural capital .
and this is a defect in the way that we have designed the accounts of society .
the irony is that the designers - james mead and richard stone , who designed the system of national accounts for the post-war years and the marshall plan years … acknowledged 25 years ago , that they had n't finished their work .
they wanted to look at social dimensions and environmental dimensions , and of course production dimensions .
but they only ever had time to look at the production dimensions .
and now , 25 years later , you and i are still having this discussion : should we or should n't we ?
come on , we have to !
it has to be done .

the study outlined a path for a radical rethink of economics . pavan sukhdev currently heads up the un environment programme 's green economy initiative .
he led the groundbreaking study " the economics of ecosystems and biodiversity , " or teeb , which was launched by germany and the european commission in 2007 .
the last of the study 's volumes was delivered at this year 's biodiversity summit in nagoya , japan , which wrapped up on oct .
29 , 2010 .
the report laid out " opportunities for solutions " on accounting for biodiversity .
deutsche welle : pavan sukhdev , you describe your study results and recommendations for accounting for biodiversity as ' opportunities . '
but i 'm sure that in these stretched economic times , a lot of businesses might be thinking , ' i do n't want more regulations , more contingencies to cope with . '
how would you answer them ?
pavan sukhdev : one of the main problems with biodiversity is that because it 's nature , its many services are delivered free .
i call this ' the economic invisibility of nature . '
because of this , we have a tendency not to value what we receive from them – be it clean air , fresh water , or nutrients that come from forests to the fields , or some other benefit , like pollination .
i mean , you never see a bee sending you an invoice , or a tree sending you an invoice , either for pollination or for air cleaning , but that 's what they do .
these are valuable economic services .
without pollination from insects , you 'd be out of pocket perhaps 200 billion dollars per annum if you tried to do these things manually .
so you need to recognize the reality that our economic compass is defective .
it 's partial ; it looks at some things and not at others .
it looks mainly at goods and services that are traded and priced in markets , but not those which are not traded and priced in markets .
and almost everything that comes from nature is neither traded nor priced in markets .
specifically , how would a sector or industry start incorporating biodiversity into their accounts ?
the reality is that today 's corporation is not compelled to do anything .
they only have to optimize shareholder benefits and profits .
and unless they see things from a long-term perspective , then the drive to externalize costs is n't very strong . but when you have a long term perspective , then it becomes a relationship with your shareholders , your customers , your local society , your local governments .
and when you take that longer term perspective on business , that 's when you begin to say : " aha … well we do have cost externalities . "
could you explain externalities ?
that is the economic term for the costs to a third party of an economic transaction between two other parties .
if i sell you a car , then there are costs , in terms of carbon emissions and maybe air pollution , suffered by third parties .
who do you believe should bear these external costs ?
ideally , a combination of you and me .
i made the car , you drove the car .
so somewhere there is a line between you and me who should be internalizing the costs .
but as of today with our current economic system , and with its compass , which does not measure externalities , neither of us is paying for this .
so you are talking about a radical shakeup of the economics of how businesses look at profit and loss , really .
yes , we are talking about a radical shakeup of how they look at third-party costs .
today they do n't need to look at it because regulations do n't require it .
what we 're saying in teeb is that there is a long-term self interest here , for businesses , in terms of shareholders , looking towards customers , and effectively getting a social license to operate as a business .
the coca cola corporation has already decided that by 2020 , they are going to be freshwater neutral .
and for a them - for whom fresh water is a key resource input into production - that is a huge decision .
i see the economic wisdom in that , because at the end f the day , they are effectively saying : ' look , we are aware of the risk of freshwater scarcity .
we know that the pricing of freshwater is going to be changed .
let us design our product in a way that it makes itself freshwater neutral . let us already anticipate the future risks to our business so that we can survive and make profits into the future . '
well , coke is an enormous multinational .
what about smaller companies ?
all we are saying , is : be aware of it .
be conscious of it .
and what we hope will happen is that some companies will take leadership and start quantifying their externalities , and then start managing them .
take rio tinto , a mining company .
they 're an international company .
they 've got a five stage plan where , location by location , they are looking at how to first mitigate their impact on biodiversity , then offset them , or also avoid certain cases - you can just decide not mine in a certain area if you know it to be bio-diversely rich - and to educating their staff and other people . their intention is by 2015 , to be biodiversity positive .
they are among the first signatories to this concept of net positive impact on biodiversity .
it 's a positive thinking strategy .
lets look at how countries will deal with this idea .
the strategic plan that is part of cop 10 contains a clause about incorporating biodiversity loss into international accounts in the future .
what should countries be ready to do by 2020 ?
i think they should get the important aspects of natural capital into national accounts . .
currently , every country in the world does not report or disclose its biggest asset - natural capital .
national balance sheets are based on a system of accounts which do not capture natural capital .
and this is a defect in the way that we have designed the accounts of society .
the irony is that the designers - james mead and richard stone , who designed the system of national accounts for the post-war years and the marshall plan years … acknowledged 25 years ago , that they had n't finished their work .
they wanted to look at social dimensions and environmental dimensions , and of course production dimensions .
but they only ever had time to look at the production dimensions .
and now , 25 years later , you and i are still having this discussion : should we or should n't we ?
come on , we have to !
it has to be done .

the clock had passed 1:30 a.m. on saturday when the japanese chairman of the meeting , embattled environment minister ryu matsumoto , brought the gavel down on the final and most contentious issues , each time greeted with a standing ovation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zoos may eventually become the only place to find tigers the eventual success of the summit came down to three pieces of legislation : a strategic plan for reversing the decline of the world 's species by 2020 ; the finance for that plan ; and what proved the thorniest problem of all – a deal to prevent the misappropriation of genetic resources .
anti- ' biopiracy ' progress developing countries have long accused companies in the developed world of " biopiracy " - exploiting the traditional knowledge of indigenous groups and genetic material that they have sovereign rights over , in order to create commercially successful products , typically drugs or cosmetics .
african countries , and poorer countries with vast natural resources like india and brazil , had looked to the summit in nagoya to close regulatory loopholes , which they say allow foreign companies to exploit their resources without paying adequate compensation .
given the gap between the positions of developing and developed countries on this issue , there was widespread surprise after the conference that the final text - hastily drafted by the japanese presidency and key negotiators - had garnered enough support to achieve consensus .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the japanese presidency of talks has tried to facilitate a compromise only a small group of central and south american countries - in particular cuba and bolivia - objected to the text , but did not stand in the way of its adoption by the plenary .
other developing nations acknowledged that the new deal on what the un convention on biodiversity terms " access and benefit sharing " -lrb- abs -rrb- was not perfect , but the repeated refrain was that “ they could live with it . "
leaving nagoya without a deal on abs , said many delegates , would have dealt a serious blow to attempts to stop biopiracy , as well as to international environment negotiations as a whole .
a 10-year plan the abs protocol , now renamed the nagoya protocol , was not the only qualified success of the night .
the strategic plan for 2011-2020 set out goals for the preservation and protection of nature , even though many of the goals from the previous plan were not met .
the new plan contains both new targets , like stopping the extinction of known endangered species by 2020 , and old , unfulfilled promises , like such as the aim of designating 10 percent of all oceans as protected areas .
delegates also agreed on a plan to set up an international body to provide governments with better information for making decisions that can impact on the environment .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nature yields many of the genetic compounds found in modern pharmaceuticals the body is to be called the intergovernmental platform on biodiversity and ecosystem services and will serve a similar function to the intergovernmental panel on climate change .
it only awaits approval by the united nations general assembly .
cash for nature the summit also saw the culmination of a series of reports that attempt to bridge the divide between nature and economics .

one lawmaker says it 's time to do long-term immigrants a favor and loosen up that rule . new legislation introduced in the german parliament could allow certain groups to get a german passport more easily and quickly , as well as granting more people the right to hold dual citizenship .
currently , immigrants who want to get german citizenship must take a naturalization test and show that they have a firm grasp of the language .
in addition , they generally have to renounce their previous citizenship .
pensioners who came to the country as immigrants are one of the groups that would benefit most from a change to the law .
if the bill were passed , a person who is over 53 years old and has been living in germany for at least 15 years could apply for a passport without meeting the language requirements .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kilic wants to see an immigrant 's work rewarded " if a person has made a contribution to this society , i want to make it easier for them to become citizens , " green party parliamentarian memet kilic told deutsche welle .
" especially older immigrants - who gave their youth and health to build up this country - should be able to obtain citizenship without a language requirement .
that way , we can win the hearts of their children and grandchildren for this country . "
integration conversation kilic 's bill comes as the integration of immigrants is under the microscope in germany .
chancellor angela merkel , a christian democrat , said earlier this month that multiculturalism had failed in germany .
there have also been repeated calls for immigrants to integrate better into german society by learning the language and customs .
kilic , who was born in turkey , said the legislation he sponsored would be welcome news to immigrants .
" third-generation immigrant children in germany hear three times a day that they do n't belong to this country , " he said .
" what good is that ?
i want to turn the tables . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : integration is hard to define in germany in support of the bill , kilic cited statistics showing that the number of citizens naturalized in germany each year had fallen by 20 percent since 2004 .
this was an indication that becoming a german citizen was simply too difficult , he said .
without citizenship , many of germany 's 6.7 million immigrants do not have the right to vote in the country .
but citizenship goes beyond the legal realm .
" integration means more than simply structural integration , " said guelistan guerbey , a political scientist at berlin 's free university .
" it has a very strong emotional and psychological dimension . "
this is especially true for dual citizens .
if the bill became law , an immigrant would no longer have to give up their passport to become german .
guerbey said this would have a positive effect .
" a person has emotional ties in both directions , " she said , " and dual citizenship is a legal recognition of this emotional state . "
time to learn german but while legal benefits and emotional satisfaction might encourage a retired immigrant with less-than-perfect german to apply for citizenship under the loosened rules of the proposed law , they may never get the chance .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : learning german is essential for integration , says grindel on thursday in the bundestag , reinhard grindel of the governing christian democrats , was clear about what his party thought of the proposal .
" when someone wants to become a german citizen , " grindel said , " then i have to be able to say , as an incentive , that you must learn german if you have n't learned it well enough already .
that 's a part of the integration process - to finally learn german . "
and there is reason to believe that many retired immigrants in germany would n't apply for a german passport if the rules were loosened .
some come from other european union countries , where moving across borders is n't problematic , though they do not have full voting rights in germany .
but kilic says there are some 2,000-3,000 retirees from other countries who would gladly take advantage of the opportunity .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de war crimes -pipe- 29.10.2010 argentine judge invokes universal justice to probe spain 's franco-era crimes großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the franco regime was known for its brutality the descendants of victims of the spanish civil war may finally be about to see justice done after an argentine judge opens a case into war-time murders and human rights abuses . spain is well known internationally for its efforts to bring latin american dictators to justice .
but now these roles have been reversed .
an argentine judge is petitioning spain to investigate franco 's civil war crimes .
every thursday night , hundreds of people march to protest against impunity in central madrid .
many are elderly , carrying placards bearing the images of victims killed by right-wing death squads during the spanish civil war in the mid-to-late 1930s .
among the marchers is 79-year-old hilda farfante gallo , who wears a black and white photo of her parents around her neck .
hilda 's parents were murdered when she was five years old .
both were teachers .
they still lie in unmarked graves and their assassins have never been brought to justice .
in fact , spain has yet to investigate any of the human rights abuses committed during the civil war - or during general franco 's subsequent 40-year dictatorship - due to an amnesty law .
new hope bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the civil war effected the entire peninsula but demonstrators on thursday were optimistic that this might be about to change .
a crusading argentine judge has taken an initial step toward opening the first investigation into human rights abuses during the war .
in buenos aires , maria servini took up the case of examining the systematic murder of over 100,000 opponents of the franco regime , which rights groups say amounts to crimes against humanity .
invoking the principle of universal jurisdiction , the formal petition from the argentine judge indicated that her court would investigate allegations of genocide , tens of thousands of assassinations and the fate of stolen children - if spain could not demonstrate it would do so .
healing old wounds argentine emigre rodolfo franco had two uncles murdered by his country 's military regime .
he thinks the case will be good for spain .
" it sounds quite promising because it could open a new way to investigate what happened in the civil war .
it seems very difficult to go on with this in spain because of political interests , " he says .
" it 's a very difficult subject , even now , in spain .
i think it 's a good thing that international judges can interfere and judge certain things , because they are , in a way , more impartial than local people . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franco ruled spain for almost 40 years the spanish government has not yet responded formally to the petition but has said it will cooperate .
universal justice ironically , spain is more used to dishing out universal justice than receiving it .
the crusading spanish judge baltasar garzon , for example , was central to the indictment of former chilean despot augusto pinochet .
like maria servini , garzon relied on the principal of universal jurisdiction in his efforts to bring pinochet to justice .
according to that principal , states can claim jurisdiction over persons whose alleged crimes were committed outside their borders , but only if the crimes are deemed crimes against all and are too serious to be overlooked as mere discrepancies between legal systems .
but amnesty laws have made prosecution over franco-era crimes a tricky business .
garzon fell afoul of the laws when he opened an investigation into atrocities carried out by franco 's regime .
he was suspended and is now awaiting trial on charges of " distorting the law , " to the anguish of victims ' families .
long way to go bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : garzon is accused of breaking amnesty laws campaigner emilio silva said that spain was still a long way from addressing its past .
" the discussion in spain is like chile , argentina , " he says .
" the same arguments all the time : ' we have to look to the future . '
i think today there is still a lot of sociological francoism in spanish society , and they do n't want to look at their crimes .
" we are crying ' killers ' about the -lsb- basque -rsb- terrorist group eta , but in spain there are a lot of killers , because we had an amnesty law in 1977 . "
with garzon under indictment , many spaniards now feel the argentine court case is the last hope for justice .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de integration -pipe- 29.10.2010 greens propose simplified citizenship laws for retired immigrants großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the proposal would make becoming a citizen easier for some good german is required to get german citizenship .
one lawmaker says it 's time to do long-term immigrants a favor and loosen up that rule . new legislation introduced in the german parliament could allow certain groups to get a german passport more easily and quickly , as well as granting more people the right to hold dual citizenship .
currently , immigrants who want to get german citizenship must take a naturalization test and show that they have a firm grasp of the language .
in addition , they generally have to renounce their previous citizenship .
pensioners who came to the country as immigrants are one of the groups that would benefit most from a change to the law .
if the bill were passed , a person who is over 53 years old and has been living in germany for at least 15 years could apply for a passport without meeting the language requirements .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kilic wants to see an immigrant 's work rewarded " if a person has made a contribution to this society , i want to make it easier for them to become citizens , " green party parliamentarian memet kilic told deutsche welle .
" especially older immigrants - who gave their youth and health to build up this country - should be able to obtain citizenship without a language requirement .
that way , we can win the hearts of their children and grandchildren for this country . "
integration conversation kilic 's bill comes as the integration of immigrants is under the microscope in germany .
chancellor angela merkel , a christian democrat , said earlier this month that multiculturalism had failed in germany .
there have also been repeated calls for immigrants to integrate better into german society by learning the language and customs .
kilic , who was born in turkey , said the legislation he sponsored would be welcome news to immigrants .
" third-generation immigrant children in germany hear three times a day that they do n't belong to this country , " he said .
" what good is that ?
i want to turn the tables . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : integration is hard to define in germany in support of the bill , kilic cited statistics showing that the number of citizens naturalized in germany each year had fallen by 20 percent since 2004 .
this was an indication that becoming a german citizen was simply too difficult , he said .
without citizenship , many of germany 's 6.7 million immigrants do not have the right to vote in the country .
but citizenship goes beyond the legal realm .
" integration means more than simply structural integration , " said guelistan guerbey , a political scientist at berlin 's free university .
" it has a very strong emotional and psychological dimension . "
this is especially true for dual citizens .
if the bill became law , an immigrant would no longer have to give up their passport to become german .
guerbey said this would have a positive effect .
" a person has emotional ties in both directions , " she said , " and dual citizenship is a legal recognition of this emotional state . "
time to learn german but while legal benefits and emotional satisfaction might encourage a retired immigrant with less-than-perfect german to apply for citizenship under the loosened rules of the proposed law , they may never get the chance .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : learning german is essential for integration , says grindel on thursday in the bundestag , reinhard grindel of the governing christian democrats , was clear about what his party thought of the proposal .
" when someone wants to become a german citizen , " grindel said , " then i have to be able to say , as an incentive , that you must learn german if you have n't learned it well enough already .
that 's a part of the integration process - to finally learn german . "
and there is reason to believe that many retired immigrants in germany would n't apply for a german passport if the rules were loosened .
some come from other european union countries , where moving across borders is n't problematic , though they do not have full voting rights in germany .
but kilic says there are some 2,000-3,000 retirees from other countries who would gladly take advantage of the opportunity .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de integration -pipe- 29.10.2010 greens propose simplified citizenship laws for retired immigrants großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the proposal would make becoming a citizen easier for some good german is required to get german citizenship .
one lawmaker says it 's time to do long-term immigrants a favor and loosen up that rule . new legislation introduced in the german parliament could allow certain groups to get a german passport more easily and quickly , as well as granting more people the right to hold dual citizenship .
currently , immigrants who want to get german citizenship must take a naturalization test and show that they have a firm grasp of the language .
in addition , they generally have to renounce their previous citizenship .
pensioners who came to the country as immigrants are one of the groups that would benefit most from a change to the law .
if the bill were passed , a person who is over 53 years old and has been living in germany for at least 15 years could apply for a passport without meeting the language requirements .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kilic wants to see an immigrant 's work rewarded " if a person has made a contribution to this society , i want to make it easier for them to become citizens , " green party parliamentarian memet kilic told deutsche welle .
" especially older immigrants - who gave their youth and health to build up this country - should be able to obtain citizenship without a language requirement .
that way , we can win the hearts of their children and grandchildren for this country . "
integration conversation kilic 's bill comes as the integration of immigrants is under the microscope in germany .
chancellor angela merkel , a christian democrat , said earlier this month that multiculturalism had failed in germany .
there have also been repeated calls for immigrants to integrate better into german society by learning the language and customs .
kilic , who was born in turkey , said the legislation he sponsored would be welcome news to immigrants .
" third-generation immigrant children in germany hear three times a day that they do n't belong to this country , " he said .
" what good is that ?
i want to turn the tables . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : integration is hard to define in germany in support of the bill , kilic cited statistics showing that the number of citizens naturalized in germany each year had fallen by 20 percent since 2004 .
this was an indication that becoming a german citizen was simply too difficult , he said .
without citizenship , many of germany 's 6.7 million immigrants do not have the right to vote in the country .
but citizenship goes beyond the legal realm .
" integration means more than simply structural integration , " said guelistan guerbey , a political scientist at berlin 's free university .
" it has a very strong emotional and psychological dimension . "
this is especially true for dual citizens .
if the bill became law , an immigrant would no longer have to give up their passport to become german .
guerbey said this would have a positive effect .
" a person has emotional ties in both directions , " she said , " and dual citizenship is a legal recognition of this emotional state . "
time to learn german but while legal benefits and emotional satisfaction might encourage a retired immigrant with less-than-perfect german to apply for citizenship under the loosened rules of the proposed law , they may never get the chance .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : learning german is essential for integration , says grindel on thursday in the bundestag , reinhard grindel of the governing christian democrats , was clear about what his party thought of the proposal .
" when someone wants to become a german citizen , " grindel said , " then i have to be able to say , as an incentive , that you must learn german if you have n't learned it well enough already .
that 's a part of the integration process - to finally learn german . "
and there is reason to believe that many retired immigrants in germany would n't apply for a german passport if the rules were loosened .
some come from other european union countries , where moving across borders is n't problematic , though they do not have full voting rights in germany .
but kilic says there are some 2,000-3,000 retirees from other countries who would gladly take advantage of the opportunity .

eurostar , which operates passenger trains through the channel tunnel recently ordered 10 new trains from siemens , in a deal which threatened to engulf france and germany in a protectionist row .
alstom , which also makes high-speed tgv trains , had been backed by france 's transport ministry in its claim that siemens trains ordered by eurostar do not comply with current safety standards set by the franco-british commission which regulates the tunnel .
the judge said alstom did not have a " serious case " and that granting a suspension " would be against the public interest . "
eurostar said it was pleased the matter had been resolved , adding that it always aimed to conduct a rigorous tender to select the best trains .
deutsche bahn , which plans to introduce services through the channel tunnel from 2013 , linking london directly with frankfurt and amsterdam , has also placed a 500-million-euro order with siemens for 15 new high-speed ice trains .

but as andy valvur points out in this postcard , the conspiracy theorists have gone into overdrive . he was just a small town cephalopod , living quietly in an aquarium in oberhausen germany , entertaining children , moving languidly around his tank and generally being ignored .
but , this summer , it all changed and paul , as the octopus was called , became an international superstar by accurately picking the winners of all the games that the german world cup soccer team faced .
and , to finish it off , he accurately picked the winner of the entire world cup .
it all started innocently enough , when he correctly picked the winner of the first game .
people smiled , a lucky guess , said most .
then he picked the winner in the next game .
ah , another lucky guess .
but people took notice .
even better , the media took notice .
by the time he correctly picked the third game result , the media were in full frenzy , as only the media can .
suddenly , the sleepy little german town of oberhausen became media central .
satellite trucks sprouted like mushrooms around the aquarium .
interview requests poured in from around the world , but paul remained silent .
ok .
he ’ s an octopus and not known for his verbal skills , but he was now , as they say in hollywood , hot .
his streak continued , picking the winners of several more games .
when he picked germany to lose against spain , germans thought , well , now he ’ s going to fail , as germany was on a roll , and many thought it seemingly possible that germany might win the whole thing .
but , paul was not to be denied .
by picking spain over germany , there were calls for paul to made into a calamari dish or perhaps served up as sushi … .but aquarium officials demurred and increased security .
in the end , paul amazed everyone and correctly picked the winner of the world cup final between the netherlands and spain .
suddenly , everyone wanted a piece of paul .
rumors spread like wildfire .
it was reported that paul was spotted hanging with squid supermodels at sea world in san diego , california … .
other reports had him accepting a teaching job at woods hole oceanography institute .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dw 's andy valvur is waiting for paul 's return but the truth is that paul , even though he was born in england , had become quite german and decided that all the flash and hoopla were not for him .
he stayed in oberhausen , doing what he did best , languidly moving around a fish tank … seemingly oblivious to everything .
this week , the news that everyone dreaded , was released by aquarium officials in oberhausen .
paul was dead .
murder most foul ?
conspiracy theorists immediately suspected squid play ... i mean … foul play pointing to the rumors of beatle paul mccartney ’ s demise in the 70 ’ s .
their suspicions were fueled by reports that paul had been cremated .
no autopsy , no open casket , no official investigation .
other conspiracy theories suggested that paul was the subject of a mob hit , as his uncanny ability to pick winners was lowering the profits from illegal gambling .
another theory is that museum officials sold paul to a japanese sushi consortium , pointing to a website has that has blurry photos of an alleged sushi chef leaving the aquarium in oberhausen still another claim was that paul was just tired of all the attention , and in a late night dash , escaped from oberhausen to spend the rest of his days relaxing in the mediterranean .
museum officials have been tight lipped saying only that paul is dead .
a memorial has been set up in his tank complete with a replica of the world cup .
so ends a remarkable career .
and in life as in death , paul continues to be a lightning rod for publicity .
personally , i like the relaxing in the mediterranean theory the best .

but now the eu wants to make patent protection easier and less expensive for the bloc 's inventors . the economic crisis has n't put european companies and independent inventors off investing into research and development .
judged by the some 60,000 patents issued so far this year in germany , the country 's is on track to meet 2009 's total . " companies followed experts ' advice and continued investing in new products - even though we were in the middle of a crisis , " bettina berner of the german patent and trade mark office -lrb- dpma -rrb- said on thursday at the opening ceremony of the 62nd edition of the inventors ' trade fair iena in nuremberg . hoping for a break through bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some 800 products , like an unpoppable tire , are on display at the iena trade fair inventors from 37 countries are currently presenting some 800 new products at the fair , which the organizers said is the largest of its kind in the world . rollerblades , the folding bicycle and inflatable water wings are some of products that went on to conquer the world after being presented in nuremberg .
like their successful predecessors , many inventors at this year 's fair are hoping for break-through deals with the industry so their products can be mass-produced . shaky hands ?
no problem ! bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the willomat tray lets the clumsy wait tables - without worrying guests bernhard haehnsen is one such inventor .
the former ship 's captain grew tired moping up after glasses spilled their contents as his ship pitched on the high seas .
his neighbor barbara willomat designed a way to stabilize glasses and cups on trays .
special suction cups which can be fixed on a tray hold retainers in different shapes and sizes . " when you 're carrying beer glasses on a tray across wobbly grass in a beer garden , the glasses break easily if you do n't attach them , " haehnsen said , adding that the willomat tray could also facilitate work in hospitals and help anyone with shaky hands . register first , then show it bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moreau 's idea came when he saw a report about delayed flights other products on display at iena this year include a foldable chair attached to a suitcase , invented by 12-year-old johannes von moreau , and a remote control for model sports cars which can be used with one hand rather than two . the two inventors kevin hummel and nicolas rathauser have registered their product with the munich-based german patent office -lrb- dpma -rrb- already .
that 's a step experts strongly recommend . " many independent inventors do n't have their products registered before they present them at a trade fair , " said dpma spokesperson berner . lengthy , costly patent process but inventors who want to protect their product in more than one european country currently have to undergo a tedious and costly process that begins with registration at the european patent office . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : inventors register their products here : the european patent office in munich " you have to decide in how many countries you want to have your patent validated , " heinrich dornbusch , a consultant with german patent marketing agency provendis , told deutsche welle .
" currently you have to do that separately in every single member state .
this means you have to invest a lot of time and money . " the costs for registering a product in 13 of the eu 's 27 countries , for instance , can easily amount to more than 20,000 euros -lrb- $ 28,000 -rrb- - 10 times the cost of a patent in the united states , according to dornbusch three languages sufficient the laborious validation process needs simplification , said stefaan de rynck from the internal market and services division at the european commission . " we want to get rid of the procedure where you have to translate a patent into all languages in order for it to be valid , " he told deutsche welle .
" patents should be valid across the eu if they are in english , french or german . " this would considerably lower registration costs as the largest part currently goes into translating the relevant documents into the individual countries ' languages . authors : nina haase , brigitta moll -lrb- dpa , ap -rrb- editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

eurostar , which operates passenger trains through the channel tunnel recently ordered 10 new trains from siemens , in a deal which threatened to engulf france and germany in a protectionist row .
alstom , which also makes high-speed tgv trains , had been backed by france 's transport ministry in its claim that siemens trains ordered by eurostar do not comply with current safety standards set by the franco-british commission which regulates the tunnel .
the judge said alstom did not have a " serious case " and that granting a suspension " would be against the public interest . "
eurostar said it was pleased the matter had been resolved , adding that it always aimed to conduct a rigorous tender to select the best trains .
deutsche bahn , which plans to introduce services through the channel tunnel from 2013 , linking london directly with frankfurt and amsterdam , has also placed a 500-million-euro order with siemens for 15 new high-speed ice trains .

one british mp said london needs to do more to protect people 's privacy . it 's been a busy week for google lawyers in europe , as the california tech giant became the target of the legal wrath of italy and the united kingdom . prosecutors in rome on wednesday began an investigation against google for potential invasions of privacy in its street view online mapping service . italian authorities , like their counterparts in germany , spain , canada and elsewhere , are concerned that google acquired personal data including e-mails and passwords while " packet sniffing " on open wifi networks while photographing for the street view service . google has previously said that the data acquisition was accidental , and that it has taken measures to ensure that this kind of breach does not happen again . this legal move came as the italian data protection authority also announced more restrictions this week against google . " italian citizens will be informed of the presence of google cars taking pictures of places and individuals to be posted online via the street view service , " the italian privacy authority said in a statement on its website on monday . the authority added that google street view vehicles will have to be obvious to passers-by . " google cars will have to be clearly marked by means of visible stickers or signs to unambiguously signify that pictures are being taken for the purposes of street view , " it said in the statement . other conditions set by the italian authorities included requiring google list what neighborhoods its cars would photograph in local media ahead of time .
the italian dpa added that failure to comply with the new rules would carry a fine of up to 1,800 euros -lrb- $ 2,500 -rrb- . uk privacy investigation has been ' lily-livered ' bildunterschrift : states around the world are investigating google 's privacy policies thursday , in london , a parliamentary committee met to find out why the british government has not done more to investigate privacy concerns over the leaked wifi data situation . earlier this year , the british data protection authority , the information commissioner 's office , had said it had found no wrongdoing on google 's part , but on monday the office re-opened the case after google 's admitted acquiring more data than had been previously disclosed . " the uk information commissioner has been lily-livered , " robert halfon , a conservative parliamentarian , said during the committee hearing . " these corporations need to be taught that advancing the technological wonder that is the internet is one thing , " he added .
" trampling over the individual 's right to privacy is quite another .

a pre-summit deal between merkel and sarkozy on how to safeguard the euro annoyed many eu states .
deutsche welle 's brussels correspondent , christoph hasselbach , says that 's why so little progress was achieved . chancellor merkel pushed the right issues , but at this summit , at least , made little concrete progress .
it remains to be seen whether the december summit will in fact bring about the desired effect .
the reason for this lies not least in her advance talks with french president nicolas sarkozy .
through the “ deauville deal ” shortly before the summit , merkel managed to irritate almost everyone in the eu .
those who had supported automatic sanctions for budget sinners noted with horror that the german chancellor had given up on this central goal .
merkel also managed to stab the european commission in the back .
the commission had pursued this aim and , until the deauville conference , could be sure having the support of the germans .
in the end , even european council president herman van rompuy must have felt blindsided .
he was given the task of working out the details of the reforms , and even before he could present his results officially , germany and france declared they 'd already reached a decision .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche welle 's brussels correspondent , christoph hasselbach as a trade-off , merkel had secured assurances from sarkozy that france would echo the german demands for altering the lisbon treaty .
merkel experienced how little that promise was worth when she got to the summit .
rarely has such a wall of resistance built up , above all on the question of taking away voting rights .
this means that early on merkel threw away one of the most important methods of stabilizing the euro , and has - at least so far - has nothing to show for her trade-off .
whether the eu can agree on a so-called small amendment to the treaty by december , is not only down to france .
as far as taking away voting rights is concerned , merkel can forget it .
now she just says she wants to keep the item “ on the agenda ” .
it wo n't go beyond that .
it 's a different story when it comes to the permanent rescue mechanism for financially stricken states .
the participation of the private sectors is popular .
and the fear in the whole eurozone of the collapse of a member state could give the necessary pressure to get through moderate treaty amendments on this issue .
the strange thing is this : had merkel fought for automatic sanctions at the summit , and looked for allies on the issue , she may have saved herself and the whole eu some of the conflict over treaty changes .
because the stricter the disciplinary tools are before a financial crisis , the more unlikely it is , that the whole mechanism will need to be used at all .

it remains to be seen whether the december summit will in fact bring about the desired effect .
the reason for this lies not least in her advance talks with french president nicolas sarkozy .
through the “ deauville deal ” shortly before the summit , merkel managed to irritate almost everyone in the eu .
those who had supported automatic sanctions for budget sinners noted with horror that the german chancellor had given up on this central goal .
merkel also managed to stab the european commission in the back .
the commission had pursued this aim and , until the deauville conference , could be sure having the support of the germans .
in the end , even european council president herman van rompuy must have felt blindsided .
he was given the task of working out the details of the reforms , and even before he could present his results officially , germany and france declared they 'd already reached a decision .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche welle 's brussels correspondent , christoph hasselbach as a trade-off , merkel had secured assurances from sarkozy that france would echo the german demands for altering the lisbon treaty .
merkel experienced how little that promise was worth when she got to the summit .
rarely has such a wall of resistance built up , above all on the question of taking away voting rights .
this means that early on merkel threw away one of the most important methods of stabilizing the euro , and has - at least so far - has nothing to show for her trade-off .
whether the eu can agree on a so-called small amendment to the treaty by december , is not only down to france .
as far as taking away voting rights is concerned , merkel can forget it .
now she just says she wants to keep the item “ on the agenda ” .
it wo n't go beyond that .
it 's a different story when it comes to the permanent rescue mechanism for financially stricken states .
the participation of the private sectors is popular .
and the fear in the whole eurozone of the collapse of a member state could give the necessary pressure to get through moderate treaty amendments on this issue .
the strange thing is this : had merkel fought for automatic sanctions at the summit , and looked for allies on the issue , she may have saved herself and the whole eu some of the conflict over treaty changes .
because the stricter the disciplinary tools are before a financial crisis , the more unlikely it is , that the whole mechanism will need to be used at all .

traditional gender attitudes could be to blame . a new government-commissioned study conducted by the german society for man and health -lrb- dgmg -rrb- and the men 's health foundation , was released on thursday , nearly a decade after a ground-breaking report on women 's health was conducted in 2001 .
speaking at its launch , family affairs minister kristina schroeder said it was high time : " a men 's health report is vitally necessary , because we still have a difference in life expectancy between men and women of 5.5 years . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kristina schroeder said the study was urgently needed one of the main causes for concern is the heart .
men suffer heart-related problems much earlier and more frequently and more seriously than women .
dr. ursula mueller-werdan , a cardiologist at the halle university heart clinic , spoke of the significant differences .
" heart attacks manifest themselves about 15 years earlier in men than in women , " she said .
" men often have unhealthy cardiovascular risk profiles in younger years .
that means , for example , high blood pressure well before the age of 55 . "
doctor-shy men the causes are manifold , but the study identified one particular social difference that can cause problems .
men are much less likely to take their ailments to the doctor , and so serious problems often go unnoticed for too long .
on top of this , only two out of 10 german men go to the doctor for precautionary check-ups .
elmar braehler , professor of medicinal psychology at the university of leipzig says men simply need to get over their fears .
" women are used to going to the gynecologist , they go for contraception , for pregnancies , " he said .
" men are scared of what the doctor will find , and tend to avoid doctors .
they see it as part of their social role that they have to show they are healthy . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : men are more likely to keep depression to themselves the study also concluded that men are more likely to let psychological problems go untreated .
three times as many men commit suicide than women , even though only half as many men are diagnosed with depression than women .
male menopause but this finding simply confirmed a relatively commonly held theory .
the study also highlighted a less well-known problem - that of male menopause .
dr. stefan kowalik believes that while hormone problems are routinely treated in women , they are too often ignored in men .
" hormone disorders are not just important for sexuality , " he said .
" the male hormone , testosterone , is also important for blood production , bone production , muscle production .
a lot of people do n't even know that . "
german state health insurance only pays for male check-ups over the age of 55 , and one of the study 's recommendations is the introduction of check-up programs for young men , but old-fashioned attitudes need to be changed first .

but as andy valvur points out in this postcard , the conspiracy theorists have gone into overdrive . he was just a small town cephalopod , living quietly in an aquarium in oberhausen germany , entertaining children , moving languidly around his tank and generally being ignored .
but , this summer , it all changed and paul , as the octopus was called , became an international superstar by accurately picking the winners of all the games that the german world cup soccer team faced .
and , to finish it off , he accurately picked the winner of the entire world cup .
it all started innocently enough , when he correctly picked the winner of the first game .
people smiled , a lucky guess , said most .
then he picked the winner in the next game .
ah , another lucky guess .
but people took notice .
even better , the media took notice .
by the time he correctly picked the third game result , the media were in full frenzy , as only the media can .
suddenly , the sleepy little german town of oberhausen became media central .
satellite trucks sprouted like mushrooms around the aquarium .
interview requests poured in from around the world , but paul remained silent .
ok .
he ’ s an octopus and not known for his verbal skills , but he was now , as they say in hollywood , hot .
his streak continued , picking the winners of several more games .
when he picked germany to lose against spain , germans thought , well , now he ’ s going to fail , as germany was on a roll , and many thought it seemingly possible that germany might win the whole thing .
but , paul was not to be denied .
by picking spain over germany , there were calls for paul to made into a calamari dish or perhaps served up as sushi … .but aquarium officials demurred and increased security .
in the end , paul amazed everyone and correctly picked the winner of the world cup final between the netherlands and spain .
suddenly , everyone wanted a piece of paul .
rumors spread like wildfire .
it was reported that paul was spotted hanging with squid supermodels at sea world in san diego , california … .
other reports had him accepting a teaching job at woods hole oceanography institute .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dw 's andy valvur is waiting for paul 's return but the truth is that paul , even though he was born in england , had become quite german and decided that all the flash and hoopla were not for him .
he stayed in oberhausen , doing what he did best , languidly moving around a fish tank … seemingly oblivious to everything .
this week , the news that everyone dreaded , was released by aquarium officials in oberhausen .
paul was dead .
murder most foul ?
conspiracy theorists immediately suspected squid play ... i mean … foul play pointing to the rumors of beatle paul mccartney ’ s demise in the 70 ’ s .
their suspicions were fueled by reports that paul had been cremated .
no autopsy , no open casket , no official investigation .
other conspiracy theories suggested that paul was the subject of a mob hit , as his uncanny ability to pick winners was lowering the profits from illegal gambling .
another theory is that museum officials sold paul to a japanese sushi consortium , pointing to a website has that has blurry photos of an alleged sushi chef leaving the aquarium in oberhausen still another claim was that paul was just tired of all the attention , and in a late night dash , escaped from oberhausen to spend the rest of his days relaxing in the mediterranean .
museum officials have been tight lipped saying only that paul is dead .
a memorial has been set up in his tank complete with a replica of the world cup .
so ends a remarkable career .
and in life as in death , paul continues to be a lightning rod for publicity .
personally , i like the relaxing in the mediterranean theory the best .

under pressure from german chancellor angela merkel and french president nicolas sarkozy , european union leaders set in motion plans to amend the lisbon treaty to create a system to ward off financial crises .
they also endorsed tougher sanctions on states that do not keep their public debt in check .

one british mp said london needs to do more to protect people 's privacy . it 's been a busy week for google lawyers in europe , as the california tech giant became the target of the legal wrath of italy and the united kingdom . prosecutors in rome on wednesday began an investigation against google for potential invasions of privacy in its street view online mapping service . italian authorities , like their counterparts in germany , spain , canada and elsewhere , are concerned that google acquired personal data including e-mails and passwords while " packet sniffing " on open wifi networks while photographing for the street view service . google has previously said that the data acquisition was accidental , and that it has taken measures to ensure that this kind of breach does not happen again . this legal move came as the italian data protection authority also announced more restrictions this week against google . " italian citizens will be informed of the presence of google cars taking pictures of places and individuals to be posted online via the street view service , " the italian privacy authority said in a statement on its website on monday . the authority added that google street view vehicles will have to be obvious to passers-by . " google cars will have to be clearly marked by means of visible stickers or signs to unambiguously signify that pictures are being taken for the purposes of street view , " it said in the statement . other conditions set by the italian authorities included requiring google list what neighborhoods its cars would photograph in local media ahead of time .
the italian dpa added that failure to comply with the new rules would carry a fine of up to 1,800 euros -lrb- $ 2,500 -rrb- . uk privacy investigation has been ' lily-livered ' bildunterschrift : states around the world are investigating google 's privacy policies thursday , in london , a parliamentary committee met to find out why the british government has not done more to investigate privacy concerns over the leaked wifi data situation . earlier this year , the british data protection authority , the information commissioner 's office , had said it had found no wrongdoing on google 's part , but on monday the office re-opened the case after google 's admitted acquiring more data than had been previously disclosed . " the uk information commissioner has been lily-livered , " robert halfon , a conservative parliamentarian , said during the committee hearing . " these corporations need to be taught that advancing the technological wonder that is the internet is one thing , " he added .
" trampling over the individual 's right to privacy is quite another .

traditional gender attitudes could be to blame . a new government-commissioned study conducted by the german society for man and health -lrb- dgmg -rrb- and the men 's health foundation , was released on thursday , nearly a decade after a ground-breaking report on women 's health was conducted in 2001 .
speaking at its launch , family affairs minister kristina schroeder said it was high time : " a men 's health report is vitally necessary , because we still have a difference in life expectancy between men and women of 5.5 years . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kristina schroeder said the study was urgently needed one of the main causes for concern is the heart .
men suffer heart-related problems much earlier and more frequently and more seriously than women .
dr. ursula mueller-werdan , a cardiologist at the halle university heart clinic , spoke of the significant differences .
" heart attacks manifest themselves about 15 years earlier in men than in women , " she said .
" men often have unhealthy cardiovascular risk profiles in younger years .
that means , for example , high blood pressure well before the age of 55 . "
doctor-shy men the causes are manifold , but the study identified one particular social difference that can cause problems .
men are much less likely to take their ailments to the doctor , and so serious problems often go unnoticed for too long .
on top of this , only two out of 10 german men go to the doctor for precautionary check-ups .
elmar braehler , professor of medicinal psychology at the university of leipzig says men simply need to get over their fears .
" women are used to going to the gynecologist , they go for contraception , for pregnancies , " he said .
" men are scared of what the doctor will find , and tend to avoid doctors .
they see it as part of their social role that they have to show they are healthy . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : men are more likely to keep depression to themselves the study also concluded that men are more likely to let psychological problems go untreated .
three times as many men commit suicide than women , even though only half as many men are diagnosed with depression than women .
male menopause but this finding simply confirmed a relatively commonly held theory .
the study also highlighted a less well-known problem - that of male menopause .
dr. stefan kowalik believes that while hormone problems are routinely treated in women , they are too often ignored in men .
" hormone disorders are not just important for sexuality , " he said .
" the male hormone , testosterone , is also important for blood production , bone production , muscle production .
a lot of people do n't even know that . "
german state health insurance only pays for male check-ups over the age of 55 , and one of the study 's recommendations is the introduction of check-up programs for young men , but old-fashioned attitudes need to be changed first .

a number of states rejected the idea of far-reaching amendments that would have forced them to hold referendums , which would have been expected to fail .
chancellor merkel was forced to back down on this issue .
the german chancellor had been battling for weeks to push through changes that would provide the eurozone with greater stability .

cautious welcome from the german media the german business daily handelsblatt said the agreement was a significant achievement , calling it a " breakthrough " for merkel , whose center-right coalition has suffered a drop in support in the polls in recent months .
however , because merkel 's more far-reaching treaty changes were put on the backburner , the german newspaper hannoversche allgemeine zeitung said the deal amounted to a " light solution " to the problem of imposing budgetary discipline .

the proposed changes to the lisbon treaty are to be drafted in time for another eu summit in december .
the changes are to be agreed and implemented by 2013 , when the current rescue fund expires .

the secret ballot will take place on december 2 .
two members remain provisionally suspended . the election of the 2018 and 2022 world cup hosts will go ahead as planned despite an ongoing corruption probe , fifa president joseph blatter said on friday .
blatter made the announcement after a two-day meeting of the fifa executive committee .
the secret ballot will take place on december 2 at fifa 's headquarters in zurich .
" we are five weeks from the final decision so there was never a question of changing anything in the procedure , " blatter said .
" changing the date would have caused problems for fifa and bidders as well since they plan to bring in high-ranked politicians like bill clinton and vladimir putin . "
executive committee members suspended bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : adamu , left , and temarii are accussed of selling their votes last week , fifa provisionally suspended two of the 24 members of the executive committee , amos adamu of nigeria and reynald temarii of tahiti .
there have been allegations that they offered to sell their votes to undercover reporters from the british sunday times newspaper .
blatter said that the fifa ethics committee will deal with their cases before the election of the host countries takes place . " if and when people are suspended for the vote on december 2 , they will not be replaced , " he said .
alleged deal between spain , portugal and qatar the joint 2018 bidders , spain and portugal , are said to have struck a deal with qatar , a 2022 candidate , for the interchange of votes . the chief of the joint spanish-portugal bid , miguel angel lopez , denied the allegations of collusion with qatar .
blatter said fifa was investigating those allegations as well and said this issue would also be dealt with by the ethics committee .
" let us do our job .
and let us clarify the situation .
and let us do what the people and the fans , the millions , hundred of millions , thousands of millions of fans are expecting : bring back credibility in fifa , " he said .
aside from spain and portugal , the other countries in the running to host the 2018 world cup are england , russia and the netherlands with belgium .
for the 2022 tournament australia , the united states , qatar , japan and south korea are competing .
blatter acknowledged that the recent incidents showed that it was wrong to elect two world cup hosts on one day .
this is the first time such a vote will take place after a decision made by fifa in 2008 .
the scandal is no surprise , experts say jean-paul mean , president of transparency international switzerland , said the fifa scandal should not come as a surprise .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blatter called on fifa to ' bring back credibility ' " we have seen it with the international olympic committee 10 years ago that there were some strange practices , " he said .
" there is just a flair around sport associations that their governance is not the best yet . "
if there is money around , " corruption shows its ugly head , " he added .
according to mean , there is not enough control of international sports organizations since they are not subject to swiss anti-corruption law .
however , according to blatter , fifa will resolve its problems through its ethics committee .
" it 's an uncomfortable situation for fifa , but we have the necessary instruments to react the proper way , " he said .

german chancellor angela merkel said the leaders had had a " profound and difficult discussion , " and other participants described the discussions as heated and emotional . merkel added that she was satisfied with the outcome of the debate : " we have promoted our essential points , " she said .
" everyone is in agreement that a limited change to the lisbon treaty is necessary . " eu council president herman van rompuy told a news conference that " important decisions to strengthen the eurozone " had been taken .

she said the new crisis mechanism would only be " valid for cases where the stability of the euro as a whole is at risk . " " we said once more that ... should a country ever need to make use of this , it would be faced with very strict requirements , " she said . opposition to budget increase some non-eurozone states threw around their weight in the discussions , like the united kingdom , which sought to cap the eu 's budget next year , and poland , which wants the calculation of its national debt to take into account costly pension reforms . merkel chimed in , saying , " if we have to reduce our budget at home - we do this at the federal level by more than 3 percent - it can not be that the european budget rises by nearly 6 percent . " the leaders asked van rompuy to prepare potential changes to the lisbon treaty ahead of another eu summit in december .

" if treaty change is to reduce the rights of member states on voting , i find it unacceptable , and , frankly speaking , it is not realistic , " european commission president jose manuel barroso said . it would also likely turn into a political nightmare for national governments .
the lisbon treaty took 10 years of wrangling to enact , after challenges in national courts and referendum failures in france , ireland and the netherlands . " many countries do not want a huge treaty reform , and therefore we are trying to narrow it down to a very limited treaty change that should be acceptable for countries without having to face referendums , " swedish prime minister fredrik reinfeldt said . although the proposals were weaker than merkel had pushed for , she said the eu had underlined that " private investors will not be able to make money or speculate against the euro .

one british mp said london needs to do more to protect people 's privacy . it 's been a busy week for google lawyers in europe , as the california tech giant became the target of the legal wrath of italy and the united kingdom . prosecutors in rome on wednesday began an investigation against google for potential invasions of privacy in its street view online mapping service . italian authorities , like their counterparts in germany , spain , canada and elsewhere , are concerned that google acquired personal data including e-mails and passwords while " packet sniffing " on open wifi networks while photographing for the street view service . google has previously said that the data acquisition was accidental , and that it has taken measures to ensure that this kind of breach does not happen again . this legal move came as the italian data protection authority also announced more restrictions this week against google .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de film -pipe- 29.10.2010 berlin and beyond film festival highlights plight of immigrants großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a still from " home from home " directed by sung hyung-cho 's chancellor angela merkel recently said that multi-culturalism in germany had " utterly failed . "
as the debate rages on , one film festival in san francisco aims to offer a more nuanced portrait of immigration . when 8,000 korean nurses arrived in germany during the 1960s , few of them thought they 'd be staying in the country longer than their three-year contracts allowed . thirty-seven years later , three of these women found themselves retiring to korea with their husbands , the sole german residents of the seaside " german village . "
replete with red-tiled roofs , garden gnomes and black bread for breakfast , the retirement community and its german inhabitants have become a must-see for many korean tourists .
they 've also provided the inspiration for sung hyung-cho 's wistful documentary , " endstation der sehnsuechte " -lrb- " home from home " -rrb- .
cameras followed these three couples through their everyday lives – watching as one man created his own sausages so he could get a taste of home and following another as he learned a traditional korean dance .
the women have different experiences , showing a real wariness toward settling in ; as the movie played on , the discomfort these women feel in their birthland grew acute .
" we have no homeland and that is the tragedy of our lives , " one of the women said .
though she 'd long dreamed of returning to korea , she told the camera , " the longer i live here , the more i think of germany . "
heimat has no plural it 's this cross-cultural nostalgia that director sung-hyung cho wanted to address in her film .
" a lot of people have two heimat s -lrb- homes -rrb- , " she told an audience at the berlin and beyond film festival running this week in san francisco , california .
" in german , there is no possibility to have two homes – the word heimat has no plural .
but i have two homes : korea and germany .
when i finally felt at home in germany , i simultaneously became frightened that i would n't be able to feel at home again in korea . "
it was that feeling that drove cho to make the documentary – to explore the depths of homesickness , the bizarre emotional pull that two very different places can have on migrants .
an emphasis on diversity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : another festival highlight was comedy-drama " wedding fever in campobello " " home from home " was just one of several award-winning films playing at the festival this week that added nuance to the extended immigrant experience while showing the diversity of contemporary germany .
" die fremde " -lrb- " when we leave " -rrb- , the festival 's centerpiece film directed by feo aladag , highlighted the plight of a german-born turk who struggled to survive between two very different worlds in modern-day berlin and istanbul .
it 's quite a different story than that shown in the flashbacks in the romantic comedy " wedding fever in campobello " .
the violence and prejudice that the protagonist encountered just after his arrival in osnabrueck in the 1960s are unflinchingly portrayed .
set alongside the modern-day story of his daughter 's wedding , however , the film showcased what the children of these guest workers have lived through as they 've attempted to balance two worlds , two cultures , two languages .
still , the emphasis on the problems facing immigrants was n't an intentional theme for berlin and beyond , said festival director sophaon sorn .
" we really wanted to empower the festival with a diverse program , one that shows a wide variety of human experience , " said sorn .
" and san francisco is a diverse city , it appreciates diversity , so we tried to find movies that would appeal both within the german community here and extend to a broader community as well . "
rudolf de baey , director of the goethe institute of san francisco , emphasized that diversity and immigration are both powerful elements in german society today .
" the reality of germany is that it 's just not a blonde-haired , blue-eyed country any more .
and i think these films reflect that . "

dw 's ramon garcia-ziemsen writes about how germany 's history was deliberately repressed . yes , it is shocking how german diplomats were complicit in the holocaust in the second world war , and how they were involved in its implementation .
it 's unbelievable how much continuity there was in the diplomatic personnel after 1945 in germany : men who had participated in the nazi extermination policies later made careers and protected each other , even before their involvement was made public .
but it 's just as incredible how long it has taken : that only now , 65 years on , this has come to the attention of the wider german public .
in 1979 , a book was published by a british historian about the participation of the foreign office in the so called " final solution , " the nazi description for the murder of european jews .
the book describes what the nature of the foreign office 's participation in the holocaust was , how deportation orders were signed there , how the office was a systematic element of the nazi killing machine .
and even back in the 1950s , there was clear evidence showing that the foreign office was certainly not a " school of passive resistance " against hitler , as it liked to present itself in the post-war period .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ramon garcia-ziemsen head of dw 's german culture department a lot was known , a lot was forgotten in short : much was known .
and almost everything was forgotten .
how the germans dealt with the third reich is not as exemplary as it has often been perceived around the world , it is also a history of forgetting and repressing .
the elites have often knowingly prevented a discussion about their past .
and the public allowed this discourse to be prevented .
how could this happen ? after 1945 , german society was always looking for the " good , " for the " other germany " - the " other germany " that had remained innocent , that had perhaps not been openly resistant , but did not allow itself to be sucked into nazi ideology ; which had remained resistant , which had rejected the nazi madness , and of which one might even be proud .
because it wanted a fresh start , the young germany did not think it could live with the weight of such a large feeling of guilt .
myths and collective guilt and in this way the yarn was spun : first came the myth that many germans had only found out about the holocaust in 1945 from the allies .
the myth was born that only a small group around hitler had known what had happened in concentration camps like auschwitz and dachau .
the germans were a nation led astray .
this position was also of course a reaction to the similarly blanket collective guilt theory purported by the allies after the war . then came the myth of the armed forces : that the soldiers had played almost no part in hitler 's atrocities - and besides that everything had been carried out under orders .
both theories were exposed by historians as false only decades later , from the 1970s , through studies , books and exhibitions .
large parts of the population knew not only why jewish friends and neighbors had suddenly disappeared , but they had also assisted with this disappearance .
soldiers took part in shooting jews - voluntarily and not under orders .
but again it took years and decades , well into the 1990s , until this knowledge resulted in a public debate and led to a real demystification . where the myth certainly still existed was in the foreign office , one of the last places where the fairy tale of the " other germany " could live on .
the solidarity of the diplomats worked so well and perhaps the respect for the future german president richard von weizsaecker was too great .
weizsaecker 's father ernst was a top diplomat , who supported the nazi ideology in the foreign office .
but germany 's longing for this " other germany " , which existed much less than most germans had thought , was also too great .

one lawmaker says it 's time to do long-term immigrants a favor and loosen up that rule . new legislation introduced in the german parliament could allow certain groups to get a german passport more easily and quickly , as well as granting more people the right to hold dual citizenship .
currently , immigrants who want to get german citizenship must take a naturalization test and show that they have a firm grasp of the language .
in addition , they generally have to renounce their previous citizenship .
pensioners who came to the country as immigrants are one of the groups that would benefit most from a change to the law .
if the bill were passed , a person who is over 53 years old and has been living in germany for at least 15 years could apply for a passport without meeting the language requirements .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kilic wants to see an immigrant 's work rewarded " if a person has made a contribution to this society , i want to make it easier for them to become citizens , " green party parliamentarian memet kilic told deutsche welle .
" especially older immigrants - who gave their youth and health to build up this country - should be able to obtain citizenship without a language requirement .
that way , we can win the hearts of their children and grandchildren for this country . "
integration conversation kilic 's bill comes as the integration of immigrants is under the microscope in germany .
chancellor angela merkel , a christian democrat , said earlier this month that multiculturalism had failed in germany .
there have also been repeated calls for immigrants to integrate better into german society by learning the language and customs .
kilic , who was born in turkey , said the legislation he sponsored would be welcome news to immigrants .
" third-generation immigrant children in germany hear three times a day that they do n't belong to this country , " he said .
" what good is that ?
i want to turn the tables . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : integration is hard to define in germany in support of the bill , kilic cited statistics showing that the number of citizens naturalized in germany each year had fallen by 20 percent since 2004 .
this was an indication that becoming a german citizen was simply too difficult , he said .
without citizenship , many of germany 's 6.7 million immigrants do not have the right to vote in the country .
but citizenship goes beyond the legal realm .
" integration means more than simply structural integration , " said guelistan guerbey , a political scientist at berlin 's free university .
" it has a very strong emotional and psychological dimension . "
this is especially true for dual citizens .
if the bill became law , an immigrant would no longer have to give up their passport to become german .
guerbey said this would have a positive effect .
" a person has emotional ties in both directions , " she said , " and dual citizenship is a legal recognition of this emotional state . "
time to learn german but while legal benefits and emotional satisfaction might encourage a retired immigrant with less-than-perfect german to apply for citizenship under the loosened rules of the proposed law , they may never get the chance .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : learning german is essential for integration , says grindel on thursday in the bundestag , reinhard grindel of the governing christian democrats , was clear about what his party thought of the proposal .
" when someone wants to become a german citizen , " grindel said , " then i have to be able to say , as an incentive , that you must learn german if you have n't learned it well enough already .
that 's a part of the integration process - to finally learn german . "
and there is reason to believe that many retired immigrants in germany would n't apply for a german passport if the rules were loosened .
some come from other european union countries , where moving across borders is n't problematic , though they do not have full voting rights in germany .
but kilic says there are some 2,000-3,000 retirees from other countries who would gladly take advantage of the opportunity .
