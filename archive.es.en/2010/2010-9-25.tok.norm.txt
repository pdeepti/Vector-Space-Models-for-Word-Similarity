but some german lawmakers say they do not want a celebrity visit . german chancellor angela merkel has welcomed france 's first lady carla bruni to make a personal appeal to the german parliament for humanitarian aid , despite a dismissive response to the plan by some german politicians .
merkel 's spokesman steffen seibert said thursday that the chancellor supported bruni 's aim to speak before the budget committee of the bundestag lower house to seek funding as an ambassador for the global fund to fight aids , tuberculosis and malaria .
" the chancellor found this a good idea because mrs. bruni-sarkozy could deliver important arguments , " he said , using the former model and singer-songwriter 's married name .
' no celebrities , please ' otto fricke , a budget policy specialist of the free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- , came out against the move , warning that the budget committee " must n't give the impression that celebrity status ensures access to -lsb- committee meetings -rsb- . "
the head of the budget committee , petra merkel of the opposition social democrats , said meanwhile that she had yet to receive a request from bruni to speak .
" we had a similar case with the -lrb- u2 -rrb- singer bono , who wanted to speak to the committee a few years ago but we refused because it did not comply with our rules , " she added , referring to a decision made in 2008 .
another member of the committee , norbert barthle of merkel 's christian democrats , stressed that the committee did not in principle invite representatives of special interests , adding , " if we open the door to that , we would have to receive every representative of a social welfare and economic association or lobbyists . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bruni is known for attracting more attention on international visits than her husband under pressure merkel 's support for bruni may have been a bid to soothe diplomatic relations with french president nicolas sarkozy - which have already faced challenges this month over france 's controversial expulsion of illegal roma migrants .
german press agency dpa reported that the idea for bruni 's berlin trip was broached during a meeting between merkel and sarkozy in new york , to which sarkozy brought his wife and son . earlier , the two leaders were at odds over sarkozy 's claim that the chancellor intended to adopt a similiar campaign of deporting illegal roma immigrants .
bruni reportedly wants to ask germany for an extra 200 million euros -lrb- $ 268 million -rrb- for the global fund , to which sarkozy promised a billion euros from france .
germany 's development ministry has set aside only 200 million euros for the fund next year and has ruled out further pledges for now .

no explosives were found on the suspect and an extensive search of the aircraft yielded " no dangerous substances , " according to police spokesman kjell lindgren .
anonymous tip-off the incident began when canadian police received an anonymous phone call .
a woman , calling from a payphone after the plane had taken off , told authorities a passenger on board the flight was carrying explosives .
another police spokesman in sweden , janne hedlund , said the suspect had passed through all the usual security checks before boarding the flight .
police described him as a canadian national of pakistani origin in his 30s . the man , whose name was not made public , was released without charge after questioning .
canadian police now say they are looking into whether the bomb alert was a " terrorist hoax . "

miliband was elected by a ballot of legislators , party activists and about 3.5 million labor union members , narrowly defeating his older brother david miliband , a former foreign secretary .
after a five-month race , ed miliband secured labour 's leadership with 50.65 percent of the vote .
david miliband , who led the contest up until the final days , finished at a narrow second with 49.35 percent .
ed miliband 's last-minute surge in popularity has been attributed to a campaign that appealed to labour 's traditional left-wing supporters .
a new generation takes charge in his victory speech , ed miliband vowed to unify the party .
" the labour party in the future must be a vehicle that does n't just attract thousands of young people but tens of thousands , hundreds of thousands of young people who see us as their voice in british politics today , " he said .
" today a new generation has taken charge of labour , a new generation that understands the call of change , " he said .
brown resigned as the center-left party 's leader after losing the may election in which a conservative-led coalition removed labour from office , ending 13 years in power .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ed miliband , right , narrowly overcame his brother david , left , in the final days of the election .
miliband paid tribute to the former prime minister , saying he was " proud of the leadership of both tony blair and gordon brown " but that labour had " lost the election , and we lost it badly . "
" my message to the country is this , " he said : " i know we lost trust .
i know we lost touch .
i know we need to change . "
challenges ahead one of the biggest challenges facing milibrand will be to sort out his position on conservative prime minister david cameron 's planned austerity measures , the details of which are due in a comprehensive spending review on october 20 .
miliband also faces a tough choice of how to respond to possible mass strikes against the spending cuts , any stance on which could prove divisive .
miliband will face his first test as labour chief this sunday , as the party begins a five-day meeting in manchester to discuss its role in britain 's new political landscape .

experts warn that the virus could be used for sabotage . one of the most sophisticated pieces of malware ever detected has infected tens of thousands of computers in indonesia , india , the united states , australia , britain , malaysia and pakistan .
the biggest target , however , has been iran . the computer virus , known as stuxnet , is a " working and fearsome prototype of a cyber-weapon that could lead to the creation of a new arms race , " kaspersky labs , an internet security firm based in moscow , warned in a statement . the german engineering conglomerate siemens , which developed the systems attacked by stuxnet , said the malware spreads via infected usb thumb drive memory sticks , exploiting vulnerabilities in the microsoft windows operating system . the super-virus attacks software programs that run on supervisory control and data acquisition , or scada , systems , a product developed by siemens and sold around the world , including to iran .
scada is used to manage water supplies , oil rigs , power plants and other industrial facilities . once the worm infects a system , it quickly sets up communications with a remote server computer that can be used to steal proprietary information or take control of the scada system . bildunterschrift : iran is suspected of secretly developing nuclear weapons using its bushehr facility as a cover stuxnet source unknown computer security experts have said the attackers may have chosen to spread the malicious software via thumb drives because many scada systems control sensitive operations and are therefore not connected to the internet , but do have usb ports . ralf langner , a german cyber security specialist , said the attack was launched by an as yet unknown software expert , very possibly a nation state . " this is not some hacker sitting in the basement of his parents ' house , " he said . stuxnet is able to recognize a specific facility 's control network and then destroy it , said langner .
he said he suspects that the virus ' target was the bushehr nuclear reactor facility in iran . since june , tehran has blamed unspecified problems for a delay in getting the facility fully operational .
iran 's isna news agency reported that the country 's nuclear agency met to determine a way to combat the computer worm . a siemens spokesperson , however , said the iranian nuclear power plant was built with help from a russian contractor and that siemens was not involved .
the spokesperson added that the company would not speculation the virus ' target . a study of the stuxnet virus conducted by the us technology company symantec showed that the country most affected by the virus was iran with nearly 63,000 infected computers or more than two-thirds of all cases worldwide . so far , neither siemens nor cyber security experts in europe , russia or the united states , have discovered who is behind the stuxnet attacks , but langner said investigations would eventually point to the attackers .

prices are climbing all the time , and poor berliners are being squeezed out of the real estate market .
but maybe there are some alternatives . berlin has apparently never been so popular .
tourists , especially young people , keep streaming into the city , excited by the avant garde reputation the city seems to radiate .
and there is one big economic catalyst that greases the wheels of post-wall berlin : low-rent apartments . the berlin city council , or senat , knows when it has a good selling point , and is quick to point out the benefits of the housing market to potential residents .
reiner nagel , of the senat 's urban development department , is confident the city can maintain its reputation for cheapness . " structurally it 's a good situation , because the housing market is relaxed , " he said .
" you can get flats in all areas of the city , and the rent levels are relatively balanced .
compared to other german cities , where rents are two or three times as high . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some alternative projects are rooted in berlin 's former squat scene certainly berlin has a lot of catching up to do .
buying a nice apartment in the most popular area of mitte will currently cost you between 1,600 euros and 3,500 euros -lrb- $ 2,100 - $ 4,600 -rrb- per square meter .
the most precious space in european capitals further west can easily cost four times as much . all-important income / rent ratio but there is of course more to it .
other factors need to be taken into account , according to andreas otto , housing policy spokesman for the opposition green party . " if i know how much people earn here , how big the incomes are , then it is put into proportion , " he said .
" some people in berlin spend a third , or even 40 percent , of their take-home income on rent .
that is really quite a lot . " the city council quotes a statistic saying there are 100,000 uninhabited apartments in berlin - equal to about 7 percent of the total number of units - a healthy figure for a strong property market .
but this figure is open to some interpretation .
it is based on data from energy supplier vattenfall and is generated by counting the number of apartments that do not receive electricity for over six months .
this method has been heavily criticized by the berlin tenant 's association , which has said many of these flats are uninhabitable . michael lafond , an urban project developer at his institute for creative sustainability - which started life at the ufa fabrik squat in berlin - summed up the situation . " the city 's been caught off guard , i would say , " says lafond .
" the establishment basically went to sleep a few years ago and stopped doing anything about housing .
they worked in the wrong direction , privatizing public housing and forcing gentrification of the city , meaning encouraging increases in rent and increases in real estate value . " the alternatives so with the market a bit tighter than advertised , a lot of berliners are turning to alternative , self-managed living projects as a way to beat the speculators .
there are different models for these undertakings . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some believe the city should make more land available to housing projects some are rooted in berlin 's politicized former squat scene , with locks taken off the doors and communal meetings , and others offer more conventional living arrangements .
an effort to beat the inflation of the free market is what unites all of them .
julian benz is an adviser with the mietshaeuser syndikat , an organization that provides assistance for groups hoping to manage their own living space . " what i like about the syndikat 's model is that the question of ownership is cancelled out , " benz said .
" the property is only ever at the disposal of those that live in it .
that 's how it should be .
it 's a small step in the direction of a right to living for everyone . " of course , not every model is this idealistic - sometimes a small group of people simply buy a piece of land , build a new building on it and live in it .
according to lafond , the german capital is in a unique position to take advantage of such ideas . " berlin is in a special situation , if you compare with other big cities around europe , " he said .
" there are an estimated 5,000 vacant lots in the city .

foreign minister guido westerwelle drove home that message in an address to the united nations general assembly on saturday , his first before the international body . " you can rely on germany , " westerwelle said , adding , " germany is prepared to take on greater responsibility . " shaking up the un westerwelle advocated a shake-up in the un security council , claiming the un " no longer reflects the architecture of today 's world . " the foreign minister stressed germany 's involvement in a number of global issues . " germany is the third largest donor for development cooperation , " westerwelle said .
" we 've largely overcome the financial and economic crisis , and are on the right course with robust economic growth . " westerwelle added that germany was prepared to spearhead measures to counter climate change .
he said his country wanted a seat on the un security council in order to work towards " peace and development . " germany is currently in the running with portugal and canada for a rotating , two-year , non-permanent seat on the council .
a decision over new members is to be made in october .
berlin would need the votes of two-thirds of the 192 countries in the un general assembly . berlin is pushing hard for the seat , but ultimately is seeking a permanent spot on the security council , along with the five current veto powers usa , britain , france , china and russia . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : westerwelle is an advocate of german leadership britain voices support for german ambitions westerwelle , on friday , got support from britain 's deputy premier nick clegg , who said london was " clearly and unequivocally " in favor of a permanent seat for germany on the un security council . clegg also advocated that japan , india , brazil and a representative from africa be given permanent seats on the council . meanwhile , a former german foreign minister , hans-dietrich genscher , who presided over german reunification 20 years ago , has called a permanent german seat an outdated notion . " if we 're serious about european unity , then we need a seat for the european union , while retaining the seats for france and britain , " genscher said on saturday in an interview with the mitteldeutsche zeitung newspaper . this , however , is not what westerwelle and his colleagues from india , japan and brazil had in mind when they published a joint declaration in new york on friday to stake their claims to a permanent security council seat . in their statement they said a reform of the un body was " urgently needed " to make it " more representative , legitimate and efficient .

the 40-year-old former energy minister beat out his older brother , david miliband . britain 's opposition labour party elected former energy and climate change minister ed miliband as its new leader on saturday , after a knife-edge race to replace former prime minister gordon brown .
miliband was elected by a ballot of legislators , party activists and about 3.5 million labor union members , narrowly defeating his older brother david miliband , a former foreign secretary .
after a five-month race , ed miliband secured labour 's leadership with 50.65 percent of the vote .
david miliband , who led the contest up until the final days , finished at a narrow second with 49.35 percent .
ed miliband 's last-minute surge in popularity has been attributed to a campaign that appealed to labour 's traditional left-wing supporters .
a new generation takes charge in his victory speech , ed miliband vowed to unify the party .
" the labour party in the future must be a vehicle that does n't just attract thousands of young people but tens of thousands , hundreds of thousands of young people who see us as their voice in british politics today , " he said .
" today a new generation has taken charge of labour , a new generation that understands the call of change , " he said .
brown resigned as the center-left party 's leader after losing the may election in which a conservative-led coalition removed labour from office , ending 13 years in power .

" my message to the country is this , " he said : " i know we lost trust .
i know we lost touch .
i know we need to change . "
challenges ahead one of the biggest challenges facing milibrand will be to sort out his position on conservative prime minister david cameron 's planned austerity measures , the details of which are due in a comprehensive spending review on october 20 .
miliband also faces a tough choice of how to respond to possible mass strikes against the spending cuts , any stance on which could prove divisive .
miliband will face his first test as labour chief this sunday , as the party begins a five-day meeting in manchester to discuss its role in britain 's new political landscape .

the 40-year-old former energy minister beat out his older brother , david miliband . britain 's opposition labour party elected former energy and climate change minister ed miliband as its new leader on saturday , after a knife-edge race to replace former prime minister gordon brown .
miliband was elected by a ballot of legislators , party activists and about 3.5 million labor union members , narrowly defeating his older brother david miliband , a former foreign secretary .
after a five-month race , ed miliband secured labour 's leadership with 50.65 percent of the vote .
david miliband , who led the contest up until the final days , finished at a narrow second with 49.35 percent .
ed miliband 's last-minute surge in popularity has been attributed to a campaign that appealed to labour 's traditional left-wing supporters .
a new generation takes charge in his victory speech , ed miliband vowed to unify the party .
" the labour party in the future must be a vehicle that does n't just attract thousands of young people but tens of thousands , hundreds of thousands of young people who see us as their voice in british politics today , " he said .
" today a new generation has taken charge of labour , a new generation that understands the call of change , " he said .
brown resigned as the center-left party 's leader after losing the may election in which a conservative-led coalition removed labour from office , ending 13 years in power .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ed miliband , right , narrowly overcame his brother david , left , in the final days of the election .
miliband paid tribute to the former prime minister , saying he was " proud of the leadership of both tony blair and gordon brown " but that labour had " lost the election , and we lost it badly . "
" my message to the country is this , " he said : " i know we lost trust .
i know we lost touch .
i know we need to change . "
challenges ahead one of the biggest challenges facing milibrand will be to sort out his position on conservative prime minister david cameron 's planned austerity measures , the details of which are due in a comprehensive spending review on october 20 .
miliband also faces a tough choice of how to respond to possible mass strikes against the spending cuts , any stance on which could prove divisive .
miliband will face his first test as labour chief this sunday , as the party begins a five-day meeting in manchester to discuss its role in britain 's new political landscape .

together with seven other co-conspirators , the so-called gang of eight , yanayev formed a state emergency situation committee but failed to muster enough public and military support to govern the country .
boris yeltsin , president of russia and an arch political rival of president gorbachev arrived at the seat of russia 's legislature , the white house on the moscow river , and called for a general strike to resist the coup .

foreign minister guido westerwelle drove home that message in an address to the united nations general assembly on saturday , his first before the international body . " you can rely on germany , " westerwelle said , adding , " germany is prepared to take on greater responsibility . " shaking up the un westerwelle advocated a shake-up in the un security council , claiming the un " no longer reflects the architecture of today 's world . " the foreign minister stressed germany 's involvement in a number of global issues . " germany is the third largest donor for development cooperation , " westerwelle said .
" we 've largely overcome the financial and economic crisis , and are on the right course with robust economic growth . " westerwelle added that germany was prepared to spearhead measures to counter climate change .
he said his country wanted a seat on the un security council in order to work towards " peace and development . " germany is currently in the running with portugal and canada for a rotating , two-year , non-permanent seat on the council .
a decision over new members is to be made in october .
berlin would need the votes of two-thirds of the 192 countries in the un general assembly . berlin is pushing hard for the seat , but ultimately is seeking a permanent spot on the security council , along with the five current veto powers usa , britain , france , china and russia . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : westerwelle is an advocate of german leadership britain voices support for german ambitions westerwelle , on friday , got support from britain 's deputy premier nick clegg , who said london was " clearly and unequivocally " in favor of a permanent seat for germany on the un security council . clegg also advocated that japan , india , brazil and a representative from africa be given permanent seats on the council . meanwhile , a former german foreign minister , hans-dietrich genscher , who presided over german reunification 20 years ago , has called a permanent german seat an outdated notion . " if we 're serious about european unity , then we need a seat for the european union , while retaining the seats for france and britain , " genscher said on saturday in an interview with the mitteldeutsche zeitung newspaper . this , however , is not what westerwelle and his colleagues from india , japan and brazil had in mind when they published a joint declaration in new york on friday to stake their claims to a permanent security council seat . in their statement they said a reform of the un body was " urgently needed " to make it " more representative , legitimate and efficient .

russian media said 73-year-old yanayev had been suffering from cancer . yanayev declared a state of emergency on august 19 , 1991 , telling stunned television viewers that soviet leader mikhail gorbachev was under house arrest in crimea .
speaking at a news conference in moscow , the then vice-president of the soviet union said that under these circumstances " we have no other choice than to take decisive measures in order to prevent the country from sliding towards catastrophe . "
together with seven other co-conspirators , the so-called gang of eight , yanayev formed a state emergency situation committee but failed to muster enough public and military support to govern the country .
boris yeltsin , president of russia and an arch political rival of president gorbachev arrived at the seat of russia 's legislature , the white house on the moscow river , and called for a general strike to resist the coup .
tanks entered moscow , rallies were banned and pro-reform newspapers were shut down as the plotters sought to curb resistance .
defiant crowds massed outside the white house and the coup collapsed three days after it began after resistance led by the then russian president , boris yeltsin .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the failed coup sealed the fate of the soviet union images of yeltsin standing on a tank have persisted as a symbol of the failure of the coup .
four months later gorbachev resigned .
yeltsin and the leaders of other soviet republics declared them independent states , sealing the collapse of the soviet union and the end of the comunist regime .
yanayev was arrested on treason charges and spent more than a year in prison before being released before his trial began .
he and 11 others charged as ringleaders were later pardoned by the russian parliament in 1994 .

the 40-year-old former energy minister beat out his older brother , david miliband . britain 's opposition labour party elected former energy and climate change minister ed miliband as its new leader on saturday , after a knife-edge race to replace former prime minister gordon brown .
miliband was elected by a ballot of legislators , party activists and about 3.5 million labor union members , narrowly defeating his older brother david miliband , a former foreign secretary .
after a five-month race , ed miliband secured labour 's leadership with 50.65 percent of the vote .
david miliband , who led the contest up until the final days , finished at a narrow second with 49.35 percent .
ed miliband 's last-minute surge in popularity has been attributed to a campaign that appealed to labour 's traditional left-wing supporters .
a new generation takes charge in his victory speech , ed miliband vowed to unify the party .
" the labour party in the future must be a vehicle that does n't just attract thousands of young people but tens of thousands , hundreds of thousands of young people who see us as their voice in british politics today , " he said .
" today a new generation has taken charge of labour , a new generation that understands the call of change , " he said .
brown resigned as the center-left party 's leader after losing the may election in which a conservative-led coalition removed labour from office , ending 13 years in power .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ed miliband , right , narrowly overcame his brother david , left , in the final days of the election .
miliband paid tribute to the former prime minister , saying he was " proud of the leadership of both tony blair and gordon brown " but that labour had " lost the election , and we lost it badly . "
" my message to the country is this , " he said : " i know we lost trust .
i know we lost touch .
i know we need to change . "
challenges ahead one of the biggest challenges facing milibrand will be to sort out his position on conservative prime minister david cameron 's planned austerity measures , the details of which are due in a comprehensive spending review on october 20 .
miliband also faces a tough choice of how to respond to possible mass strikes against the spending cuts , any stance on which could prove divisive .
miliband will face his first test as labour chief this sunday , as the party begins a five-day meeting in manchester to discuss its role in britain 's new political landscape .

but some german lawmakers say they do not want a celebrity visit . german chancellor angela merkel has welcomed france 's first lady carla bruni to make a personal appeal to the german parliament for humanitarian aid , despite a dismissive response to the plan by some german politicians .
merkel 's spokesman steffen seibert said thursday that the chancellor supported bruni 's aim to speak before the budget committee of the bundestag lower house to seek funding as an ambassador for the global fund to fight aids , tuberculosis and malaria .
" the chancellor found this a good idea because mrs. bruni-sarkozy could deliver important arguments , " he said , using the former model and singer-songwriter 's married name .
' no celebrities , please ' otto fricke , a budget policy specialist of the free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- , came out against the move , warning that the budget committee " must n't give the impression that celebrity status ensures access to -lsb- committee meetings -rsb- . "
the head of the budget committee , petra merkel of the opposition social democrats , said meanwhile that she had yet to receive a request from bruni to speak .
" we had a similar case with the -lrb- u2 -rrb- singer bono , who wanted to speak to the committee a few years ago but we refused because it did not comply with our rules , " she added , referring to a decision made in 2008 .
another member of the committee , norbert barthle of merkel 's christian democrats , stressed that the committee did not in principle invite representatives of special interests , adding , " if we open the door to that , we would have to receive every representative of a social welfare and economic association or lobbyists . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bruni is known for attracting more attention on international visits than her husband under pressure merkel 's support for bruni may have been a bid to soothe diplomatic relations with french president nicolas sarkozy - which have already faced challenges this month over france 's controversial expulsion of illegal roma migrants .
german press agency dpa reported that the idea for bruni 's berlin trip was broached during a meeting between merkel and sarkozy in new york , to which sarkozy brought his wife and son . earlier , the two leaders were at odds over sarkozy 's claim that the chancellor intended to adopt a similiar campaign of deporting illegal roma immigrants .
bruni reportedly wants to ask germany for an extra 200 million euros -lrb- $ 268 million -rrb- for the global fund , to which sarkozy promised a billion euros from france .
germany 's development ministry has set aside only 200 million euros for the fund next year and has ruled out further pledges for now .

flight pk782 was traveling from toronto to karachi when the pilot received word by radio that canadian authorities suspected a passenger was carrying explosives .
the pilot requested to land at stockholm 's arlanda airport , where all 273 passengers and crew aboard the boeing 777 were safely evacuated .
no explosives were found on the suspect and an extensive search of the aircraft yielded " no dangerous substances , " according to police spokesman kjell lindgren .
anonymous tip-off the incident began when canadian police received an anonymous phone call .
a woman , calling from a payphone after the plane had taken off , told authorities a passenger on board the flight was carrying explosives .
another police spokesman in sweden , janne hedlund , said the suspect had passed through all the usual security checks before boarding the flight .
police described him as a canadian national of pakistani origin in his 30s . the man , whose name was not made public , was released without charge after questioning .
canadian police now say they are looking into whether the bomb alert was a " terrorist hoax . "

the team took down german champions bayern munich and are now ready to claim the record for best start to a season . undefeated mainz triumphed 2-1 over german soccer giants bayern munich at the allianz arena , achieving their sixth victory in six games this bundesliga season .
the result left champions bayern munich in eighth place , eight points behind mainz who lead dortmund by two points .
mainz took the lead on 15 minutes when 20-year-old star player lewis holtby overtook daniel van buyten to cross for sami allagui , who kicked the ball into the bottom left-hand corner .
the two teams were level by half-time after mainz 's danish defender bo svensson headed into his own net .
adam szalai secured mainz 's win with 13 minutes remaining on the clock , notching up his team 's second goal from 15 metres out . bayern munich coach louis van gaal did not hide his respect for mainz .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mainz made the winning goal with 13 minutes remaining " i think they can achieve a lot , even the championship , " he said , adding , " in my side too many players were playing below their standard .
we had a lot of problems with the pressure from mainz . "
approaching record mainz coach tomas tuchel , meanwhile , gave himself and his players two days off to celebrate their winning streak .
" i need these two days off as well to really understand what is happening , " added tuchel , who at 37 is the youngest coach in the league .
" it is quite extraordinary that after five wins we 've continued our streak at bayern munich , " tuchel said .
if mainz win against hoffenheim next week , they will meet the bundesliga record for best start to a season .

the two teams were level by half-time after mainz 's danish defender bo svensson headed into his own net .
adam szalai secured mainz 's win with 13 minutes remaining on the clock , notching up his team 's second goal from 15 metres out . bayern munich coach louis van gaal did not hide his respect for mainz .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mainz made the winning goal with 13 minutes remaining " i think they can achieve a lot , even the championship , " he said , adding , " in my side too many players were playing below their standard .
we had a lot of problems with the pressure from mainz . "
approaching record mainz coach tomas tuchel , meanwhile , gave himself and his players two days off to celebrate their winning streak .
" i need these two days off as well to really understand what is happening , " added tuchel , who at 37 is the youngest coach in the league .
" it is quite extraordinary that after five wins we 've continued our streak at bayern munich , " tuchel said .
if mainz win against hoffenheim next week , they will meet the bundesliga record for best start to a season .

experts warn that the virus could be used for sabotage . one of the most sophisticated pieces of malware ever detected has infected tens of thousands of computers in indonesia , india , the united states , australia , britain , malaysia and pakistan .
the biggest target , however , has been iran . the computer virus , known as stuxnet , is a " working and fearsome prototype of a cyber-weapon that could lead to the creation of a new arms race , " kaspersky labs , an internet security firm based in moscow , warned in a statement . the german engineering conglomerate siemens , which developed the systems attacked by stuxnet , said the malware spreads via infected usb thumb drive memory sticks , exploiting vulnerabilities in the microsoft windows operating system . the super-virus attacks software programs that run on supervisory control and data acquisition , or scada , systems , a product developed by siemens and sold around the world , including to iran .
scada is used to manage water supplies , oil rigs , power plants and other industrial facilities . once the worm infects a system , it quickly sets up communications with a remote server computer that can be used to steal proprietary information or take control of the scada system . bildunterschrift : iran is suspected of secretly developing nuclear weapons using its bushehr facility as a cover stuxnet source unknown computer security experts have said the attackers may have chosen to spread the malicious software via thumb drives because many scada systems control sensitive operations and are therefore not connected to the internet , but do have usb ports . ralf langner , a german cyber security specialist , said the attack was launched by an as yet unknown software expert , very possibly a nation state . " this is not some hacker sitting in the basement of his parents ' house , " he said . stuxnet is able to recognize a specific facility 's control network and then destroy it , said langner .
he said he suspects that the virus ' target was the bushehr nuclear reactor facility in iran . since june , tehran has blamed unspecified problems for a delay in getting the facility fully operational .
iran 's isna news agency reported that the country 's nuclear agency met to determine a way to combat the computer worm . a siemens spokesperson , however , said the iranian nuclear power plant was built with help from a russian contractor and that siemens was not involved .
the spokesperson added that the company would not speculation the virus ' target . a study of the stuxnet virus conducted by the us technology company symantec showed that the country most affected by the virus was iran with nearly 63,000 infected computers or more than two-thirds of all cases worldwide . so far , neither siemens nor cyber security experts in europe , russia or the united states , have discovered who is behind the stuxnet attacks , but langner said investigations would eventually point to the attackers .

experts warn that the virus could be used for sabotage . one of the most sophisticated pieces of malware ever detected has infected tens of thousands of computers in indonesia , india , the united states , australia , britain , malaysia and pakistan .
the biggest target , however , has been iran . the computer virus , known as stuxnet , is a " working and fearsome prototype of a cyber-weapon that could lead to the creation of a new arms race , " kaspersky labs , an internet security firm based in moscow , warned in a statement . the german engineering conglomerate siemens , which developed the systems attacked by stuxnet , said the malware spreads via infected usb thumb drive memory sticks , exploiting vulnerabilities in the microsoft windows operating system . the super-virus attacks software programs that run on supervisory control and data acquisition , or scada , systems , a product developed by siemens and sold around the world , including to iran .
scada is used to manage water supplies , oil rigs , power plants and other industrial facilities . once the worm infects a system , it quickly sets up communications with a remote server computer that can be used to steal proprietary information or take control of the scada system . bildunterschrift : iran is suspected of secretly developing nuclear weapons using its bushehr facility as a cover stuxnet source unknown computer security experts have said the attackers may have chosen to spread the malicious software via thumb drives because many scada systems control sensitive operations and are therefore not connected to the internet , but do have usb ports . ralf langner , a german cyber security specialist , said the attack was launched by an as yet unknown software expert , very possibly a nation state . " this is not some hacker sitting in the basement of his parents ' house , " he said . stuxnet is able to recognize a specific facility 's control network and then destroy it , said langner .
he said he suspects that the virus ' target was the bushehr nuclear reactor facility in iran . since june , tehran has blamed unspecified problems for a delay in getting the facility fully operational .
iran 's isna news agency reported that the country 's nuclear agency met to determine a way to combat the computer worm . a siemens spokesperson , however , said the iranian nuclear power plant was built with help from a russian contractor and that siemens was not involved .
the spokesperson added that the company would not speculation the virus ' target . a study of the stuxnet virus conducted by the us technology company symantec showed that the country most affected by the virus was iran with nearly 63,000 infected computers or more than two-thirds of all cases worldwide . so far , neither siemens nor cyber security experts in europe , russia or the united states , have discovered who is behind the stuxnet attacks , but langner said investigations would eventually point to the attackers . " the attackers must know this , " he said .
" my conclusion is they do n't care .
they do n't fear going to jail . " author : gregg benzow -lrb- dpa / afp / reuters -rrb- editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

experts warn that the virus could be used for sabotage . one of the most sophisticated pieces of malware ever detected has infected tens of thousands of computers in indonesia , india , the united states , australia , britain , malaysia and pakistan .
the biggest target , however , has been iran . the computer virus , known as stuxnet , is a " working and fearsome prototype of a cyber-weapon that could lead to the creation of a new arms race , " kaspersky labs , an internet security firm based in moscow , warned in a statement . the german engineering conglomerate siemens , which developed the systems attacked by stuxnet , said the malware spreads via infected usb thumb drive memory sticks , exploiting vulnerabilities in the microsoft windows operating system . the super-virus attacks software programs that run on supervisory control and data acquisition , or scada , systems , a product developed by siemens and sold around the world , including to iran .
scada is used to manage water supplies , oil rigs , power plants and other industrial facilities . once the worm infects a system , it quickly sets up communications with a remote server computer that can be used to steal proprietary information or take control of the scada system . bildunterschrift : iran is suspected of secretly developing nuclear weapons using its bushehr facility as a cover stuxnet source unknown computer security experts have said the attackers may have chosen to spread the malicious software via thumb drives because many scada systems control sensitive operations and are therefore not connected to the internet , but do have usb ports . ralf langner , a german cyber security specialist , said the attack was launched by an as yet unknown software expert , very possibly a nation state . " this is not some hacker sitting in the basement of his parents ' house , " he said . stuxnet is able to recognize a specific facility 's control network and then destroy it , said langner .
he said he suspects that the virus ' target was the bushehr nuclear reactor facility in iran . since june , tehran has blamed unspecified problems for a delay in getting the facility fully operational .
iran 's isna news agency reported that the country 's nuclear agency met to determine a way to combat the computer worm . a siemens spokesperson , however , said the iranian nuclear power plant was built with help from a russian contractor and that siemens was not involved .
the spokesperson added that the company would not speculation the virus ' target . a study of the stuxnet virus conducted by the us technology company symantec showed that the country most affected by the virus was iran with nearly 63,000 infected computers or more than two-thirds of all cases worldwide . so far , neither siemens nor cyber security experts in europe , russia or the united states , have discovered who is behind the stuxnet attacks , but langner said investigations would eventually point to the attackers . " the attackers must know this , " he said .
" my conclusion is they do n't care .
they do n't fear going to jail . " author : gregg benzow -lrb- dpa / afp / reuters -rrb- editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

experts warn that the virus could be used for sabotage . one of the most sophisticated pieces of malware ever detected has infected tens of thousands of computers in indonesia , india , the united states , australia , britain , malaysia and pakistan .
the biggest target , however , has been iran . the computer virus , known as stuxnet , is a " working and fearsome prototype of a cyber-weapon that could lead to the creation of a new arms race , " kaspersky labs , an internet security firm based in moscow , warned in a statement . the german engineering conglomerate siemens , which developed the systems attacked by stuxnet , said the malware spreads via infected usb thumb drive memory sticks , exploiting vulnerabilities in the microsoft windows operating system . the super-virus attacks software programs that run on supervisory control and data acquisition , or scada , systems , a product developed by siemens and sold around the world , including to iran .
scada is used to manage water supplies , oil rigs , power plants and other industrial facilities . once the worm infects a system , it quickly sets up communications with a remote server computer that can be used to steal proprietary information or take control of the scada system . bildunterschrift : iran is suspected of secretly developing nuclear weapons using its bushehr facility as a cover stuxnet source unknown computer security experts have said the attackers may have chosen to spread the malicious software via thumb drives because many scada systems control sensitive operations and are therefore not connected to the internet , but do have usb ports . ralf langner , a german cyber security specialist , said the attack was launched by an as yet unknown software expert , very possibly a nation state . " this is not some hacker sitting in the basement of his parents ' house , " he said . stuxnet is able to recognize a specific facility 's control network and then destroy it , said langner .
he said he suspects that the virus ' target was the bushehr nuclear reactor facility in iran . since june , tehran has blamed unspecified problems for a delay in getting the facility fully operational .
iran 's isna news agency reported that the country 's nuclear agency met to determine a way to combat the computer worm . a siemens spokesperson , however , said the iranian nuclear power plant was built with help from a russian contractor and that siemens was not involved .
the spokesperson added that the company would not speculation the virus ' target . a study of the stuxnet virus conducted by the us technology company symantec showed that the country most affected by the virus was iran with nearly 63,000 infected computers or more than two-thirds of all cases worldwide . so far , neither siemens nor cyber security experts in europe , russia or the united states , have discovered who is behind the stuxnet attacks , but langner said investigations would eventually point to the attackers . " the attackers must know this , " he said .
" my conclusion is they do n't care .
they do n't fear going to jail . " author : gregg benzow -lrb- dpa / afp / reuters -rrb- editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

experts warn that the virus could be used for sabotage . one of the most sophisticated pieces of malware ever detected has infected tens of thousands of computers in indonesia , india , the united states , australia , britain , malaysia and pakistan .
the biggest target , however , has been iran . the computer virus , known as stuxnet , is a " working and fearsome prototype of a cyber-weapon that could lead to the creation of a new arms race , " kaspersky labs , an internet security firm based in moscow , warned in a statement . the german engineering conglomerate siemens , which developed the systems attacked by stuxnet , said the malware spreads via infected usb thumb drive memory sticks , exploiting vulnerabilities in the microsoft windows operating system . the super-virus attacks software programs that run on supervisory control and data acquisition , or scada , systems , a product developed by siemens and sold around the world , including to iran .
scada is used to manage water supplies , oil rigs , power plants and other industrial facilities . once the worm infects a system , it quickly sets up communications with a remote server computer that can be used to steal proprietary information or take control of the scada system . bildunterschrift : iran is suspected of secretly developing nuclear weapons using its bushehr facility as a cover stuxnet source unknown computer security experts have said the attackers may have chosen to spread the malicious software via thumb drives because many scada systems control sensitive operations and are therefore not connected to the internet , but do have usb ports . ralf langner , a german cyber security specialist , said the attack was launched by an as yet unknown software expert , very possibly a nation state . " this is not some hacker sitting in the basement of his parents ' house , " he said . stuxnet is able to recognize a specific facility 's control network and then destroy it , said langner .
he said he suspects that the virus ' target was the bushehr nuclear reactor facility in iran . since june , tehran has blamed unspecified problems for a delay in getting the facility fully operational .
iran 's isna news agency reported that the country 's nuclear agency met to determine a way to combat the computer worm . a siemens spokesperson , however , said the iranian nuclear power plant was built with help from a russian contractor and that siemens was not involved .
the spokesperson added that the company would not speculation the virus ' target . a study of the stuxnet virus conducted by the us technology company symantec showed that the country most affected by the virus was iran with nearly 63,000 infected computers or more than two-thirds of all cases worldwide . so far , neither siemens nor cyber security experts in europe , russia or the united states , have discovered who is behind the stuxnet attacks , but langner said investigations would eventually point to the attackers . " the attackers must know this , " he said .
" my conclusion is they do n't care .
they do n't fear going to jail . " author : gregg benzow -lrb- dpa / afp / reuters -rrb- editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

experts warn that the virus could be used for sabotage . one of the most sophisticated pieces of malware ever detected has infected tens of thousands of computers in indonesia , india , the united states , australia , britain , malaysia and pakistan .
the biggest target , however , has been iran . the computer virus , known as stuxnet , is a " working and fearsome prototype of a cyber-weapon that could lead to the creation of a new arms race , " kaspersky labs , an internet security firm based in moscow , warned in a statement . the german engineering conglomerate siemens , which developed the systems attacked by stuxnet , said the malware spreads via infected usb thumb drive memory sticks , exploiting vulnerabilities in the microsoft windows operating system . the super-virus attacks software programs that run on supervisory control and data acquisition , or scada , systems , a product developed by siemens and sold around the world , including to iran .
scada is used to manage water supplies , oil rigs , power plants and other industrial facilities . once the worm infects a system , it quickly sets up communications with a remote server computer that can be used to steal proprietary information or take control of the scada system . bildunterschrift : iran is suspected of secretly developing nuclear weapons using its bushehr facility as a cover stuxnet source unknown computer security experts have said the attackers may have chosen to spread the malicious software via thumb drives because many scada systems control sensitive operations and are therefore not connected to the internet , but do have usb ports . ralf langner , a german cyber security specialist , said the attack was launched by an as yet unknown software expert , very possibly a nation state . " this is not some hacker sitting in the basement of his parents ' house , " he said . stuxnet is able to recognize a specific facility 's control network and then destroy it , said langner .
he said he suspects that the virus ' target was the bushehr nuclear reactor facility in iran . since june , tehran has blamed unspecified problems for a delay in getting the facility fully operational .
iran 's isna news agency reported that the country 's nuclear agency met to determine a way to combat the computer worm . a siemens spokesperson , however , said the iranian nuclear power plant was built with help from a russian contractor and that siemens was not involved .
the spokesperson added that the company would not speculation the virus ' target . a study of the stuxnet virus conducted by the us technology company symantec showed that the country most affected by the virus was iran with nearly 63,000 infected computers or more than two-thirds of all cases worldwide . so far , neither siemens nor cyber security experts in europe , russia or the united states , have discovered who is behind the stuxnet attacks , but langner said investigations would eventually point to the attackers . " the attackers must know this , " he said .
" my conclusion is they do n't care .
they do n't fear going to jail . " author : gregg benzow -lrb- dpa / afp / reuters -rrb- editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

experts warn that the virus could be used for sabotage . one of the most sophisticated pieces of malware ever detected has infected tens of thousands of computers in indonesia , india , the united states , australia , britain , malaysia and pakistan .
the biggest target , however , has been iran . the computer virus , known as stuxnet , is a " working and fearsome prototype of a cyber-weapon that could lead to the creation of a new arms race , " kaspersky labs , an internet security firm based in moscow , warned in a statement . the german engineering conglomerate siemens , which developed the systems attacked by stuxnet , said the malware spreads via infected usb thumb drive memory sticks , exploiting vulnerabilities in the microsoft windows operating system . the super-virus attacks software programs that run on supervisory control and data acquisition , or scada , systems , a product developed by siemens and sold around the world , including to iran .

he said he suspects that the virus ' target was the bushehr nuclear reactor facility in iran . since june , tehran has blamed unspecified problems for a delay in getting the facility fully operational .
iran 's isna news agency reported that the country 's nuclear agency met to determine a way to combat the computer worm . a siemens spokesperson , however , said the iranian nuclear power plant was built with help from a russian contractor and that siemens was not involved .

the biggest target , however , has been iran . the computer virus , known as stuxnet , is a " working and fearsome prototype of a cyber-weapon that could lead to the creation of a new arms race , " kaspersky labs , an internet security firm based in moscow , warned in a statement . the german engineering conglomerate siemens , which developed the systems attacked by stuxnet , said the malware spreads via infected usb thumb drive memory sticks , exploiting vulnerabilities in the microsoft windows operating system . the super-virus attacks software programs that run on supervisory control and data acquisition , or scada , systems , a product developed by siemens and sold around the world , including to iran .
scada is used to manage water supplies , oil rigs , power plants and other industrial facilities . once the worm infects a system , it quickly sets up communications with a remote server computer that can be used to steal proprietary information or take control of the scada system . bildunterschrift : iran is suspected of secretly developing nuclear weapons using its bushehr facility as a cover stuxnet source unknown computer security experts have said the attackers may have chosen to spread the malicious software via thumb drives because many scada systems control sensitive operations and are therefore not connected to the internet , but do have usb ports . ralf langner , a german cyber security specialist , said the attack was launched by an as yet unknown software expert , very possibly a nation state . " this is not some hacker sitting in the basement of his parents ' house , " he said . stuxnet is able to recognize a specific facility 's control network and then destroy it , said langner .
he said he suspects that the virus ' target was the bushehr nuclear reactor facility in iran . since june , tehran has blamed unspecified problems for a delay in getting the facility fully operational .
iran 's isna news agency reported that the country 's nuclear agency met to determine a way to combat the computer worm . a siemens spokesperson , however , said the iranian nuclear power plant was built with help from a russian contractor and that siemens was not involved .
the spokesperson added that the company would not speculation the virus ' target . a study of the stuxnet virus conducted by the us technology company symantec showed that the country most affected by the virus was iran with nearly 63,000 infected computers or more than two-thirds of all cases worldwide . so far , neither siemens nor cyber security experts in europe , russia or the united states , have discovered who is behind the stuxnet attacks , but langner said investigations would eventually point to the attackers .

experts warn that the virus could be used for sabotage . one of the most sophisticated pieces of malware ever detected has infected tens of thousands of computers in indonesia , india , the united states , australia , britain , malaysia and pakistan .
the biggest target , however , has been iran . the computer virus , known as stuxnet , is a " working and fearsome prototype of a cyber-weapon that could lead to the creation of a new arms race , " kaspersky labs , an internet security firm based in moscow , warned in a statement . the german engineering conglomerate siemens , which developed the systems attacked by stuxnet , said the malware spreads via infected usb thumb drive memory sticks , exploiting vulnerabilities in the microsoft windows operating system . the super-virus attacks software programs that run on supervisory control and data acquisition , or scada , systems , a product developed by siemens and sold around the world , including to iran .
scada is used to manage water supplies , oil rigs , power plants and other industrial facilities . once the worm infects a system , it quickly sets up communications with a remote server computer that can be used to steal proprietary information or take control of the scada system . bildunterschrift : iran is suspected of secretly developing nuclear weapons using its bushehr facility as a cover stuxnet source unknown computer security experts have said the attackers may have chosen to spread the malicious software via thumb drives because many scada systems control sensitive operations and are therefore not connected to the internet , but do have usb ports . ralf langner , a german cyber security specialist , said the attack was launched by an as yet unknown software expert , very possibly a nation state . " this is not some hacker sitting in the basement of his parents ' house , " he said . stuxnet is able to recognize a specific facility 's control network and then destroy it , said langner .
he said he suspects that the virus ' target was the bushehr nuclear reactor facility in iran . since june , tehran has blamed unspecified problems for a delay in getting the facility fully operational .
iran 's isna news agency reported that the country 's nuclear agency met to determine a way to combat the computer worm . a siemens spokesperson , however , said the iranian nuclear power plant was built with help from a russian contractor and that siemens was not involved .
the spokesperson added that the company would not speculation the virus ' target . a study of the stuxnet virus conducted by the us technology company symantec showed that the country most affected by the virus was iran with nearly 63,000 infected computers or more than two-thirds of all cases worldwide . so far , neither siemens nor cyber security experts in europe , russia or the united states , have discovered who is behind the stuxnet attacks , but langner said investigations would eventually point to the attackers . " the attackers must know this , " he said .
" my conclusion is they do n't care .
they do n't fear going to jail . " author : gregg benzow -lrb- dpa / afp / reuters -rrb- editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

foreign minister guido westerwelle drove home that message in an address to the united nations general assembly on saturday , his first before the international body . " you can rely on germany , " westerwelle said , adding , " germany is prepared to take on greater responsibility . " shaking up the un westerwelle advocated a shake-up in the un security council , claiming the un " no longer reflects the architecture of today 's world . " the foreign minister stressed germany 's involvement in a number of global issues . " germany is the third largest donor for development cooperation , " westerwelle said .
" we 've largely overcome the financial and economic crisis , and are on the right course with robust economic growth . " westerwelle added that germany was prepared to spearhead measures to counter climate change .
he said his country wanted a seat on the un security council in order to work towards " peace and development . " germany is currently in the running with portugal and canada for a rotating , two-year , non-permanent seat on the council .
a decision over new members is to be made in october .
berlin would need the votes of two-thirds of the 192 countries in the un general assembly . berlin is pushing hard for the seat , but ultimately is seeking a permanent spot on the security council , along with the five current veto powers usa , britain , france , china and russia . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : westerwelle is an advocate of german leadership britain voices support for german ambitions westerwelle , on friday , got support from britain 's deputy premier nick clegg , who said london was " clearly and unequivocally " in favor of a permanent seat for germany on the un security council . clegg also advocated that japan , india , brazil and a representative from africa be given permanent seats on the council . meanwhile , a former german foreign minister , hans-dietrich genscher , who presided over german reunification 20 years ago , has called a permanent german seat an outdated notion . " if we 're serious about european unity , then we need a seat for the european union , while retaining the seats for france and britain , " genscher said on saturday in an interview with the mitteldeutsche zeitung newspaper . this , however , is not what westerwelle and his colleagues from india , japan and brazil had in mind when they published a joint declaration in new york on friday to stake their claims to a permanent security council seat . in their statement they said a reform of the un body was " urgently needed " to make it " more representative , legitimate and efficient .

in return , the museum will expand its collection to further cover both grassroots and international cricket , and use these artefacts to promote the game .
taking the field will focus on key themes describing cricket and its place in society ; such as the effect of migration , decolonization , changing women 's roles and class on local cricket clubs and their communities .
the newport asians club unites players from all south asian backgrounds as such , the project will act as a social history of the uk and sri lanka and attempt to document the long links between them , from the colonial past to current , post-tsunami reconstruction .
professor mike wilson , who is supervising the project , said : " the project itself will attempt to reflect the diverse nature of cricket in both the uk and sri lanka , as well as the character of cricket clubs and the communities they serve .
" it will chart the changes of both good and bad , experienced by clubs and communities over the past century . "
adam chadwick , curator of collections at the mcc museum , added : " mcc is delighted to be a part of this groundbreaking partnership .
" the club is seeking to underline how dynamic its heritage collections can be .
" emma peplow 's work over the next two years will mirror not only mcc 's support for school , club and university cricket but also its efforts to help communities in sri lanka in the wake of the tsunami . "
the project is intended to be self-sustaining and will invite clubs not initially involved to come forward and tell their own stories .

who is standing in the contest ?
there are five contenders .
former foreign secretary david miliband , his brother and former energy secretary ed miliband , former schools secretary ed balls , former health secretary andy burnham and backbencher diane abbott , the uk 's first female black mp .
read more about the hopefuls .
how did they become candidates ?
candidates could not simply declare they wanted to stand .
each had to be nominated by 33 labour mps in order to get onto the ballot paper .
three candidates - david miliband , ed miliband and ed balls - secured sufficient nominations well before the deadline last month but andy burnham and diane abbott only passed the threshold on the day itself .
another intended candidate , mp john mcdonnell , pulled out of the race and encouraged his backers to transfer their support to diane abbott to make sure she qualified .
how long will the contest take ?
voting took place between mid-august and mid-september with the winner being announced on 25 september ahead of the first day of the party 's conference in manchester .
party officials believed the contest , triggered in may , should not be rushed saying labour should have as full a debate as possible on the party 's future direction .
the candidates set out their stalls in a series of hustings up and down the country .
w ho can vote in the contest ?
labour mps , members of the european parliament -lrb- meps -rrb- , party members and members of affiliated organisations , such as trades unions and socialist societies , are all entitled to vote in the election .
nearly a million people voted in the last contested election , in 1994 .
anyone who joined the labour party by 8 september was eligible to vote .
how is the vote conducted ?
the vote is broken down into three sections , known as an electoral college .
labour mps and meps , party members and members of affiliate organisations are all balloted individually and the results from the separate categories each make up a third of the final result .
in 1994 , tony blair won the backing of 60 % of mps / meps , 58 % of party members and 52 % of affiliate organisations .
his nearest challenger , john prescott , got 19 % , 24 % and 28.4 % of the votes respectively .
the share of the vote from each category is divided proportionately to get the final result .
mr blair won the contest with a 57 % share of the overall vote .
in labour 's 2007 deputy leadership election , it was decided that no-one could win outright with less than 50 % of the vote .
the candidates with the fewest votes were successively eliminated and their second preferences distributed to other candidates until harriet harman won in the fifth round .
the labour party 's ruling national executive committee -lrb- nec -rrb- , in charge of the election rules , will decide what process to follow this time .
who is in charge in the meantime ?
deputy labour leader harriet harman has been acting leader until the election takes place .
when is the result being announced ?
the result of the vote is expected at about 1630 bst on saturday , in manchester , ahead of the start of labour 's annual party conference .

labour mps , members of the european parliament -lrb- meps -rrb- , party members and members of affiliated organisations , such as trades unions and socialist societies , are all entitled to vote in the election .
nearly a million people voted in the last contested election , in 1994 .

in 1994 , tony blair won the backing of 60 % of mps / meps , 58 % of party members and 52 % of affiliate organisations .
his nearest challenger , john prescott , got 19 % , 24 % and 28.4 % of the votes respectively .

mr blair won the contest with a 57 % share of the overall vote .
in labour 's 2007 deputy leadership election , it was decided that no-one could win outright with less than 50 % of the vote .
the candidates with the fewest votes were successively eliminated and their second preferences distributed to other candidates until harriet harman won in the fifth round .
the labour party 's ruling national executive committee -lrb- nec -rrb- , in charge of the election rules , will decide what process to follow this time .

lee , from cheddleton in staffordshire , has appeared on channel 4 's that paralympics show as the tv station looks forward to london 2012 .
lee is also the featured cover-face for new bt phone books in stoke-on-trent & stafford areas .
the paralympic games , which runs parallel with the olympic games , celebrates athletes with disabilities .
dressage legend lee was born with arthrogryposis multiplex congenita , which limits movement in his legs and ankles .
but it 's not stopped him from becoming a legend in horse-riding competition where he specialises in dressage .
he has been unbeaten in three consecutive paralympic games since 2000 .
his success however has largely gone unnoticed by the public , as awareness of paralympic sport remains low .
research done by channel 4 showed that 84 % of the public could not name a single british paralympian , despite the country coming second in the medals table in 2008 .
channel 4 won the rights to broadcast the paralympics and they hope to turn some some of the athletes into household names .
new editions lee has also made the front cover of the new bt phone books for stoke-on-trent and stafford .
these new editions celebrate the forthcoming london 2012 olympic & paralympic games .
bt produces 168 geographic versions of the book every year .
lee said : " featuring sporting personalities on the cover of the phone book is a great idea and will help raise the profile of the london 2012 olympic and paralympic games across the uk . "
important ambassador david grossman , ceo , bt directories , said : " we hope everyone gets behind the athlete that features on the front cover of their own phone book - it would be great if this inspires young hopefuls in the world of sport .
" lee is a super enthusiastic paralympian whose accomplishments make him a role model and an important ambassador for london 2012 .
and who knows ?
maybe the new phone books will become a collector 's item ! "
each phone book will include london 2012 information - specific to its own region - as the games move closer .
