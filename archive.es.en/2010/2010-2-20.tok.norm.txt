the package is reportedly being cobbled together by the german government . the deal under consideration would see the 15 other euro zone countries issue 20-25 billion euros in aid in the form of loans and guarantees , weekly german newsmagazine der spiegel reported .
the report said each euro zone country 's contribution to the package would be calculated according to the proportion of capital each holds in the european central bank .
germany 's contribution would reportedly amount to around four billion euros and be handled by the state-owned development bank , the kfw .
the government of chancellor angela merkel has so far held off on committing any aid to greece over fears this would cause other troubled euro zone countries to go easy on reforms to their economies in the hope of also receiving bailout packages .
" crisis as a chance " greece is currently trying to rein in a deficit of 12.7 percent of gdp , more than four times the limit allowed by euro zone regulations .
the government of greek prime minister georgiou papandreou said it was aiming to reduce the deficit to below three percent by 2012 .
papandreou said he was confident this ambitious target could be met by clamping down on bribery and corruption .
" we need to understand the crisis as a chance to launch the necessary reforms , " he said in an interview for a separate report also to run in der spiegel on monday .

besides being expensive , they have been used as official cars by two relief organizations in germany .
this has sparked outrage among donors and aid workers . the director of treberhilfe , a berlin-based non-profit organization aiding the homeless , found himself in a bind this week trying to explain why he was driving a maserati quattroporte , a flashy italian sports sedan that starts at about 90,000 euros -lrb- $ 120,000 -rrb- . when asked about the car , ehlert 's response was that " a maserati is a car for a gentleman . "
he added that his organization " worked unconventionally , but was absolutely respectable . " ehlert , who has a predilection for fedoras , fine leather shoes and silk scarves , said it was important " to make a good impression on prospective donors . " treberhilfe 's website has since been shut down after angry donors flooded the portal with emails , calling ehlert " asocial " and pledging never to donate again . christine lehmacher-dubberke , the spokeswoman for diakonie emergency aid - the social service umbrella organization of the german protestant church that treberhilfe belongs to - said a maserati was " not a suitable company car " and buying one for that purpose was " morally reprehensible .

she complained that that the proceedings were biased against her .
" given that the court is refusing to establish the truth in essence , i withdrew my lawsuit at today 's morning sitting of the supreme administrative court and asked the court to stop this show , which bears no resemblance to justice , " she said .
the 49-year-old said the court had refused to consider documented proof of what she claimed were " falsification " of election results .
" it is clear they want to whitewash this falsification and act as if it was legal , " tymoshenko said , referring to the judges on the court panel .

besides being expensive , they have been used as official cars by two relief organizations in germany .
this has sparked outrage among donors and aid workers . the director of treberhilfe , a berlin-based non-profit organization aiding the homeless , found himself in a bind this week trying to explain why he was driving a maserati quattroporte , a flashy italian sports sedan that starts at about 90,000 euros -lrb- $ 120,000 -rrb- . when asked about the car , ehlert 's response was that " a maserati is a car for a gentleman . "
he added that his organization " worked unconventionally , but was absolutely respectable . " ehlert , who has a predilection for fedoras , fine leather shoes and silk scarves , said it was important " to make a good impression on prospective donors . " treberhilfe 's website has since been shut down after angry donors flooded the portal with emails , calling ehlert " asocial " and pledging never to donate again . christine lehmacher-dubberke , the spokeswoman for diakonie emergency aid - the social service umbrella organization of the german protestant church that treberhilfe belongs to - said a maserati was " not a suitable company car " and buying one for that purpose was " morally reprehensible . " " mr. ehlert believes he needs the car , " she said .
" we see that differently . " police probe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schwarzer claims funds have been misappropriated meanwhile , police and state prosecutors are investigating claims of fraud and embezzlement at the berlin-based women 's relief group , hatun & can , after it surfaced that the organization was using a large , upscale , all-terrain vehicle as a company car . police have since confiscated a land rover and frozen most of the group 's bank accounts . the case came to light after alice schwarzer , a prominent german feminist and women 's magazine publisher , won 500,000 euros on the celebrity edition of the television game show " who wants to be a millionaire ? " last year .
she donated the prize money to hatun & can , but later filed charges against the group alleging fraud and misappropriation of funds . germany 's feminist number one said that her attempts to find out what her donation was being used for had landed on deaf ears and that she got only " short and vague answers . " the women 's organization rejected the allegations . " -lsb- schwarzer 's -rsb- accusations are legally absurd and her charges - a catastrophic mistake , " said hubert dreyling , a lawyer for hatun & can .
" -lsb- she -rsb- is being hypocritical and acting self-important . " the women 's aid group was named after 23-year-old hatun sürücü , who was gunned down in berlin by her brother in a so-called " honor killing " five years ago because her fundamentalist turkish-kurdish family strongly disapproved of her modern and " un-islamic " way of life . gb / dpa / epd editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but the gold went to britain 's amy williams . kerstin symkowiak and anja huber have won germany 's first ever medals in the skeleton event , clinching silver and bronze in vancouver late on friday .
their achievement is all the more impressive as it seemed impossible going into the final round .
the germans were fourth and fifth after three attempts , but both managed to leapfrog american noelle pikus-pace and canadian home favorite mellisa hollingsworth with solid times in the fourth , and final , round .
" i have worked long and hard towards this moment , " kerstin symkowiak told reporters before receiving her medal .
" i always knew that if i delivered four consistent runs , then anything was possible . "

historic gold while the german women secured the country 's first ever skeleton medals , amy williams won britain 's first gold medal in any individual winter olympics event since 1980 .
williams ended britain 's 30-year winter olympics drought with relative ease , leading from start to finish , and setting the fastest single time of the competition with her third run .
" i ca n't believe it is actually happening right now , " williams said .
" i feel like i am in a little bubble , and i do n't know if it is at all real . "
williams , however , was doubtful for the competition until the last minute .
a protest over the special design of her helmet , which the us argued provided an illegal aerodynamic advantage , put williams ' olympic fate in doubt . organizers dismissed the appeal shortly before the competition began .
skeleton - which is a head-first variation of the luge event - only became a medal-winning winter olympic discipline at salt lake city in 2002 .

but hoffenheim recovered to salvage a point .
the exciting , if somewhat scrappy match finished 2-2 . hoffenheim and borussia moenchengladbach played out a 2-2 draw in the bundesliga 's friday fixture .
the two sides delivered an exciting , offensive match , but it was also littered with mistakes .
hoffenheim started strong , but could n't take the lead in front of their home crowd ; demba ba , carlos eduardo , and vedad ibisevic all let excellent scoring chances go begging .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moenchengladbach took the lead through a controversial penalty however , a controversial handball by hoffenheim defender per nilsson led to the opening goal for moenchengladbach .
the referee decided to award a penalty , and showed nilsson the yellow card , although replays showed that the swede 's transgression actually took place outside the penalty area .
moenchengladbach 's belgian captain filip daems made no mistake from the spot and put his team ahead .
the visitors added another shortly after half time through israeli striker roberto colautti .
but in the last twenty minutes hoffenheim , having lost their way after their strong start , came back to life .
on 69 minutes , carlos eduardo carved through the moenchengladbach back line and provided vedad ibisevic with a chance that was just too good to turn down .
then , with just moments remaining , gladbach captain filip daems blocked a cross with his arm in the penalty area , conceding a penalty for the hosts .
carlos eduardo stepped up and slotted the ball home , rescuing the draw and a valuable bundesliga point for hoffenheim .
hoffenheim and moenchengladbach remain glued together in the mid-table , in ninth and tenth positions , with 28 points apiece .

but hoffenheim recovered to salvage a point .
the exciting , if somewhat scrappy match finished 2-2 . hoffenheim and borussia moenchengladbach played out a 2-2 draw in the bundesliga 's friday fixture .
the two sides delivered an exciting , offensive match , but it was also littered with mistakes .
hoffenheim started strong , but could n't take the lead in front of their home crowd ; demba ba , carlos eduardo , and vedad ibisevic all let excellent scoring chances go begging .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moenchengladbach took the lead through a controversial penalty however , a controversial handball by hoffenheim defender per nilsson led to the opening goal for moenchengladbach .
the referee decided to award a penalty , and showed nilsson the yellow card , although replays showed that the swede 's transgression actually took place outside the penalty area .
moenchengladbach 's belgian captain filip daems made no mistake from the spot and put his team ahead .
the visitors added another shortly after half time through israeli striker roberto colautti .
but in the last twenty minutes hoffenheim , having lost their way after their strong start , came back to life .
on 69 minutes , carlos eduardo carved through the moenchengladbach back line and provided vedad ibisevic with a chance that was just too good to turn down .
then , with just moments remaining , gladbach captain filip daems blocked a cross with his arm in the penalty area , conceding a penalty for the hosts .
carlos eduardo stepped up and slotted the ball home , rescuing the draw and a valuable bundesliga point for hoffenheim .
hoffenheim and moenchengladbach remain glued together in the mid-table , in ninth and tenth positions , with 28 points apiece .

the central question - is the era of the great hollywood studio over ? the european film market is the commercial arm of the berlin film festival .
held in tandem with the main event , the efm is an exchange floor for hundreds of potential movie deals - a forum where film producers compare ideas , struggling screenwriters try to bend the ears of high-powered executives , and where industry leaders look to the future and the challenges it holds .
one of the key issues this year was the global diversification of the entertainment industry , which is shaking up the way film deals are done around the world and threatening the dominance of the hollywood studio .
as more and more new hollywood movies are being financed , produced and shot outside the united states , film production companies are popping up like mushrooms all over the world , all serving the american audiences that make the us the biggest movie market in the world bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the efm debate was held parallel to the berlinale asian challenge but with cinema attendance sky-rocketing in places like china , and arab nations embarking on ambitious bids to build domestic film industries virtually from scratch , western producers will soon have to face the fact that the us is no longer the biggest market for movies .
the industry debate held at this year 's efm set out to answer the question whether this meant the beginning of the end for hollywood studio giants like fox , paramount and warner brothers ?
would a new model soon begin dominating the global film market ?
frederic sichler , an independent french film producer with close ties to the egyptian film business , had an unambiguous answer , for one simple reason – distribution .
" my answer is certainly not , " he said during the debate .
" there are two things to the us dominance : the control of distribution systems , and the production .
for any non-us company to have a distribution system in place that covers the world - i will not see it during my life , that 's for sure . "
instead , sichler predicts that a lot of very strong locally-focussed companies will emerge in places like china and india , where the demand for domestic movies is huge and expected to grow even more .
this will obviously have a major influence on the macro-economic picture , but sichler believes this will be evolutionary , not revolutionary .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : constantin produces and distributes major german movies like ' the baader meinhof complex ' keeping pace by diversifying no single company will rival fox , but a global network of companies will present strong alternatives .
" what has changed is that to produce international content , and to have a global distribution network , you do n't have only one model , which is to deal with the studio , " sichler said .
" you can assemble several partners all around the world which can ultimately deliver the same result . "
but christian grass , president of international production and acquisitions at universal pictures international , admitted that large us studios like his needed to keep pace with the global industry by diversifying along with it .
" speaking for universal , the idea is to be more active in the international market , and supplement the business that comes from the studio with more local and international productions , " he said .
european film production companies like germany 's constantin and the french studiocanal have also come to present a viable alternative to hollywood , if only in the european market .
ron halpern , responsible for international productions and acquisitions for studiocanal , says companies like his are large enough and better-placed to distribute films in europe 's three major markets : germany , britain and france .
" i think what 's interesting at studiocanal is because we are at-the-source distributors in these three territories , we can get feedback very early from three countries with pretty different points of view , " he told the debate .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ' slumdog millionaire ' was a rare example of an internationally-produced global hit in other words , being smaller and closer to the ground can mean that you are better at marketing and distributing a movie in a specific place .
after the debate , halpern told deutsche welle that this was exactly why studiocanal does not keep an office in los angeles : " if you have an office there then ... if you have n't brought in a film in a year , then why are you there ?
so at the end of the year you 're like , " shit , i gotta find a film . "
as the british / indian co-production ' slumdog millionaire ' showed last year , hollywood is no longer necessary to produce a major , internationally successful film .
but the efm 's panellists agreed that the success of that film was still an exception , rather than a rule – the old hollywood truism that american audiences are prepared to see one foreign film per year still holds .
hollywood is still the only force in the film industry with the infrastructure to distribute a major 200 million dollar production around the world .
and that is unlikely to change any time soon .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : dossier : the 60th berlin film festival opinion : berlin film festival should drop the fluff and aim higher films from war-torn regions set somber tone at berlinale berlinale reaches climax with awards ceremony german film ' jew suss ' booed at berlin film festival film -pipe- 20.02.2010 movie industry debate says hollywood is n't going anywhere großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : industry leaders asked whether hollywood had had its day industry leaders gathered at the european film market at this year 's berlinale to discuss the challenges facing the 21st century movie business .
the central question - is the era of the great hollywood studio over ? the european film market is the commercial arm of the berlin film festival .
held in tandem with the main event , the efm is an exchange floor for hundreds of potential movie deals - a forum where film producers compare ideas , struggling screenwriters try to bend the ears of high-powered executives , and where industry leaders look to the future and the challenges it holds .
one of the key issues this year was the global diversification of the entertainment industry , which is shaking up the way film deals are done around the world and threatening the dominance of the hollywood studio .
as more and more new hollywood movies are being financed , produced and shot outside the united states , film production companies are popping up like mushrooms all over the world , all serving the american audiences that make the us the biggest movie market in the world bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the efm debate was held parallel to the berlinale asian challenge but with cinema attendance sky-rocketing in places like china , and arab nations embarking on ambitious bids to build domestic film industries virtually from scratch , western producers will soon have to face the fact that the us is no longer the biggest market for movies .
the industry debate held at this year 's efm set out to answer the question whether this meant the beginning of the end for hollywood studio giants like fox , paramount and warner brothers ?
would a new model soon begin dominating the global film market ?
frederic sichler , an independent french film producer with close ties to the egyptian film business , had an unambiguous answer , for one simple reason – distribution .
" my answer is certainly not , " he said during the debate .
" there are two things to the us dominance : the control of distribution systems , and the production .
for any non-us company to have a distribution system in place that covers the world - i will not see it during my life , that 's for sure . "
instead , sichler predicts that a lot of very strong locally-focussed companies will emerge in places like china and india , where the demand for domestic movies is huge and expected to grow even more .
this will obviously have a major influence on the macro-economic picture , but sichler believes this will be evolutionary , not revolutionary .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : constantin produces and distributes major german movies like ' the baader meinhof complex ' keeping pace by diversifying no single company will rival fox , but a global network of companies will present strong alternatives .
" what has changed is that to produce international content , and to have a global distribution network , you do n't have only one model , which is to deal with the studio , " sichler said .
" you can assemble several partners all around the world which can ultimately deliver the same result . "
but christian grass , president of international production and acquisitions at universal pictures international , admitted that large us studios like his needed to keep pace with the global industry by diversifying along with it .
" speaking for universal , the idea is to be more active in the international market , and supplement the business that comes from the studio with more local and international productions , " he said .
european film production companies like germany 's constantin and the french studiocanal have also come to present a viable alternative to hollywood , if only in the european market .
ron halpern , responsible for international productions and acquisitions for studiocanal , says companies like his are large enough and better-placed to distribute films in europe 's three major markets : germany , britain and france .
" i think what 's interesting at studiocanal is because we are at-the-source distributors in these three territories , we can get feedback very early from three countries with pretty different points of view , " he told the debate .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ' slumdog millionaire ' was a rare example of an internationally-produced global hit in other words , being smaller and closer to the ground can mean that you are better at marketing and distributing a movie in a specific place .
after the debate , halpern told deutsche welle that this was exactly why studiocanal does not keep an office in los angeles : " if you have an office there then ... if you have n't brought in a film in a year , then why are you there ?
so at the end of the year you 're like , " shit , i gotta find a film . "
as the british / indian co-production ' slumdog millionaire ' showed last year , hollywood is no longer necessary to produce a major , internationally successful film .
but the efm 's panellists agreed that the success of that film was still an exception , rather than a rule – the old hollywood truism that american audiences are prepared to see one foreign film per year still holds .
hollywood is still the only force in the film industry with the infrastructure to distribute a major 200 million dollar production around the world .
and that is unlikely to change any time soon .

besides being expensive , they have been used as official cars by two relief organizations in germany .
this has sparked outrage among donors and aid workers . the director of treberhilfe , a berlin-based non-profit organization aiding the homeless , found himself in a bind this week trying to explain why he was driving a maserati quattroporte , a flashy italian sports sedan that starts at about 90,000 euros -lrb- $ 120,000 -rrb- . when asked about the car , ehlert 's response was that " a maserati is a car for a gentleman . "
he added that his organization " worked unconventionally , but was absolutely respectable . " ehlert , who has a predilection for fedoras , fine leather shoes and silk scarves , said it was important " to make a good impression on prospective donors . " treberhilfe 's website has since been shut down after angry donors flooded the portal with emails , calling ehlert " asocial " and pledging never to donate again . christine lehmacher-dubberke , the spokeswoman for diakonie emergency aid - the social service umbrella organization of the german protestant church that treberhilfe belongs to - said a maserati was " not a suitable company car " and buying one for that purpose was " morally reprehensible . " " mr. ehlert believes he needs the car , " she said .
" we see that differently . " police probe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schwarzer claims funds have been misappropriated meanwhile , police and state prosecutors are investigating claims of fraud and embezzlement at the berlin-based women 's relief group , hatun & can , after it surfaced that the organization was using a large , upscale , all-terrain vehicle as a company car . police have since confiscated a land rover and frozen most of the group 's bank accounts . the case came to light after alice schwarzer , a prominent german feminist and women 's magazine publisher , won 500,000 euros on the celebrity edition of the television game show " who wants to be a millionaire ? " last year .
she donated the prize money to hatun & can , but later filed charges against the group alleging fraud and misappropriation of funds . germany 's feminist number one said that her attempts to find out what her donation was being used for had landed on deaf ears and that she got only " short and vague answers . " the women 's organization rejected the allegations . " -lsb- schwarzer 's -rsb- accusations are legally absurd and her charges - a catastrophic mistake , " said hubert dreyling , a lawyer for hatun & can .
" -lsb- she -rsb- is being hypocritical and acting self-important . " the women 's aid group was named after 23-year-old hatun sürücü , who was gunned down in berlin by her brother in a so-called " honor killing " five years ago because her fundamentalist turkish-kurdish family strongly disapproved of her modern and " un-islamic " way of life . gb / dpa / epd editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

besides being expensive , they have been used as official cars by two relief organizations in germany .
this has sparked outrage among donors and aid workers . the director of treberhilfe , a berlin-based non-profit organization aiding the homeless , found himself in a bind this week trying to explain why he was driving a maserati quattroporte , a flashy italian sports sedan that starts at about 90,000 euros -lrb- $ 120,000 -rrb- . when asked about the car , ehlert 's response was that " a maserati is a car for a gentleman . "
he added that his organization " worked unconventionally , but was absolutely respectable . " ehlert , who has a predilection for fedoras , fine leather shoes and silk scarves , said it was important " to make a good impression on prospective donors . " treberhilfe 's website has since been shut down after angry donors flooded the portal with emails , calling ehlert " asocial " and pledging never to donate again . christine lehmacher-dubberke , the spokeswoman for diakonie emergency aid - the social service umbrella organization of the german protestant church that treberhilfe belongs to - said a maserati was " not a suitable company car " and buying one for that purpose was " morally reprehensible . " " mr. ehlert believes he needs the car , " she said .
" we see that differently . " police probe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schwarzer claims funds have been misappropriated meanwhile , police and state prosecutors are investigating claims of fraud and embezzlement at the berlin-based women 's relief group , hatun & can , after it surfaced that the organization was using a large , upscale , all-terrain vehicle as a company car . police have since confiscated a land rover and frozen most of the group 's bank accounts . the case came to light after alice schwarzer , a prominent german feminist and women 's magazine publisher , won 500,000 euros on the celebrity edition of the television game show " who wants to be a millionaire ? " last year .
she donated the prize money to hatun & can , but later filed charges against the group alleging fraud and misappropriation of funds . germany 's feminist number one said that her attempts to find out what her donation was being used for had landed on deaf ears and that she got only " short and vague answers . " the women 's organization rejected the allegations . " -lsb- schwarzer 's -rsb- accusations are legally absurd and her charges - a catastrophic mistake , " said hubert dreyling , a lawyer for hatun & can .
" -lsb- she -rsb- is being hypocritical and acting self-important . " the women 's aid group was named after 23-year-old hatun sürücü , who was gunned down in berlin by her brother in a so-called " honor killing " five years ago because her fundamentalist turkish-kurdish family strongly disapproved of her modern and " un-islamic " way of life . gb / dpa / epd editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the package is reportedly being cobbled together by the german government . the deal under consideration would see the 15 other euro zone countries issue 20-25 billion euros in aid in the form of loans and guarantees , weekly german newsmagazine der spiegel reported .
the report said each euro zone country 's contribution to the package would be calculated according to the proportion of capital each holds in the european central bank .
germany 's contribution would reportedly amount to around four billion euros and be handled by the state-owned development bank , the kfw .
the government of chancellor angela merkel has so far held off on committing any aid to greece over fears this would cause other troubled euro zone countries to go easy on reforms to their economies in the hope of also receiving bailout packages .
" crisis as a chance " greece is currently trying to rein in a deficit of 12.7 percent of gdp , more than four times the limit allowed by euro zone regulations .
the government of greek prime minister georgiou papandreou said it was aiming to reduce the deficit to below three percent by 2012 .
papandreou said he was confident this ambitious target could be met by clamping down on bribery and corruption .
" we need to understand the crisis as a chance to launch the necessary reforms , " he said in an interview for a separate report also to run in der spiegel on monday .

the central question - is the era of the great hollywood studio over ? the european film market is the commercial arm of the berlin film festival .
held in tandem with the main event , the efm is an exchange floor for hundreds of potential movie deals - a forum where film producers compare ideas , struggling screenwriters try to bend the ears of high-powered executives , and where industry leaders look to the future and the challenges it holds .
one of the key issues this year was the global diversification of the entertainment industry , which is shaking up the way film deals are done around the world and threatening the dominance of the hollywood studio .
as more and more new hollywood movies are being financed , produced and shot outside the united states , film production companies are popping up like mushrooms all over the world , all serving the american audiences that make the us the biggest movie market in the world bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the efm debate was held parallel to the berlinale asian challenge but with cinema attendance sky-rocketing in places like china , and arab nations embarking on ambitious bids to build domestic film industries virtually from scratch , western producers will soon have to face the fact that the us is no longer the biggest market for movies .
the industry debate held at this year 's efm set out to answer the question whether this meant the beginning of the end for hollywood studio giants like fox , paramount and warner brothers ?
would a new model soon begin dominating the global film market ?
frederic sichler , an independent french film producer with close ties to the egyptian film business , had an unambiguous answer , for one simple reason – distribution .
" my answer is certainly not , " he said during the debate .
" there are two things to the us dominance : the control of distribution systems , and the production .
for any non-us company to have a distribution system in place that covers the world - i will not see it during my life , that 's for sure . "
instead , sichler predicts that a lot of very strong locally-focussed companies will emerge in places like china and india , where the demand for domestic movies is huge and expected to grow even more .
this will obviously have a major influence on the macro-economic picture , but sichler believes this will be evolutionary , not revolutionary .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : constantin produces and distributes major german movies like ' the baader meinhof complex ' keeping pace by diversifying no single company will rival fox , but a global network of companies will present strong alternatives .
" what has changed is that to produce international content , and to have a global distribution network , you do n't have only one model , which is to deal with the studio , " sichler said .
" you can assemble several partners all around the world which can ultimately deliver the same result . "
but christian grass , president of international production and acquisitions at universal pictures international , admitted that large us studios like his needed to keep pace with the global industry by diversifying along with it .
" speaking for universal , the idea is to be more active in the international market , and supplement the business that comes from the studio with more local and international productions , " he said .
european film production companies like germany 's constantin and the french studiocanal have also come to present a viable alternative to hollywood , if only in the european market .
ron halpern , responsible for international productions and acquisitions for studiocanal , says companies like his are large enough and better-placed to distribute films in europe 's three major markets : germany , britain and france .
" i think what 's interesting at studiocanal is because we are at-the-source distributors in these three territories , we can get feedback very early from three countries with pretty different points of view , " he told the debate .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ' slumdog millionaire ' was a rare example of an internationally-produced global hit in other words , being smaller and closer to the ground can mean that you are better at marketing and distributing a movie in a specific place .
after the debate , halpern told deutsche welle that this was exactly why studiocanal does not keep an office in los angeles : " if you have an office there then ... if you have n't brought in a film in a year , then why are you there ?
so at the end of the year you 're like , " shit , i gotta find a film . "
as the british / indian co-production ' slumdog millionaire ' showed last year , hollywood is no longer necessary to produce a major , internationally successful film .
but the efm 's panellists agreed that the success of that film was still an exception , rather than a rule – the old hollywood truism that american audiences are prepared to see one foreign film per year still holds .
hollywood is still the only force in the film industry with the infrastructure to distribute a major 200 million dollar production around the world .
and that is unlikely to change any time soon .

after the debate , halpern told deutsche welle that this was exactly why studiocanal does not keep an office in los angeles : " if you have an office there then ... if you have n't brought in a film in a year , then why are you there ?
so at the end of the year you 're like , " shit , i gotta find a film . "
as the british / indian co-production ' slumdog millionaire ' showed last year , hollywood is no longer necessary to produce a major , internationally successful film .
but the efm 's panellists agreed that the success of that film was still an exception , rather than a rule – the old hollywood truism that american audiences are prepared to see one foreign film per year still holds .
hollywood is still the only force in the film industry with the infrastructure to distribute a major 200 million dollar production around the world .
and that is unlikely to change any time soon .

the judge ruled the party 's program to be xenophobic , racist , chauvinist , homophobic and anti-semitic . tomas vandas , the leader of the far-right czech workers ' party , told local television broadcasters that he intends to appeal against a court decision to outlaw his political group .
the supreme administrative court in brno outlawed the far-right party , describing it as xenophobic , racist , chauvinist , homophobic and anti-semitic , in a verdict broadcast live on national television .
" this ruling needs to be understood as a preventative one , to maintain the constitutional and democratic order in the future , " judge vojtech simicek said on wednesday .

" this ruling needs to be understood as a preventative one , to maintain the constitutional and democratic order in the future , " judge vojtech simicek said on wednesday .

but hoffenheim recovered to salvage a point .
the exciting , if somewhat scrappy match finished 2-2 . hoffenheim and borussia moenchengladbach played out a 2-2 draw in the bundesliga 's friday fixture .
the two sides delivered an exciting , offensive match , but it was also littered with mistakes .
hoffenheim started strong , but could n't take the lead in front of their home crowd ; demba ba , carlos eduardo , and vedad ibisevic all let excellent scoring chances go begging .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moenchengladbach took the lead through a controversial penalty however , a controversial handball by hoffenheim defender per nilsson led to the opening goal for moenchengladbach .
the referee decided to award a penalty , and showed nilsson the yellow card , although replays showed that the swede 's transgression actually took place outside the penalty area .
moenchengladbach 's belgian captain filip daems made no mistake from the spot and put his team ahead .
the visitors added another shortly after half time through israeli striker roberto colautti .
but in the last twenty minutes hoffenheim , having lost their way after their strong start , came back to life .
on 69 minutes , carlos eduardo carved through the moenchengladbach back line and provided vedad ibisevic with a chance that was just too good to turn down .
then , with just moments remaining , gladbach captain filip daems blocked a cross with his arm in the penalty area , conceding a penalty for the hosts .
carlos eduardo stepped up and slotted the ball home , rescuing the draw and a valuable bundesliga point for hoffenheim .
hoffenheim and moenchengladbach remain glued together in the mid-table , in ninth and tenth positions , with 28 points apiece .

the judge ruled the party 's program to be xenophobic , racist , chauvinist , homophobic and anti-semitic . tomas vandas , the leader of the far-right czech workers ' party , told local television broadcasters that he intends to appeal against a court decision to outlaw his political group .
the supreme administrative court in brno outlawed the far-right party , describing it as xenophobic , racist , chauvinist , homophobic and anti-semitic , in a verdict broadcast live on national television .
" this ruling needs to be understood as a preventative one , to maintain the constitutional and democratic order in the future , " judge vojtech simicek said on wednesday .
the court also said that the party , founded in 2003 , drew inspiration from the doctrines of the german nazi party and had links to openly white supremacist and racist groups .
the workers ' party is the first in the czech republic to be outlawed on the grounds of extremism .
the most recent regional examples of such a move date from before the fall of communist rule in 1989 .
the workers ' party , as part of its opposition to the process , called on its members to picket the courtroom and disrupt the decision , however , only about 50 of them showed up .
weakening the movement bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the court ruled that the party was influenced by hitler 's writing more mainstream political groups welcomed the decision , especially interior minister martin pecina , who filed the motion on behalf of cabinet .
" i said right from the very beginning that in a democratic society the battle against extremism never ends .
however , we can fight the manifestations of far-right activity , " pecina said in the courtroom in brno after the verdict .
pecina said that authorities faced a choice , either stamp these groups out as soon as they emerged , " or we can wait for police cars to be set on fire and petrol bombs to be thrown .
so i 'm convinced that we acted at the right moment , and that each step - like the one taken today - significantly weakens the neo-nazi movement . "
the workers ' party has garnered support from the relatively thin ranks of czech neo-nazis , but also appealed to some voters frustrated by social and ethnic tensions , especially in neighborhoods inhabited by the minority roma population .
the european roma rights center -lrb- errc -rrb- , a support group for the roma population , welcomed the decision , saying they hoped it would improve living conditions for roma people in the czech republic .
" more importantly , however , the czech authorities must act aggressively to prosecute workers ' party members and other individuals who committed crimes against the roma , " the errc 's rob kushen said. msh / reuters / dpa editor : holly fox send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

besides being expensive , they have been used as official cars by two relief organizations in germany .
this has sparked outrage among donors and aid workers . the director of treberhilfe , a berlin-based non-profit organization aiding the homeless , found himself in a bind this week trying to explain why he was driving a maserati quattroporte , a flashy italian sports sedan that starts at about 90,000 euros -lrb- $ 120,000 -rrb- . when asked about the car , ehlert 's response was that " a maserati is a car for a gentleman . "
he added that his organization " worked unconventionally , but was absolutely respectable . " ehlert , who has a predilection for fedoras , fine leather shoes and silk scarves , said it was important " to make a good impression on prospective donors . " treberhilfe 's website has since been shut down after angry donors flooded the portal with emails , calling ehlert " asocial " and pledging never to donate again . christine lehmacher-dubberke , the spokeswoman for diakonie emergency aid - the social service umbrella organization of the german protestant church that treberhilfe belongs to - said a maserati was " not a suitable company car " and buying one for that purpose was " morally reprehensible .

" last year .
she donated the prize money to hatun & can , but later filed charges against the group alleging fraud and misappropriation of funds . germany 's feminist number one said that her attempts to find out what her donation was being used for had landed on deaf ears and that she got only " short and vague answers .

the package is reportedly being cobbled together by the german government . the deal under consideration would see the 15 other euro zone countries issue 20-25 billion euros in aid in the form of loans and guarantees , weekly german newsmagazine der spiegel reported .
the report said each euro zone country 's contribution to the package would be calculated according to the proportion of capital each holds in the european central bank .
germany 's contribution would reportedly amount to around four billion euros and be handled by the state-owned development bank , the kfw .
the government of chancellor angela merkel has so far held off on committing any aid to greece over fears this would cause other troubled euro zone countries to go easy on reforms to their economies in the hope of also receiving bailout packages .
" crisis as a chance " greece is currently trying to rein in a deficit of 12.7 percent of gdp , more than four times the limit allowed by euro zone regulations .
the government of greek prime minister georgiou papandreou said it was aiming to reduce the deficit to below three percent by 2012 .
papandreou said he was confident this ambitious target could be met by clamping down on bribery and corruption .
" we need to understand the crisis as a chance to launch the necessary reforms , " he said in an interview for a separate report also to run in der spiegel on monday .

the judge ruled the party 's program to be xenophobic , racist , chauvinist , homophobic and anti-semitic . tomas vandas , the leader of the far-right czech workers ' party , told local television broadcasters that he intends to appeal against a court decision to outlaw his political group .
the supreme administrative court in brno outlawed the far-right party , describing it as xenophobic , racist , chauvinist , homophobic and anti-semitic , in a verdict broadcast live on national television .
" this ruling needs to be understood as a preventative one , to maintain the constitutional and democratic order in the future , " judge vojtech simicek said on wednesday .
the court also said that the party , founded in 2003 , drew inspiration from the doctrines of the german nazi party and had links to openly white supremacist and racist groups .
the workers ' party is the first in the czech republic to be outlawed on the grounds of extremism .
the most recent regional examples of such a move date from before the fall of communist rule in 1989 .
the workers ' party , as part of its opposition to the process , called on its members to picket the courtroom and disrupt the decision , however , only about 50 of them showed up .
weakening the movement bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the court ruled that the party was influenced by hitler 's writing more mainstream political groups welcomed the decision , especially interior minister martin pecina , who filed the motion on behalf of cabinet .
" i said right from the very beginning that in a democratic society the battle against extremism never ends .
however , we can fight the manifestations of far-right activity , " pecina said in the courtroom in brno after the verdict .
pecina said that authorities faced a choice , either stamp these groups out as soon as they emerged , " or we can wait for police cars to be set on fire and petrol bombs to be thrown .
so i 'm convinced that we acted at the right moment , and that each step - like the one taken today - significantly weakens the neo-nazi movement . "
the workers ' party has garnered support from the relatively thin ranks of czech neo-nazis , but also appealed to some voters frustrated by social and ethnic tensions , especially in neighborhoods inhabited by the minority roma population .
the european roma rights center -lrb- errc -rrb- , a support group for the roma population , welcomed the decision , saying they hoped it would improve living conditions for roma people in the czech republic .
" more importantly , however , the czech authorities must act aggressively to prosecute workers ' party members and other individuals who committed crimes against the roma , " the errc 's rob kushen said. msh / reuters / dpa editor : holly fox send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the judge ruled the party 's program to be xenophobic , racist , chauvinist , homophobic and anti-semitic . tomas vandas , the leader of the far-right czech workers ' party , told local television broadcasters that he intends to appeal against a court decision to outlaw his political group .
the supreme administrative court in brno outlawed the far-right party , describing it as xenophobic , racist , chauvinist , homophobic and anti-semitic , in a verdict broadcast live on national television .
" this ruling needs to be understood as a preventative one , to maintain the constitutional and democratic order in the future , " judge vojtech simicek said on wednesday .
the court also said that the party , founded in 2003 , drew inspiration from the doctrines of the german nazi party and had links to openly white supremacist and racist groups .
the workers ' party is the first in the czech republic to be outlawed on the grounds of extremism .
the most recent regional examples of such a move date from before the fall of communist rule in 1989 .
the workers ' party , as part of its opposition to the process , called on its members to picket the courtroom and disrupt the decision , however , only about 50 of them showed up .
weakening the movement bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the court ruled that the party was influenced by hitler 's writing more mainstream political groups welcomed the decision , especially interior minister martin pecina , who filed the motion on behalf of cabinet .
" i said right from the very beginning that in a democratic society the battle against extremism never ends .
however , we can fight the manifestations of far-right activity , " pecina said in the courtroom in brno after the verdict .
pecina said that authorities faced a choice , either stamp these groups out as soon as they emerged , " or we can wait for police cars to be set on fire and petrol bombs to be thrown .
so i 'm convinced that we acted at the right moment , and that each step - like the one taken today - significantly weakens the neo-nazi movement . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : dossier : the 60th berlin film festival opinion : berlin film festival should drop the fluff and aim higher films from war-torn regions set somber tone at berlinale berlinale reaches climax with awards ceremony german film ' jew suss ' booed at berlin film festival film -pipe- 20.02.2010 movie industry debate says hollywood is n't going anywhere großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : industry leaders asked whether hollywood had had its day industry leaders gathered at the european film market at this year 's berlinale to discuss the challenges facing the 21st century movie business .
the central question - is the era of the great hollywood studio over ? the european film market is the commercial arm of the berlin film festival .
held in tandem with the main event , the efm is an exchange floor for hundreds of potential movie deals - a forum where film producers compare ideas , struggling screenwriters try to bend the ears of high-powered executives , and where industry leaders look to the future and the challenges it holds .
one of the key issues this year was the global diversification of the entertainment industry , which is shaking up the way film deals are done around the world and threatening the dominance of the hollywood studio .
as more and more new hollywood movies are being financed , produced and shot outside the united states , film production companies are popping up like mushrooms all over the world , all serving the american audiences that make the us the biggest movie market in the world bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the efm debate was held parallel to the berlinale asian challenge but with cinema attendance sky-rocketing in places like china , and arab nations embarking on ambitious bids to build domestic film industries virtually from scratch , western producers will soon have to face the fact that the us is no longer the biggest market for movies .
the industry debate held at this year 's efm set out to answer the question whether this meant the beginning of the end for hollywood studio giants like fox , paramount and warner brothers ?
would a new model soon begin dominating the global film market ?
frederic sichler , an independent french film producer with close ties to the egyptian film business , had an unambiguous answer , for one simple reason – distribution .
" my answer is certainly not , " he said during the debate .
" there are two things to the us dominance : the control of distribution systems , and the production .
for any non-us company to have a distribution system in place that covers the world - i will not see it during my life , that 's for sure . "
instead , sichler predicts that a lot of very strong locally-focussed companies will emerge in places like china and india , where the demand for domestic movies is huge and expected to grow even more .
this will obviously have a major influence on the macro-economic picture , but sichler believes this will be evolutionary , not revolutionary .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : constantin produces and distributes major german movies like ' the baader meinhof complex ' keeping pace by diversifying no single company will rival fox , but a global network of companies will present strong alternatives .
" what has changed is that to produce international content , and to have a global distribution network , you do n't have only one model , which is to deal with the studio , " sichler said .
" you can assemble several partners all around the world which can ultimately deliver the same result . "
but christian grass , president of international production and acquisitions at universal pictures international , admitted that large us studios like his needed to keep pace with the global industry by diversifying along with it .
" speaking for universal , the idea is to be more active in the international market , and supplement the business that comes from the studio with more local and international productions , " he said .
european film production companies like germany 's constantin and the french studiocanal have also come to present a viable alternative to hollywood , if only in the european market .
ron halpern , responsible for international productions and acquisitions for studiocanal , says companies like his are large enough and better-placed to distribute films in europe 's three major markets : germany , britain and france .
" i think what 's interesting at studiocanal is because we are at-the-source distributors in these three territories , we can get feedback very early from three countries with pretty different points of view , " he told the debate .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ' slumdog millionaire ' was a rare example of an internationally-produced global hit in other words , being smaller and closer to the ground can mean that you are better at marketing and distributing a movie in a specific place .
after the debate , halpern told deutsche welle that this was exactly why studiocanal does not keep an office in los angeles : " if you have an office there then ... if you have n't brought in a film in a year , then why are you there ?
so at the end of the year you 're like , " shit , i gotta find a film . "
as the british / indian co-production ' slumdog millionaire ' showed last year , hollywood is no longer necessary to produce a major , internationally successful film .
but the efm 's panellists agreed that the success of that film was still an exception , rather than a rule – the old hollywood truism that american audiences are prepared to see one foreign film per year still holds .
hollywood is still the only force in the film industry with the infrastructure to distribute a major 200 million dollar production around the world .
and that is unlikely to change any time soon .

the package is reportedly being cobbled together by the german government . the deal under consideration would see the 15 other euro zone countries issue 20-25 billion euros in aid in the form of loans and guarantees , weekly german newsmagazine der spiegel reported .
the report said each euro zone country 's contribution to the package would be calculated according to the proportion of capital each holds in the european central bank .
germany 's contribution would reportedly amount to around four billion euros and be handled by the state-owned development bank , the kfw .
the government of chancellor angela merkel has so far held off on committing any aid to greece over fears this would cause other troubled euro zone countries to go easy on reforms to their economies in the hope of also receiving bailout packages .
" crisis as a chance " greece is currently trying to rein in a deficit of 12.7 percent of gdp , more than four times the limit allowed by euro zone regulations .
the government of greek prime minister georgiou papandreou said it was aiming to reduce the deficit to below three percent by 2012 .
papandreou said he was confident this ambitious target could be met by clamping down on bribery and corruption .

the package is reportedly being cobbled together by the german government . the deal under consideration would see the 15 other euro zone countries issue 20-25 billion euros in aid in the form of loans and guarantees , weekly german newsmagazine der spiegel reported .
the report said each euro zone country 's contribution to the package would be calculated according to the proportion of capital each holds in the european central bank .
germany 's contribution would reportedly amount to around four billion euros and be handled by the state-owned development bank , the kfw .
the government of chancellor angela merkel has so far held off on committing any aid to greece over fears this would cause other troubled euro zone countries to go easy on reforms to their economies in the hope of also receiving bailout packages .
" crisis as a chance " greece is currently trying to rein in a deficit of 12.7 percent of gdp , more than four times the limit allowed by euro zone regulations .
the government of greek prime minister georgiou papandreou said it was aiming to reduce the deficit to below three percent by 2012 .
papandreou said he was confident this ambitious target could be met by clamping down on bribery and corruption .
" we need to understand the crisis as a chance to launch the necessary reforms , " he said in an interview for a separate report also to run in der spiegel on monday .

the central question - is the era of the great hollywood studio over ? the european film market is the commercial arm of the berlin film festival .
held in tandem with the main event , the efm is an exchange floor for hundreds of potential movie deals - a forum where film producers compare ideas , struggling screenwriters try to bend the ears of high-powered executives , and where industry leaders look to the future and the challenges it holds .
one of the key issues this year was the global diversification of the entertainment industry , which is shaking up the way film deals are done around the world and threatening the dominance of the hollywood studio .
as more and more new hollywood movies are being financed , produced and shot outside the united states , film production companies are popping up like mushrooms all over the world , all serving the american audiences that make the us the biggest movie market in the world bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the efm debate was held parallel to the berlinale asian challenge but with cinema attendance sky-rocketing in places like china , and arab nations embarking on ambitious bids to build domestic film industries virtually from scratch , western producers will soon have to face the fact that the us is no longer the biggest market for movies .
the industry debate held at this year 's efm set out to answer the question whether this meant the beginning of the end for hollywood studio giants like fox , paramount and warner brothers ?
would a new model soon begin dominating the global film market ?
frederic sichler , an independent french film producer with close ties to the egyptian film business , had an unambiguous answer , for one simple reason – distribution .
" my answer is certainly not , " he said during the debate .
" there are two things to the us dominance : the control of distribution systems , and the production .
for any non-us company to have a distribution system in place that covers the world - i will not see it during my life , that 's for sure . "
instead , sichler predicts that a lot of very strong locally-focussed companies will emerge in places like china and india , where the demand for domestic movies is huge and expected to grow even more .
this will obviously have a major influence on the macro-economic picture , but sichler believes this will be evolutionary , not revolutionary .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : constantin produces and distributes major german movies like ' the baader meinhof complex ' keeping pace by diversifying no single company will rival fox , but a global network of companies will present strong alternatives .
" what has changed is that to produce international content , and to have a global distribution network , you do n't have only one model , which is to deal with the studio , " sichler said .
" you can assemble several partners all around the world which can ultimately deliver the same result . "
but christian grass , president of international production and acquisitions at universal pictures international , admitted that large us studios like his needed to keep pace with the global industry by diversifying along with it .
" speaking for universal , the idea is to be more active in the international market , and supplement the business that comes from the studio with more local and international productions , " he said .
european film production companies like germany 's constantin and the french studiocanal have also come to present a viable alternative to hollywood , if only in the european market .
ron halpern , responsible for international productions and acquisitions for studiocanal , says companies like his are large enough and better-placed to distribute films in europe 's three major markets : germany , britain and france .
" i think what 's interesting at studiocanal is because we are at-the-source distributors in these three territories , we can get feedback very early from three countries with pretty different points of view , " he told the debate .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ' slumdog millionaire ' was a rare example of an internationally-produced global hit in other words , being smaller and closer to the ground can mean that you are better at marketing and distributing a movie in a specific place .
after the debate , halpern told deutsche welle that this was exactly why studiocanal does not keep an office in los angeles : " if you have an office there then ... if you have n't brought in a film in a year , then why are you there ?
so at the end of the year you 're like , " shit , i gotta find a film . "
as the british / indian co-production ' slumdog millionaire ' showed last year , hollywood is no longer necessary to produce a major , internationally successful film .
but the efm 's panellists agreed that the success of that film was still an exception , rather than a rule – the old hollywood truism that american audiences are prepared to see one foreign film per year still holds .
hollywood is still the only force in the film industry with the infrastructure to distribute a major 200 million dollar production around the world .
and that is unlikely to change any time soon .

the package is reportedly being cobbled together by the german government . the deal under consideration would see the 15 other euro zone countries issue 20-25 billion euros in aid in the form of loans and guarantees , weekly german newsmagazine der spiegel reported .
the report said each euro zone country 's contribution to the package would be calculated according to the proportion of capital each holds in the european central bank .
germany 's contribution would reportedly amount to around four billion euros and be handled by the state-owned development bank , the kfw .

the government of greek prime minister georgiou papandreou said it was aiming to reduce the deficit to below three percent by 2012 .
papandreou said he was confident this ambitious target could be met by clamping down on bribery and corruption .

the judge ruled the party 's program to be xenophobic , racist , chauvinist , homophobic and anti-semitic . tomas vandas , the leader of the far-right czech workers ' party , told local television broadcasters that he intends to appeal against a court decision to outlaw his political group .
the supreme administrative court in brno outlawed the far-right party , describing it as xenophobic , racist , chauvinist , homophobic and anti-semitic , in a verdict broadcast live on national television .
" this ruling needs to be understood as a preventative one , to maintain the constitutional and democratic order in the future , " judge vojtech simicek said on wednesday .
the court also said that the party , founded in 2003 , drew inspiration from the doctrines of the german nazi party and had links to openly white supremacist and racist groups .
the workers ' party is the first in the czech republic to be outlawed on the grounds of extremism .
the most recent regional examples of such a move date from before the fall of communist rule in 1989 .
the workers ' party , as part of its opposition to the process , called on its members to picket the courtroom and disrupt the decision , however , only about 50 of them showed up .
weakening the movement bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the court ruled that the party was influenced by hitler 's writing more mainstream political groups welcomed the decision , especially interior minister martin pecina , who filed the motion on behalf of cabinet .
" i said right from the very beginning that in a democratic society the battle against extremism never ends .
however , we can fight the manifestations of far-right activity , " pecina said in the courtroom in brno after the verdict .
pecina said that authorities faced a choice , either stamp these groups out as soon as they emerged , " or we can wait for police cars to be set on fire and petrol bombs to be thrown .
so i 'm convinced that we acted at the right moment , and that each step - like the one taken today - significantly weakens the neo-nazi movement . "
the workers ' party has garnered support from the relatively thin ranks of czech neo-nazis , but also appealed to some voters frustrated by social and ethnic tensions , especially in neighborhoods inhabited by the minority roma population .
the european roma rights center -lrb- errc -rrb- , a support group for the roma population , welcomed the decision , saying they hoped it would improve living conditions for roma people in the czech republic .
" more importantly , however , the czech authorities must act aggressively to prosecute workers ' party members and other individuals who committed crimes against the roma , " the errc 's rob kushen said. msh / reuters / dpa editor : holly fox send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we put down our guns in gaza , instead we took microphones in our hands , " raps the palestinian group darg team in one of their songs .
swiss documentary director nicolas wadimoff met the rappers in 2009 , a month after the end of the israeli military attack on gaza . living on after the worst has happened bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " you could find the same stories in haiti or rwanda , " said filmmaker nicolas wadimoff his documentary " still alive in gaza " -lrb- " aisheen " -rrb- focuses on a region that has suffered war and destruction for decades .
without allocating blame to either side , " still alive in gaza " shows what life is like in the aftermath of a disaster .
the film presents people who do n't give up amid grief , despair and destruction . " it is about being human , " wadimoff said .
" what i filmed in gaza - you can see the same things in haiti , bosnia or rwanda .
after going through the worst , people want to live . " that is also the case in the small town of burros , northwest of ramallah .
the local people simply wanted to continue leading their lives like their ancestors had for many generations .
but in 2003 , the israeli government decided to build a security barrier between the west bank and israel .
the fence was to cut right through the village of budrus , and across the fields that provided the livelihoods of the local farmers . the non-violent protests organized by budrus village leader ayed morrar and his daughter iltezam against the measure made international headlines .
local men , women and children as well as members of the rivalling palestinian organizations hamas and fatah and various international and israeli peace activists participated . finding common ground bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the isreali fence cuts through fields and villages in the west bank for five years , american documentary filmmaker julia bacha followed the developments in budrus with her camera .
her film addresses many controversial issues and neither refrains from showing the aggressive reactions of israeli soldiers to the protests nor the moments when palestinian protesters and israelis start to find common ground . " i visited my father in prison many times , and all the israelis i met there were very , very bad , " 15-year-old iltezam said in the film .
" but now i know that not all the israelis are the same .
some of them think that we should live together in peace . " many films at this year 's berlin film festival take a multilayered approach in presenting ways of coping with conflict .
and it 's not about nostalgia or cloying sentimentality , but about critically analyzing the situation .
coming to terms with the past is meant to help understand the present better - in order to be able to shape the future constructively . ' violence is no solution ' " our film wants to show that violence is no solution , " said iraqi director mohamed al-daradji . his film " son of babylon " is set in iraq , a few weeks after the fall of saddam hussein ’ s regime .
ahmed , a bright 12-year-old kurdish boy , sets off with his grandmother in search of his father who was arrested by saddam 's republican guard at the end of the gulf war .
as they travel along bombed out desert tracks they encounter others with similar quests , searching for a new beginning . " son of babylon " was shot on location in iraq and relies on a cast of nonprofessional actors .
the female lead is played by a kurd , shezad hussen , the only female witness to testify during the trial against saddam hussein . during saddam 's regime , hundreds of thousands of civilians were killed , thousands of kurdish villages destroyed and more than 1.5 million kurds were forced to flee their homes in northern iraq . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : searching for a new beginning in a country ravaged by terror " i hope that in the future we will speak three languages in iraq : arabic , kurdish and turkmen , " al-daradji said . in the film , the boy 's journey ends at the recently uncovered mass graves from the time of saddam hussein 's regime .
yet al-daradji , like other filmmakers at this year ’ s festival show that even though the past is still very present , in a place ravaged by war , dignity and understanding are also possible . author : silke bartlick -lrb- ara -rrb- editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the central question - is the era of the great hollywood studio over ? the european film market is the commercial arm of the berlin film festival .
held in tandem with the main event , the efm is an exchange floor for hundreds of potential movie deals - a forum where film producers compare ideas , struggling screenwriters try to bend the ears of high-powered executives , and where industry leaders look to the future and the challenges it holds .
one of the key issues this year was the global diversification of the entertainment industry , which is shaking up the way film deals are done around the world and threatening the dominance of the hollywood studio .
as more and more new hollywood movies are being financed , produced and shot outside the united states , film production companies are popping up like mushrooms all over the world , all serving the american audiences that make the us the biggest movie market in the world bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the efm debate was held parallel to the berlinale asian challenge but with cinema attendance sky-rocketing in places like china , and arab nations embarking on ambitious bids to build domestic film industries virtually from scratch , western producers will soon have to face the fact that the us is no longer the biggest market for movies .
the industry debate held at this year 's efm set out to answer the question whether this meant the beginning of the end for hollywood studio giants like fox , paramount and warner brothers ?
would a new model soon begin dominating the global film market ?
frederic sichler , an independent french film producer with close ties to the egyptian film business , had an unambiguous answer , for one simple reason – distribution .
" my answer is certainly not , " he said during the debate .
" there are two things to the us dominance : the control of distribution systems , and the production .
for any non-us company to have a distribution system in place that covers the world - i will not see it during my life , that 's for sure . "
instead , sichler predicts that a lot of very strong locally-focussed companies will emerge in places like china and india , where the demand for domestic movies is huge and expected to grow even more .
this will obviously have a major influence on the macro-economic picture , but sichler believes this will be evolutionary , not revolutionary .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : constantin produces and distributes major german movies like ' the baader meinhof complex ' keeping pace by diversifying no single company will rival fox , but a global network of companies will present strong alternatives .
" what has changed is that to produce international content , and to have a global distribution network , you do n't have only one model , which is to deal with the studio , " sichler said .
" you can assemble several partners all around the world which can ultimately deliver the same result . "
but christian grass , president of international production and acquisitions at universal pictures international , admitted that large us studios like his needed to keep pace with the global industry by diversifying along with it .
" speaking for universal , the idea is to be more active in the international market , and supplement the business that comes from the studio with more local and international productions , " he said .
european film production companies like germany 's constantin and the french studiocanal have also come to present a viable alternative to hollywood , if only in the european market .
ron halpern , responsible for international productions and acquisitions for studiocanal , says companies like his are large enough and better-placed to distribute films in europe 's three major markets : germany , britain and france .
" i think what 's interesting at studiocanal is because we are at-the-source distributors in these three territories , we can get feedback very early from three countries with pretty different points of view , " he told the debate .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ' slumdog millionaire ' was a rare example of an internationally-produced global hit in other words , being smaller and closer to the ground can mean that you are better at marketing and distributing a movie in a specific place .
after the debate , halpern told deutsche welle that this was exactly why studiocanal does not keep an office in los angeles : " if you have an office there then ... if you have n't brought in a film in a year , then why are you there ?
so at the end of the year you 're like , " shit , i gotta find a film . "
as the british / indian co-production ' slumdog millionaire ' showed last year , hollywood is no longer necessary to produce a major , internationally successful film .
but the efm 's panellists agreed that the success of that film was still an exception , rather than a rule – the old hollywood truism that american audiences are prepared to see one foreign film per year still holds .
hollywood is still the only force in the film industry with the infrastructure to distribute a major 200 million dollar production around the world .
and that is unlikely to change any time soon .

the central question - is the era of the great hollywood studio over ? the european film market is the commercial arm of the berlin film festival .
held in tandem with the main event , the efm is an exchange floor for hundreds of potential movie deals - a forum where film producers compare ideas , struggling screenwriters try to bend the ears of high-powered executives , and where industry leaders look to the future and the challenges it holds .
one of the key issues this year was the global diversification of the entertainment industry , which is shaking up the way film deals are done around the world and threatening the dominance of the hollywood studio .
as more and more new hollywood movies are being financed , produced and shot outside the united states , film production companies are popping up like mushrooms all over the world , all serving the american audiences that make the us the biggest movie market in the world bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the efm debate was held parallel to the berlinale asian challenge but with cinema attendance sky-rocketing in places like china , and arab nations embarking on ambitious bids to build domestic film industries virtually from scratch , western producers will soon have to face the fact that the us is no longer the biggest market for movies .
the industry debate held at this year 's efm set out to answer the question whether this meant the beginning of the end for hollywood studio giants like fox , paramount and warner brothers ?
would a new model soon begin dominating the global film market ?
frederic sichler , an independent french film producer with close ties to the egyptian film business , had an unambiguous answer , for one simple reason – distribution .
" my answer is certainly not , " he said during the debate .
" there are two things to the us dominance : the control of distribution systems , and the production .
for any non-us company to have a distribution system in place that covers the world - i will not see it during my life , that 's for sure . "
instead , sichler predicts that a lot of very strong locally-focussed companies will emerge in places like china and india , where the demand for domestic movies is huge and expected to grow even more .
this will obviously have a major influence on the macro-economic picture , but sichler believes this will be evolutionary , not revolutionary .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : constantin produces and distributes major german movies like ' the baader meinhof complex ' keeping pace by diversifying no single company will rival fox , but a global network of companies will present strong alternatives .
" what has changed is that to produce international content , and to have a global distribution network , you do n't have only one model , which is to deal with the studio , " sichler said .
" you can assemble several partners all around the world which can ultimately deliver the same result . "
but christian grass , president of international production and acquisitions at universal pictures international , admitted that large us studios like his needed to keep pace with the global industry by diversifying along with it .
" speaking for universal , the idea is to be more active in the international market , and supplement the business that comes from the studio with more local and international productions , " he said .
european film production companies like germany 's constantin and the french studiocanal have also come to present a viable alternative to hollywood , if only in the european market .
ron halpern , responsible for international productions and acquisitions for studiocanal , says companies like his are large enough and better-placed to distribute films in europe 's three major markets : germany , britain and france .
" i think what 's interesting at studiocanal is because we are at-the-source distributors in these three territories , we can get feedback very early from three countries with pretty different points of view , " he told the debate .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ' slumdog millionaire ' was a rare example of an internationally-produced global hit in other words , being smaller and closer to the ground can mean that you are better at marketing and distributing a movie in a specific place .
after the debate , halpern told deutsche welle that this was exactly why studiocanal does not keep an office in los angeles : " if you have an office there then ... if you have n't brought in a film in a year , then why are you there ?
so at the end of the year you 're like , " shit , i gotta find a film . "
as the british / indian co-production ' slumdog millionaire ' showed last year , hollywood is no longer necessary to produce a major , internationally successful film .
but the efm 's panellists agreed that the success of that film was still an exception , rather than a rule – the old hollywood truism that american audiences are prepared to see one foreign film per year still holds .
hollywood is still the only force in the film industry with the infrastructure to distribute a major 200 million dollar production around the world .
and that is unlikely to change any time soon .

" we put down our guns in gaza , instead we took microphones in our hands , " raps the palestinian group darg team in one of their songs .
swiss documentary director nicolas wadimoff met the rappers in 2009 , a month after the end of the israeli military attack on gaza . living on after the worst has happened bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " you could find the same stories in haiti or rwanda , " said filmmaker nicolas wadimoff his documentary " still alive in gaza " -lrb- " aisheen " -rrb- focuses on a region that has suffered war and destruction for decades .
without allocating blame to either side , " still alive in gaza " shows what life is like in the aftermath of a disaster .
the film presents people who do n't give up amid grief , despair and destruction . " it is about being human , " wadimoff said .
" what i filmed in gaza - you can see the same things in haiti , bosnia or rwanda .
after going through the worst , people want to live . " that is also the case in the small town of burros , northwest of ramallah .
the local people simply wanted to continue leading their lives like their ancestors had for many generations .
but in 2003 , the israeli government decided to build a security barrier between the west bank and israel .
the fence was to cut right through the village of budrus , and across the fields that provided the livelihoods of the local farmers . the non-violent protests organized by budrus village leader ayed morrar and his daughter iltezam against the measure made international headlines .
local men , women and children as well as members of the rivalling palestinian organizations hamas and fatah and various international and israeli peace activists participated . finding common ground bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the isreali fence cuts through fields and villages in the west bank for five years , american documentary filmmaker julia bacha followed the developments in budrus with her camera .
her film addresses many controversial issues and neither refrains from showing the aggressive reactions of israeli soldiers to the protests nor the moments when palestinian protesters and israelis start to find common ground . " i visited my father in prison many times , and all the israelis i met there were very , very bad , " 15-year-old iltezam said in the film .
" but now i know that not all the israelis are the same .
some of them think that we should live together in peace . " many films at this year 's berlin film festival take a multilayered approach in presenting ways of coping with conflict .
and it 's not about nostalgia or cloying sentimentality , but about critically analyzing the situation .
coming to terms with the past is meant to help understand the present better - in order to be able to shape the future constructively . ' violence is no solution ' " our film wants to show that violence is no solution , " said iraqi director mohamed al-daradji . his film " son of babylon " is set in iraq , a few weeks after the fall of saddam hussein ’ s regime .
ahmed , a bright 12-year-old kurdish boy , sets off with his grandmother in search of his father who was arrested by saddam 's republican guard at the end of the gulf war .
as they travel along bombed out desert tracks they encounter others with similar quests , searching for a new beginning . " son of babylon " was shot on location in iraq and relies on a cast of nonprofessional actors .
the female lead is played by a kurd , shezad hussen , the only female witness to testify during the trial against saddam hussein . during saddam 's regime , hundreds of thousands of civilians were killed , thousands of kurdish villages destroyed and more than 1.5 million kurds were forced to flee their homes in northern iraq . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : searching for a new beginning in a country ravaged by terror " i hope that in the future we will speak three languages in iraq : arabic , kurdish and turkmen , " al-daradji said . in the film , the boy 's journey ends at the recently uncovered mass graves from the time of saddam hussein 's regime .
yet al-daradji , like other filmmakers at this year ’ s festival show that even though the past is still very present , in a place ravaged by war , dignity and understanding are also possible . author : silke bartlick -lrb- ara -rrb- editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but hoffenheim recovered to salvage a point .
the exciting , if somewhat scrappy match finished 2-2 . hoffenheim and borussia moenchengladbach played out a 2-2 draw in the bundesliga 's friday fixture .
the two sides delivered an exciting , offensive match , but it was also littered with mistakes .
hoffenheim started strong , but could n't take the lead in front of their home crowd ; demba ba , carlos eduardo , and vedad ibisevic all let excellent scoring chances go begging .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moenchengladbach took the lead through a controversial penalty however , a controversial handball by hoffenheim defender per nilsson led to the opening goal for moenchengladbach .
the referee decided to award a penalty , and showed nilsson the yellow card , although replays showed that the swede 's transgression actually took place outside the penalty area .
moenchengladbach 's belgian captain filip daems made no mistake from the spot and put his team ahead .
the visitors added another shortly after half time through israeli striker roberto colautti .
but in the last twenty minutes hoffenheim , having lost their way after their strong start , came back to life .
on 69 minutes , carlos eduardo carved through the moenchengladbach back line and provided vedad ibisevic with a chance that was just too good to turn down .
then , with just moments remaining , gladbach captain filip daems blocked a cross with his arm in the penalty area , conceding a penalty for the hosts .
carlos eduardo stepped up and slotted the ball home , rescuing the draw and a valuable bundesliga point for hoffenheim .
hoffenheim and moenchengladbach remain glued together in the mid-table , in ninth and tenth positions , with 28 points apiece .

frederic sichler , an independent french film producer with close ties to the egyptian film business , had an unambiguous answer , for one simple reason – distribution .
" my answer is certainly not , " he said during the debate .
" there are two things to the us dominance : the control of distribution systems , and the production .
for any non-us company to have a distribution system in place that covers the world - i will not see it during my life , that 's for sure . "
instead , sichler predicts that a lot of very strong locally-focussed companies will emerge in places like china and india , where the demand for domestic movies is huge and expected to grow even more .
this will obviously have a major influence on the macro-economic picture , but sichler believes this will be evolutionary , not revolutionary .

but christian grass , president of international production and acquisitions at universal pictures international , admitted that large us studios like his needed to keep pace with the global industry by diversifying along with it .
" speaking for universal , the idea is to be more active in the international market , and supplement the business that comes from the studio with more local and international productions , " he said .
european film production companies like germany 's constantin and the french studiocanal have also come to present a viable alternative to hollywood , if only in the european market .
ron halpern , responsible for international productions and acquisitions for studiocanal , says companies like his are large enough and better-placed to distribute films in europe 's three major markets : germany , britain and france .
" i think what 's interesting at studiocanal is because we are at-the-source distributors in these three territories , we can get feedback very early from three countries with pretty different points of view , " he told the debate .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ' slumdog millionaire ' was a rare example of an internationally-produced global hit in other words , being smaller and closer to the ground can mean that you are better at marketing and distributing a movie in a specific place .

so at the end of the year you 're like , " shit , i gotta find a film . "
as the british / indian co-production ' slumdog millionaire ' showed last year , hollywood is no longer necessary to produce a major , internationally successful film .
but the efm 's panellists agreed that the success of that film was still an exception , rather than a rule – the old hollywood truism that american audiences are prepared to see one foreign film per year still holds .
hollywood is still the only force in the film industry with the infrastructure to distribute a major 200 million dollar production around the world .
and that is unlikely to change any time soon .

" we put down our guns in gaza , instead we took microphones in our hands , " raps the palestinian group darg team in one of their songs .
swiss documentary director nicolas wadimoff met the rappers in 2009 , a month after the end of the israeli military attack on gaza . living on after the worst has happened bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " you could find the same stories in haiti or rwanda , " said filmmaker nicolas wadimoff his documentary " still alive in gaza " -lrb- " aisheen " -rrb- focuses on a region that has suffered war and destruction for decades .
without allocating blame to either side , " still alive in gaza " shows what life is like in the aftermath of a disaster .
the film presents people who do n't give up amid grief , despair and destruction . " it is about being human , " wadimoff said .
" what i filmed in gaza - you can see the same things in haiti , bosnia or rwanda .
after going through the worst , people want to live . " that is also the case in the small town of burros , northwest of ramallah .
the local people simply wanted to continue leading their lives like their ancestors had for many generations .
but in 2003 , the israeli government decided to build a security barrier between the west bank and israel .
the fence was to cut right through the village of budrus , and across the fields that provided the livelihoods of the local farmers . the non-violent protests organized by budrus village leader ayed morrar and his daughter iltezam against the measure made international headlines .
local men , women and children as well as members of the rivalling palestinian organizations hamas and fatah and various international and israeli peace activists participated . finding common ground bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the isreali fence cuts through fields and villages in the west bank for five years , american documentary filmmaker julia bacha followed the developments in budrus with her camera .
her film addresses many controversial issues and neither refrains from showing the aggressive reactions of israeli soldiers to the protests nor the moments when palestinian protesters and israelis start to find common ground . " i visited my father in prison many times , and all the israelis i met there were very , very bad , " 15-year-old iltezam said in the film .
" but now i know that not all the israelis are the same .
some of them think that we should live together in peace . " many films at this year 's berlin film festival take a multilayered approach in presenting ways of coping with conflict .
and it 's not about nostalgia or cloying sentimentality , but about critically analyzing the situation .
coming to terms with the past is meant to help understand the present better - in order to be able to shape the future constructively . ' violence is no solution ' " our film wants to show that violence is no solution , " said iraqi director mohamed al-daradji . his film " son of babylon " is set in iraq , a few weeks after the fall of saddam hussein ’ s regime .
ahmed , a bright 12-year-old kurdish boy , sets off with his grandmother in search of his father who was arrested by saddam 's republican guard at the end of the gulf war .
as they travel along bombed out desert tracks they encounter others with similar quests , searching for a new beginning . " son of babylon " was shot on location in iraq and relies on a cast of nonprofessional actors .
the female lead is played by a kurd , shezad hussen , the only female witness to testify during the trial against saddam hussein . during saddam 's regime , hundreds of thousands of civilians were killed , thousands of kurdish villages destroyed and more than 1.5 million kurds were forced to flee their homes in northern iraq . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : searching for a new beginning in a country ravaged by terror " i hope that in the future we will speak three languages in iraq : arabic , kurdish and turkmen , " al-daradji said . in the film , the boy 's journey ends at the recently uncovered mass graves from the time of saddam hussein 's regime .

the judge ruled the party 's program to be xenophobic , racist , chauvinist , homophobic and anti-semitic . tomas vandas , the leader of the far-right czech workers ' party , told local television broadcasters that he intends to appeal against a court decision to outlaw his political group .
the supreme administrative court in brno outlawed the far-right party , describing it as xenophobic , racist , chauvinist , homophobic and anti-semitic , in a verdict broadcast live on national television .
" this ruling needs to be understood as a preventative one , to maintain the constitutional and democratic order in the future , " judge vojtech simicek said on wednesday .
the court also said that the party , founded in 2003 , drew inspiration from the doctrines of the german nazi party and had links to openly white supremacist and racist groups .
the workers ' party is the first in the czech republic to be outlawed on the grounds of extremism .
the most recent regional examples of such a move date from before the fall of communist rule in 1989 .
the workers ' party , as part of its opposition to the process , called on its members to picket the courtroom and disrupt the decision , however , only about 50 of them showed up .
weakening the movement bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the court ruled that the party was influenced by hitler 's writing more mainstream political groups welcomed the decision , especially interior minister martin pecina , who filed the motion on behalf of cabinet .
" i said right from the very beginning that in a democratic society the battle against extremism never ends .
however , we can fight the manifestations of far-right activity , " pecina said in the courtroom in brno after the verdict .
pecina said that authorities faced a choice , either stamp these groups out as soon as they emerged , " or we can wait for police cars to be set on fire and petrol bombs to be thrown .
so i 'm convinced that we acted at the right moment , and that each step - like the one taken today - significantly weakens the neo-nazi movement . "
the workers ' party has garnered support from the relatively thin ranks of czech neo-nazis , but also appealed to some voters frustrated by social and ethnic tensions , especially in neighborhoods inhabited by the minority roma population .
the european roma rights center -lrb- errc -rrb- , a support group for the roma population , welcomed the decision , saying they hoped it would improve living conditions for roma people in the czech republic .
" more importantly , however , the czech authorities must act aggressively to prosecute workers ' party members and other individuals who committed crimes against the roma , " the errc 's rob kushen said. msh / reuters / dpa editor : holly fox send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the judge ruled the party 's program to be xenophobic , racist , chauvinist , homophobic and anti-semitic . tomas vandas , the leader of the far-right czech workers ' party , told local television broadcasters that he intends to appeal against a court decision to outlaw his political group .
the supreme administrative court in brno outlawed the far-right party , describing it as xenophobic , racist , chauvinist , homophobic and anti-semitic , in a verdict broadcast live on national television .
" this ruling needs to be understood as a preventative one , to maintain the constitutional and democratic order in the future , " judge vojtech simicek said on wednesday .
the court also said that the party , founded in 2003 , drew inspiration from the doctrines of the german nazi party and had links to openly white supremacist and racist groups .
the workers ' party is the first in the czech republic to be outlawed on the grounds of extremism .
the most recent regional examples of such a move date from before the fall of communist rule in 1989 .
the workers ' party , as part of its opposition to the process , called on its members to picket the courtroom and disrupt the decision , however , only about 50 of them showed up .
weakening the movement bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the court ruled that the party was influenced by hitler 's writing more mainstream political groups welcomed the decision , especially interior minister martin pecina , who filed the motion on behalf of cabinet .
" i said right from the very beginning that in a democratic society the battle against extremism never ends .
however , we can fight the manifestations of far-right activity , " pecina said in the courtroom in brno after the verdict .
pecina said that authorities faced a choice , either stamp these groups out as soon as they emerged , " or we can wait for police cars to be set on fire and petrol bombs to be thrown .
so i 'm convinced that we acted at the right moment , and that each step - like the one taken today - significantly weakens the neo-nazi movement . "
the workers ' party has garnered support from the relatively thin ranks of czech neo-nazis , but also appealed to some voters frustrated by social and ethnic tensions , especially in neighborhoods inhabited by the minority roma population .
the european roma rights center -lrb- errc -rrb- , a support group for the roma population , welcomed the decision , saying they hoped it would improve living conditions for roma people in the czech republic .
" more importantly , however , the czech authorities must act aggressively to prosecute workers ' party members and other individuals who committed crimes against the roma , " the errc 's rob kushen said. msh / reuters / dpa editor : holly fox send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de corruption -pipe- 20.02.2010 german aid groups under fire over luxury cars großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the mystique of maserati seems to be irresistible what do maseratis and land rovers have in common ?
besides being expensive , they have been used as official cars by two relief organizations in germany .
this has sparked outrage among donors and aid workers . the director of treberhilfe , a berlin-based non-profit organization aiding the homeless , found himself in a bind this week trying to explain why he was driving a maserati quattroporte , a flashy italian sports sedan that starts at about 90,000 euros -lrb- $ 120,000 -rrb- . when asked about the car , ehlert 's response was that " a maserati is a car for a gentleman . "
he added that his organization " worked unconventionally , but was absolutely respectable . " ehlert , who has a predilection for fedoras , fine leather shoes and silk scarves , said it was important " to make a good impression on prospective donors . " treberhilfe 's website has since been shut down after angry donors flooded the portal with emails , calling ehlert " asocial " and pledging never to donate again . christine lehmacher-dubberke , the spokeswoman for diakonie emergency aid - the social service umbrella organization of the german protestant church that treberhilfe belongs to - said a maserati was " not a suitable company car " and buying one for that purpose was " morally reprehensible . " " mr. ehlert believes he needs the car , " she said .
" we see that differently . " police probe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schwarzer claims funds have been misappropriated meanwhile , police and state prosecutors are investigating claims of fraud and embezzlement at the berlin-based women 's relief group , hatun & can , after it surfaced that the organization was using a large , upscale , all-terrain vehicle as a company car . police have since confiscated a land rover and frozen most of the group 's bank accounts . the case came to light after alice schwarzer , a prominent german feminist and women 's magazine publisher , won 500,000 euros on the celebrity edition of the television game show " who wants to be a millionaire ? " last year .
she donated the prize money to hatun & can , but later filed charges against the group alleging fraud and misappropriation of funds . germany 's feminist number one said that her attempts to find out what her donation was being used for had landed on deaf ears and that she got only " short and vague answers . " the women 's organization rejected the allegations . " -lsb- schwarzer 's -rsb- accusations are legally absurd and her charges - a catastrophic mistake , " said hubert dreyling , a lawyer for hatun & can .
" -lsb- she -rsb- is being hypocritical and acting self-important . " the women 's aid group was named after 23-year-old hatun sürücü , who was gunned down in berlin by her brother in a so-called " honor killing " five years ago because her fundamentalist turkish-kurdish family strongly disapproved of her modern and " un-islamic " way of life . gb / dpa / epd editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

one of the key issues this year was the global diversification of the entertainment industry , which is shaking up the way film deals are done around the world and threatening the dominance of the hollywood studio .

the industry debate held at this year 's efm set out to answer the question whether this meant the beginning of the end for hollywood studio giants like fox , paramount and warner brothers ?
would a new model soon begin dominating the global film market ?
frederic sichler , an independent french film producer with close ties to the egyptian film business , had an unambiguous answer , for one simple reason – distribution .
" my answer is certainly not , " he said during the debate .
" there are two things to the us dominance : the control of distribution systems , and the production .
for any non-us company to have a distribution system in place that covers the world - i will not see it during my life , that 's for sure . "
instead , sichler predicts that a lot of very strong locally-focussed companies will emerge in places like china and india , where the demand for domestic movies is huge and expected to grow even more .
this will obviously have a major influence on the macro-economic picture , but sichler believes this will be evolutionary , not revolutionary .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : constantin produces and distributes major german movies like ' the baader meinhof complex ' keeping pace by diversifying no single company will rival fox , but a global network of companies will present strong alternatives .
" what has changed is that to produce international content , and to have a global distribution network , you do n't have only one model , which is to deal with the studio , " sichler said .
" you can assemble several partners all around the world which can ultimately deliver the same result . "
but christian grass , president of international production and acquisitions at universal pictures international , admitted that large us studios like his needed to keep pace with the global industry by diversifying along with it .
" speaking for universal , the idea is to be more active in the international market , and supplement the business that comes from the studio with more local and international productions , " he said .
european film production companies like germany 's constantin and the french studiocanal have also come to present a viable alternative to hollywood , if only in the european market .
ron halpern , responsible for international productions and acquisitions for studiocanal , says companies like his are large enough and better-placed to distribute films in europe 's three major markets : germany , britain and france .
" i think what 's interesting at studiocanal is because we are at-the-source distributors in these three territories , we can get feedback very early from three countries with pretty different points of view , " he told the debate .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ' slumdog millionaire ' was a rare example of an internationally-produced global hit in other words , being smaller and closer to the ground can mean that you are better at marketing and distributing a movie in a specific place .
after the debate , halpern told deutsche welle that this was exactly why studiocanal does not keep an office in los angeles : " if you have an office there then ... if you have n't brought in a film in a year , then why are you there ?
so at the end of the year you 're like , " shit , i gotta find a film . "
as the british / indian co-production ' slumdog millionaire ' showed last year , hollywood is no longer necessary to produce a major , internationally successful film .
but the efm 's panellists agreed that the success of that film was still an exception , rather than a rule – the old hollywood truism that american audiences are prepared to see one foreign film per year still holds .
hollywood is still the only force in the film industry with the infrastructure to distribute a major 200 million dollar production around the world .
and that is unlikely to change any time soon .

frederic sichler , an independent french film producer with close ties to the egyptian film business , had an unambiguous answer , for one simple reason – distribution .
" my answer is certainly not , " he said during the debate .
" there are two things to the us dominance : the control of distribution systems , and the production .
for any non-us company to have a distribution system in place that covers the world - i will not see it during my life , that 's for sure . "
instead , sichler predicts that a lot of very strong locally-focussed companies will emerge in places like china and india , where the demand for domestic movies is huge and expected to grow even more .
this will obviously have a major influence on the macro-economic picture , but sichler believes this will be evolutionary , not revolutionary .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : constantin produces and distributes major german movies like ' the baader meinhof complex ' keeping pace by diversifying no single company will rival fox , but a global network of companies will present strong alternatives .
" what has changed is that to produce international content , and to have a global distribution network , you do n't have only one model , which is to deal with the studio , " sichler said .
" you can assemble several partners all around the world which can ultimately deliver the same result . "
but christian grass , president of international production and acquisitions at universal pictures international , admitted that large us studios like his needed to keep pace with the global industry by diversifying along with it .
" speaking for universal , the idea is to be more active in the international market , and supplement the business that comes from the studio with more local and international productions , " he said .
european film production companies like germany 's constantin and the french studiocanal have also come to present a viable alternative to hollywood , if only in the european market .
ron halpern , responsible for international productions and acquisitions for studiocanal , says companies like his are large enough and better-placed to distribute films in europe 's three major markets : germany , britain and france .
" i think what 's interesting at studiocanal is because we are at-the-source distributors in these three territories , we can get feedback very early from three countries with pretty different points of view , " he told the debate .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ' slumdog millionaire ' was a rare example of an internationally-produced global hit in other words , being smaller and closer to the ground can mean that you are better at marketing and distributing a movie in a specific place .
after the debate , halpern told deutsche welle that this was exactly why studiocanal does not keep an office in los angeles : " if you have an office there then ... if you have n't brought in a film in a year , then why are you there ?
so at the end of the year you 're like , " shit , i gotta find a film . "
as the british / indian co-production ' slumdog millionaire ' showed last year , hollywood is no longer necessary to produce a major , internationally successful film .
but the efm 's panellists agreed that the success of that film was still an exception , rather than a rule – the old hollywood truism that american audiences are prepared to see one foreign film per year still holds .
hollywood is still the only force in the film industry with the infrastructure to distribute a major 200 million dollar production around the world .
and that is unlikely to change any time soon .

" we put down our guns in gaza , instead we took microphones in our hands , " raps the palestinian group darg team in one of their songs .
swiss documentary director nicolas wadimoff met the rappers in 2009 , a month after the end of the israeli military attack on gaza . living on after the worst has happened bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " you could find the same stories in haiti or rwanda , " said filmmaker nicolas wadimoff his documentary " still alive in gaza " -lrb- " aisheen " -rrb- focuses on a region that has suffered war and destruction for decades .
without allocating blame to either side , " still alive in gaza " shows what life is like in the aftermath of a disaster .
the film presents people who do n't give up amid grief , despair and destruction . " it is about being human , " wadimoff said .
" what i filmed in gaza - you can see the same things in haiti , bosnia or rwanda .
after going through the worst , people want to live . " that is also the case in the small town of burros , northwest of ramallah .
the local people simply wanted to continue leading their lives like their ancestors had for many generations .
but in 2003 , the israeli government decided to build a security barrier between the west bank and israel .
the fence was to cut right through the village of budrus , and across the fields that provided the livelihoods of the local farmers . the non-violent protests organized by budrus village leader ayed morrar and his daughter iltezam against the measure made international headlines .
local men , women and children as well as members of the rivalling palestinian organizations hamas and fatah and various international and israeli peace activists participated . finding common ground bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the isreali fence cuts through fields and villages in the west bank for five years , american documentary filmmaker julia bacha followed the developments in budrus with her camera .
her film addresses many controversial issues and neither refrains from showing the aggressive reactions of israeli soldiers to the protests nor the moments when palestinian protesters and israelis start to find common ground . " i visited my father in prison many times , and all the israelis i met there were very , very bad , " 15-year-old iltezam said in the film .
" but now i know that not all the israelis are the same .
some of them think that we should live together in peace . " many films at this year 's berlin film festival take a multilayered approach in presenting ways of coping with conflict .
and it 's not about nostalgia or cloying sentimentality , but about critically analyzing the situation .
coming to terms with the past is meant to help understand the present better - in order to be able to shape the future constructively . ' violence is no solution ' " our film wants to show that violence is no solution , " said iraqi director mohamed al-daradji . his film " son of babylon " is set in iraq , a few weeks after the fall of saddam hussein ’ s regime .
ahmed , a bright 12-year-old kurdish boy , sets off with his grandmother in search of his father who was arrested by saddam 's republican guard at the end of the gulf war .
as they travel along bombed out desert tracks they encounter others with similar quests , searching for a new beginning . " son of babylon " was shot on location in iraq and relies on a cast of nonprofessional actors .
the female lead is played by a kurd , shezad hussen , the only female witness to testify during the trial against saddam hussein . during saddam 's regime , hundreds of thousands of civilians were killed , thousands of kurdish villages destroyed and more than 1.5 million kurds were forced to flee their homes in northern iraq . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : searching for a new beginning in a country ravaged by terror " i hope that in the future we will speak three languages in iraq : arabic , kurdish and turkmen , " al-daradji said . in the film , the boy 's journey ends at the recently uncovered mass graves from the time of saddam hussein 's regime .
yet al-daradji , like other filmmakers at this year ’ s festival show that even though the past is still very present , in a place ravaged by war , dignity and understanding are also possible . author : silke bartlick -lrb- ara -rrb- editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we put down our guns in gaza , instead we took microphones in our hands , " raps the palestinian group darg team in one of their songs .
swiss documentary director nicolas wadimoff met the rappers in 2009 , a month after the end of the israeli military attack on gaza . living on after the worst has happened bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " you could find the same stories in haiti or rwanda , " said filmmaker nicolas wadimoff his documentary " still alive in gaza " -lrb- " aisheen " -rrb- focuses on a region that has suffered war and destruction for decades .
without allocating blame to either side , " still alive in gaza " shows what life is like in the aftermath of a disaster .
the film presents people who do n't give up amid grief , despair and destruction . " it is about being human , " wadimoff said .
" what i filmed in gaza - you can see the same things in haiti , bosnia or rwanda .
after going through the worst , people want to live . " that is also the case in the small town of burros , northwest of ramallah .
the local people simply wanted to continue leading their lives like their ancestors had for many generations .
but in 2003 , the israeli government decided to build a security barrier between the west bank and israel .
the fence was to cut right through the village of budrus , and across the fields that provided the livelihoods of the local farmers . the non-violent protests organized by budrus village leader ayed morrar and his daughter iltezam against the measure made international headlines .
local men , women and children as well as members of the rivalling palestinian organizations hamas and fatah and various international and israeli peace activists participated . finding common ground bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the isreali fence cuts through fields and villages in the west bank for five years , american documentary filmmaker julia bacha followed the developments in budrus with her camera .
her film addresses many controversial issues and neither refrains from showing the aggressive reactions of israeli soldiers to the protests nor the moments when palestinian protesters and israelis start to find common ground . " i visited my father in prison many times , and all the israelis i met there were very , very bad , " 15-year-old iltezam said in the film .
" but now i know that not all the israelis are the same .
some of them think that we should live together in peace . " many films at this year 's berlin film festival take a multilayered approach in presenting ways of coping with conflict .
and it 's not about nostalgia or cloying sentimentality , but about critically analyzing the situation .
coming to terms with the past is meant to help understand the present better - in order to be able to shape the future constructively . ' violence is no solution ' " our film wants to show that violence is no solution , " said iraqi director mohamed al-daradji . his film " son of babylon " is set in iraq , a few weeks after the fall of saddam hussein ’ s regime .
ahmed , a bright 12-year-old kurdish boy , sets off with his grandmother in search of his father who was arrested by saddam 's republican guard at the end of the gulf war .
as they travel along bombed out desert tracks they encounter others with similar quests , searching for a new beginning . " son of babylon " was shot on location in iraq and relies on a cast of nonprofessional actors .
the female lead is played by a kurd , shezad hussen , the only female witness to testify during the trial against saddam hussein . during saddam 's regime , hundreds of thousands of civilians were killed , thousands of kurdish villages destroyed and more than 1.5 million kurds were forced to flee their homes in northern iraq . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : searching for a new beginning in a country ravaged by terror " i hope that in the future we will speak three languages in iraq : arabic , kurdish and turkmen , " al-daradji said . in the film , the boy 's journey ends at the recently uncovered mass graves from the time of saddam hussein 's regime .
yet al-daradji , like other filmmakers at this year ’ s festival show that even though the past is still very present , in a place ravaged by war , dignity and understanding are also possible . author : silke bartlick -lrb- ara -rrb- editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we put down our guns in gaza , instead we took microphones in our hands , " raps the palestinian group darg team in one of their songs .
swiss documentary director nicolas wadimoff met the rappers in 2009 , a month after the end of the israeli military attack on gaza . living on after the worst has happened bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " you could find the same stories in haiti or rwanda , " said filmmaker nicolas wadimoff his documentary " still alive in gaza " -lrb- " aisheen " -rrb- focuses on a region that has suffered war and destruction for decades .
without allocating blame to either side , " still alive in gaza " shows what life is like in the aftermath of a disaster .
the film presents people who do n't give up amid grief , despair and destruction . " it is about being human , " wadimoff said .
" what i filmed in gaza - you can see the same things in haiti , bosnia or rwanda .
after going through the worst , people want to live . " that is also the case in the small town of burros , northwest of ramallah .
the local people simply wanted to continue leading their lives like their ancestors had for many generations .
but in 2003 , the israeli government decided to build a security barrier between the west bank and israel .
the fence was to cut right through the village of budrus , and across the fields that provided the livelihoods of the local farmers . the non-violent protests organized by budrus village leader ayed morrar and his daughter iltezam against the measure made international headlines .
local men , women and children as well as members of the rivalling palestinian organizations hamas and fatah and various international and israeli peace activists participated . finding common ground bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the isreali fence cuts through fields and villages in the west bank for five years , american documentary filmmaker julia bacha followed the developments in budrus with her camera .
her film addresses many controversial issues and neither refrains from showing the aggressive reactions of israeli soldiers to the protests nor the moments when palestinian protesters and israelis start to find common ground . " i visited my father in prison many times , and all the israelis i met there were very , very bad , " 15-year-old iltezam said in the film .
" but now i know that not all the israelis are the same .
some of them think that we should live together in peace . " many films at this year 's berlin film festival take a multilayered approach in presenting ways of coping with conflict .
and it 's not about nostalgia or cloying sentimentality , but about critically analyzing the situation .
coming to terms with the past is meant to help understand the present better - in order to be able to shape the future constructively .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : dossier : the 60th berlin film festival opinion : berlin film festival should drop the fluff and aim higher films from war-torn regions set somber tone at berlinale berlinale reaches climax with awards ceremony german film ' jew suss ' booed at berlin film festival film -pipe- 20.02.2010 movie industry debate says hollywood is n't going anywhere großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : industry leaders asked whether hollywood had had its day industry leaders gathered at the european film market at this year 's berlinale to discuss the challenges facing the 21st century movie business .
the central question - is the era of the great hollywood studio over ? the european film market is the commercial arm of the berlin film festival .
held in tandem with the main event , the efm is an exchange floor for hundreds of potential movie deals - a forum where film producers compare ideas , struggling screenwriters try to bend the ears of high-powered executives , and where industry leaders look to the future and the challenges it holds .
one of the key issues this year was the global diversification of the entertainment industry , which is shaking up the way film deals are done around the world and threatening the dominance of the hollywood studio .
as more and more new hollywood movies are being financed , produced and shot outside the united states , film production companies are popping up like mushrooms all over the world , all serving the american audiences that make the us the biggest movie market in the world bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the efm debate was held parallel to the berlinale asian challenge but with cinema attendance sky-rocketing in places like china , and arab nations embarking on ambitious bids to build domestic film industries virtually from scratch , western producers will soon have to face the fact that the us is no longer the biggest market for movies .
the industry debate held at this year 's efm set out to answer the question whether this meant the beginning of the end for hollywood studio giants like fox , paramount and warner brothers ?
would a new model soon begin dominating the global film market ?
frederic sichler , an independent french film producer with close ties to the egyptian film business , had an unambiguous answer , for one simple reason – distribution .
" my answer is certainly not , " he said during the debate .
" there are two things to the us dominance : the control of distribution systems , and the production .
for any non-us company to have a distribution system in place that covers the world - i will not see it during my life , that 's for sure . "
instead , sichler predicts that a lot of very strong locally-focussed companies will emerge in places like china and india , where the demand for domestic movies is huge and expected to grow even more .
this will obviously have a major influence on the macro-economic picture , but sichler believes this will be evolutionary , not revolutionary .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : constantin produces and distributes major german movies like ' the baader meinhof complex ' keeping pace by diversifying no single company will rival fox , but a global network of companies will present strong alternatives .
" what has changed is that to produce international content , and to have a global distribution network , you do n't have only one model , which is to deal with the studio , " sichler said .
" you can assemble several partners all around the world which can ultimately deliver the same result . "
but christian grass , president of international production and acquisitions at universal pictures international , admitted that large us studios like his needed to keep pace with the global industry by diversifying along with it .
" speaking for universal , the idea is to be more active in the international market , and supplement the business that comes from the studio with more local and international productions , " he said .
european film production companies like germany 's constantin and the french studiocanal have also come to present a viable alternative to hollywood , if only in the european market .
ron halpern , responsible for international productions and acquisitions for studiocanal , says companies like his are large enough and better-placed to distribute films in europe 's three major markets : germany , britain and france .
" i think what 's interesting at studiocanal is because we are at-the-source distributors in these three territories , we can get feedback very early from three countries with pretty different points of view , " he told the debate .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ' slumdog millionaire ' was a rare example of an internationally-produced global hit in other words , being smaller and closer to the ground can mean that you are better at marketing and distributing a movie in a specific place .
after the debate , halpern told deutsche welle that this was exactly why studiocanal does not keep an office in los angeles : " if you have an office there then ... if you have n't brought in a film in a year , then why are you there ?
so at the end of the year you 're like , " shit , i gotta find a film . "
as the british / indian co-production ' slumdog millionaire ' showed last year , hollywood is no longer necessary to produce a major , internationally successful film .
but the efm 's panellists agreed that the success of that film was still an exception , rather than a rule – the old hollywood truism that american audiences are prepared to see one foreign film per year still holds .
hollywood is still the only force in the film industry with the infrastructure to distribute a major 200 million dollar production around the world .
and that is unlikely to change any time soon .

but hoffenheim recovered to salvage a point .
the exciting , if somewhat scrappy match finished 2-2 . hoffenheim and borussia moenchengladbach played out a 2-2 draw in the bundesliga 's friday fixture .
the two sides delivered an exciting , offensive match , but it was also littered with mistakes .
hoffenheim started strong , but could n't take the lead in front of their home crowd ; demba ba , carlos eduardo , and vedad ibisevic all let excellent scoring chances go begging .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moenchengladbach took the lead through a controversial penalty however , a controversial handball by hoffenheim defender per nilsson led to the opening goal for moenchengladbach .
the referee decided to award a penalty , and showed nilsson the yellow card , although replays showed that the swede 's transgression actually took place outside the penalty area .
moenchengladbach 's belgian captain filip daems made no mistake from the spot and put his team ahead .
the visitors added another shortly after half time through israeli striker roberto colautti .
but in the last twenty minutes hoffenheim , having lost their way after their strong start , came back to life .
on 69 minutes , carlos eduardo carved through the moenchengladbach back line and provided vedad ibisevic with a chance that was just too good to turn down .
then , with just moments remaining , gladbach captain filip daems blocked a cross with his arm in the penalty area , conceding a penalty for the hosts .
carlos eduardo stepped up and slotted the ball home , rescuing the draw and a valuable bundesliga point for hoffenheim .
hoffenheim and moenchengladbach remain glued together in the mid-table , in ninth and tenth positions , with 28 points apiece .

championship hopefuls bayern munich have what should be an easy away match against nuremberg .
stuttgart will look to get back to winning ways in cologne , after hamburg brought their five-game win-streak to an end last weekend .
fourth-placed hamburg , meanwhile , will play host to eintracht frankfurt , a team that has been punching above its weight this season .
borussia dortmund should be clear favorites at home against struggling hanover , while eighth-placed mainz , perhaps the overachievers of the season so far , play host to bochum. msh / dpa / reuters editor : nigel tandy send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the local people simply wanted to continue leading their lives like their ancestors had for many generations .
but in 2003 , the israeli government decided to build a security barrier between the west bank and israel .
the fence was to cut right through the village of budrus , and across the fields that provided the livelihoods of the local farmers . the non-violent protests organized by budrus village leader ayed morrar and his daughter iltezam against the measure made international headlines .

her film addresses many controversial issues and neither refrains from showing the aggressive reactions of israeli soldiers to the protests nor the moments when palestinian protesters and israelis start to find common ground . " i visited my father in prison many times , and all the israelis i met there were very , very bad , " 15-year-old iltezam said in the film .
" but now i know that not all the israelis are the same .
some of them think that we should live together in peace . " many films at this year 's berlin film festival take a multilayered approach in presenting ways of coping with conflict .
and it 's not about nostalgia or cloying sentimentality , but about critically analyzing the situation .
coming to terms with the past is meant to help understand the present better - in order to be able to shape the future constructively . ' violence is no solution ' " our film wants to show that violence is no solution , " said iraqi director mohamed al-daradji . his film " son of babylon " is set in iraq , a few weeks after the fall of saddam hussein ’ s regime .
ahmed , a bright 12-year-old kurdish boy , sets off with his grandmother in search of his father who was arrested by saddam 's republican guard at the end of the gulf war .
as they travel along bombed out desert tracks they encounter others with similar quests , searching for a new beginning . " son of babylon " was shot on location in iraq and relies on a cast of nonprofessional actors .
the female lead is played by a kurd , shezad hussen , the only female witness to testify during the trial against saddam hussein . during saddam 's regime , hundreds of thousands of civilians were killed , thousands of kurdish villages destroyed and more than 1.5 million kurds were forced to flee their homes in northern iraq . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : searching for a new beginning in a country ravaged by terror " i hope that in the future we will speak three languages in iraq : arabic , kurdish and turkmen , " al-daradji said . in the film , the boy 's journey ends at the recently uncovered mass graves from the time of saddam hussein 's regime .
yet al-daradji , like other filmmakers at this year ’ s festival show that even though the past is still very present , in a place ravaged by war , dignity and understanding are also possible . author : silke bartlick -lrb- ara -rrb- editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

some of them think that we should live together in peace . " many films at this year 's berlin film festival take a multilayered approach in presenting ways of coping with conflict .
and it 's not about nostalgia or cloying sentimentality , but about critically analyzing the situation .
coming to terms with the past is meant to help understand the present better - in order to be able to shape the future constructively . ' violence is no solution ' " our film wants to show that violence is no solution , " said iraqi director mohamed al-daradji . his film " son of babylon " is set in iraq , a few weeks after the fall of saddam hussein ’ s regime .
ahmed , a bright 12-year-old kurdish boy , sets off with his grandmother in search of his father who was arrested by saddam 's republican guard at the end of the gulf war .
as they travel along bombed out desert tracks they encounter others with similar quests , searching for a new beginning . " son of babylon " was shot on location in iraq and relies on a cast of nonprofessional actors .
the female lead is played by a kurd , shezad hussen , the only female witness to testify during the trial against saddam hussein . during saddam 's regime , hundreds of thousands of civilians were killed , thousands of kurdish villages destroyed and more than 1.5 million kurds were forced to flee their homes in northern iraq . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : searching for a new beginning in a country ravaged by terror " i hope that in the future we will speak three languages in iraq : arabic , kurdish and turkmen , " al-daradji said . in the film , the boy 's journey ends at the recently uncovered mass graves from the time of saddam hussein 's regime .
yet al-daradji , like other filmmakers at this year ’ s festival show that even though the past is still very present , in a place ravaged by war , dignity and understanding are also possible . author : silke bartlick -lrb- ara -rrb- editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" -lsb- schwarzer 's -rsb- accusations are legally absurd and her charges - a catastrophic mistake , " said hubert dreyling , a lawyer for hatun & can .
" -lsb- she -rsb- is being hypocritical and acting self-important .

the package is reportedly being cobbled together by the german government . the deal under consideration would see the 15 other euro zone countries issue 20-25 billion euros in aid in the form of loans and guarantees , weekly german newsmagazine der spiegel reported .
the report said each euro zone country 's contribution to the package would be calculated according to the proportion of capital each holds in the european central bank .
germany 's contribution would reportedly amount to around four billion euros and be handled by the state-owned development bank , the kfw .
the government of chancellor angela merkel has so far held off on committing any aid to greece over fears this would cause other troubled euro zone countries to go easy on reforms to their economies in the hope of also receiving bailout packages .
" crisis as a chance " greece is currently trying to rein in a deficit of 12.7 percent of gdp , more than four times the limit allowed by euro zone regulations .
the government of greek prime minister georgiou papandreou said it was aiming to reduce the deficit to below three percent by 2012 .
papandreou said he was confident this ambitious target could be met by clamping down on bribery and corruption .
" we need to understand the crisis as a chance to launch the necessary reforms , " he said in an interview for a separate report also to run in der spiegel on monday .

the central question - is the era of the great hollywood studio over ? the european film market is the commercial arm of the berlin film festival .
held in tandem with the main event , the efm is an exchange floor for hundreds of potential movie deals - a forum where film producers compare ideas , struggling screenwriters try to bend the ears of high-powered executives , and where industry leaders look to the future and the challenges it holds .
one of the key issues this year was the global diversification of the entertainment industry , which is shaking up the way film deals are done around the world and threatening the dominance of the hollywood studio .
as more and more new hollywood movies are being financed , produced and shot outside the united states , film production companies are popping up like mushrooms all over the world , all serving the american audiences that make the us the biggest movie market in the world bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the efm debate was held parallel to the berlinale asian challenge but with cinema attendance sky-rocketing in places like china , and arab nations embarking on ambitious bids to build domestic film industries virtually from scratch , western producers will soon have to face the fact that the us is no longer the biggest market for movies .
the industry debate held at this year 's efm set out to answer the question whether this meant the beginning of the end for hollywood studio giants like fox , paramount and warner brothers ?
would a new model soon begin dominating the global film market ?
frederic sichler , an independent french film producer with close ties to the egyptian film business , had an unambiguous answer , for one simple reason – distribution .
" my answer is certainly not , " he said during the debate .
" there are two things to the us dominance : the control of distribution systems , and the production .
for any non-us company to have a distribution system in place that covers the world - i will not see it during my life , that 's for sure . "
instead , sichler predicts that a lot of very strong locally-focussed companies will emerge in places like china and india , where the demand for domestic movies is huge and expected to grow even more .
this will obviously have a major influence on the macro-economic picture , but sichler believes this will be evolutionary , not revolutionary .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : constantin produces and distributes major german movies like ' the baader meinhof complex ' keeping pace by diversifying no single company will rival fox , but a global network of companies will present strong alternatives .
" what has changed is that to produce international content , and to have a global distribution network , you do n't have only one model , which is to deal with the studio , " sichler said .
" you can assemble several partners all around the world which can ultimately deliver the same result . "
but christian grass , president of international production and acquisitions at universal pictures international , admitted that large us studios like his needed to keep pace with the global industry by diversifying along with it .
" speaking for universal , the idea is to be more active in the international market , and supplement the business that comes from the studio with more local and international productions , " he said .
european film production companies like germany 's constantin and the french studiocanal have also come to present a viable alternative to hollywood , if only in the european market .
ron halpern , responsible for international productions and acquisitions for studiocanal , says companies like his are large enough and better-placed to distribute films in europe 's three major markets : germany , britain and france .
" i think what 's interesting at studiocanal is because we are at-the-source distributors in these three territories , we can get feedback very early from three countries with pretty different points of view , " he told the debate .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ' slumdog millionaire ' was a rare example of an internationally-produced global hit in other words , being smaller and closer to the ground can mean that you are better at marketing and distributing a movie in a specific place .
after the debate , halpern told deutsche welle that this was exactly why studiocanal does not keep an office in los angeles : " if you have an office there then ... if you have n't brought in a film in a year , then why are you there ?
so at the end of the year you 're like , " shit , i gotta find a film . "
as the british / indian co-production ' slumdog millionaire ' showed last year , hollywood is no longer necessary to produce a major , internationally successful film .
but the efm 's panellists agreed that the success of that film was still an exception , rather than a rule – the old hollywood truism that american audiences are prepared to see one foreign film per year still holds .
hollywood is still the only force in the film industry with the infrastructure to distribute a major 200 million dollar production around the world .
and that is unlikely to change any time soon .

the central question - is the era of the great hollywood studio over ? the european film market is the commercial arm of the berlin film festival .
held in tandem with the main event , the efm is an exchange floor for hundreds of potential movie deals - a forum where film producers compare ideas , struggling screenwriters try to bend the ears of high-powered executives , and where industry leaders look to the future and the challenges it holds .
one of the key issues this year was the global diversification of the entertainment industry , which is shaking up the way film deals are done around the world and threatening the dominance of the hollywood studio .

the industry debate held at this year 's efm set out to answer the question whether this meant the beginning of the end for hollywood studio giants like fox , paramount and warner brothers ?
would a new model soon begin dominating the global film market ?
frederic sichler , an independent french film producer with close ties to the egyptian film business , had an unambiguous answer , for one simple reason – distribution .
" my answer is certainly not , " he said during the debate .
" there are two things to the us dominance : the control of distribution systems , and the production .
for any non-us company to have a distribution system in place that covers the world - i will not see it during my life , that 's for sure . "
instead , sichler predicts that a lot of very strong locally-focussed companies will emerge in places like china and india , where the demand for domestic movies is huge and expected to grow even more .
this will obviously have a major influence on the macro-economic picture , but sichler believes this will be evolutionary , not revolutionary .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : constantin produces and distributes major german movies like ' the baader meinhof complex ' keeping pace by diversifying no single company will rival fox , but a global network of companies will present strong alternatives .
" what has changed is that to produce international content , and to have a global distribution network , you do n't have only one model , which is to deal with the studio , " sichler said .
" you can assemble several partners all around the world which can ultimately deliver the same result . "
but christian grass , president of international production and acquisitions at universal pictures international , admitted that large us studios like his needed to keep pace with the global industry by diversifying along with it .
" speaking for universal , the idea is to be more active in the international market , and supplement the business that comes from the studio with more local and international productions , " he said .
european film production companies like germany 's constantin and the french studiocanal have also come to present a viable alternative to hollywood , if only in the european market .
ron halpern , responsible for international productions and acquisitions for studiocanal , says companies like his are large enough and better-placed to distribute films in europe 's three major markets : germany , britain and france .
" i think what 's interesting at studiocanal is because we are at-the-source distributors in these three territories , we can get feedback very early from three countries with pretty different points of view , " he told the debate .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ' slumdog millionaire ' was a rare example of an internationally-produced global hit in other words , being smaller and closer to the ground can mean that you are better at marketing and distributing a movie in a specific place .
after the debate , halpern told deutsche welle that this was exactly why studiocanal does not keep an office in los angeles : " if you have an office there then ... if you have n't brought in a film in a year , then why are you there ?
so at the end of the year you 're like , " shit , i gotta find a film . "
as the british / indian co-production ' slumdog millionaire ' showed last year , hollywood is no longer necessary to produce a major , internationally successful film .
but the efm 's panellists agreed that the success of that film was still an exception , rather than a rule – the old hollywood truism that american audiences are prepared to see one foreign film per year still holds .
hollywood is still the only force in the film industry with the infrastructure to distribute a major 200 million dollar production around the world .
and that is unlikely to change any time soon .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : dossier : the 60th berlin film festival opinion : berlin film festival should drop the fluff and aim higher films from war-torn regions set somber tone at berlinale berlinale reaches climax with awards ceremony german film ' jew suss ' booed at berlin film festival film -pipe- 20.02.2010 movie industry debate says hollywood is n't going anywhere großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : industry leaders asked whether hollywood had had its day industry leaders gathered at the european film market at this year 's berlinale to discuss the challenges facing the 21st century movie business .
the central question - is the era of the great hollywood studio over ? the european film market is the commercial arm of the berlin film festival .
held in tandem with the main event , the efm is an exchange floor for hundreds of potential movie deals - a forum where film producers compare ideas , struggling screenwriters try to bend the ears of high-powered executives , and where industry leaders look to the future and the challenges it holds .
one of the key issues this year was the global diversification of the entertainment industry , which is shaking up the way film deals are done around the world and threatening the dominance of the hollywood studio .
as more and more new hollywood movies are being financed , produced and shot outside the united states , film production companies are popping up like mushrooms all over the world , all serving the american audiences that make the us the biggest movie market in the world bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the efm debate was held parallel to the berlinale asian challenge but with cinema attendance sky-rocketing in places like china , and arab nations embarking on ambitious bids to build domestic film industries virtually from scratch , western producers will soon have to face the fact that the us is no longer the biggest market for movies .
the industry debate held at this year 's efm set out to answer the question whether this meant the beginning of the end for hollywood studio giants like fox , paramount and warner brothers ?
would a new model soon begin dominating the global film market ?
frederic sichler , an independent french film producer with close ties to the egyptian film business , had an unambiguous answer , for one simple reason – distribution .
" my answer is certainly not , " he said during the debate .
" there are two things to the us dominance : the control of distribution systems , and the production .
for any non-us company to have a distribution system in place that covers the world - i will not see it during my life , that 's for sure . "
instead , sichler predicts that a lot of very strong locally-focussed companies will emerge in places like china and india , where the demand for domestic movies is huge and expected to grow even more .
this will obviously have a major influence on the macro-economic picture , but sichler believes this will be evolutionary , not revolutionary .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : constantin produces and distributes major german movies like ' the baader meinhof complex ' keeping pace by diversifying no single company will rival fox , but a global network of companies will present strong alternatives .
" what has changed is that to produce international content , and to have a global distribution network , you do n't have only one model , which is to deal with the studio , " sichler said .
" you can assemble several partners all around the world which can ultimately deliver the same result . "
but christian grass , president of international production and acquisitions at universal pictures international , admitted that large us studios like his needed to keep pace with the global industry by diversifying along with it .
" speaking for universal , the idea is to be more active in the international market , and supplement the business that comes from the studio with more local and international productions , " he said .
european film production companies like germany 's constantin and the french studiocanal have also come to present a viable alternative to hollywood , if only in the european market .
ron halpern , responsible for international productions and acquisitions for studiocanal , says companies like his are large enough and better-placed to distribute films in europe 's three major markets : germany , britain and france .
" i think what 's interesting at studiocanal is because we are at-the-source distributors in these three territories , we can get feedback very early from three countries with pretty different points of view , " he told the debate .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ' slumdog millionaire ' was a rare example of an internationally-produced global hit in other words , being smaller and closer to the ground can mean that you are better at marketing and distributing a movie in a specific place .
after the debate , halpern told deutsche welle that this was exactly why studiocanal does not keep an office in los angeles : " if you have an office there then ... if you have n't brought in a film in a year , then why are you there ?
so at the end of the year you 're like , " shit , i gotta find a film . "
as the british / indian co-production ' slumdog millionaire ' showed last year , hollywood is no longer necessary to produce a major , internationally successful film .
but the efm 's panellists agreed that the success of that film was still an exception , rather than a rule – the old hollywood truism that american audiences are prepared to see one foreign film per year still holds .
hollywood is still the only force in the film industry with the infrastructure to distribute a major 200 million dollar production around the world .
and that is unlikely to change any time soon .

the package is reportedly being cobbled together by the german government . the deal under consideration would see the 15 other euro zone countries issue 20-25 billion euros in aid in the form of loans and guarantees , weekly german newsmagazine der spiegel reported .
the report said each euro zone country 's contribution to the package would be calculated according to the proportion of capital each holds in the european central bank .
germany 's contribution would reportedly amount to around four billion euros and be handled by the state-owned development bank , the kfw .
the government of chancellor angela merkel has so far held off on committing any aid to greece over fears this would cause other troubled euro zone countries to go easy on reforms to their economies in the hope of also receiving bailout packages .
" crisis as a chance " greece is currently trying to rein in a deficit of 12.7 percent of gdp , more than four times the limit allowed by euro zone regulations .
the government of greek prime minister georgiou papandreou said it was aiming to reduce the deficit to below three percent by 2012 .
papandreou said he was confident this ambitious target could be met by clamping down on bribery and corruption .
" we need to understand the crisis as a chance to launch the necessary reforms , " he said in an interview for a separate report also to run in der spiegel on monday .

besides being expensive , they have been used as official cars by two relief organizations in germany .
this has sparked outrage among donors and aid workers . the director of treberhilfe , a berlin-based non-profit organization aiding the homeless , found himself in a bind this week trying to explain why he was driving a maserati quattroporte , a flashy italian sports sedan that starts at about 90,000 euros -lrb- $ 120,000 -rrb- . when asked about the car , ehlert 's response was that " a maserati is a car for a gentleman . "
he added that his organization " worked unconventionally , but was absolutely respectable . " ehlert , who has a predilection for fedoras , fine leather shoes and silk scarves , said it was important " to make a good impression on prospective donors . " treberhilfe 's website has since been shut down after angry donors flooded the portal with emails , calling ehlert " asocial " and pledging never to donate again . christine lehmacher-dubberke , the spokeswoman for diakonie emergency aid - the social service umbrella organization of the german protestant church that treberhilfe belongs to - said a maserati was " not a suitable company car " and buying one for that purpose was " morally reprehensible . " " mr. ehlert believes he needs the car , " she said .
" we see that differently . " police probe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schwarzer claims funds have been misappropriated meanwhile , police and state prosecutors are investigating claims of fraud and embezzlement at the berlin-based women 's relief group , hatun & can , after it surfaced that the organization was using a large , upscale , all-terrain vehicle as a company car . police have since confiscated a land rover and frozen most of the group 's bank accounts . the case came to light after alice schwarzer , a prominent german feminist and women 's magazine publisher , won 500,000 euros on the celebrity edition of the television game show " who wants to be a millionaire ? " last year .
she donated the prize money to hatun & can , but later filed charges against the group alleging fraud and misappropriation of funds . germany 's feminist number one said that her attempts to find out what her donation was being used for had landed on deaf ears and that she got only " short and vague answers . " the women 's organization rejected the allegations . " -lsb- schwarzer 's -rsb- accusations are legally absurd and her charges - a catastrophic mistake , " said hubert dreyling , a lawyer for hatun & can .
" -lsb- she -rsb- is being hypocritical and acting self-important . " the women 's aid group was named after 23-year-old hatun sürücü , who was gunned down in berlin by her brother in a so-called " honor killing " five years ago because her fundamentalist turkish-kurdish family strongly disapproved of her modern and " un-islamic " way of life . gb / dpa / epd editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but the gold went to britain 's amy williams . kerstin symkowiak and anja huber have won germany 's first ever medals in the skeleton event , clinching silver and bronze in vancouver late on friday .
their achievement is all the more impressive as it seemed impossible going into the final round .
the germans were fourth and fifth after three attempts , but both managed to leapfrog american noelle pikus-pace and canadian home favorite mellisa hollingsworth with solid times in the fourth , and final , round .
" i have worked long and hard towards this moment , " kerstin symkowiak told reporters before receiving her medal .
" i always knew that if i delivered four consistent runs , then anything was possible . "
symkowiak and anja huber are roommates at the vancouver games , and celebrated raucously together after the surprise result .
" i 've been on an emotional rollercoaster , " huber said .
" after the third run i did n't believe it was possible anymore .
now i am speechless , and ecstatic ! "
however , germany 's third hope , world champion marion trott , disappointed .
trott was never amongst the front runners , and finished in eighth position , one-and-a-half seconds adrift of the gold medal time .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : skeleton is a rather new olympic event , and it demands a lot of courage " here i failed to show what i 'm really capable of , " trott lamented .
historic gold while the german women secured the country 's first ever skeleton medals , amy williams won britain 's first gold medal in any individual winter olympics event since 1980 .
williams ended britain 's 30-year winter olympics drought with relative ease , leading from start to finish , and setting the fastest single time of the competition with her third run .
" i ca n't believe it is actually happening right now , " williams said .
" i feel like i am in a little bubble , and i do n't know if it is at all real . "
williams , however , was doubtful for the competition until the last minute .
a protest over the special design of her helmet , which the us argued provided an illegal aerodynamic advantage , put williams ' olympic fate in doubt . organizers dismissed the appeal shortly before the competition began .
skeleton - which is a head-first variation of the luge event - only became a medal-winning winter olympic discipline at salt lake city in 2002 .
eight years and three olympics later , germany has now secured two medals in the event .
with four gold , five silver , and four bronze medals , germany maintains second place in the medal tally in vancouver , behind the united states .

the two sides delivered an exciting , offensive match , but it was also littered with mistakes .
hoffenheim started strong , but could n't take the lead in front of their home crowd ; demba ba , carlos eduardo , and vedad ibisevic all let excellent scoring chances go begging .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moenchengladbach took the lead through a controversial penalty however , a controversial handball by hoffenheim defender per nilsson led to the opening goal for moenchengladbach .
the referee decided to award a penalty , and showed nilsson the yellow card , although replays showed that the swede 's transgression actually took place outside the penalty area .
moenchengladbach 's belgian captain filip daems made no mistake from the spot and put his team ahead .
the visitors added another shortly after half time through israeli striker roberto colautti .
but in the last twenty minutes hoffenheim , having lost their way after their strong start , came back to life .
on 69 minutes , carlos eduardo carved through the moenchengladbach back line and provided vedad ibisevic with a chance that was just too good to turn down .
then , with just moments remaining , gladbach captain filip daems blocked a cross with his arm in the penalty area , conceding a penalty for the hosts .

but the gold went to britain 's amy williams . kerstin symkowiak and anja huber have won germany 's first ever medals in the skeleton event , clinching silver and bronze in vancouver late on friday .
their achievement is all the more impressive as it seemed impossible going into the final round .
the germans were fourth and fifth after three attempts , but both managed to leapfrog american noelle pikus-pace and canadian home favorite mellisa hollingsworth with solid times in the fourth , and final , round .
" i have worked long and hard towards this moment , " kerstin symkowiak told reporters before receiving her medal .
" i always knew that if i delivered four consistent runs , then anything was possible . "
symkowiak and anja huber are roommates at the vancouver games , and celebrated raucously together after the surprise result .
" i 've been on an emotional rollercoaster , " huber said .
" after the third run i did n't believe it was possible anymore .
now i am speechless , and ecstatic ! "
however , germany 's third hope , world champion marion trott , disappointed .
trott was never amongst the front runners , and finished in eighth position , one-and-a-half seconds adrift of the gold medal time .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : skeleton is a rather new olympic event , and it demands a lot of courage " here i failed to show what i 'm really capable of , " trott lamented .
historic gold while the german women secured the country 's first ever skeleton medals , amy williams won britain 's first gold medal in any individual winter olympics event since 1980 .
williams ended britain 's 30-year winter olympics drought with relative ease , leading from start to finish , and setting the fastest single time of the competition with her third run .
" i ca n't believe it is actually happening right now , " williams said .
" i feel like i am in a little bubble , and i do n't know if it is at all real . "
williams , however , was doubtful for the competition until the last minute .
a protest over the special design of her helmet , which the us argued provided an illegal aerodynamic advantage , put williams ' olympic fate in doubt . organizers dismissed the appeal shortly before the competition began .
skeleton - which is a head-first variation of the luge event - only became a medal-winning winter olympic discipline at salt lake city in 2002 .
eight years and three olympics later , germany has now secured two medals in the event .
with four gold , five silver , and four bronze medals , germany maintains second place in the medal tally in vancouver , behind the united states .

" we put down our guns in gaza , instead we took microphones in our hands , " raps the palestinian group darg team in one of their songs .
swiss documentary director nicolas wadimoff met the rappers in 2009 , a month after the end of the israeli military attack on gaza . living on after the worst has happened bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " you could find the same stories in haiti or rwanda , " said filmmaker nicolas wadimoff his documentary " still alive in gaza " -lrb- " aisheen " -rrb- focuses on a region that has suffered war and destruction for decades .
without allocating blame to either side , " still alive in gaza " shows what life is like in the aftermath of a disaster .
the film presents people who do n't give up amid grief , despair and destruction . " it is about being human , " wadimoff said .
" what i filmed in gaza - you can see the same things in haiti , bosnia or rwanda .
after going through the worst , people want to live . " that is also the case in the small town of burros , northwest of ramallah .
the local people simply wanted to continue leading their lives like their ancestors had for many generations .

" we put down our guns in gaza , instead we took microphones in our hands , " raps the palestinian group darg team in one of their songs .
swiss documentary director nicolas wadimoff met the rappers in 2009 , a month after the end of the israeli military attack on gaza . living on after the worst has happened bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " you could find the same stories in haiti or rwanda , " said filmmaker nicolas wadimoff his documentary " still alive in gaza " -lrb- " aisheen " -rrb- focuses on a region that has suffered war and destruction for decades .
without allocating blame to either side , " still alive in gaza " shows what life is like in the aftermath of a disaster .
the film presents people who do n't give up amid grief , despair and destruction . " it is about being human , " wadimoff said .
" what i filmed in gaza - you can see the same things in haiti , bosnia or rwanda .
after going through the worst , people want to live . " that is also the case in the small town of burros , northwest of ramallah .
the local people simply wanted to continue leading their lives like their ancestors had for many generations .

thomas mueller , replacing french international franck ribery , gave the german giants the lead after 38 minutes , slotting home a cross from striker mario gomez into the top right corner .
but bavarian rivals nuremberg drew even on 54 minutes when striker ilkay guendogan took advantage of confusion in bayern 's defense to tap the ball home from short range .
bayern now sit atop the league ladder by one point , and will be hoping leverkusen slip up away to werder bremen , who will be looking for three points to push them back up into a european qualifying position .

stuttgart moved up to ninth .

nelson valdez added a third seven minutes later .
arouna kone pulled one back for hannover in the 81st minute , but kevin grosskreutz added to dortmund 's lead two minutes before the whistle .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : dossier : the 60th berlin film festival opinion : berlin film festival should drop the fluff and aim higher movie industry debate says hollywood is n't going anywhere berlinale reaches climax with awards ceremony german film ' jew suss ' booed at berlin film festival film -pipe- 20.02.2010 films from war-torn regions set somber tone at berlinale großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the documentary " still alive in gaza " was shot in 2009 despite the glitz and glamour of the berlin film festival , the topics addressed by many of the films presented this year are dark and complex : war , conflict and disaster . " we put down our guns in gaza , instead we took microphones in our hands , " raps the palestinian group darg team in one of their songs .
swiss documentary director nicolas wadimoff met the rappers in 2009 , a month after the end of the israeli military attack on gaza . living on after the worst has happened bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " you could find the same stories in haiti or rwanda , " said filmmaker nicolas wadimoff his documentary " still alive in gaza " -lrb- " aisheen " -rrb- focuses on a region that has suffered war and destruction for decades .
without allocating blame to either side , " still alive in gaza " shows what life is like in the aftermath of a disaster .
the film presents people who do n't give up amid grief , despair and destruction . " it is about being human , " wadimoff said .
" what i filmed in gaza - you can see the same things in haiti , bosnia or rwanda .
after going through the worst , people want to live . " that is also the case in the small town of burros , northwest of ramallah .
the local people simply wanted to continue leading their lives like their ancestors had for many generations .
but in 2003 , the israeli government decided to build a security barrier between the west bank and israel .
the fence was to cut right through the village of budrus , and across the fields that provided the livelihoods of the local farmers . the non-violent protests organized by budrus village leader ayed morrar and his daughter iltezam against the measure made international headlines .
local men , women and children as well as members of the rivalling palestinian organizations hamas and fatah and various international and israeli peace activists participated . finding common ground bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the isreali fence cuts through fields and villages in the west bank for five years , american documentary filmmaker julia bacha followed the developments in budrus with her camera .
her film addresses many controversial issues and neither refrains from showing the aggressive reactions of israeli soldiers to the protests nor the moments when palestinian protesters and israelis start to find common ground . " i visited my father in prison many times , and all the israelis i met there were very , very bad , " 15-year-old iltezam said in the film .
" but now i know that not all the israelis are the same .
some of them think that we should live together in peace . " many films at this year 's berlin film festival take a multilayered approach in presenting ways of coping with conflict .
and it 's not about nostalgia or cloying sentimentality , but about critically analyzing the situation .
coming to terms with the past is meant to help understand the present better - in order to be able to shape the future constructively . ' violence is no solution ' " our film wants to show that violence is no solution , " said iraqi director mohamed al-daradji . his film " son of babylon " is set in iraq , a few weeks after the fall of saddam hussein ’ s regime .
ahmed , a bright 12-year-old kurdish boy , sets off with his grandmother in search of his father who was arrested by saddam 's republican guard at the end of the gulf war .
as they travel along bombed out desert tracks they encounter others with similar quests , searching for a new beginning . " son of babylon " was shot on location in iraq and relies on a cast of nonprofessional actors .
the female lead is played by a kurd , shezad hussen , the only female witness to testify during the trial against saddam hussein . during saddam 's regime , hundreds of thousands of civilians were killed , thousands of kurdish villages destroyed and more than 1.5 million kurds were forced to flee their homes in northern iraq . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : searching for a new beginning in a country ravaged by terror " i hope that in the future we will speak three languages in iraq : arabic , kurdish and turkmen , " al-daradji said . in the film , the boy 's journey ends at the recently uncovered mass graves from the time of saddam hussein 's regime .
yet al-daradji , like other filmmakers at this year ’ s festival show that even though the past is still very present , in a place ravaged by war , dignity and understanding are also possible . author : silke bartlick -lrb- ara -rrb- editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

besides being expensive , they have been used as official cars by two relief organizations in germany .
this has sparked outrage among donors and aid workers . the director of treberhilfe , a berlin-based non-profit organization aiding the homeless , found himself in a bind this week trying to explain why he was driving a maserati quattroporte , a flashy italian sports sedan that starts at about 90,000 euros -lrb- $ 120,000 -rrb- . when asked about the car , ehlert 's response was that " a maserati is a car for a gentleman . "
he added that his organization " worked unconventionally , but was absolutely respectable . " ehlert , who has a predilection for fedoras , fine leather shoes and silk scarves , said it was important " to make a good impression on prospective donors . " treberhilfe 's website has since been shut down after angry donors flooded the portal with emails , calling ehlert " asocial " and pledging never to donate again . christine lehmacher-dubberke , the spokeswoman for diakonie emergency aid - the social service umbrella organization of the german protestant church that treberhilfe belongs to - said a maserati was " not a suitable company car " and buying one for that purpose was " morally reprehensible .

" we put down our guns in gaza , instead we took microphones in our hands , " raps the palestinian group darg team in one of their songs .
swiss documentary director nicolas wadimoff met the rappers in 2009 , a month after the end of the israeli military attack on gaza . living on after the worst has happened bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " you could find the same stories in haiti or rwanda , " said filmmaker nicolas wadimoff his documentary " still alive in gaza " -lrb- " aisheen " -rrb- focuses on a region that has suffered war and destruction for decades .
without allocating blame to either side , " still alive in gaza " shows what life is like in the aftermath of a disaster .
the film presents people who do n't give up amid grief , despair and destruction . " it is about being human , " wadimoff said .
" what i filmed in gaza - you can see the same things in haiti , bosnia or rwanda .
after going through the worst , people want to live . " that is also the case in the small town of burros , northwest of ramallah .
the local people simply wanted to continue leading their lives like their ancestors had for many generations .
but in 2003 , the israeli government decided to build a security barrier between the west bank and israel .
the fence was to cut right through the village of budrus , and across the fields that provided the livelihoods of the local farmers . the non-violent protests organized by budrus village leader ayed morrar and his daughter iltezam against the measure made international headlines .
local men , women and children as well as members of the rivalling palestinian organizations hamas and fatah and various international and israeli peace activists participated . finding common ground bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the isreali fence cuts through fields and villages in the west bank for five years , american documentary filmmaker julia bacha followed the developments in budrus with her camera .
her film addresses many controversial issues and neither refrains from showing the aggressive reactions of israeli soldiers to the protests nor the moments when palestinian protesters and israelis start to find common ground . " i visited my father in prison many times , and all the israelis i met there were very , very bad , " 15-year-old iltezam said in the film .
" but now i know that not all the israelis are the same .
some of them think that we should live together in peace . " many films at this year 's berlin film festival take a multilayered approach in presenting ways of coping with conflict .
and it 's not about nostalgia or cloying sentimentality , but about critically analyzing the situation .
coming to terms with the past is meant to help understand the present better - in order to be able to shape the future constructively . ' violence is no solution ' " our film wants to show that violence is no solution , " said iraqi director mohamed al-daradji . his film " son of babylon " is set in iraq , a few weeks after the fall of saddam hussein ’ s regime .
ahmed , a bright 12-year-old kurdish boy , sets off with his grandmother in search of his father who was arrested by saddam 's republican guard at the end of the gulf war .
as they travel along bombed out desert tracks they encounter others with similar quests , searching for a new beginning . " son of babylon " was shot on location in iraq and relies on a cast of nonprofessional actors .
the female lead is played by a kurd , shezad hussen , the only female witness to testify during the trial against saddam hussein . during saddam 's regime , hundreds of thousands of civilians were killed , thousands of kurdish villages destroyed and more than 1.5 million kurds were forced to flee their homes in northern iraq . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : searching for a new beginning in a country ravaged by terror " i hope that in the future we will speak three languages in iraq : arabic , kurdish and turkmen , " al-daradji said . in the film , the boy 's journey ends at the recently uncovered mass graves from the time of saddam hussein 's regime .
yet al-daradji , like other filmmakers at this year ’ s festival show that even though the past is still very present , in a place ravaged by war , dignity and understanding are also possible . author : silke bartlick -lrb- ara -rrb- editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we put down our guns in gaza , instead we took microphones in our hands , " raps the palestinian group darg team in one of their songs .
swiss documentary director nicolas wadimoff met the rappers in 2009 , a month after the end of the israeli military attack on gaza . living on after the worst has happened bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " you could find the same stories in haiti or rwanda , " said filmmaker nicolas wadimoff his documentary " still alive in gaza " -lrb- " aisheen " -rrb- focuses on a region that has suffered war and destruction for decades .
without allocating blame to either side , " still alive in gaza " shows what life is like in the aftermath of a disaster .
the film presents people who do n't give up amid grief , despair and destruction . " it is about being human , " wadimoff said .
" what i filmed in gaza - you can see the same things in haiti , bosnia or rwanda .
after going through the worst , people want to live . " that is also the case in the small town of burros , northwest of ramallah .
the local people simply wanted to continue leading their lives like their ancestors had for many generations .
but in 2003 , the israeli government decided to build a security barrier between the west bank and israel .
the fence was to cut right through the village of budrus , and across the fields that provided the livelihoods of the local farmers . the non-violent protests organized by budrus village leader ayed morrar and his daughter iltezam against the measure made international headlines .
local men , women and children as well as members of the rivalling palestinian organizations hamas and fatah and various international and israeli peace activists participated . finding common ground bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the isreali fence cuts through fields and villages in the west bank for five years , american documentary filmmaker julia bacha followed the developments in budrus with her camera .
her film addresses many controversial issues and neither refrains from showing the aggressive reactions of israeli soldiers to the protests nor the moments when palestinian protesters and israelis start to find common ground . " i visited my father in prison many times , and all the israelis i met there were very , very bad , " 15-year-old iltezam said in the film .
" but now i know that not all the israelis are the same .
some of them think that we should live together in peace . " many films at this year 's berlin film festival take a multilayered approach in presenting ways of coping with conflict .
and it 's not about nostalgia or cloying sentimentality , but about critically analyzing the situation .
coming to terms with the past is meant to help understand the present better - in order to be able to shape the future constructively . ' violence is no solution ' " our film wants to show that violence is no solution , " said iraqi director mohamed al-daradji . his film " son of babylon " is set in iraq , a few weeks after the fall of saddam hussein ’ s regime .
ahmed , a bright 12-year-old kurdish boy , sets off with his grandmother in search of his father who was arrested by saddam 's republican guard at the end of the gulf war .
as they travel along bombed out desert tracks they encounter others with similar quests , searching for a new beginning . " son of babylon " was shot on location in iraq and relies on a cast of nonprofessional actors .
the female lead is played by a kurd , shezad hussen , the only female witness to testify during the trial against saddam hussein . during saddam 's regime , hundreds of thousands of civilians were killed , thousands of kurdish villages destroyed and more than 1.5 million kurds were forced to flee their homes in northern iraq . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : searching for a new beginning in a country ravaged by terror " i hope that in the future we will speak three languages in iraq : arabic , kurdish and turkmen , " al-daradji said . in the film , the boy 's journey ends at the recently uncovered mass graves from the time of saddam hussein 's regime .
yet al-daradji , like other filmmakers at this year ’ s festival show that even though the past is still very present , in a place ravaged by war , dignity and understanding are also possible . author : silke bartlick -lrb- ara -rrb- editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the judge ruled the party 's program to be xenophobic , racist , chauvinist , homophobic and anti-semitic . tomas vandas , the leader of the far-right czech workers ' party , told local television broadcasters that he intends to appeal against a court decision to outlaw his political group .
the supreme administrative court in brno outlawed the far-right party , describing it as xenophobic , racist , chauvinist , homophobic and anti-semitic , in a verdict broadcast live on national television .
" this ruling needs to be understood as a preventative one , to maintain the constitutional and democratic order in the future , " judge vojtech simicek said on wednesday .
the court also said that the party , founded in 2003 , drew inspiration from the doctrines of the german nazi party and had links to openly white supremacist and racist groups .
the workers ' party is the first in the czech republic to be outlawed on the grounds of extremism .
the most recent regional examples of such a move date from before the fall of communist rule in 1989 .
the workers ' party , as part of its opposition to the process , called on its members to picket the courtroom and disrupt the decision , however , only about 50 of them showed up .
weakening the movement bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the court ruled that the party was influenced by hitler 's writing more mainstream political groups welcomed the decision , especially interior minister martin pecina , who filed the motion on behalf of cabinet .
" i said right from the very beginning that in a democratic society the battle against extremism never ends .
however , we can fight the manifestations of far-right activity , " pecina said in the courtroom in brno after the verdict .
pecina said that authorities faced a choice , either stamp these groups out as soon as they emerged , " or we can wait for police cars to be set on fire and petrol bombs to be thrown .
so i 'm convinced that we acted at the right moment , and that each step - like the one taken today - significantly weakens the neo-nazi movement . "
the workers ' party has garnered support from the relatively thin ranks of czech neo-nazis , but also appealed to some voters frustrated by social and ethnic tensions , especially in neighborhoods inhabited by the minority roma population .
the european roma rights center -lrb- errc -rrb- , a support group for the roma population , welcomed the decision , saying they hoped it would improve living conditions for roma people in the czech republic .
" more importantly , however , the czech authorities must act aggressively to prosecute workers ' party members and other individuals who committed crimes against the roma , " the errc 's rob kushen said. msh / reuters / dpa editor : holly fox send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

thomas mueller , replacing french international franck ribery , gave the german giants the lead after 38 minutes , slotting home a cross from striker mario gomez into the top right corner .
but bavarian rivals nuremberg drew even on 54 minutes when striker ilkay guendogan took advantage of confusion in bayern 's defense to tap the ball home from short range .

besides being expensive , they have been used as official cars by two relief organizations in germany .
this has sparked outrage among donors and aid workers . the director of treberhilfe , a berlin-based non-profit organization aiding the homeless , found himself in a bind this week trying to explain why he was driving a maserati quattroporte , a flashy italian sports sedan that starts at about 90,000 euros -lrb- $ 120,000 -rrb- . when asked about the car , ehlert 's response was that " a maserati is a car for a gentleman . "
he added that his organization " worked unconventionally , but was absolutely respectable . " ehlert , who has a predilection for fedoras , fine leather shoes and silk scarves , said it was important " to make a good impression on prospective donors . " treberhilfe 's website has since been shut down after angry donors flooded the portal with emails , calling ehlert " asocial " and pledging never to donate again . christine lehmacher-dubberke , the spokeswoman for diakonie emergency aid - the social service umbrella organization of the german protestant church that treberhilfe belongs to - said a maserati was " not a suitable company car " and buying one for that purpose was " morally reprehensible .

she donated the prize money to hatun & can , but later filed charges against the group alleging fraud and misappropriation of funds . germany 's feminist number one said that her attempts to find out what her donation was being used for had landed on deaf ears and that she got only " short and vague answers .

but the gold went to britain 's amy williams . kerstin symkowiak and anja huber have won germany 's first ever medals in the skeleton event , clinching silver and bronze in vancouver late on friday .
their achievement is all the more impressive as it seemed impossible going into the final round .
the germans were fourth and fifth after three attempts , but both managed to leapfrog american noelle pikus-pace and canadian home favorite mellisa hollingsworth with solid times in the fourth , and final , round .
" i have worked long and hard towards this moment , " kerstin symkowiak told reporters before receiving her medal .
" i always knew that if i delivered four consistent runs , then anything was possible . "
symkowiak and anja huber are roommates at the vancouver games , and celebrated raucously together after the surprise result .
" i 've been on an emotional rollercoaster , " huber said .
" after the third run i did n't believe it was possible anymore .
now i am speechless , and ecstatic ! "
however , germany 's third hope , world champion marion trott , disappointed .
trott was never amongst the front runners , and finished in eighth position , one-and-a-half seconds adrift of the gold medal time .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : skeleton is a rather new olympic event , and it demands a lot of courage " here i failed to show what i 'm really capable of , " trott lamented .
historic gold while the german women secured the country 's first ever skeleton medals , amy williams won britain 's first gold medal in any individual winter olympics event since 1980 .
williams ended britain 's 30-year winter olympics drought with relative ease , leading from start to finish , and setting the fastest single time of the competition with her third run .

but the gold went to britain 's amy williams . kerstin symkowiak and anja huber have won germany 's first ever medals in the skeleton event , clinching silver and bronze in vancouver late on friday .
their achievement is all the more impressive as it seemed impossible going into the final round .
the germans were fourth and fifth after three attempts , but both managed to leapfrog american noelle pikus-pace and canadian home favorite mellisa hollingsworth with solid times in the fourth , and final , round .
" i have worked long and hard towards this moment , " kerstin symkowiak told reporters before receiving her medal .
" i always knew that if i delivered four consistent runs , then anything was possible . "
symkowiak and anja huber are roommates at the vancouver games , and celebrated raucously together after the surprise result .
" i 've been on an emotional rollercoaster , " huber said .
" after the third run i did n't believe it was possible anymore .
now i am speechless , and ecstatic ! "
however , germany 's third hope , world champion marion trott , disappointed .
trott was never amongst the front runners , and finished in eighth position , one-and-a-half seconds adrift of the gold medal time .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : skeleton is a rather new olympic event , and it demands a lot of courage " here i failed to show what i 'm really capable of , " trott lamented .
historic gold while the german women secured the country 's first ever skeleton medals , amy williams won britain 's first gold medal in any individual winter olympics event since 1980 .
williams ended britain 's 30-year winter olympics drought with relative ease , leading from start to finish , and setting the fastest single time of the competition with her third run .
" i ca n't believe it is actually happening right now , " williams said .
" i feel like i am in a little bubble , and i do n't know if it is at all real . "
williams , however , was doubtful for the competition until the last minute .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : dossier : the 60th berlin film festival opinion : berlin film festival should drop the fluff and aim higher films from war-torn regions set somber tone at berlinale berlinale reaches climax with awards ceremony german film ' jew suss ' booed at berlin film festival film -pipe- 20.02.2010 movie industry debate says hollywood is n't going anywhere großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : industry leaders asked whether hollywood had had its day industry leaders gathered at the european film market at this year 's berlinale to discuss the challenges facing the 21st century movie business .
the central question - is the era of the great hollywood studio over ? the european film market is the commercial arm of the berlin film festival .
held in tandem with the main event , the efm is an exchange floor for hundreds of potential movie deals - a forum where film producers compare ideas , struggling screenwriters try to bend the ears of high-powered executives , and where industry leaders look to the future and the challenges it holds .
one of the key issues this year was the global diversification of the entertainment industry , which is shaking up the way film deals are done around the world and threatening the dominance of the hollywood studio .
as more and more new hollywood movies are being financed , produced and shot outside the united states , film production companies are popping up like mushrooms all over the world , all serving the american audiences that make the us the biggest movie market in the world bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the efm debate was held parallel to the berlinale asian challenge but with cinema attendance sky-rocketing in places like china , and arab nations embarking on ambitious bids to build domestic film industries virtually from scratch , western producers will soon have to face the fact that the us is no longer the biggest market for movies .
the industry debate held at this year 's efm set out to answer the question whether this meant the beginning of the end for hollywood studio giants like fox , paramount and warner brothers ?
would a new model soon begin dominating the global film market ?
frederic sichler , an independent french film producer with close ties to the egyptian film business , had an unambiguous answer , for one simple reason – distribution .
" my answer is certainly not , " he said during the debate .
" there are two things to the us dominance : the control of distribution systems , and the production .
for any non-us company to have a distribution system in place that covers the world - i will not see it during my life , that 's for sure . "
instead , sichler predicts that a lot of very strong locally-focussed companies will emerge in places like china and india , where the demand for domestic movies is huge and expected to grow even more .
this will obviously have a major influence on the macro-economic picture , but sichler believes this will be evolutionary , not revolutionary .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : constantin produces and distributes major german movies like ' the baader meinhof complex ' keeping pace by diversifying no single company will rival fox , but a global network of companies will present strong alternatives .
" what has changed is that to produce international content , and to have a global distribution network , you do n't have only one model , which is to deal with the studio , " sichler said .
" you can assemble several partners all around the world which can ultimately deliver the same result . "
but christian grass , president of international production and acquisitions at universal pictures international , admitted that large us studios like his needed to keep pace with the global industry by diversifying along with it .
" speaking for universal , the idea is to be more active in the international market , and supplement the business that comes from the studio with more local and international productions , " he said .
european film production companies like germany 's constantin and the french studiocanal have also come to present a viable alternative to hollywood , if only in the european market .
ron halpern , responsible for international productions and acquisitions for studiocanal , says companies like his are large enough and better-placed to distribute films in europe 's three major markets : germany , britain and france .
" i think what 's interesting at studiocanal is because we are at-the-source distributors in these three territories , we can get feedback very early from three countries with pretty different points of view , " he told the debate .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ' slumdog millionaire ' was a rare example of an internationally-produced global hit in other words , being smaller and closer to the ground can mean that you are better at marketing and distributing a movie in a specific place .
after the debate , halpern told deutsche welle that this was exactly why studiocanal does not keep an office in los angeles : " if you have an office there then ... if you have n't brought in a film in a year , then why are you there ?
so at the end of the year you 're like , " shit , i gotta find a film . "
as the british / indian co-production ' slumdog millionaire ' showed last year , hollywood is no longer necessary to produce a major , internationally successful film .
but the efm 's panellists agreed that the success of that film was still an exception , rather than a rule – the old hollywood truism that american audiences are prepared to see one foreign film per year still holds .
hollywood is still the only force in the film industry with the infrastructure to distribute a major 200 million dollar production around the world .
and that is unlikely to change any time soon .

the central question - is the era of the great hollywood studio over ? the european film market is the commercial arm of the berlin film festival .
held in tandem with the main event , the efm is an exchange floor for hundreds of potential movie deals - a forum where film producers compare ideas , struggling screenwriters try to bend the ears of high-powered executives , and where industry leaders look to the future and the challenges it holds .
one of the key issues this year was the global diversification of the entertainment industry , which is shaking up the way film deals are done around the world and threatening the dominance of the hollywood studio .
as more and more new hollywood movies are being financed , produced and shot outside the united states , film production companies are popping up like mushrooms all over the world , all serving the american audiences that make the us the biggest movie market in the world bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the efm debate was held parallel to the berlinale asian challenge but with cinema attendance sky-rocketing in places like china , and arab nations embarking on ambitious bids to build domestic film industries virtually from scratch , western producers will soon have to face the fact that the us is no longer the biggest market for movies .
the industry debate held at this year 's efm set out to answer the question whether this meant the beginning of the end for hollywood studio giants like fox , paramount and warner brothers ?
would a new model soon begin dominating the global film market ?
frederic sichler , an independent french film producer with close ties to the egyptian film business , had an unambiguous answer , for one simple reason – distribution .
" my answer is certainly not , " he said during the debate .
" there are two things to the us dominance : the control of distribution systems , and the production .
for any non-us company to have a distribution system in place that covers the world - i will not see it during my life , that 's for sure . "
instead , sichler predicts that a lot of very strong locally-focussed companies will emerge in places like china and india , where the demand for domestic movies is huge and expected to grow even more .
this will obviously have a major influence on the macro-economic picture , but sichler believes this will be evolutionary , not revolutionary .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : constantin produces and distributes major german movies like ' the baader meinhof complex ' keeping pace by diversifying no single company will rival fox , but a global network of companies will present strong alternatives .
" what has changed is that to produce international content , and to have a global distribution network , you do n't have only one model , which is to deal with the studio , " sichler said .
" you can assemble several partners all around the world which can ultimately deliver the same result . "
but christian grass , president of international production and acquisitions at universal pictures international , admitted that large us studios like his needed to keep pace with the global industry by diversifying along with it .
" speaking for universal , the idea is to be more active in the international market , and supplement the business that comes from the studio with more local and international productions , " he said .
european film production companies like germany 's constantin and the french studiocanal have also come to present a viable alternative to hollywood , if only in the european market .
ron halpern , responsible for international productions and acquisitions for studiocanal , says companies like his are large enough and better-placed to distribute films in europe 's three major markets : germany , britain and france .
" i think what 's interesting at studiocanal is because we are at-the-source distributors in these three territories , we can get feedback very early from three countries with pretty different points of view , " he told the debate .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ' slumdog millionaire ' was a rare example of an internationally-produced global hit in other words , being smaller and closer to the ground can mean that you are better at marketing and distributing a movie in a specific place .
after the debate , halpern told deutsche welle that this was exactly why studiocanal does not keep an office in los angeles : " if you have an office there then ... if you have n't brought in a film in a year , then why are you there ?
so at the end of the year you 're like , " shit , i gotta find a film . "
as the british / indian co-production ' slumdog millionaire ' showed last year , hollywood is no longer necessary to produce a major , internationally successful film .
but the efm 's panellists agreed that the success of that film was still an exception , rather than a rule – the old hollywood truism that american audiences are prepared to see one foreign film per year still holds .
hollywood is still the only force in the film industry with the infrastructure to distribute a major 200 million dollar production around the world .
and that is unlikely to change any time soon .

the central question - is the era of the great hollywood studio over ? the european film market is the commercial arm of the berlin film festival .
held in tandem with the main event , the efm is an exchange floor for hundreds of potential movie deals - a forum where film producers compare ideas , struggling screenwriters try to bend the ears of high-powered executives , and where industry leaders look to the future and the challenges it holds .
one of the key issues this year was the global diversification of the entertainment industry , which is shaking up the way film deals are done around the world and threatening the dominance of the hollywood studio .
as more and more new hollywood movies are being financed , produced and shot outside the united states , film production companies are popping up like mushrooms all over the world , all serving the american audiences that make the us the biggest movie market in the world bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the efm debate was held parallel to the berlinale asian challenge but with cinema attendance sky-rocketing in places like china , and arab nations embarking on ambitious bids to build domestic film industries virtually from scratch , western producers will soon have to face the fact that the us is no longer the biggest market for movies .
the industry debate held at this year 's efm set out to answer the question whether this meant the beginning of the end for hollywood studio giants like fox , paramount and warner brothers ?
would a new model soon begin dominating the global film market ?
frederic sichler , an independent french film producer with close ties to the egyptian film business , had an unambiguous answer , for one simple reason – distribution .
" my answer is certainly not , " he said during the debate .
" there are two things to the us dominance : the control of distribution systems , and the production .
for any non-us company to have a distribution system in place that covers the world - i will not see it during my life , that 's for sure . "
instead , sichler predicts that a lot of very strong locally-focussed companies will emerge in places like china and india , where the demand for domestic movies is huge and expected to grow even more .
this will obviously have a major influence on the macro-economic picture , but sichler believes this will be evolutionary , not revolutionary .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : constantin produces and distributes major german movies like ' the baader meinhof complex ' keeping pace by diversifying no single company will rival fox , but a global network of companies will present strong alternatives .
" what has changed is that to produce international content , and to have a global distribution network , you do n't have only one model , which is to deal with the studio , " sichler said .
" you can assemble several partners all around the world which can ultimately deliver the same result . "
but christian grass , president of international production and acquisitions at universal pictures international , admitted that large us studios like his needed to keep pace with the global industry by diversifying along with it .
" speaking for universal , the idea is to be more active in the international market , and supplement the business that comes from the studio with more local and international productions , " he said .
european film production companies like germany 's constantin and the french studiocanal have also come to present a viable alternative to hollywood , if only in the european market .
ron halpern , responsible for international productions and acquisitions for studiocanal , says companies like his are large enough and better-placed to distribute films in europe 's three major markets : germany , britain and france .
" i think what 's interesting at studiocanal is because we are at-the-source distributors in these three territories , we can get feedback very early from three countries with pretty different points of view , " he told the debate .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ' slumdog millionaire ' was a rare example of an internationally-produced global hit in other words , being smaller and closer to the ground can mean that you are better at marketing and distributing a movie in a specific place .
after the debate , halpern told deutsche welle that this was exactly why studiocanal does not keep an office in los angeles : " if you have an office there then ... if you have n't brought in a film in a year , then why are you there ?
so at the end of the year you 're like , " shit , i gotta find a film . "
as the british / indian co-production ' slumdog millionaire ' showed last year , hollywood is no longer necessary to produce a major , internationally successful film .
but the efm 's panellists agreed that the success of that film was still an exception , rather than a rule – the old hollywood truism that american audiences are prepared to see one foreign film per year still holds .
hollywood is still the only force in the film industry with the infrastructure to distribute a major 200 million dollar production around the world .
and that is unlikely to change any time soon .

without allocating blame to either side , " still alive in gaza " shows what life is like in the aftermath of a disaster .

" what i filmed in gaza - you can see the same things in haiti , bosnia or rwanda .
after going through the worst , people want to live . " that is also the case in the small town of burros , northwest of ramallah .
the local people simply wanted to continue leading their lives like their ancestors had for many generations .
but in 2003 , the israeli government decided to build a security barrier between the west bank and israel .
the fence was to cut right through the village of budrus , and across the fields that provided the livelihoods of the local farmers . the non-violent protests organized by budrus village leader ayed morrar and his daughter iltezam against the measure made international headlines .
local men , women and children as well as members of the rivalling palestinian organizations hamas and fatah and various international and israeli peace activists participated . finding common ground bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the isreali fence cuts through fields and villages in the west bank for five years , american documentary filmmaker julia bacha followed the developments in budrus with her camera .

and it 's not about nostalgia or cloying sentimentality , but about critically analyzing the situation .
coming to terms with the past is meant to help understand the present better - in order to be able to shape the future constructively . ' violence is no solution ' " our film wants to show that violence is no solution , " said iraqi director mohamed al-daradji . his film " son of babylon " is set in iraq , a few weeks after the fall of saddam hussein ’ s regime .
ahmed , a bright 12-year-old kurdish boy , sets off with his grandmother in search of his father who was arrested by saddam 's republican guard at the end of the gulf war .

" we put down our guns in gaza , instead we took microphones in our hands , " raps the palestinian group darg team in one of their songs .
swiss documentary director nicolas wadimoff met the rappers in 2009 , a month after the end of the israeli military attack on gaza . living on after the worst has happened bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " you could find the same stories in haiti or rwanda , " said filmmaker nicolas wadimoff his documentary " still alive in gaza " -lrb- " aisheen " -rrb- focuses on a region that has suffered war and destruction for decades .
without allocating blame to either side , " still alive in gaza " shows what life is like in the aftermath of a disaster .
the film presents people who do n't give up amid grief , despair and destruction . " it is about being human , " wadimoff said .
" what i filmed in gaza - you can see the same things in haiti , bosnia or rwanda .
after going through the worst , people want to live . " that is also the case in the small town of burros , northwest of ramallah .
the local people simply wanted to continue leading their lives like their ancestors had for many generations .
but in 2003 , the israeli government decided to build a security barrier between the west bank and israel .
the fence was to cut right through the village of budrus , and across the fields that provided the livelihoods of the local farmers . the non-violent protests organized by budrus village leader ayed morrar and his daughter iltezam against the measure made international headlines .
local men , women and children as well as members of the rivalling palestinian organizations hamas and fatah and various international and israeli peace activists participated . finding common ground bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the isreali fence cuts through fields and villages in the west bank for five years , american documentary filmmaker julia bacha followed the developments in budrus with her camera .
her film addresses many controversial issues and neither refrains from showing the aggressive reactions of israeli soldiers to the protests nor the moments when palestinian protesters and israelis start to find common ground . " i visited my father in prison many times , and all the israelis i met there were very , very bad , " 15-year-old iltezam said in the film .
" but now i know that not all the israelis are the same .
some of them think that we should live together in peace . " many films at this year 's berlin film festival take a multilayered approach in presenting ways of coping with conflict .
and it 's not about nostalgia or cloying sentimentality , but about critically analyzing the situation .
coming to terms with the past is meant to help understand the present better - in order to be able to shape the future constructively . ' violence is no solution ' " our film wants to show that violence is no solution , " said iraqi director mohamed al-daradji . his film " son of babylon " is set in iraq , a few weeks after the fall of saddam hussein ’ s regime .
ahmed , a bright 12-year-old kurdish boy , sets off with his grandmother in search of his father who was arrested by saddam 's republican guard at the end of the gulf war .
as they travel along bombed out desert tracks they encounter others with similar quests , searching for a new beginning . " son of babylon " was shot on location in iraq and relies on a cast of nonprofessional actors .
the female lead is played by a kurd , shezad hussen , the only female witness to testify during the trial against saddam hussein . during saddam 's regime , hundreds of thousands of civilians were killed , thousands of kurdish villages destroyed and more than 1.5 million kurds were forced to flee their homes in northern iraq . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : searching for a new beginning in a country ravaged by terror " i hope that in the future we will speak three languages in iraq : arabic , kurdish and turkmen , " al-daradji said . in the film , the boy 's journey ends at the recently uncovered mass graves from the time of saddam hussein 's regime .

the judge ruled the party 's program to be xenophobic , racist , chauvinist , homophobic and anti-semitic . tomas vandas , the leader of the far-right czech workers ' party , told local television broadcasters that he intends to appeal against a court decision to outlaw his political group .
the supreme administrative court in brno outlawed the far-right party , describing it as xenophobic , racist , chauvinist , homophobic and anti-semitic , in a verdict broadcast live on national television .
" this ruling needs to be understood as a preventative one , to maintain the constitutional and democratic order in the future , " judge vojtech simicek said on wednesday .
the court also said that the party , founded in 2003 , drew inspiration from the doctrines of the german nazi party and had links to openly white supremacist and racist groups .
the workers ' party is the first in the czech republic to be outlawed on the grounds of extremism .
the most recent regional examples of such a move date from before the fall of communist rule in 1989 .
the workers ' party , as part of its opposition to the process , called on its members to picket the courtroom and disrupt the decision , however , only about 50 of them showed up .

" i said right from the very beginning that in a democratic society the battle against extremism never ends .
however , we can fight the manifestations of far-right activity , " pecina said in the courtroom in brno after the verdict .
pecina said that authorities faced a choice , either stamp these groups out as soon as they emerged , " or we can wait for police cars to be set on fire and petrol bombs to be thrown .
so i 'm convinced that we acted at the right moment , and that each step - like the one taken today - significantly weakens the neo-nazi movement . "
the workers ' party has garnered support from the relatively thin ranks of czech neo-nazis , but also appealed to some voters frustrated by social and ethnic tensions , especially in neighborhoods inhabited by the minority roma population .
the european roma rights center -lrb- errc -rrb- , a support group for the roma population , welcomed the decision , saying they hoped it would improve living conditions for roma people in the czech republic .

pecina said that authorities faced a choice , either stamp these groups out as soon as they emerged , " or we can wait for police cars to be set on fire and petrol bombs to be thrown .
so i 'm convinced that we acted at the right moment , and that each step - like the one taken today - significantly weakens the neo-nazi movement . "
the workers ' party has garnered support from the relatively thin ranks of czech neo-nazis , but also appealed to some voters frustrated by social and ethnic tensions , especially in neighborhoods inhabited by the minority roma population .
the european roma rights center -lrb- errc -rrb- , a support group for the roma population , welcomed the decision , saying they hoped it would improve living conditions for roma people in the czech republic .

the judge ruled the party 's program to be xenophobic , racist , chauvinist , homophobic and anti-semitic . tomas vandas , the leader of the far-right czech workers ' party , told local television broadcasters that he intends to appeal against a court decision to outlaw his political group .
the supreme administrative court in brno outlawed the far-right party , describing it as xenophobic , racist , chauvinist , homophobic and anti-semitic , in a verdict broadcast live on national television .
" this ruling needs to be understood as a preventative one , to maintain the constitutional and democratic order in the future , " judge vojtech simicek said on wednesday .
the court also said that the party , founded in 2003 , drew inspiration from the doctrines of the german nazi party and had links to openly white supremacist and racist groups .
the workers ' party is the first in the czech republic to be outlawed on the grounds of extremism .
the most recent regional examples of such a move date from before the fall of communist rule in 1989 .
the workers ' party , as part of its opposition to the process , called on its members to picket the courtroom and disrupt the decision , however , only about 50 of them showed up .
weakening the movement bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the court ruled that the party was influenced by hitler 's writing more mainstream political groups welcomed the decision , especially interior minister martin pecina , who filed the motion on behalf of cabinet .
" i said right from the very beginning that in a democratic society the battle against extremism never ends .
however , we can fight the manifestations of far-right activity , " pecina said in the courtroom in brno after the verdict .
pecina said that authorities faced a choice , either stamp these groups out as soon as they emerged , " or we can wait for police cars to be set on fire and petrol bombs to be thrown .
so i 'm convinced that we acted at the right moment , and that each step - like the one taken today - significantly weakens the neo-nazi movement . "
the workers ' party has garnered support from the relatively thin ranks of czech neo-nazis , but also appealed to some voters frustrated by social and ethnic tensions , especially in neighborhoods inhabited by the minority roma population .

besides being expensive , they have been used as official cars by two relief organizations in germany .
this has sparked outrage among donors and aid workers . the director of treberhilfe , a berlin-based non-profit organization aiding the homeless , found himself in a bind this week trying to explain why he was driving a maserati quattroporte , a flashy italian sports sedan that starts at about 90,000 euros -lrb- $ 120,000 -rrb- . when asked about the car , ehlert 's response was that " a maserati is a car for a gentleman .

he added that his organization " worked unconventionally , but was absolutely respectable . " ehlert , who has a predilection for fedoras , fine leather shoes and silk scarves , said it was important " to make a good impression on prospective donors . " treberhilfe 's website has since been shut down after angry donors flooded the portal with emails , calling ehlert " asocial " and pledging never to donate again . christine lehmacher-dubberke , the spokeswoman for diakonie emergency aid - the social service umbrella organization of the german protestant church that treberhilfe belongs to - said a maserati was " not a suitable company car " and buying one for that purpose was " morally reprehensible .

" last year .
she donated the prize money to hatun & can , but later filed charges against the group alleging fraud and misappropriation of funds . germany 's feminist number one said that her attempts to find out what her donation was being used for had landed on deaf ears and that she got only " short and vague answers .

besides being expensive , they have been used as official cars by two relief organizations in germany .
this has sparked outrage among donors and aid workers . the director of treberhilfe , a berlin-based non-profit organization aiding the homeless , found himself in a bind this week trying to explain why he was driving a maserati quattroporte , a flashy italian sports sedan that starts at about 90,000 euros -lrb- $ 120,000 -rrb- . when asked about the car , ehlert 's response was that " a maserati is a car for a gentleman . "
he added that his organization " worked unconventionally , but was absolutely respectable . " ehlert , who has a predilection for fedoras , fine leather shoes and silk scarves , said it was important " to make a good impression on prospective donors . " treberhilfe 's website has since been shut down after angry donors flooded the portal with emails , calling ehlert " asocial " and pledging never to donate again . christine lehmacher-dubberke , the spokeswoman for diakonie emergency aid - the social service umbrella organization of the german protestant church that treberhilfe belongs to - said a maserati was " not a suitable company car " and buying one for that purpose was " morally reprehensible . " " mr. ehlert believes he needs the car , " she said .
" we see that differently . " police probe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schwarzer claims funds have been misappropriated meanwhile , police and state prosecutors are investigating claims of fraud and embezzlement at the berlin-based women 's relief group , hatun & can , after it surfaced that the organization was using a large , upscale , all-terrain vehicle as a company car . police have since confiscated a land rover and frozen most of the group 's bank accounts . the case came to light after alice schwarzer , a prominent german feminist and women 's magazine publisher , won 500,000 euros on the celebrity edition of the television game show " who wants to be a millionaire ? " last year .
she donated the prize money to hatun & can , but later filed charges against the group alleging fraud and misappropriation of funds . germany 's feminist number one said that her attempts to find out what her donation was being used for had landed on deaf ears and that she got only " short and vague answers . " the women 's organization rejected the allegations . " -lsb- schwarzer 's -rsb- accusations are legally absurd and her charges - a catastrophic mistake , " said hubert dreyling , a lawyer for hatun & can .

their achievement is all the more impressive as it seemed impossible going into the final round .
the germans were fourth and fifth after three attempts , but both managed to leapfrog american noelle pikus-pace and canadian home favorite mellisa hollingsworth with solid times in the fourth , and final , round .
" i have worked long and hard towards this moment , " kerstin symkowiak told reporters before receiving her medal .

williams ended britain 's 30-year winter olympics drought with relative ease , leading from start to finish , and setting the fastest single time of the competition with her third run .
" i ca n't believe it is actually happening right now , " williams said .
" i feel like i am in a little bubble , and i do n't know if it is at all real . "
williams , however , was doubtful for the competition until the last minute .
a protest over the special design of her helmet , which the us argued provided an illegal aerodynamic advantage , put williams ' olympic fate in doubt . organizers dismissed the appeal shortly before the competition began .

the judge ruled the party 's program to be xenophobic , racist , chauvinist , homophobic and anti-semitic . tomas vandas , the leader of the far-right czech workers ' party , told local television broadcasters that he intends to appeal against a court decision to outlaw his political group .
the supreme administrative court in brno outlawed the far-right party , describing it as xenophobic , racist , chauvinist , homophobic and anti-semitic , in a verdict broadcast live on national television .
" this ruling needs to be understood as a preventative one , to maintain the constitutional and democratic order in the future , " judge vojtech simicek said on wednesday .
the court also said that the party , founded in 2003 , drew inspiration from the doctrines of the german nazi party and had links to openly white supremacist and racist groups .
the workers ' party is the first in the czech republic to be outlawed on the grounds of extremism .
the most recent regional examples of such a move date from before the fall of communist rule in 1989 .
the workers ' party , as part of its opposition to the process , called on its members to picket the courtroom and disrupt the decision , however , only about 50 of them showed up .
weakening the movement bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the court ruled that the party was influenced by hitler 's writing more mainstream political groups welcomed the decision , especially interior minister martin pecina , who filed the motion on behalf of cabinet .
" i said right from the very beginning that in a democratic society the battle against extremism never ends .
however , we can fight the manifestations of far-right activity , " pecina said in the courtroom in brno after the verdict .
pecina said that authorities faced a choice , either stamp these groups out as soon as they emerged , " or we can wait for police cars to be set on fire and petrol bombs to be thrown .
so i 'm convinced that we acted at the right moment , and that each step - like the one taken today - significantly weakens the neo-nazi movement . "
the workers ' party has garnered support from the relatively thin ranks of czech neo-nazis , but also appealed to some voters frustrated by social and ethnic tensions , especially in neighborhoods inhabited by the minority roma population .
the european roma rights center -lrb- errc -rrb- , a support group for the roma population , welcomed the decision , saying they hoped it would improve living conditions for roma people in the czech republic .
" more importantly , however , the czech authorities must act aggressively to prosecute workers ' party members and other individuals who committed crimes against the roma , " the errc 's rob kushen said. msh / reuters / dpa editor : holly fox send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the exciting , if somewhat scrappy match finished 2-2 . hoffenheim and borussia moenchengladbach played out a 2-2 draw in the bundesliga 's friday fixture .
the two sides delivered an exciting , offensive match , but it was also littered with mistakes .
hoffenheim started strong , but could n't take the lead in front of their home crowd ; demba ba , carlos eduardo , and vedad ibisevic all let excellent scoring chances go begging .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moenchengladbach took the lead through a controversial penalty however , a controversial handball by hoffenheim defender per nilsson led to the opening goal for moenchengladbach .
the referee decided to award a penalty , and showed nilsson the yellow card , although replays showed that the swede 's transgression actually took place outside the penalty area .
moenchengladbach 's belgian captain filip daems made no mistake from the spot and put his team ahead .
the visitors added another shortly after half time through israeli striker roberto colautti .
but in the last twenty minutes hoffenheim , having lost their way after their strong start , came back to life .
on 69 minutes , carlos eduardo carved through the moenchengladbach back line and provided vedad ibisevic with a chance that was just too good to turn down .
then , with just moments remaining , gladbach captain filip daems blocked a cross with his arm in the penalty area , conceding a penalty for the hosts .
carlos eduardo stepped up and slotted the ball home , rescuing the draw and a valuable bundesliga point for hoffenheim .
hoffenheim and moenchengladbach remain glued together in the mid-table , in ninth and tenth positions , with 28 points apiece .

but hoffenheim recovered to salvage a point .
the exciting , if somewhat scrappy match finished 2-2 . hoffenheim and borussia moenchengladbach played out a 2-2 draw in the bundesliga 's friday fixture .
the two sides delivered an exciting , offensive match , but it was also littered with mistakes .
hoffenheim started strong , but could n't take the lead in front of their home crowd ; demba ba , carlos eduardo , and vedad ibisevic all let excellent scoring chances go begging .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moenchengladbach took the lead through a controversial penalty however , a controversial handball by hoffenheim defender per nilsson led to the opening goal for moenchengladbach .
the referee decided to award a penalty , and showed nilsson the yellow card , although replays showed that the swede 's transgression actually took place outside the penalty area .
moenchengladbach 's belgian captain filip daems made no mistake from the spot and put his team ahead .
the visitors added another shortly after half time through israeli striker roberto colautti .
but in the last twenty minutes hoffenheim , having lost their way after their strong start , came back to life .
on 69 minutes , carlos eduardo carved through the moenchengladbach back line and provided vedad ibisevic with a chance that was just too good to turn down .
then , with just moments remaining , gladbach captain filip daems blocked a cross with his arm in the penalty area , conceding a penalty for the hosts .
carlos eduardo stepped up and slotted the ball home , rescuing the draw and a valuable bundesliga point for hoffenheim .
hoffenheim and moenchengladbach remain glued together in the mid-table , in ninth and tenth positions , with 28 points apiece .

the central question - is the era of the great hollywood studio over ? the european film market is the commercial arm of the berlin film festival .
held in tandem with the main event , the efm is an exchange floor for hundreds of potential movie deals - a forum where film producers compare ideas , struggling screenwriters try to bend the ears of high-powered executives , and where industry leaders look to the future and the challenges it holds .
one of the key issues this year was the global diversification of the entertainment industry , which is shaking up the way film deals are done around the world and threatening the dominance of the hollywood studio .
as more and more new hollywood movies are being financed , produced and shot outside the united states , film production companies are popping up like mushrooms all over the world , all serving the american audiences that make the us the biggest movie market in the world bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the efm debate was held parallel to the berlinale asian challenge but with cinema attendance sky-rocketing in places like china , and arab nations embarking on ambitious bids to build domestic film industries virtually from scratch , western producers will soon have to face the fact that the us is no longer the biggest market for movies .
the industry debate held at this year 's efm set out to answer the question whether this meant the beginning of the end for hollywood studio giants like fox , paramount and warner brothers ?
would a new model soon begin dominating the global film market ?
frederic sichler , an independent french film producer with close ties to the egyptian film business , had an unambiguous answer , for one simple reason – distribution .
" my answer is certainly not , " he said during the debate .
" there are two things to the us dominance : the control of distribution systems , and the production .
for any non-us company to have a distribution system in place that covers the world - i will not see it during my life , that 's for sure . "
instead , sichler predicts that a lot of very strong locally-focussed companies will emerge in places like china and india , where the demand for domestic movies is huge and expected to grow even more .
this will obviously have a major influence on the macro-economic picture , but sichler believes this will be evolutionary , not revolutionary .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : constantin produces and distributes major german movies like ' the baader meinhof complex ' keeping pace by diversifying no single company will rival fox , but a global network of companies will present strong alternatives .
" what has changed is that to produce international content , and to have a global distribution network , you do n't have only one model , which is to deal with the studio , " sichler said .
" you can assemble several partners all around the world which can ultimately deliver the same result . "
but christian grass , president of international production and acquisitions at universal pictures international , admitted that large us studios like his needed to keep pace with the global industry by diversifying along with it .
" speaking for universal , the idea is to be more active in the international market , and supplement the business that comes from the studio with more local and international productions , " he said .
european film production companies like germany 's constantin and the french studiocanal have also come to present a viable alternative to hollywood , if only in the european market .
ron halpern , responsible for international productions and acquisitions for studiocanal , says companies like his are large enough and better-placed to distribute films in europe 's three major markets : germany , britain and france .
" i think what 's interesting at studiocanal is because we are at-the-source distributors in these three territories , we can get feedback very early from three countries with pretty different points of view , " he told the debate .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ' slumdog millionaire ' was a rare example of an internationally-produced global hit in other words , being smaller and closer to the ground can mean that you are better at marketing and distributing a movie in a specific place .
after the debate , halpern told deutsche welle that this was exactly why studiocanal does not keep an office in los angeles : " if you have an office there then ... if you have n't brought in a film in a year , then why are you there ?
so at the end of the year you 're like , " shit , i gotta find a film . "
as the british / indian co-production ' slumdog millionaire ' showed last year , hollywood is no longer necessary to produce a major , internationally successful film .
but the efm 's panellists agreed that the success of that film was still an exception , rather than a rule – the old hollywood truism that american audiences are prepared to see one foreign film per year still holds .
hollywood is still the only force in the film industry with the infrastructure to distribute a major 200 million dollar production around the world .
and that is unlikely to change any time soon .

european film production companies like germany 's constantin and the french studiocanal have also come to present a viable alternative to hollywood , if only in the european market .

so at the end of the year you 're like , " shit , i gotta find a film . "
as the british / indian co-production ' slumdog millionaire ' showed last year , hollywood is no longer necessary to produce a major , internationally successful film .
but the efm 's panellists agreed that the success of that film was still an exception , rather than a rule – the old hollywood truism that american audiences are prepared to see one foreign film per year still holds .
hollywood is still the only force in the film industry with the infrastructure to distribute a major 200 million dollar production around the world .
and that is unlikely to change any time soon .

" we put down our guns in gaza , instead we took microphones in our hands , " raps the palestinian group darg team in one of their songs .
swiss documentary director nicolas wadimoff met the rappers in 2009 , a month after the end of the israeli military attack on gaza . living on after the worst has happened bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " you could find the same stories in haiti or rwanda , " said filmmaker nicolas wadimoff his documentary " still alive in gaza " -lrb- " aisheen " -rrb- focuses on a region that has suffered war and destruction for decades .
without allocating blame to either side , " still alive in gaza " shows what life is like in the aftermath of a disaster .
the film presents people who do n't give up amid grief , despair and destruction . " it is about being human , " wadimoff said .
" what i filmed in gaza - you can see the same things in haiti , bosnia or rwanda .
after going through the worst , people want to live . " that is also the case in the small town of burros , northwest of ramallah .
the local people simply wanted to continue leading their lives like their ancestors had for many generations .
but in 2003 , the israeli government decided to build a security barrier between the west bank and israel .
the fence was to cut right through the village of budrus , and across the fields that provided the livelihoods of the local farmers . the non-violent protests organized by budrus village leader ayed morrar and his daughter iltezam against the measure made international headlines .
local men , women and children as well as members of the rivalling palestinian organizations hamas and fatah and various international and israeli peace activists participated . finding common ground bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the isreali fence cuts through fields and villages in the west bank for five years , american documentary filmmaker julia bacha followed the developments in budrus with her camera .
her film addresses many controversial issues and neither refrains from showing the aggressive reactions of israeli soldiers to the protests nor the moments when palestinian protesters and israelis start to find common ground . " i visited my father in prison many times , and all the israelis i met there were very , very bad , " 15-year-old iltezam said in the film .
" but now i know that not all the israelis are the same .
some of them think that we should live together in peace . " many films at this year 's berlin film festival take a multilayered approach in presenting ways of coping with conflict .
and it 's not about nostalgia or cloying sentimentality , but about critically analyzing the situation .
coming to terms with the past is meant to help understand the present better - in order to be able to shape the future constructively . ' violence is no solution ' " our film wants to show that violence is no solution , " said iraqi director mohamed al-daradji . his film " son of babylon " is set in iraq , a few weeks after the fall of saddam hussein ’ s regime .
ahmed , a bright 12-year-old kurdish boy , sets off with his grandmother in search of his father who was arrested by saddam 's republican guard at the end of the gulf war .
as they travel along bombed out desert tracks they encounter others with similar quests , searching for a new beginning . " son of babylon " was shot on location in iraq and relies on a cast of nonprofessional actors .
the female lead is played by a kurd , shezad hussen , the only female witness to testify during the trial against saddam hussein . during saddam 's regime , hundreds of thousands of civilians were killed , thousands of kurdish villages destroyed and more than 1.5 million kurds were forced to flee their homes in northern iraq . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : searching for a new beginning in a country ravaged by terror " i hope that in the future we will speak three languages in iraq : arabic , kurdish and turkmen , " al-daradji said . in the film , the boy 's journey ends at the recently uncovered mass graves from the time of saddam hussein 's regime .
yet al-daradji , like other filmmakers at this year ’ s festival show that even though the past is still very present , in a place ravaged by war , dignity and understanding are also possible . author : silke bartlick -lrb- ara -rrb- editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but in 2003 , the israeli government decided to build a security barrier between the west bank and israel .
the fence was to cut right through the village of budrus , and across the fields that provided the livelihoods of the local farmers . the non-violent protests organized by budrus village leader ayed morrar and his daughter iltezam against the measure made international headlines .
local men , women and children as well as members of the rivalling palestinian organizations hamas and fatah and various international and israeli peace activists participated . finding common ground bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the isreali fence cuts through fields and villages in the west bank for five years , american documentary filmmaker julia bacha followed the developments in budrus with her camera .
her film addresses many controversial issues and neither refrains from showing the aggressive reactions of israeli soldiers to the protests nor the moments when palestinian protesters and israelis start to find common ground . " i visited my father in prison many times , and all the israelis i met there were very , very bad , " 15-year-old iltezam said in the film .
" but now i know that not all the israelis are the same .
some of them think that we should live together in peace . " many films at this year 's berlin film festival take a multilayered approach in presenting ways of coping with conflict .
and it 's not about nostalgia or cloying sentimentality , but about critically analyzing the situation .
coming to terms with the past is meant to help understand the present better - in order to be able to shape the future constructively . ' violence is no solution ' " our film wants to show that violence is no solution , " said iraqi director mohamed al-daradji . his film " son of babylon " is set in iraq , a few weeks after the fall of saddam hussein ’ s regime .
ahmed , a bright 12-year-old kurdish boy , sets off with his grandmother in search of his father who was arrested by saddam 's republican guard at the end of the gulf war .
as they travel along bombed out desert tracks they encounter others with similar quests , searching for a new beginning . " son of babylon " was shot on location in iraq and relies on a cast of nonprofessional actors .
the female lead is played by a kurd , shezad hussen , the only female witness to testify during the trial against saddam hussein . during saddam 's regime , hundreds of thousands of civilians were killed , thousands of kurdish villages destroyed and more than 1.5 million kurds were forced to flee their homes in northern iraq . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : searching for a new beginning in a country ravaged by terror " i hope that in the future we will speak three languages in iraq : arabic , kurdish and turkmen , " al-daradji said . in the film , the boy 's journey ends at the recently uncovered mass graves from the time of saddam hussein 's regime .
yet al-daradji , like other filmmakers at this year ’ s festival show that even though the past is still very present , in a place ravaged by war , dignity and understanding are also possible . author : silke bartlick -lrb- ara -rrb- editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the judge ruled the party 's program to be xenophobic , racist , chauvinist , homophobic and anti-semitic . tomas vandas , the leader of the far-right czech workers ' party , told local television broadcasters that he intends to appeal against a court decision to outlaw his political group .
the supreme administrative court in brno outlawed the far-right party , describing it as xenophobic , racist , chauvinist , homophobic and anti-semitic , in a verdict broadcast live on national television .
" this ruling needs to be understood as a preventative one , to maintain the constitutional and democratic order in the future , " judge vojtech simicek said on wednesday .
the court also said that the party , founded in 2003 , drew inspiration from the doctrines of the german nazi party and had links to openly white supremacist and racist groups .
the workers ' party is the first in the czech republic to be outlawed on the grounds of extremism .
the most recent regional examples of such a move date from before the fall of communist rule in 1989 .

" i said right from the very beginning that in a democratic society the battle against extremism never ends .
however , we can fight the manifestations of far-right activity , " pecina said in the courtroom in brno after the verdict .
pecina said that authorities faced a choice , either stamp these groups out as soon as they emerged , " or we can wait for police cars to be set on fire and petrol bombs to be thrown .
so i 'm convinced that we acted at the right moment , and that each step - like the one taken today - significantly weakens the neo-nazi movement . "
the workers ' party has garnered support from the relatively thin ranks of czech neo-nazis , but also appealed to some voters frustrated by social and ethnic tensions , especially in neighborhoods inhabited by the minority roma population .

" we put down our guns in gaza , instead we took microphones in our hands , " raps the palestinian group darg team in one of their songs .
swiss documentary director nicolas wadimoff met the rappers in 2009 , a month after the end of the israeli military attack on gaza . living on after the worst has happened bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " you could find the same stories in haiti or rwanda , " said filmmaker nicolas wadimoff his documentary " still alive in gaza " -lrb- " aisheen " -rrb- focuses on a region that has suffered war and destruction for decades .
without allocating blame to either side , " still alive in gaza " shows what life is like in the aftermath of a disaster .
the film presents people who do n't give up amid grief , despair and destruction . " it is about being human , " wadimoff said .
" what i filmed in gaza - you can see the same things in haiti , bosnia or rwanda .
after going through the worst , people want to live . " that is also the case in the small town of burros , northwest of ramallah .
the local people simply wanted to continue leading their lives like their ancestors had for many generations .
but in 2003 , the israeli government decided to build a security barrier between the west bank and israel .
the fence was to cut right through the village of budrus , and across the fields that provided the livelihoods of the local farmers . the non-violent protests organized by budrus village leader ayed morrar and his daughter iltezam against the measure made international headlines .
local men , women and children as well as members of the rivalling palestinian organizations hamas and fatah and various international and israeli peace activists participated . finding common ground bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the isreali fence cuts through fields and villages in the west bank for five years , american documentary filmmaker julia bacha followed the developments in budrus with her camera .
her film addresses many controversial issues and neither refrains from showing the aggressive reactions of israeli soldiers to the protests nor the moments when palestinian protesters and israelis start to find common ground . " i visited my father in prison many times , and all the israelis i met there were very , very bad , " 15-year-old iltezam said in the film .
" but now i know that not all the israelis are the same .
some of them think that we should live together in peace . " many films at this year 's berlin film festival take a multilayered approach in presenting ways of coping with conflict .
and it 's not about nostalgia or cloying sentimentality , but about critically analyzing the situation .
coming to terms with the past is meant to help understand the present better - in order to be able to shape the future constructively . ' violence is no solution ' " our film wants to show that violence is no solution , " said iraqi director mohamed al-daradji . his film " son of babylon " is set in iraq , a few weeks after the fall of saddam hussein ’ s regime .
ahmed , a bright 12-year-old kurdish boy , sets off with his grandmother in search of his father who was arrested by saddam 's republican guard at the end of the gulf war .
as they travel along bombed out desert tracks they encounter others with similar quests , searching for a new beginning . " son of babylon " was shot on location in iraq and relies on a cast of nonprofessional actors .
the female lead is played by a kurd , shezad hussen , the only female witness to testify during the trial against saddam hussein . during saddam 's regime , hundreds of thousands of civilians were killed , thousands of kurdish villages destroyed and more than 1.5 million kurds were forced to flee their homes in northern iraq . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : searching for a new beginning in a country ravaged by terror " i hope that in the future we will speak three languages in iraq : arabic , kurdish and turkmen , " al-daradji said . in the film , the boy 's journey ends at the recently uncovered mass graves from the time of saddam hussein 's regime .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de right-wing extremism -pipe- 20.02.2010 czech far-right party to appeal against ban großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : czech far-right protests can turn violent a czech court has banned the country 's far-right workers ' party , which plans to appeal .
the judge ruled the party 's program to be xenophobic , racist , chauvinist , homophobic and anti-semitic . tomas vandas , the leader of the far-right czech workers ' party , told local television broadcasters that he intends to appeal against a court decision to outlaw his political group .
the supreme administrative court in brno outlawed the far-right party , describing it as xenophobic , racist , chauvinist , homophobic and anti-semitic , in a verdict broadcast live on national television .
" this ruling needs to be understood as a preventative one , to maintain the constitutional and democratic order in the future , " judge vojtech simicek said on wednesday .
the court also said that the party , founded in 2003 , drew inspiration from the doctrines of the german nazi party and had links to openly white supremacist and racist groups .
the workers ' party is the first in the czech republic to be outlawed on the grounds of extremism .
the most recent regional examples of such a move date from before the fall of communist rule in 1989 .
the workers ' party , as part of its opposition to the process , called on its members to picket the courtroom and disrupt the decision , however , only about 50 of them showed up .
weakening the movement bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the court ruled that the party was influenced by hitler 's writing more mainstream political groups welcomed the decision , especially interior minister martin pecina , who filed the motion on behalf of cabinet .
" i said right from the very beginning that in a democratic society the battle against extremism never ends .
however , we can fight the manifestations of far-right activity , " pecina said in the courtroom in brno after the verdict .
pecina said that authorities faced a choice , either stamp these groups out as soon as they emerged , " or we can wait for police cars to be set on fire and petrol bombs to be thrown .
so i 'm convinced that we acted at the right moment , and that each step - like the one taken today - significantly weakens the neo-nazi movement . "
the workers ' party has garnered support from the relatively thin ranks of czech neo-nazis , but also appealed to some voters frustrated by social and ethnic tensions , especially in neighborhoods inhabited by the minority roma population .
the european roma rights center -lrb- errc -rrb- , a support group for the roma population , welcomed the decision , saying they hoped it would improve living conditions for roma people in the czech republic .
" more importantly , however , the czech authorities must act aggressively to prosecute workers ' party members and other individuals who committed crimes against the roma , " the errc 's rob kushen said. msh / reuters / dpa editor : holly fox send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
