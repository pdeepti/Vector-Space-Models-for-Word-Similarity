the artist asked the women to describe what " beauty " meant to them in everyday prison life . it sounds rather macabre or , at the very least , a contradiction in terms - asking female prisoners to address the notion of beauty .
russian photographer igor chepikov , who has been living in cologne , germany since 1991 , visited a women 's penitentiary weekly for over 10 months .
there , after splashing a wall in white paint to serve as a backdrop , he took thousands pictures of some of the inmates .
those snapshots were ultimately distilled into a selection of just 56 photographs that compose the exhibition called " bad ossendorf : women in prison " now on show in cologne . the title is a play on words .
" bad " in front of the name a place normally refers to a spa town in german .
" ossendorf " is the name of the penitentiary outside of cologne .
" bad ossendorf , " then , could be translated as " resort ossendorf , " but is intended to also imply english connotations , as in " bad love , bad money , bad company . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the photographer took 24 pictures of each participant however one chooses to view the name , the subject of the exhibition - women in prison confronted with the topic of " beauty " - sounds like it 's begging for feminist critique .
after all , many of the female prisoners have more existential issues to address than philosophical matters like the definition of beauty .
they are worried about their children , who are now sitting in orphanages .
they are dismayed about the pain they have caused their relatives .
they want to liberate themselves from a vicious circle of crime . the photographer chepikov , at least , gave space to the women 's voices - choosing not just to display his photographs of them , but also to literally frame their " narratives . "
the photographer asked the women to answer certain questions in written form - to describe what beauty meant to them , if they felt they had lost time in prison , what effect prison had had on their bodies and souls ? some of the answers : " the feeling of loneliness is the worst . "
" i never thought prison could make a person look so bad . "
" there is no place to buy make-up here , or any other kind of personal hygiene products . "
" once i saw the photos , i realized how horrible the effects of the drugs have been . "
" i wish i could turn back the clock . "
" for me , ' beauty ' here in the prison essentially means being clean . " deutsche welle spoke with the photographer , igor chepikov , to get his take on " women in prison . " deutsche welle : why these photographs of women in prison ? why did you choose to do this ? igor chepikov : i came up with the idea about six years ago .
i was sitting in the moscow subway , and was looking out of the windows and thinking about the song " as time goes by . "
and then , i started reading something about prisons and got to thinking about what life is like in prisons .
a man , for instance , could be 20 years old and get 15 years in jail , but he 's only 35 when he gets out .
but when he 's 45 and gets out of prison -lsb- 15 years later -rsb- , he 's 60 .
life is over for him , and he has no possibility to change .
for women , it 's even harder - not only can they not adapt at that age , they have also lost their beauty .
i realized that i should take pictures of them before that happens . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some of the women spiffed themselves up for the photo sessions is n't that kind of loaded , this idea of women and beauty and prison ? i 'm not sure - that 's what i wanted to figure out : ' is it problematic for women , or not ? '
the prison administration was doubtful - they did n't think any of the women would want to present themselves in an exhibition , which is what my intention was from the start .
but 15 women wanted to participate , and that was a green light for my project from the get-go . what do you think the motivation was for these women to take part ? life in prison is quite boring .
participating in the project was almost like vacation - a departure from everyday life - for the women , who often sit for 23 hours a day in their cells .
for them , it was a connection to outside life . were n't the women ashamed to show themselves ? i 'm not sure .
they agreed to have their pictures taken .
some of the women were in prison for the second , third or fourth time .
one woman who agreed to take part had been free for a few months , then returned and said , ' hello , i 'm back , you can take more pictures of me . "
for her , it was like coming home again . do you have an example of one of the women 's stories , why she came to be in prison ? yes , i talked with the women , but their stories are supposed to remain private .
you can read the anonymous narratives hanging on the walls of the exhibition . some statistics show that women are victims themselves before they land in prison .
did you find that when you spoke with the women ? it was different .
you might find that in their narratives .
actually , a lot of these women were drug addicts , and many of them belong in a hospital or treatment center rather than a prison . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some felt the art project was an escape from everyday jail life what was one of the most difficult moments while you were photographing the women ? actually , it was beforehand - in convincing the prison administration to let me in .
they did n't really understand what i wanted and what my purpose was , but as soon as they got an idea of what i was aiming for - not criticizing the place , but just presenting the bit of beauty among the women in the prison - it was fine . how do you define beauty ? you have it or you do n't .
it 's not easily defined .
i can show it better than describe it in words .
each woman here in the exhibition has some form of beauty , even if it 's just something in her expression . is n't this a contrast , the idea of beauty and women in prison ? yes .
it 's difficult for people to imagine that women want to take care of themselves in jail , but many of the prisoners told me that it 's important to them , but they do n't have much of a chance to do that .
for the photo sessions , they made themselves up , had their hair cut . how did you try to make the women feel comfortable with you ? i brought cookies , cigarettes , tea .
and i talked with them - it was n't just a photo session with each , but also a chat . you trained as an architect , then switched to painting and finally , photography .
why ? i painted for 10 years - abstract painting .
but then i realized that there are just some things you can only capture in a moment , and i switched to photography .
my first photography project was in a slaughterhouse - i was impressed by the colors i could capture there , and the moment when life is extinguished .
you ca n't get this moment across in abstract paintings . do you think this project is political - the " women in prison " portraits ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some of the women said personal hygiene products are rare in prison no .
it 's human .
i do n't want to criticize anyone .
this is simply part of life , even if it 's scary at times . why women and not men ?
men can be beautiful too … because people think of women and not men when they hear the word beauty . you asked women to write some things down about beauty .
why ? because i wanted to know their opinions about the subject and not mine .
maybe they do n't think about it at all .
but from the letters , i can tell they do .
life is tough in prison , and it leaves traces on people 's faces much more than among people who are free . when one reads the narratives , it 's clear that the women are also struggling with other problems , like their drug addiction , missing their children , their safety .
is n't it a luxury to be asking questions about beauty , when the women are facing much tougher issues ? i do n't really know . interview : louisa schaefer editor : kate bowen the exhibition at the neues kunstforum in cologne runs through sept .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 08.09.2010 economists say berlin needs to embrace its creativity großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin wall remnants are a canvas for the city 's creatives a new study of german cities shows that the creme-de-la-creme of young professional minds are attracted to hamburg and munich .
fewer , however , lay their hats in berlin , regardless of its cool , capital status . " increased competition for clever minds " is the title of a report analyzing migration from cities with more than half a million residents .
its three authors from the institute of employment research -lrb- iab -rrb- paint a picture in which well-educated germans most readily move to places renowned for their political leanings , their solid foundations , their ability to provide work and perhaps even for their good air , be it of the sea or mountain variety .
in many ways , the findings are not surprising .
not only for the cities that did feature at the top of the popularity chart , but also for those that did not .
most notably : germany 's unconventional capital berlin , which unlike hamburg and munich , has not had the benefit of being able to continually evolve since the days of the post-war economic miracle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : munich is the most popular career destination for well-educated germans after 40 years of division and almost 20 years of reunification , berlin is still trying to find its feet , economically speaking .
as martin gornig , the head of innovation , manufacturing and service at the german institute for economic research told deutsche welle , the capital city does not boast the kind of economic framework that entices people hoping to launch prosperous careers .
" berlin does n't have bmw or allianz , " he says .
" the big companies left berlin and they have not come back . "
and nor are they likely to , given the difficulties associated with uprooting established companies .
" what berlin has to do now is grow new ones , " gornig says .
" it might be a slow process , but it has to happen . "
gornig is not talking about new car manufacturers or new insurance companies , but about berlin playing to its greatest strength : creativity .
it has always had a reputation for attracting artists , but in recent years the capital has become a veritable stomping ground for those pointedly seeking inspiration over security .
creative renown the city 's creative pool is deep .
designers , musicians , painters , fashion designers and filmmakers add to it and drink from it .
art feeds art in berlin .
and while that does not necessarily a make a booming economy , it does provide the capital with some excellent long-term prospects .
" almost everything in berlin relates in some way or another to creativity , " says volker hassemer of stiftung zukunft berlin -lrb- foundation for the future of berlin -rrb- .
" take telekom for example , they have a large creative department here , which is entirely because of the type of people that live in the city . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin has a thriving art scene and the telecommunications giant is not alone .
hassemer says businesses actively seeking creative input have picked up on the fact that it pays to offer creative jobs in berlin because they know they will stand a better chance of getting good people .
geppert goes one step further .
he says the german capital appeals to the kind of workers who are not only creative in what they do , but in the way they live their lives .
" we 're not talking here about people who want permanent contracts with all the perks of holiday and sick pay , but about those who come to berlin without work and who are willing to be freelance or take short-term contacts . "
more marketing yet for all that , there is a sense that germany 's biggest city could be doing a bit more to sell its creative vein to the commercial world , as well as to tourists and artists .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin fashion week is an annual fixture " we need to recognize the potential of what we have , " hassemer says , adding that the arts and culture landscape is currently too fractured to be of serious economic value .
he believes the capital needs to be more up front about how it wants to use the creative talent residing within its boundaries .
and for that it needs a cluster organization .
" cities should show themselves to the outside world , " hassemer said .
" berlin has a cluster for health care management , but has not managed to establish one for its creative industries , and that is a failure . "
he says that while establishing a cluster is not inherently easy , it could be done .
the major impediment is bad management on the part of politicians , who are too bound up in minor tussles to extend a hand of partnership to the creative branch .
hassemer is very clear that berlin should get on top of its potential sooner rather than later , because to squander it may well be to inflict lasting damage .
" how are we going to continue to compete as europeans when other countries are growing and producing so fast ? " he asks .
" not with manufactured products but with our cultural maturity . "

fewer , however , lay their hats in berlin , regardless of its cool , capital status . " increased competition for clever minds " is the title of a report analyzing migration from cities with more than half a million residents .
its three authors from the institute of employment research -lrb- iab -rrb- paint a picture in which well-educated germans most readily move to places renowned for their political leanings , their solid foundations , their ability to provide work and perhaps even for their good air , be it of the sea or mountain variety .
in many ways , the findings are not surprising .
not only for the cities that did feature at the top of the popularity chart , but also for those that did not .
most notably : germany 's unconventional capital berlin , which unlike hamburg and munich , has not had the benefit of being able to continually evolve since the days of the post-war economic miracle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : munich is the most popular career destination for well-educated germans after 40 years of division and almost 20 years of reunification , berlin is still trying to find its feet , economically speaking .
as martin gornig , the head of innovation , manufacturing and service at the german institute for economic research told deutsche welle , the capital city does not boast the kind of economic framework that entices people hoping to launch prosperous careers .
" berlin does n't have bmw or allianz , " he says .
" the big companies left berlin and they have not come back . "
and nor are they likely to , given the difficulties associated with uprooting established companies .
" what berlin has to do now is grow new ones , " gornig says .
" it might be a slow process , but it has to happen . "
gornig is not talking about new car manufacturers or new insurance companies , but about berlin playing to its greatest strength : creativity .
it has always had a reputation for attracting artists , but in recent years the capital has become a veritable stomping ground for those pointedly seeking inspiration over security .
creative renown the city 's creative pool is deep .
designers , musicians , painters , fashion designers and filmmakers add to it and drink from it .
art feeds art in berlin .
and while that does not necessarily a make a booming economy , it does provide the capital with some excellent long-term prospects .
" almost everything in berlin relates in some way or another to creativity , " says volker hassemer of stiftung zukunft berlin -lrb- foundation for the future of berlin -rrb- .
" take telekom for example , they have a large creative department here , which is entirely because of the type of people that live in the city . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin has a thriving art scene and the telecommunications giant is not alone .
hassemer says businesses actively seeking creative input have picked up on the fact that it pays to offer creative jobs in berlin because they know they will stand a better chance of getting good people .
geppert goes one step further .
he says the german capital appeals to the kind of workers who are not only creative in what they do , but in the way they live their lives .
" we 're not talking here about people who want permanent contracts with all the perks of holiday and sick pay , but about those who come to berlin without work and who are willing to be freelance or take short-term contacts . "
more marketing yet for all that , there is a sense that germany 's biggest city could be doing a bit more to sell its creative vein to the commercial world , as well as to tourists and artists .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin fashion week is an annual fixture " we need to recognize the potential of what we have , " hassemer says , adding that the arts and culture landscape is currently too fractured to be of serious economic value .
he believes the capital needs to be more up front about how it wants to use the creative talent residing within its boundaries .
and for that it needs a cluster organization .
" cities should show themselves to the outside world , " hassemer said .
" berlin has a cluster for health care management , but has not managed to establish one for its creative industries , and that is a failure . "
he says that while establishing a cluster is not inherently easy , it could be done .
the major impediment is bad management on the part of politicians , who are too bound up in minor tussles to extend a hand of partnership to the creative branch .
hassemer is very clear that berlin should get on top of its potential sooner rather than later , because to squander it may well be to inflict lasting damage .
" how are we going to continue to compete as europeans when other countries are growing and producing so fast ? " he asks .
" not with manufactured products but with our cultural maturity . "

but a comparison between debates in germany and the united states suggests they shed more heat than light . with the publication of his book " deutschland schafft sich ab " -lrb- " germany abolishes itself " -rrb- in late august , banker and politician thilo sarrazin gifted the german media an incendiary topic for the autumn .
among the book 's controversial theses is the idea that higher fertility rates would allow non-assimilated muslims to dominate germany in the not-too-distant future .
the book tapped into fears among some germans that german culture and the german way of life is in danger .
but the discussions engendered were reminiscent of similar debates in other cultures .
in the united states , the publication in 2004 of a book entitled " who are we ? " by political scientist samuel p. huntington sparked discussions about whether the increasing prevalence of spanish-speaking americans would bifurcate us culture and threaten what the author called the american " creed " of enlightenment democracy .
but though the subject matters are seemingly similar , the levels of discourse in the two debates are very different .
german immigration expert klaus j. bade praises sarrazin for pointing up abuse of the german welfare system by migrants and germans .
but he takes the author to task in other areas .
" huntington 's book was more scientifically informed , whereas sarrazin knows as much about demography as i do about his specialty , state finances : namely just bits and pieces , " bade told deutsche welle .
" in this field he 's a populist writer who partly trades in cheap commonplaces and looks for statistical evidence for pre-conceived ideas - the exact opposite of the scientific method .
it 's what we call beer-coaster demographics . "
and the difference between a demagogue and a respected professor is not the only respect in which superficial similarities fall apart .
apples and oranges bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us hispanics , including this woman voting in denver , are becoming more and more important debates in germany and the us about whether immigrants are sufficiently assimilating are inflected by the different histories and demographics of the two countries .
the united states is a nation with a growing population and a rising number of immigrants , which from its very inception embraced the idea of foreigners becoming citizens .
germany , on the other hand , has stagnant population and immigration and was traditionally wary of taking in non-germans looking to better their lots in life .
" social integration and acknowledgement of the dialogue with muslim communities - these things have developed over the past few years , " philip anderson , professor of social sciences at the university of regensburg , told deutsche welle .
" but there needs to be more of that and far less of the fear of a sullying of the german identity and sometimes even german blood . "
debates about assimilation in germany and in other western european countries are additionally heated because most of the foreign residents and immigrants in question are muslim .
but klaus bade warns against seeing them as a homogeneous group .
" there 's no such thing as a single muslim group in germany , " bade said .
" immigration from iran , for example , centered on elites who had little problem integrating into german society .
immigrant turks tended to come from rural anatolia , and not istanbul , and so there were educational problems , especially three generations ago .
but that had nothing to do with them being muslims .
problems among italian immigrants , for instance , were and still are worse . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thilo sarrazin -lrb- r . -rrb- has been doing the talk-show rounds self-fulfilling prophecies sarrazin has had to step down from his job on the board of germany 's federal bank , and may yet lose his membership in the social democratic party for his ill-advised and ill-informed opinions .
but is there anything to the points he - or huntington - raised ?
can demographic changes mean the end of a language , a culture and a way of life ?
" there is an aspect comparable between both books , namely the vision of a competition between cultures , " bade said .
" but competition is not the same thing as total war .
moreover , we should think less about groups and systems and more about individuals .
for many people the huntington book has something of a self-fulfilling prophecy .
it 's a circular argument that echoes older fears about the decline and fall of western civilization .
this seems , on a national level , comparable to sarrazin 's message . "
in other words , warnings about conflicts of civilizations - to paraphrase the title of another of huntington 's books - tend to create the sort of tension they claim to be decrying .
" generally there is far more acceptance - especially in the cities , where people lived together - than is usually acknowledged , " anderson said .
" politicians need to push that as a positive image of how people are getting on . "
for bade , reasoning that fails to distinguish and differentiate between individual attitudes among immigrants and resident aliens is inherently faulty .
" when asked ' when did you last go to a mosque , ' many european muslims may not know where the nearest one is or may respond : ' for religious or cultural reasons ? '
that 's comparable to the way many christians feel who may go to church to look at art or attend a wedding .
there 's an infinite number of hybrid forms and milieus of islam , and from one generation to another muslims themselves will - hopefully - adapt more and more to european civilization as they did and still do in the us . " culture is constantly in flux , and demographic changes , of course , bring cultural shifts with them .

but a comparison between debates in germany and the united states suggests they shed more heat than light . with the publication of his book " deutschland schafft sich ab " -lrb- " germany abolishes itself " -rrb- in late august , banker and politician thilo sarrazin gifted the german media an incendiary topic for the autumn .
among the book 's controversial theses is the idea that higher fertility rates would allow non-assimilated muslims to dominate germany in the not-too-distant future .
the book tapped into fears among some germans that german culture and the german way of life is in danger .
but the discussions engendered were reminiscent of similar debates in other cultures .
in the united states , the publication in 2004 of a book entitled " who are we ? " by political scientist samuel p. huntington sparked discussions about whether the increasing prevalence of spanish-speaking americans would bifurcate us culture and threaten what the author called the american " creed " of enlightenment democracy .
but though the subject matters are seemingly similar , the levels of discourse in the two debates are very different .
german immigration expert klaus j. bade praises sarrazin for pointing up abuse of the german welfare system by migrants and germans .
but he takes the author to task in other areas .
" huntington 's book was more scientifically informed , whereas sarrazin knows as much about demography as i do about his specialty , state finances : namely just bits and pieces , " bade told deutsche welle .
" in this field he 's a populist writer who partly trades in cheap commonplaces and looks for statistical evidence for pre-conceived ideas - the exact opposite of the scientific method .
it 's what we call beer-coaster demographics . "
and the difference between a demagogue and a respected professor is not the only respect in which superficial similarities fall apart .
apples and oranges bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us hispanics , including this woman voting in denver , are becoming more and more important debates in germany and the us about whether immigrants are sufficiently assimilating are inflected by the different histories and demographics of the two countries .
the united states is a nation with a growing population and a rising number of immigrants , which from its very inception embraced the idea of foreigners becoming citizens .
germany , on the other hand , has stagnant population and immigration and was traditionally wary of taking in non-germans looking to better their lots in life .
" social integration and acknowledgement of the dialogue with muslim communities - these things have developed over the past few years , " philip anderson , professor of social sciences at the university of regensburg , told deutsche welle .
" but there needs to be more of that and far less of the fear of a sullying of the german identity and sometimes even german blood . "
debates about assimilation in germany and in other western european countries are additionally heated because most of the foreign residents and immigrants in question are muslim .
but klaus bade warns against seeing them as a homogeneous group .
" there 's no such thing as a single muslim group in germany , " bade said .
" immigration from iran , for example , centered on elites who had little problem integrating into german society .
immigrant turks tended to come from rural anatolia , and not istanbul , and so there were educational problems , especially three generations ago .
but that had nothing to do with them being muslims .
problems among italian immigrants , for instance , were and still are worse . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thilo sarrazin -lrb- r . -rrb- has been doing the talk-show rounds self-fulfilling prophecies sarrazin has had to step down from his job on the board of germany 's federal bank , and may yet lose his membership in the social democratic party for his ill-advised and ill-informed opinions .
but is there anything to the points he - or huntington - raised ?
can demographic changes mean the end of a language , a culture and a way of life ?
" there is an aspect comparable between both books , namely the vision of a competition between cultures , " bade said .
" but competition is not the same thing as total war .
moreover , we should think less about groups and systems and more about individuals .
for many people the huntington book has something of a self-fulfilling prophecy .
it 's a circular argument that echoes older fears about the decline and fall of western civilization .
this seems , on a national level , comparable to sarrazin 's message . "
in other words , warnings about conflicts of civilizations - to paraphrase the title of another of huntington 's books - tend to create the sort of tension they claim to be decrying .
" generally there is far more acceptance - especially in the cities , where people lived together - than is usually acknowledged , " anderson said .
" politicians need to push that as a positive image of how people are getting on . "
for bade , reasoning that fails to distinguish and differentiate between individual attitudes among immigrants and resident aliens is inherently faulty .
" when asked ' when did you last go to a mosque , ' many european muslims may not know where the nearest one is or may respond : ' for religious or cultural reasons ? '
that 's comparable to the way many christians feel who may go to church to look at art or attend a wedding .
there 's an infinite number of hybrid forms and milieus of islam , and from one generation to another muslims themselves will - hopefully - adapt more and more to european civilization as they did and still do in the us . " culture is constantly in flux , and demographic changes , of course , bring cultural shifts with them .
but a " host " culture being taken over by a monolithic foreign group , say experts , is one thing neither americans nor germans need to fear . author : jefferson chase editor : rob mudge send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de art -pipe- 08.09.2010 photographer explores beauty among women prisoners großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the women were asked how prison life had changed them a photographer in cologne has taken female inmates as the subjects of his work - a tall order , given penitentiary security .
the artist asked the women to describe what " beauty " meant to them in everyday prison life . it sounds rather macabre or , at the very least , a contradiction in terms - asking female prisoners to address the notion of beauty .
russian photographer igor chepikov , who has been living in cologne , germany since 1991 , visited a women 's penitentiary weekly for over 10 months .
there , after splashing a wall in white paint to serve as a backdrop , he took thousands pictures of some of the inmates .
those snapshots were ultimately distilled into a selection of just 56 photographs that compose the exhibition called " bad ossendorf : women in prison " now on show in cologne . the title is a play on words .
" bad " in front of the name a place normally refers to a spa town in german .
" ossendorf " is the name of the penitentiary outside of cologne .
" bad ossendorf , " then , could be translated as " resort ossendorf , " but is intended to also imply english connotations , as in " bad love , bad money , bad company . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the photographer took 24 pictures of each participant however one chooses to view the name , the subject of the exhibition - women in prison confronted with the topic of " beauty " - sounds like it 's begging for feminist critique .
after all , many of the female prisoners have more existential issues to address than philosophical matters like the definition of beauty .
they are worried about their children , who are now sitting in orphanages .
they are dismayed about the pain they have caused their relatives .
they want to liberate themselves from a vicious circle of crime . the photographer chepikov , at least , gave space to the women 's voices - choosing not just to display his photographs of them , but also to literally frame their " narratives . "
the photographer asked the women to answer certain questions in written form - to describe what beauty meant to them , if they felt they had lost time in prison , what effect prison had had on their bodies and souls ? some of the answers : " the feeling of loneliness is the worst . "
" i never thought prison could make a person look so bad . "
" there is no place to buy make-up here , or any other kind of personal hygiene products . "
" once i saw the photos , i realized how horrible the effects of the drugs have been . "
" i wish i could turn back the clock . "
" for me , ' beauty ' here in the prison essentially means being clean . " deutsche welle spoke with the photographer , igor chepikov , to get his take on " women in prison . " deutsche welle : why these photographs of women in prison ? why did you choose to do this ? igor chepikov : i came up with the idea about six years ago .
i was sitting in the moscow subway , and was looking out of the windows and thinking about the song " as time goes by . "
and then , i started reading something about prisons and got to thinking about what life is like in prisons .
a man , for instance , could be 20 years old and get 15 years in jail , but he 's only 35 when he gets out .
but when he 's 45 and gets out of prison -lsb- 15 years later -rsb- , he 's 60 .
life is over for him , and he has no possibility to change .
for women , it 's even harder - not only can they not adapt at that age , they have also lost their beauty .
i realized that i should take pictures of them before that happens . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some of the women spiffed themselves up for the photo sessions is n't that kind of loaded , this idea of women and beauty and prison ? i 'm not sure - that 's what i wanted to figure out : ' is it problematic for women , or not ? '
the prison administration was doubtful - they did n't think any of the women would want to present themselves in an exhibition , which is what my intention was from the start .
but 15 women wanted to participate , and that was a green light for my project from the get-go . what do you think the motivation was for these women to take part ? life in prison is quite boring .
participating in the project was almost like vacation - a departure from everyday life - for the women , who often sit for 23 hours a day in their cells .
for them , it was a connection to outside life . were n't the women ashamed to show themselves ? i 'm not sure .
they agreed to have their pictures taken .
some of the women were in prison for the second , third or fourth time .
one woman who agreed to take part had been free for a few months , then returned and said , ' hello , i 'm back , you can take more pictures of me . "
for her , it was like coming home again . do you have an example of one of the women 's stories , why she came to be in prison ? yes , i talked with the women , but their stories are supposed to remain private .
you can read the anonymous narratives hanging on the walls of the exhibition . some statistics show that women are victims themselves before they land in prison .

fewer , however , lay their hats in berlin , regardless of its cool , capital status . " increased competition for clever minds " is the title of a report analyzing migration from cities with more than half a million residents .
its three authors from the institute of employment research -lrb- iab -rrb- paint a picture in which well-educated germans most readily move to places renowned for their political leanings , their solid foundations , their ability to provide work and perhaps even for their good air , be it of the sea or mountain variety .
in many ways , the findings are not surprising .
not only for the cities that did feature at the top of the popularity chart , but also for those that did not .
most notably : germany 's unconventional capital berlin , which unlike hamburg and munich , has not had the benefit of being able to continually evolve since the days of the post-war economic miracle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : munich is the most popular career destination for well-educated germans after 40 years of division and almost 20 years of reunification , berlin is still trying to find its feet , economically speaking .
as martin gornig , the head of innovation , manufacturing and service at the german institute for economic research told deutsche welle , the capital city does not boast the kind of economic framework that entices people hoping to launch prosperous careers .
" berlin does n't have bmw or allianz , " he says .
" the big companies left berlin and they have not come back . "
and nor are they likely to , given the difficulties associated with uprooting established companies .
" what berlin has to do now is grow new ones , " gornig says .
" it might be a slow process , but it has to happen . "
gornig is not talking about new car manufacturers or new insurance companies , but about berlin playing to its greatest strength : creativity .
it has always had a reputation for attracting artists , but in recent years the capital has become a veritable stomping ground for those pointedly seeking inspiration over security .
creative renown the city 's creative pool is deep .
designers , musicians , painters , fashion designers and filmmakers add to it and drink from it .
art feeds art in berlin .
and while that does not necessarily a make a booming economy , it does provide the capital with some excellent long-term prospects .
" almost everything in berlin relates in some way or another to creativity , " says volker hassemer of stiftung zukunft berlin -lrb- foundation for the future of berlin -rrb- .
" take telekom for example , they have a large creative department here , which is entirely because of the type of people that live in the city . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin has a thriving art scene and the telecommunications giant is not alone .
hassemer says businesses actively seeking creative input have picked up on the fact that it pays to offer creative jobs in berlin because they know they will stand a better chance of getting good people .
geppert goes one step further .
he says the german capital appeals to the kind of workers who are not only creative in what they do , but in the way they live their lives .
" we 're not talking here about people who want permanent contracts with all the perks of holiday and sick pay , but about those who come to berlin without work and who are willing to be freelance or take short-term contacts . "
more marketing yet for all that , there is a sense that germany 's biggest city could be doing a bit more to sell its creative vein to the commercial world , as well as to tourists and artists .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin fashion week is an annual fixture " we need to recognize the potential of what we have , " hassemer says , adding that the arts and culture landscape is currently too fractured to be of serious economic value .
he believes the capital needs to be more up front about how it wants to use the creative talent residing within its boundaries .
and for that it needs a cluster organization .
" cities should show themselves to the outside world , " hassemer said .
" berlin has a cluster for health care management , but has not managed to establish one for its creative industries , and that is a failure . "
he says that while establishing a cluster is not inherently easy , it could be done .
the major impediment is bad management on the part of politicians , who are too bound up in minor tussles to extend a hand of partnership to the creative branch .
hassemer is very clear that berlin should get on top of its potential sooner rather than later , because to squander it may well be to inflict lasting damage .
" how are we going to continue to compete as europeans when other countries are growing and producing so fast ? " he asks .
" not with manufactured products but with our cultural maturity . "

the hamburg-based bank has been called " a key financial lifeline for iran . " the us treasury department on tuesday slapped sanctions on a german bank accused of helping iran evade international sanctions and supporting its nuclear and missile activities .
europaeisch-iranische handelsbank -lrb- eih -rrb- , based in hamburg , has handled billions of dollars in transactions on behalf of the iranian government and entities involved in its nuclear and missile programs , according to the treasury department .
the bank is also said to have previously done business with other iranian banks already under sanctions .
" as one of iran 's few remaining access points to the european financial system , eih has facilitated a tremendous volume of transactions for iranian banks previously designated for proliferation , " said stuart levey , treasury undersecretary .
levey called the bank " a key financial lifeline for iran , " adding that it had provided financial services to iranian proliferators of weapons of mass destruction .
the sanctions will isolate eih from the us financial system , and are the latest effort by the united states to pressure iran under un security council sanctions adopted in june .
the west suspects iran of trying to develop nuclear weapons , charges which tehran has denied .
in august , the treasury department placed 13 european firms under sanctions , including nine in germany .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de art -pipe- 08.09.2010 photographer explores beauty among women prisoners großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the women were asked how prison life had changed them a photographer in cologne has taken female inmates as the subjects of his work - a tall order , given penitentiary security .
the artist asked the women to describe what " beauty " meant to them in everyday prison life . it sounds rather macabre or , at the very least , a contradiction in terms - asking female prisoners to address the notion of beauty .
russian photographer igor chepikov , who has been living in cologne , germany since 1991 , visited a women 's penitentiary weekly for over 10 months .
there , after splashing a wall in white paint to serve as a backdrop , he took thousands pictures of some of the inmates .
those snapshots were ultimately distilled into a selection of just 56 photographs that compose the exhibition called " bad ossendorf : women in prison " now on show in cologne . the title is a play on words .
" bad " in front of the name a place normally refers to a spa town in german .
" ossendorf " is the name of the penitentiary outside of cologne .
" bad ossendorf , " then , could be translated as " resort ossendorf , " but is intended to also imply english connotations , as in " bad love , bad money , bad company . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the photographer took 24 pictures of each participant however one chooses to view the name , the subject of the exhibition - women in prison confronted with the topic of " beauty " - sounds like it 's begging for feminist critique .
after all , many of the female prisoners have more existential issues to address than philosophical matters like the definition of beauty .
they are worried about their children , who are now sitting in orphanages .
they are dismayed about the pain they have caused their relatives .
they want to liberate themselves from a vicious circle of crime . the photographer chepikov , at least , gave space to the women 's voices - choosing not just to display his photographs of them , but also to literally frame their " narratives . "
the photographer asked the women to answer certain questions in written form - to describe what beauty meant to them , if they felt they had lost time in prison , what effect prison had had on their bodies and souls ? some of the answers : " the feeling of loneliness is the worst . "
" i never thought prison could make a person look so bad . "
" there is no place to buy make-up here , or any other kind of personal hygiene products . "
" once i saw the photos , i realized how horrible the effects of the drugs have been . "
" i wish i could turn back the clock . "
" for me , ' beauty ' here in the prison essentially means being clean . " deutsche welle spoke with the photographer , igor chepikov , to get his take on " women in prison . " deutsche welle : why these photographs of women in prison ? why did you choose to do this ? igor chepikov : i came up with the idea about six years ago .
i was sitting in the moscow subway , and was looking out of the windows and thinking about the song " as time goes by . "
and then , i started reading something about prisons and got to thinking about what life is like in prisons .
a man , for instance , could be 20 years old and get 15 years in jail , but he 's only 35 when he gets out .
but when he 's 45 and gets out of prison -lsb- 15 years later -rsb- , he 's 60 .
life is over for him , and he has no possibility to change .
for women , it 's even harder - not only can they not adapt at that age , they have also lost their beauty .
i realized that i should take pictures of them before that happens . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some of the women spiffed themselves up for the photo sessions is n't that kind of loaded , this idea of women and beauty and prison ? i 'm not sure - that 's what i wanted to figure out : ' is it problematic for women , or not ? '
the prison administration was doubtful - they did n't think any of the women would want to present themselves in an exhibition , which is what my intention was from the start .
but 15 women wanted to participate , and that was a green light for my project from the get-go . what do you think the motivation was for these women to take part ? life in prison is quite boring .
participating in the project was almost like vacation - a departure from everyday life - for the women , who often sit for 23 hours a day in their cells .
for them , it was a connection to outside life . were n't the women ashamed to show themselves ? i 'm not sure .
they agreed to have their pictures taken .
some of the women were in prison for the second , third or fourth time .
one woman who agreed to take part had been free for a few months , then returned and said , ' hello , i 'm back , you can take more pictures of me . "
for her , it was like coming home again . do you have an example of one of the women 's stories , why she came to be in prison ? yes , i talked with the women , but their stories are supposed to remain private .
you can read the anonymous narratives hanging on the walls of the exhibition . some statistics show that women are victims themselves before they land in prison .
did you find that when you spoke with the women ? it was different .
you might find that in their narratives .
actually , a lot of these women were drug addicts , and many of them belong in a hospital or treatment center rather than a prison . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some felt the art project was an escape from everyday jail life what was one of the most difficult moments while you were photographing the women ? actually , it was beforehand - in convincing the prison administration to let me in .

but a comparison between debates in germany and the united states suggests they shed more heat than light . with the publication of his book " deutschland schafft sich ab " -lrb- " germany abolishes itself " -rrb- in late august , banker and politician thilo sarrazin gifted the german media an incendiary topic for the autumn .
among the book 's controversial theses is the idea that higher fertility rates would allow non-assimilated muslims to dominate germany in the not-too-distant future .
the book tapped into fears among some germans that german culture and the german way of life is in danger .
but the discussions engendered were reminiscent of similar debates in other cultures .
in the united states , the publication in 2004 of a book entitled " who are we ? " by political scientist samuel p. huntington sparked discussions about whether the increasing prevalence of spanish-speaking americans would bifurcate us culture and threaten what the author called the american " creed " of enlightenment democracy .
but though the subject matters are seemingly similar , the levels of discourse in the two debates are very different .

" immigration from iran , for example , centered on elites who had little problem integrating into german society .

fewer , however , lay their hats in berlin , regardless of its cool , capital status . " increased competition for clever minds " is the title of a report analyzing migration from cities with more than half a million residents .
its three authors from the institute of employment research -lrb- iab -rrb- paint a picture in which well-educated germans most readily move to places renowned for their political leanings , their solid foundations , their ability to provide work and perhaps even for their good air , be it of the sea or mountain variety .
in many ways , the findings are not surprising .
not only for the cities that did feature at the top of the popularity chart , but also for those that did not .
most notably : germany 's unconventional capital berlin , which unlike hamburg and munich , has not had the benefit of being able to continually evolve since the days of the post-war economic miracle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : munich is the most popular career destination for well-educated germans after 40 years of division and almost 20 years of reunification , berlin is still trying to find its feet , economically speaking .
as martin gornig , the head of innovation , manufacturing and service at the german institute for economic research told deutsche welle , the capital city does not boast the kind of economic framework that entices people hoping to launch prosperous careers .
" berlin does n't have bmw or allianz , " he says .
" the big companies left berlin and they have not come back . "
and nor are they likely to , given the difficulties associated with uprooting established companies .
" what berlin has to do now is grow new ones , " gornig says .
" it might be a slow process , but it has to happen . "
gornig is not talking about new car manufacturers or new insurance companies , but about berlin playing to its greatest strength : creativity .
it has always had a reputation for attracting artists , but in recent years the capital has become a veritable stomping ground for those pointedly seeking inspiration over security .
creative renown the city 's creative pool is deep .
designers , musicians , painters , fashion designers and filmmakers add to it and drink from it .
art feeds art in berlin .
and while that does not necessarily a make a booming economy , it does provide the capital with some excellent long-term prospects .
" almost everything in berlin relates in some way or another to creativity , " says volker hassemer of stiftung zukunft berlin -lrb- foundation for the future of berlin -rrb- .
" take telekom for example , they have a large creative department here , which is entirely because of the type of people that live in the city . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin has a thriving art scene and the telecommunications giant is not alone .
hassemer says businesses actively seeking creative input have picked up on the fact that it pays to offer creative jobs in berlin because they know they will stand a better chance of getting good people .
geppert goes one step further .
he says the german capital appeals to the kind of workers who are not only creative in what they do , but in the way they live their lives .
" we 're not talking here about people who want permanent contracts with all the perks of holiday and sick pay , but about those who come to berlin without work and who are willing to be freelance or take short-term contacts . "
more marketing yet for all that , there is a sense that germany 's biggest city could be doing a bit more to sell its creative vein to the commercial world , as well as to tourists and artists .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin fashion week is an annual fixture " we need to recognize the potential of what we have , " hassemer says , adding that the arts and culture landscape is currently too fractured to be of serious economic value .
he believes the capital needs to be more up front about how it wants to use the creative talent residing within its boundaries .
and for that it needs a cluster organization .
" cities should show themselves to the outside world , " hassemer said .
" berlin has a cluster for health care management , but has not managed to establish one for its creative industries , and that is a failure . "
he says that while establishing a cluster is not inherently easy , it could be done .
the major impediment is bad management on the part of politicians , who are too bound up in minor tussles to extend a hand of partnership to the creative branch .
hassemer is very clear that berlin should get on top of its potential sooner rather than later , because to squander it may well be to inflict lasting damage .
" how are we going to continue to compete as europeans when other countries are growing and producing so fast ? " he asks .
" not with manufactured products but with our cultural maturity . "

but a comparison between debates in germany and the united states suggests they shed more heat than light . with the publication of his book " deutschland schafft sich ab " -lrb- " germany abolishes itself " -rrb- in late august , banker and politician thilo sarrazin gifted the german media an incendiary topic for the autumn .
among the book 's controversial theses is the idea that higher fertility rates would allow non-assimilated muslims to dominate germany in the not-too-distant future .
the book tapped into fears among some germans that german culture and the german way of life is in danger .
but the discussions engendered were reminiscent of similar debates in other cultures .
in the united states , the publication in 2004 of a book entitled " who are we ? " by political scientist samuel p. huntington sparked discussions about whether the increasing prevalence of spanish-speaking americans would bifurcate us culture and threaten what the author called the american " creed " of enlightenment democracy .
but though the subject matters are seemingly similar , the levels of discourse in the two debates are very different .
german immigration expert klaus j. bade praises sarrazin for pointing up abuse of the german welfare system by migrants and germans .
but he takes the author to task in other areas .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de art -pipe- 08.09.2010 photographer explores beauty among women prisoners großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the women were asked how prison life had changed them a photographer in cologne has taken female inmates as the subjects of his work - a tall order , given penitentiary security .
the artist asked the women to describe what " beauty " meant to them in everyday prison life . it sounds rather macabre or , at the very least , a contradiction in terms - asking female prisoners to address the notion of beauty .
russian photographer igor chepikov , who has been living in cologne , germany since 1991 , visited a women 's penitentiary weekly for over 10 months .
there , after splashing a wall in white paint to serve as a backdrop , he took thousands pictures of some of the inmates .
those snapshots were ultimately distilled into a selection of just 56 photographs that compose the exhibition called " bad ossendorf : women in prison " now on show in cologne . the title is a play on words .
" bad " in front of the name a place normally refers to a spa town in german .
" ossendorf " is the name of the penitentiary outside of cologne .
" bad ossendorf , " then , could be translated as " resort ossendorf , " but is intended to also imply english connotations , as in " bad love , bad money , bad company . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the photographer took 24 pictures of each participant however one chooses to view the name , the subject of the exhibition - women in prison confronted with the topic of " beauty " - sounds like it 's begging for feminist critique .
after all , many of the female prisoners have more existential issues to address than philosophical matters like the definition of beauty .
they are worried about their children , who are now sitting in orphanages .
they are dismayed about the pain they have caused their relatives .
they want to liberate themselves from a vicious circle of crime . the photographer chepikov , at least , gave space to the women 's voices - choosing not just to display his photographs of them , but also to literally frame their " narratives . "
the photographer asked the women to answer certain questions in written form - to describe what beauty meant to them , if they felt they had lost time in prison , what effect prison had had on their bodies and souls ? some of the answers : " the feeling of loneliness is the worst . "
" i never thought prison could make a person look so bad . "
" there is no place to buy make-up here , or any other kind of personal hygiene products . "
" once i saw the photos , i realized how horrible the effects of the drugs have been . "
" i wish i could turn back the clock . "
" for me , ' beauty ' here in the prison essentially means being clean . " deutsche welle spoke with the photographer , igor chepikov , to get his take on " women in prison . " deutsche welle : why these photographs of women in prison ? why did you choose to do this ? igor chepikov : i came up with the idea about six years ago .
i was sitting in the moscow subway , and was looking out of the windows and thinking about the song " as time goes by . "
and then , i started reading something about prisons and got to thinking about what life is like in prisons .
a man , for instance , could be 20 years old and get 15 years in jail , but he 's only 35 when he gets out .
but when he 's 45 and gets out of prison -lsb- 15 years later -rsb- , he 's 60 .
life is over for him , and he has no possibility to change .
for women , it 's even harder - not only can they not adapt at that age , they have also lost their beauty .
i realized that i should take pictures of them before that happens . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some of the women spiffed themselves up for the photo sessions is n't that kind of loaded , this idea of women and beauty and prison ? i 'm not sure - that 's what i wanted to figure out : ' is it problematic for women , or not ? '
the prison administration was doubtful - they did n't think any of the women would want to present themselves in an exhibition , which is what my intention was from the start .
but 15 women wanted to participate , and that was a green light for my project from the get-go . what do you think the motivation was for these women to take part ? life in prison is quite boring .
participating in the project was almost like vacation - a departure from everyday life - for the women , who often sit for 23 hours a day in their cells .
for them , it was a connection to outside life . were n't the women ashamed to show themselves ? i 'm not sure .
they agreed to have their pictures taken .
some of the women were in prison for the second , third or fourth time .
one woman who agreed to take part had been free for a few months , then returned and said , ' hello , i 'm back , you can take more pictures of me . "
for her , it was like coming home again . do you have an example of one of the women 's stories , why she came to be in prison ? yes , i talked with the women , but their stories are supposed to remain private .
you can read the anonymous narratives hanging on the walls of the exhibition . some statistics show that women are victims themselves before they land in prison .
did you find that when you spoke with the women ? it was different .
you might find that in their narratives .
actually , a lot of these women were drug addicts , and many of them belong in a hospital or treatment center rather than a prison . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some felt the art project was an escape from everyday jail life what was one of the most difficult moments while you were photographing the women ? actually , it was beforehand - in convincing the prison administration to let me in .
they did n't really understand what i wanted and what my purpose was , but as soon as they got an idea of what i was aiming for - not criticizing the place , but just presenting the bit of beauty among the women in the prison - it was fine . how do you define beauty ? you have it or you do n't .
it 's not easily defined .
i can show it better than describe it in words .
each woman here in the exhibition has some form of beauty , even if it 's just something in her expression . is n't this a contrast , the idea of beauty and women in prison ? yes .
it 's difficult for people to imagine that women want to take care of themselves in jail , but many of the prisoners told me that it 's important to them , but they do n't have much of a chance to do that .
for the photo sessions , they made themselves up , had their hair cut . how did you try to make the women feel comfortable with you ? i brought cookies , cigarettes , tea .
and i talked with them - it was n't just a photo session with each , but also a chat . you trained as an architect , then switched to painting and finally , photography .
why ? i painted for 10 years - abstract painting .
but then i realized that there are just some things you can only capture in a moment , and i switched to photography .
my first photography project was in a slaughterhouse - i was impressed by the colors i could capture there , and the moment when life is extinguished .
you ca n't get this moment across in abstract paintings . do you think this project is political - the " women in prison " portraits ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some of the women said personal hygiene products are rare in prison no .
it 's human .
i do n't want to criticize anyone .
this is simply part of life , even if it 's scary at times . why women and not men ?
men can be beautiful too … because people think of women and not men when they hear the word beauty . you asked women to write some things down about beauty .
why ? because i wanted to know their opinions about the subject and not mine .
maybe they do n't think about it at all .
but from the letters , i can tell they do .
life is tough in prison , and it leaves traces on people 's faces much more than among people who are free . when one reads the narratives , it 's clear that the women are also struggling with other problems , like their drug addiction , missing their children , their safety .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de art -pipe- 08.09.2010 photographer explores beauty among women prisoners großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the women were asked how prison life had changed them a photographer in cologne has taken female inmates as the subjects of his work - a tall order , given penitentiary security .
the artist asked the women to describe what " beauty " meant to them in everyday prison life . it sounds rather macabre or , at the very least , a contradiction in terms - asking female prisoners to address the notion of beauty .
russian photographer igor chepikov , who has been living in cologne , germany since 1991 , visited a women 's penitentiary weekly for over 10 months .
there , after splashing a wall in white paint to serve as a backdrop , he took thousands pictures of some of the inmates .
those snapshots were ultimately distilled into a selection of just 56 photographs that compose the exhibition called " bad ossendorf : women in prison " now on show in cologne . the title is a play on words .
" bad " in front of the name a place normally refers to a spa town in german .
" ossendorf " is the name of the penitentiary outside of cologne .
" bad ossendorf , " then , could be translated as " resort ossendorf , " but is intended to also imply english connotations , as in " bad love , bad money , bad company . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the photographer took 24 pictures of each participant however one chooses to view the name , the subject of the exhibition - women in prison confronted with the topic of " beauty " - sounds like it 's begging for feminist critique .
after all , many of the female prisoners have more existential issues to address than philosophical matters like the definition of beauty .
they are worried about their children , who are now sitting in orphanages .
they are dismayed about the pain they have caused their relatives .
they want to liberate themselves from a vicious circle of crime . the photographer chepikov , at least , gave space to the women 's voices - choosing not just to display his photographs of them , but also to literally frame their " narratives . "
the photographer asked the women to answer certain questions in written form - to describe what beauty meant to them , if they felt they had lost time in prison , what effect prison had had on their bodies and souls ? some of the answers : " the feeling of loneliness is the worst . "
" i never thought prison could make a person look so bad . "
" there is no place to buy make-up here , or any other kind of personal hygiene products . "
" once i saw the photos , i realized how horrible the effects of the drugs have been . "
" i wish i could turn back the clock . "
" for me , ' beauty ' here in the prison essentially means being clean . " deutsche welle spoke with the photographer , igor chepikov , to get his take on " women in prison . " deutsche welle : why these photographs of women in prison ? why did you choose to do this ? igor chepikov : i came up with the idea about six years ago .
i was sitting in the moscow subway , and was looking out of the windows and thinking about the song " as time goes by . "
and then , i started reading something about prisons and got to thinking about what life is like in prisons .
a man , for instance , could be 20 years old and get 15 years in jail , but he 's only 35 when he gets out .
but when he 's 45 and gets out of prison -lsb- 15 years later -rsb- , he 's 60 .
life is over for him , and he has no possibility to change .
for women , it 's even harder - not only can they not adapt at that age , they have also lost their beauty .
i realized that i should take pictures of them before that happens . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some of the women spiffed themselves up for the photo sessions is n't that kind of loaded , this idea of women and beauty and prison ? i 'm not sure - that 's what i wanted to figure out : ' is it problematic for women , or not ? '
the prison administration was doubtful - they did n't think any of the women would want to present themselves in an exhibition , which is what my intention was from the start .
but 15 women wanted to participate , and that was a green light for my project from the get-go . what do you think the motivation was for these women to take part ? life in prison is quite boring .
participating in the project was almost like vacation - a departure from everyday life - for the women , who often sit for 23 hours a day in their cells .
for them , it was a connection to outside life . were n't the women ashamed to show themselves ? i 'm not sure .
they agreed to have their pictures taken .
some of the women were in prison for the second , third or fourth time .
one woman who agreed to take part had been free for a few months , then returned and said , ' hello , i 'm back , you can take more pictures of me . "
for her , it was like coming home again . do you have an example of one of the women 's stories , why she came to be in prison ? yes , i talked with the women , but their stories are supposed to remain private .
you can read the anonymous narratives hanging on the walls of the exhibition . some statistics show that women are victims themselves before they land in prison .
did you find that when you spoke with the women ? it was different .
you might find that in their narratives .
actually , a lot of these women were drug addicts , and many of them belong in a hospital or treatment center rather than a prison . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some felt the art project was an escape from everyday jail life what was one of the most difficult moments while you were photographing the women ? actually , it was beforehand - in convincing the prison administration to let me in .
they did n't really understand what i wanted and what my purpose was , but as soon as they got an idea of what i was aiming for - not criticizing the place , but just presenting the bit of beauty among the women in the prison - it was fine . how do you define beauty ? you have it or you do n't .
it 's not easily defined .
i can show it better than describe it in words .
each woman here in the exhibition has some form of beauty , even if it 's just something in her expression . is n't this a contrast , the idea of beauty and women in prison ? yes .
it 's difficult for people to imagine that women want to take care of themselves in jail , but many of the prisoners told me that it 's important to them , but they do n't have much of a chance to do that .
for the photo sessions , they made themselves up , had their hair cut . how did you try to make the women feel comfortable with you ? i brought cookies , cigarettes , tea .
and i talked with them - it was n't just a photo session with each , but also a chat . you trained as an architect , then switched to painting and finally , photography .
why ? i painted for 10 years - abstract painting .
but then i realized that there are just some things you can only capture in a moment , and i switched to photography .
my first photography project was in a slaughterhouse - i was impressed by the colors i could capture there , and the moment when life is extinguished .
you ca n't get this moment across in abstract paintings . do you think this project is political - the " women in prison " portraits ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some of the women said personal hygiene products are rare in prison no .
it 's human .
i do n't want to criticize anyone .
this is simply part of life , even if it 's scary at times . why women and not men ?
men can be beautiful too … because people think of women and not men when they hear the word beauty . you asked women to write some things down about beauty .
why ? because i wanted to know their opinions about the subject and not mine .
maybe they do n't think about it at all .
but from the letters , i can tell they do .
life is tough in prison , and it leaves traces on people 's faces much more than among people who are free . when one reads the narratives , it 's clear that the women are also struggling with other problems , like their drug addiction , missing their children , their safety .
is n't it a luxury to be asking questions about beauty , when the women are facing much tougher issues ? i do n't really know . interview : louisa schaefer editor : kate bowen the exhibition at the neues kunstforum in cologne runs through sept .

the court said the gambling laws were being applied inconsistently . the german government 's monopoly on most forms of gambling must be ended immediately , according to the european court of justice in luxembourg .
the court ruled that " the german rules do not limit games of chance in a consistent and systematic manner . " it said that the state the monopoly is not justifiable .
under german law , only the country 's 16 federal states or companies run by them can offer gambling services .
the state therefore has an effective monopoly on gambling and lotteries .
the law also bans most web-based betting , and forbids advertising such services .
the german state treaty on gambling came into force in 2008 to curb a growing trend in gambling addiction .
critics say it simply ensured that the state received a substantial chunk of the revenue from gambling .
internet betting agencies based abroad a number of private betting companies have challenged the treaty , saying it is inconsistent , because the federal states do not hold a monopoly on certain forms of gambling like slot machines and casinos .
numerous internet users place bets illegally with private online companies registered abroad , which tend to offer better odds .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de art -pipe- 08.09.2010 photographer explores beauty among women prisoners großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the women were asked how prison life had changed them a photographer in cologne has taken female inmates as the subjects of his work - a tall order , given penitentiary security .
the artist asked the women to describe what " beauty " meant to them in everyday prison life . it sounds rather macabre or , at the very least , a contradiction in terms - asking female prisoners to address the notion of beauty .
russian photographer igor chepikov , who has been living in cologne , germany since 1991 , visited a women 's penitentiary weekly for over 10 months .
there , after splashing a wall in white paint to serve as a backdrop , he took thousands pictures of some of the inmates .
those snapshots were ultimately distilled into a selection of just 56 photographs that compose the exhibition called " bad ossendorf : women in prison " now on show in cologne . the title is a play on words .
" bad " in front of the name a place normally refers to a spa town in german .
" ossendorf " is the name of the penitentiary outside of cologne .
" bad ossendorf , " then , could be translated as " resort ossendorf , " but is intended to also imply english connotations , as in " bad love , bad money , bad company . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the photographer took 24 pictures of each participant however one chooses to view the name , the subject of the exhibition - women in prison confronted with the topic of " beauty " - sounds like it 's begging for feminist critique .
after all , many of the female prisoners have more existential issues to address than philosophical matters like the definition of beauty .
they are worried about their children , who are now sitting in orphanages .
they are dismayed about the pain they have caused their relatives .
they want to liberate themselves from a vicious circle of crime . the photographer chepikov , at least , gave space to the women 's voices - choosing not just to display his photographs of them , but also to literally frame their " narratives . "
the photographer asked the women to answer certain questions in written form - to describe what beauty meant to them , if they felt they had lost time in prison , what effect prison had had on their bodies and souls ? some of the answers : " the feeling of loneliness is the worst . "
" i never thought prison could make a person look so bad . "
" there is no place to buy make-up here , or any other kind of personal hygiene products . "
" once i saw the photos , i realized how horrible the effects of the drugs have been . "
" i wish i could turn back the clock . "
" for me , ' beauty ' here in the prison essentially means being clean . " deutsche welle spoke with the photographer , igor chepikov , to get his take on " women in prison . " deutsche welle : why these photographs of women in prison ? why did you choose to do this ? igor chepikov : i came up with the idea about six years ago .
i was sitting in the moscow subway , and was looking out of the windows and thinking about the song " as time goes by . "
and then , i started reading something about prisons and got to thinking about what life is like in prisons .
a man , for instance , could be 20 years old and get 15 years in jail , but he 's only 35 when he gets out .
but when he 's 45 and gets out of prison -lsb- 15 years later -rsb- , he 's 60 .
life is over for him , and he has no possibility to change .
for women , it 's even harder - not only can they not adapt at that age , they have also lost their beauty .
i realized that i should take pictures of them before that happens . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some of the women spiffed themselves up for the photo sessions is n't that kind of loaded , this idea of women and beauty and prison ? i 'm not sure - that 's what i wanted to figure out : ' is it problematic for women , or not ? '
the prison administration was doubtful - they did n't think any of the women would want to present themselves in an exhibition , which is what my intention was from the start .
but 15 women wanted to participate , and that was a green light for my project from the get-go . what do you think the motivation was for these women to take part ? life in prison is quite boring .
participating in the project was almost like vacation - a departure from everyday life - for the women , who often sit for 23 hours a day in their cells .
for them , it was a connection to outside life . were n't the women ashamed to show themselves ? i 'm not sure .
they agreed to have their pictures taken .
some of the women were in prison for the second , third or fourth time .
one woman who agreed to take part had been free for a few months , then returned and said , ' hello , i 'm back , you can take more pictures of me . "
for her , it was like coming home again . do you have an example of one of the women 's stories , why she came to be in prison ? yes , i talked with the women , but their stories are supposed to remain private .
you can read the anonymous narratives hanging on the walls of the exhibition . some statistics show that women are victims themselves before they land in prison .
did you find that when you spoke with the women ? it was different .
you might find that in their narratives .
actually , a lot of these women were drug addicts , and many of them belong in a hospital or treatment center rather than a prison . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some felt the art project was an escape from everyday jail life what was one of the most difficult moments while you were photographing the women ? actually , it was beforehand - in convincing the prison administration to let me in .
they did n't really understand what i wanted and what my purpose was , but as soon as they got an idea of what i was aiming for - not criticizing the place , but just presenting the bit of beauty among the women in the prison - it was fine . how do you define beauty ? you have it or you do n't .
it 's not easily defined .
i can show it better than describe it in words .
each woman here in the exhibition has some form of beauty , even if it 's just something in her expression . is n't this a contrast , the idea of beauty and women in prison ? yes .
it 's difficult for people to imagine that women want to take care of themselves in jail , but many of the prisoners told me that it 's important to them , but they do n't have much of a chance to do that .
for the photo sessions , they made themselves up , had their hair cut . how did you try to make the women feel comfortable with you ? i brought cookies , cigarettes , tea .
and i talked with them - it was n't just a photo session with each , but also a chat . you trained as an architect , then switched to painting and finally , photography .
why ? i painted for 10 years - abstract painting .
but then i realized that there are just some things you can only capture in a moment , and i switched to photography .
my first photography project was in a slaughterhouse - i was impressed by the colors i could capture there , and the moment when life is extinguished .
you ca n't get this moment across in abstract paintings . do you think this project is political - the " women in prison " portraits ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some of the women said personal hygiene products are rare in prison no .
it 's human .
i do n't want to criticize anyone .
this is simply part of life , even if it 's scary at times . why women and not men ?
men can be beautiful too … because people think of women and not men when they hear the word beauty . you asked women to write some things down about beauty .
why ? because i wanted to know their opinions about the subject and not mine .
maybe they do n't think about it at all .
but from the letters , i can tell they do .
life is tough in prison , and it leaves traces on people 's faces much more than among people who are free . when one reads the narratives , it 's clear that the women are also struggling with other problems , like their drug addiction , missing their children , their safety .
is n't it a luxury to be asking questions about beauty , when the women are facing much tougher issues ? i do n't really know . interview : louisa schaefer editor : kate bowen the exhibition at the neues kunstforum in cologne runs through sept .

the percentage of people in urban areas with access is declining . lack of access to clean sources of water remains a major problem is much of the world , said anders berntell , executive director of the stockholm international water institute -lrb- siwi -rrb- . " bad water kills more people than hiv , malaria and wars together , affecting the lives of families and the economic development of many countries around the world , " he said at the world water week conference being held in the swedish capital . the united nation 's food and agriculture organization estimates that within the next 15 years , 1.8 billion people will be living in regions with acute water scarcity , and that two-thirds of the world 's population could be facing shortages . thirsty cities bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many people in cities lack the clean water they need while the plight of those in dry , rural areas has long been examined by development aid and the work of non-governmental organizations -lrb- ngos -rrb- , people in urban areas also suffer from lack of access to water , according to gerard payen , who heads the international federation of private water operators -lrb- aquafed -rrb- . " in cities , there are today more people suffering from a poor and unsatisfactory access to safe water and sanitation than at the end of the 20th century , " payen said in a statement . access to safe drinking water was recognized as a human right by the united nations general assembly in july , yet the un , together with ngos and individual governments , has struggled for decades to get potable water to hundreds of millions of people worldwide who lack water and basic sanitation services . growing population bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in some places , a trek is necessary to get clean water population growth is one of the biggest difficulties they confront .
between 2000 and 2008 , the world 's population increased by 635 million people , 80 percent of whom live in urban areas , according to un data . " the proportion of the urban population that benefits from satisfactory access to drinking water or sanitation is decreasing , " aquafed said , pointing to un statistics showing that 114 million more people went without access to tap water at home or in the immediate vicinity at the end of the eight-year-period . at the same time , 134 million more people went without access to basic sanitation , the group said , pointing out that in both cases there had been a 20 percent hike of urban dwellers lacking access .

the court said the gambling laws were being applied inconsistently . the german government 's monopoly on most forms of gambling must be ended immediately , according to the european court of justice in luxembourg .
the court ruled that " the german rules do not limit games of chance in a consistent and systematic manner . " it said that the state the monopoly is not justifiable .
under german law , only the country 's 16 federal states or companies run by them can offer gambling services .
the state therefore has an effective monopoly on gambling and lotteries .
the law also bans most web-based betting , and forbids advertising such services .
the german state treaty on gambling came into force in 2008 to curb a growing trend in gambling addiction .
critics say it simply ensured that the state received a substantial chunk of the revenue from gambling .
internet betting agencies based abroad a number of private betting companies have challenged the treaty , saying it is inconsistent , because the federal states do not hold a monopoly on certain forms of gambling like slot machines and casinos .
numerous internet users place bets illegally with private online companies registered abroad , which tend to offer better odds .

the project helps parents with migrant backgrounds and their children improve their literacy skills through storytelling . four million of the more than 750 million illiterate people in the world live in germany , and a disproportionate number of them are immigrants or have an immigrant background .
the " family literacy " project -lrb- fly -rrb- focuses on that group , which makes up 14 percent of hamburg 's population , and for that reason it was singled out for unesco 's 2010 literacy award .
fly , a pilot project initiated and run by the hamburg state institute for teacher training and school development , uses an intergenerational approach to ensure closer cooperation and better communication between the school and the childrens ' home " it 's our goal to get the parents interested in reading more at home with their children and in engaging more strongly with language , " gabriele rabkin , the head of fly , told deutsche welle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an intergenerational approach benefits adults and children forty-four schools in hamburg participate in the program , which was started six years ago .
nearly 1,000 parents and as many children take part in the project every year .
parents welcome every two weeks , parents join their children , mainly preschoolers and first-graders , in the classroom .
they see how their kids engage with words and storytelling - and they 're allowed to help .
fly 's teachers encourage the adults to make sure their children speak in complete sentences outside of class , take time to look at picture books together or point out individual letters on the way to school .
ute stather , who teaches first and second graders at hamburg 's osterbrook school , has been with the project from the start .
" the parents see what we are doing and that helps them understand where they have to support their child , " she said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sometimes aunts , grandmothers and siblings join the classes the families are not discouraged from speaking their native language in class .
on the contrary , teachers view multilingualism as an asset , stather said .
" if people speak and read a lot in their native tongue , their children will also learn german much more easily . "
many of the parents also see fly classes as a chance to learn german , according to rabkin .
the teachers also do n't put pressure on the adults to read and speak in german with their children at home ; what was important was for them to deal with language as such .
" we do n't see parents as assistant teachers - they are their children 's first and most important teachers , " rabkin said .

the project helps parents with migrant backgrounds and their children improve their literacy skills through storytelling . four million of the more than 750 million illiterate people in the world live in germany , and a disproportionate number of them are immigrants or have an immigrant background .
the " family literacy " project -lrb- fly -rrb- focuses on that group , which makes up 14 percent of hamburg 's population , and for that reason it was singled out for unesco 's 2010 literacy award .
fly , a pilot project initiated and run by the hamburg state institute for teacher training and school development , uses an intergenerational approach to ensure closer cooperation and better communication between the school and the childrens ' home " it 's our goal to get the parents interested in reading more at home with their children and in engaging more strongly with language , " gabriele rabkin , the head of fly , told deutsche welle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an intergenerational approach benefits adults and children forty-four schools in hamburg participate in the program , which was started six years ago .
nearly 1,000 parents and as many children take part in the project every year .
parents welcome every two weeks , parents join their children , mainly preschoolers and first-graders , in the classroom .
they see how their kids engage with words and storytelling - and they 're allowed to help .
fly 's teachers encourage the adults to make sure their children speak in complete sentences outside of class , take time to look at picture books together or point out individual letters on the way to school .
ute stather , who teaches first and second graders at hamburg 's osterbrook school , has been with the project from the start .
" the parents see what we are doing and that helps them understand where they have to support their child , " she said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sometimes aunts , grandmothers and siblings join the classes the families are not discouraged from speaking their native language in class .
on the contrary , teachers view multilingualism as an asset , stather said .
" if people speak and read a lot in their native tongue , their children will also learn german much more easily . "
many of the parents also see fly classes as a chance to learn german , according to rabkin .
the teachers also do n't put pressure on the adults to read and speak in german with their children at home ; what was important was for them to deal with language as such .
" we do n't see parents as assistant teachers - they are their children 's first and most important teachers , " rabkin said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de art -pipe- 08.09.2010 photographer explores beauty among women prisoners großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the women were asked how prison life had changed them a photographer in cologne has taken female inmates as the subjects of his work - a tall order , given penitentiary security .
the artist asked the women to describe what " beauty " meant to them in everyday prison life . it sounds rather macabre or , at the very least , a contradiction in terms - asking female prisoners to address the notion of beauty .
russian photographer igor chepikov , who has been living in cologne , germany since 1991 , visited a women 's penitentiary weekly for over 10 months .
there , after splashing a wall in white paint to serve as a backdrop , he took thousands pictures of some of the inmates .
those snapshots were ultimately distilled into a selection of just 56 photographs that compose the exhibition called " bad ossendorf : women in prison " now on show in cologne . the title is a play on words .
" bad " in front of the name a place normally refers to a spa town in german .
" ossendorf " is the name of the penitentiary outside of cologne .
" bad ossendorf , " then , could be translated as " resort ossendorf , " but is intended to also imply english connotations , as in " bad love , bad money , bad company . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the photographer took 24 pictures of each participant however one chooses to view the name , the subject of the exhibition - women in prison confronted with the topic of " beauty " - sounds like it 's begging for feminist critique .
after all , many of the female prisoners have more existential issues to address than philosophical matters like the definition of beauty .
they are worried about their children , who are now sitting in orphanages .
they are dismayed about the pain they have caused their relatives .
they want to liberate themselves from a vicious circle of crime . the photographer chepikov , at least , gave space to the women 's voices - choosing not just to display his photographs of them , but also to literally frame their " narratives . "
the photographer asked the women to answer certain questions in written form - to describe what beauty meant to them , if they felt they had lost time in prison , what effect prison had had on their bodies and souls ? some of the answers : " the feeling of loneliness is the worst . "
" i never thought prison could make a person look so bad . "
" there is no place to buy make-up here , or any other kind of personal hygiene products . "
" once i saw the photos , i realized how horrible the effects of the drugs have been . "
" i wish i could turn back the clock . "
" for me , ' beauty ' here in the prison essentially means being clean . " deutsche welle spoke with the photographer , igor chepikov , to get his take on " women in prison . " deutsche welle : why these photographs of women in prison ? why did you choose to do this ? igor chepikov : i came up with the idea about six years ago .
i was sitting in the moscow subway , and was looking out of the windows and thinking about the song " as time goes by . "
and then , i started reading something about prisons and got to thinking about what life is like in prisons .
a man , for instance , could be 20 years old and get 15 years in jail , but he 's only 35 when he gets out .
but when he 's 45 and gets out of prison -lsb- 15 years later -rsb- , he 's 60 .
life is over for him , and he has no possibility to change .
for women , it 's even harder - not only can they not adapt at that age , they have also lost their beauty .
i realized that i should take pictures of them before that happens . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some of the women spiffed themselves up for the photo sessions is n't that kind of loaded , this idea of women and beauty and prison ? i 'm not sure - that 's what i wanted to figure out : ' is it problematic for women , or not ? '
the prison administration was doubtful - they did n't think any of the women would want to present themselves in an exhibition , which is what my intention was from the start .
but 15 women wanted to participate , and that was a green light for my project from the get-go . what do you think the motivation was for these women to take part ? life in prison is quite boring .
participating in the project was almost like vacation - a departure from everyday life - for the women , who often sit for 23 hours a day in their cells .
for them , it was a connection to outside life . were n't the women ashamed to show themselves ? i 'm not sure .
they agreed to have their pictures taken .
some of the women were in prison for the second , third or fourth time .
one woman who agreed to take part had been free for a few months , then returned and said , ' hello , i 'm back , you can take more pictures of me . "
for her , it was like coming home again . do you have an example of one of the women 's stories , why she came to be in prison ? yes , i talked with the women , but their stories are supposed to remain private .
you can read the anonymous narratives hanging on the walls of the exhibition . some statistics show that women are victims themselves before they land in prison .
did you find that when you spoke with the women ? it was different .
you might find that in their narratives .
actually , a lot of these women were drug addicts , and many of them belong in a hospital or treatment center rather than a prison . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some felt the art project was an escape from everyday jail life what was one of the most difficult moments while you were photographing the women ? actually , it was beforehand - in convincing the prison administration to let me in .
they did n't really understand what i wanted and what my purpose was , but as soon as they got an idea of what i was aiming for - not criticizing the place , but just presenting the bit of beauty among the women in the prison - it was fine . how do you define beauty ? you have it or you do n't .
it 's not easily defined .
i can show it better than describe it in words .
each woman here in the exhibition has some form of beauty , even if it 's just something in her expression . is n't this a contrast , the idea of beauty and women in prison ? yes .
it 's difficult for people to imagine that women want to take care of themselves in jail , but many of the prisoners told me that it 's important to them , but they do n't have much of a chance to do that .
for the photo sessions , they made themselves up , had their hair cut . how did you try to make the women feel comfortable with you ? i brought cookies , cigarettes , tea .
and i talked with them - it was n't just a photo session with each , but also a chat . you trained as an architect , then switched to painting and finally , photography .
why ? i painted for 10 years - abstract painting .
but then i realized that there are just some things you can only capture in a moment , and i switched to photography .
my first photography project was in a slaughterhouse - i was impressed by the colors i could capture there , and the moment when life is extinguished .
you ca n't get this moment across in abstract paintings . do you think this project is political - the " women in prison " portraits ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some of the women said personal hygiene products are rare in prison no .
it 's human .
i do n't want to criticize anyone .
this is simply part of life , even if it 's scary at times . why women and not men ?
men can be beautiful too … because people think of women and not men when they hear the word beauty . you asked women to write some things down about beauty .
why ? because i wanted to know their opinions about the subject and not mine .
maybe they do n't think about it at all .
but from the letters , i can tell they do .
life is tough in prison , and it leaves traces on people 's faces much more than among people who are free . when one reads the narratives , it 's clear that the women are also struggling with other problems , like their drug addiction , missing their children , their safety .
is n't it a luxury to be asking questions about beauty , when the women are facing much tougher issues ? i do n't really know . interview : louisa schaefer editor : kate bowen the exhibition at the neues kunstforum in cologne runs through sept .

the photographer asked the women to answer certain questions in written form - to describe what beauty meant to them , if they felt they had lost time in prison , what effect prison had had on their bodies and souls ? some of the answers : " the feeling of loneliness is the worst . "
" i never thought prison could make a person look so bad . "
" there is no place to buy make-up here , or any other kind of personal hygiene products . "
" once i saw the photos , i realized how horrible the effects of the drugs have been . "
" i wish i could turn back the clock . "
" for me , ' beauty ' here in the prison essentially means being clean . " deutsche welle spoke with the photographer , igor chepikov , to get his take on " women in prison . " deutsche welle : why these photographs of women in prison ? why did you choose to do this ? igor chepikov : i came up with the idea about six years ago .
i was sitting in the moscow subway , and was looking out of the windows and thinking about the song " as time goes by . "
and then , i started reading something about prisons and got to thinking about what life is like in prisons .
a man , for instance , could be 20 years old and get 15 years in jail , but he 's only 35 when he gets out .
but when he 's 45 and gets out of prison -lsb- 15 years later -rsb- , he 's 60 .
life is over for him , and he has no possibility to change .
for women , it 's even harder - not only can they not adapt at that age , they have also lost their beauty .
i realized that i should take pictures of them before that happens . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some of the women spiffed themselves up for the photo sessions is n't that kind of loaded , this idea of women and beauty and prison ? i 'm not sure - that 's what i wanted to figure out : ' is it problematic for women , or not ? '
the prison administration was doubtful - they did n't think any of the women would want to present themselves in an exhibition , which is what my intention was from the start .
but 15 women wanted to participate , and that was a green light for my project from the get-go . what do you think the motivation was for these women to take part ? life in prison is quite boring .
participating in the project was almost like vacation - a departure from everyday life - for the women , who often sit for 23 hours a day in their cells .
for them , it was a connection to outside life . were n't the women ashamed to show themselves ? i 'm not sure .
they agreed to have their pictures taken .
some of the women were in prison for the second , third or fourth time .
one woman who agreed to take part had been free for a few months , then returned and said , ' hello , i 'm back , you can take more pictures of me . "
for her , it was like coming home again . do you have an example of one of the women 's stories , why she came to be in prison ? yes , i talked with the women , but their stories are supposed to remain private .
you can read the anonymous narratives hanging on the walls of the exhibition . some statistics show that women are victims themselves before they land in prison .
did you find that when you spoke with the women ? it was different .
you might find that in their narratives .
actually , a lot of these women were drug addicts , and many of them belong in a hospital or treatment center rather than a prison . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some felt the art project was an escape from everyday jail life what was one of the most difficult moments while you were photographing the women ? actually , it was beforehand - in convincing the prison administration to let me in .
they did n't really understand what i wanted and what my purpose was , but as soon as they got an idea of what i was aiming for - not criticizing the place , but just presenting the bit of beauty among the women in the prison - it was fine . how do you define beauty ? you have it or you do n't .
it 's not easily defined .
i can show it better than describe it in words .
each woman here in the exhibition has some form of beauty , even if it 's just something in her expression . is n't this a contrast , the idea of beauty and women in prison ? yes .
it 's difficult for people to imagine that women want to take care of themselves in jail , but many of the prisoners told me that it 's important to them , but they do n't have much of a chance to do that .
for the photo sessions , they made themselves up , had their hair cut . how did you try to make the women feel comfortable with you ? i brought cookies , cigarettes , tea .
and i talked with them - it was n't just a photo session with each , but also a chat . you trained as an architect , then switched to painting and finally , photography .
why ? i painted for 10 years - abstract painting .
but then i realized that there are just some things you can only capture in a moment , and i switched to photography .
my first photography project was in a slaughterhouse - i was impressed by the colors i could capture there , and the moment when life is extinguished .
you ca n't get this moment across in abstract paintings . do you think this project is political - the " women in prison " portraits ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some of the women said personal hygiene products are rare in prison no .
it 's human .
i do n't want to criticize anyone .
this is simply part of life , even if it 's scary at times . why women and not men ?
men can be beautiful too … because people think of women and not men when they hear the word beauty . you asked women to write some things down about beauty .
why ? because i wanted to know their opinions about the subject and not mine .
maybe they do n't think about it at all .
but from the letters , i can tell they do .
life is tough in prison , and it leaves traces on people 's faces much more than among people who are free . when one reads the narratives , it 's clear that the women are also struggling with other problems , like their drug addiction , missing their children , their safety .
is n't it a luxury to be asking questions about beauty , when the women are facing much tougher issues ? i do n't really know . interview : louisa schaefer editor : kate bowen the exhibition at the neues kunstforum in cologne runs through sept .

the artist asked the women to describe what " beauty " meant to them in everyday prison life . it sounds rather macabre or , at the very least , a contradiction in terms - asking female prisoners to address the notion of beauty .
russian photographer igor chepikov , who has been living in cologne , germany since 1991 , visited a women 's penitentiary weekly for over 10 months .
there , after splashing a wall in white paint to serve as a backdrop , he took thousands pictures of some of the inmates .
those snapshots were ultimately distilled into a selection of just 56 photographs that compose the exhibition called " bad ossendorf : women in prison " now on show in cologne . the title is a play on words .
" bad " in front of the name a place normally refers to a spa town in german .
" ossendorf " is the name of the penitentiary outside of cologne .
" bad ossendorf , " then , could be translated as " resort ossendorf , " but is intended to also imply english connotations , as in " bad love , bad money , bad company . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the photographer took 24 pictures of each participant however one chooses to view the name , the subject of the exhibition - women in prison confronted with the topic of " beauty " - sounds like it 's begging for feminist critique .
after all , many of the female prisoners have more existential issues to address than philosophical matters like the definition of beauty .
they are worried about their children , who are now sitting in orphanages .
they are dismayed about the pain they have caused their relatives .
they want to liberate themselves from a vicious circle of crime . the photographer chepikov , at least , gave space to the women 's voices - choosing not just to display his photographs of them , but also to literally frame their " narratives . "

the project helps parents with migrant backgrounds and their children improve their literacy skills through storytelling . four million of the more than 750 million illiterate people in the world live in germany , and a disproportionate number of them are immigrants or have an immigrant background .
the " family literacy " project -lrb- fly -rrb- focuses on that group , which makes up 14 percent of hamburg 's population , and for that reason it was singled out for unesco 's 2010 literacy award .
fly , a pilot project initiated and run by the hamburg state institute for teacher training and school development , uses an intergenerational approach to ensure closer cooperation and better communication between the school and the childrens ' home " it 's our goal to get the parents interested in reading more at home with their children and in engaging more strongly with language , " gabriele rabkin , the head of fly , told deutsche welle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an intergenerational approach benefits adults and children forty-four schools in hamburg participate in the program , which was started six years ago .
nearly 1,000 parents and as many children take part in the project every year .
parents welcome every two weeks , parents join their children , mainly preschoolers and first-graders , in the classroom .
they see how their kids engage with words and storytelling - and they 're allowed to help .
fly 's teachers encourage the adults to make sure their children speak in complete sentences outside of class , take time to look at picture books together or point out individual letters on the way to school .
ute stather , who teaches first and second graders at hamburg 's osterbrook school , has been with the project from the start .
" the parents see what we are doing and that helps them understand where they have to support their child , " she said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sometimes aunts , grandmothers and siblings join the classes the families are not discouraged from speaking their native language in class .
on the contrary , teachers view multilingualism as an asset , stather said .
" if people speak and read a lot in their native tongue , their children will also learn german much more easily . "
many of the parents also see fly classes as a chance to learn german , according to rabkin .
the teachers also do n't put pressure on the adults to read and speak in german with their children at home ; what was important was for them to deal with language as such .
" we do n't see parents as assistant teachers - they are their children 's first and most important teachers , " rabkin said .

french workers strike over pension reforms australia has proposed by the labour government of ms. julia gillard to increase the age of pensions for retirement from 65 to 67 in the future .
there has been no real opposition to this proposal like in france .
the same reasons are given by australia like in france such as an aging population and life expectancy . - stuart , australia unless the strikers can come up with a way to pay for their pensions , 62 is early .
what are they planning to do , sit around and wait to die ? - marga , us the retirement age should be raised because unaffordable benefits now will transfer the financial burden to the upcoming generations .
we will rely more and more on low wage manufacturing for affordable products , further exacerbating the problem . - steve , france the unions in france should fight against this reactionary measure and do what ever is necessary to stop the government from doing this disgraceful act against the people .
the president of france is similar to adolphe thiers who in 1871 ordered the french troops to eliminate the working class of paris .
what the french government is doing should be condemned by the working class every where in the world . - stan , canada german energy policy it really would be the greenest energy policy , relatively speaking , if the remaining energy in the spent nuclear fuel was used for something .
that would reduce the toxicity of spent fuel .
anything else would be irresponsible . - gene , us nein !
non !
no !
the decision is not good for our planet and chancellor merkel should know better , being a scientist .
but it good to see some compromise within the government debate . - stuart , australia i can not believe the german people are so blind on this subject .
the world is facing a climate catastrophe and needs to reduce co2 emissions as soon as possible .
germany , like australia , has high co2 emissions but believes that renewables are the answer .
please do the math ; no country , including germany , has ever reduced co2 emissions using renewables .
the only successful non-carbon technology is nuclear power which your neighbors france , switzerland and sweden have successfully used to reduce co2 emissions .
facts , not fantasy , must drive decision-making . - tom , australia germany must have a continuous reliable source of electricity and the present nuclear plants should run for their designed lifetimes .
there should not be any further construction of fossil fuel power stations unless they replace older ones that have reached the end of their most efficient lifespan . - roland , new zealand i think germany needs to review their energy policy , now that the country is not so vulnerable to geopolitical controls on natural gas .
natural gas with nuclear base load is your best option until another superior source evolves . - george , canada compiled by stuart tiffen editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin fashion week is an annual fixture " we need to recognize the potential of what we have , " hassemer says , adding that the arts and culture landscape is currently too fractured to be of serious economic value .
he believes the capital needs to be more up front about how it wants to use the creative talent residing within its boundaries .
and for that it needs a cluster organization .
" cities should show themselves to the outside world , " hassemer said .
" berlin has a cluster for health care management , but has not managed to establish one for its creative industries , and that is a failure . "
he says that while establishing a cluster is not inherently easy , it could be done .
the major impediment is bad management on the part of politicians , who are too bound up in minor tussles to extend a hand of partnership to the creative branch .
hassemer is very clear that berlin should get on top of its potential sooner rather than later , because to squander it may well be to inflict lasting damage .
" how are we going to continue to compete as europeans when other countries are growing and producing so fast ? " he asks .
" not with manufactured products but with our cultural maturity . "

but a comparison between debates in germany and the united states suggests they shed more heat than light . with the publication of his book " deutschland schafft sich ab " -lrb- " germany abolishes itself " -rrb- in late august , banker and politician thilo sarrazin gifted the german media an incendiary topic for the autumn .
among the book 's controversial theses is the idea that higher fertility rates would allow non-assimilated muslims to dominate germany in the not-too-distant future .
the book tapped into fears among some germans that german culture and the german way of life is in danger .
but the discussions engendered were reminiscent of similar debates in other cultures .
in the united states , the publication in 2004 of a book entitled " who are we ? " by political scientist samuel p. huntington sparked discussions about whether the increasing prevalence of spanish-speaking americans would bifurcate us culture and threaten what the author called the american " creed " of enlightenment democracy .
but though the subject matters are seemingly similar , the levels of discourse in the two debates are very different .
german immigration expert klaus j. bade praises sarrazin for pointing up abuse of the german welfare system by migrants and germans .
but he takes the author to task in other areas .
" huntington 's book was more scientifically informed , whereas sarrazin knows as much about demography as i do about his specialty , state finances : namely just bits and pieces , " bade told deutsche welle .
" in this field he 's a populist writer who partly trades in cheap commonplaces and looks for statistical evidence for pre-conceived ideas - the exact opposite of the scientific method .

apples and oranges bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us hispanics , including this woman voting in denver , are becoming more and more important debates in germany and the us about whether immigrants are sufficiently assimilating are inflected by the different histories and demographics of the two countries .
the united states is a nation with a growing population and a rising number of immigrants , which from its very inception embraced the idea of foreigners becoming citizens .
germany , on the other hand , has stagnant population and immigration and was traditionally wary of taking in non-germans looking to better their lots in life .
" social integration and acknowledgement of the dialogue with muslim communities - these things have developed over the past few years , " philip anderson , professor of social sciences at the university of regensburg , told deutsche welle .
" but there needs to be more of that and far less of the fear of a sullying of the german identity and sometimes even german blood . "
debates about assimilation in germany and in other western european countries are additionally heated because most of the foreign residents and immigrants in question are muslim .
but klaus bade warns against seeing them as a homogeneous group .
" there 's no such thing as a single muslim group in germany , " bade said .
" immigration from iran , for example , centered on elites who had little problem integrating into german society .
immigrant turks tended to come from rural anatolia , and not istanbul , and so there were educational problems , especially three generations ago .
but that had nothing to do with them being muslims .
problems among italian immigrants , for instance , were and still are worse . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thilo sarrazin -lrb- r . -rrb- has been doing the talk-show rounds self-fulfilling prophecies sarrazin has had to step down from his job on the board of germany 's federal bank , and may yet lose his membership in the social democratic party for his ill-advised and ill-informed opinions .
but is there anything to the points he - or huntington - raised ?
can demographic changes mean the end of a language , a culture and a way of life ?
" there is an aspect comparable between both books , namely the vision of a competition between cultures , " bade said .
" but competition is not the same thing as total war .
moreover , we should think less about groups and systems and more about individuals .
for many people the huntington book has something of a self-fulfilling prophecy .
it 's a circular argument that echoes older fears about the decline and fall of western civilization .
this seems , on a national level , comparable to sarrazin 's message . "
in other words , warnings about conflicts of civilizations - to paraphrase the title of another of huntington 's books - tend to create the sort of tension they claim to be decrying .
" generally there is far more acceptance - especially in the cities , where people lived together - than is usually acknowledged , " anderson said .
" politicians need to push that as a positive image of how people are getting on . "
for bade , reasoning that fails to distinguish and differentiate between individual attitudes among immigrants and resident aliens is inherently faulty .
" when asked ' when did you last go to a mosque , ' many european muslims may not know where the nearest one is or may respond : ' for religious or cultural reasons ? '
that 's comparable to the way many christians feel who may go to church to look at art or attend a wedding .

germany , on the other hand , has stagnant population and immigration and was traditionally wary of taking in non-germans looking to better their lots in life .
" social integration and acknowledgement of the dialogue with muslim communities - these things have developed over the past few years , " philip anderson , professor of social sciences at the university of regensburg , told deutsche welle .
" but there needs to be more of that and far less of the fear of a sullying of the german identity and sometimes even german blood . "
debates about assimilation in germany and in other western european countries are additionally heated because most of the foreign residents and immigrants in question are muslim .
but klaus bade warns against seeing them as a homogeneous group .
" there 's no such thing as a single muslim group in germany , " bade said .
" immigration from iran , for example , centered on elites who had little problem integrating into german society .
immigrant turks tended to come from rural anatolia , and not istanbul , and so there were educational problems , especially three generations ago .
but that had nothing to do with them being muslims .
problems among italian immigrants , for instance , were and still are worse . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thilo sarrazin -lrb- r . -rrb- has been doing the talk-show rounds self-fulfilling prophecies sarrazin has had to step down from his job on the board of germany 's federal bank , and may yet lose his membership in the social democratic party for his ill-advised and ill-informed opinions .
but is there anything to the points he - or huntington - raised ?
can demographic changes mean the end of a language , a culture and a way of life ?
" there is an aspect comparable between both books , namely the vision of a competition between cultures , " bade said .
" but competition is not the same thing as total war .
moreover , we should think less about groups and systems and more about individuals .
for many people the huntington book has something of a self-fulfilling prophecy .
it 's a circular argument that echoes older fears about the decline and fall of western civilization .
this seems , on a national level , comparable to sarrazin 's message . "
in other words , warnings about conflicts of civilizations - to paraphrase the title of another of huntington 's books - tend to create the sort of tension they claim to be decrying .
" generally there is far more acceptance - especially in the cities , where people lived together - than is usually acknowledged , " anderson said .
" politicians need to push that as a positive image of how people are getting on . "
for bade , reasoning that fails to distinguish and differentiate between individual attitudes among immigrants and resident aliens is inherently faulty .
" when asked ' when did you last go to a mosque , ' many european muslims may not know where the nearest one is or may respond : ' for religious or cultural reasons ? '
that 's comparable to the way many christians feel who may go to church to look at art or attend a wedding .
there 's an infinite number of hybrid forms and milieus of islam , and from one generation to another muslims themselves will - hopefully - adapt more and more to european civilization as they did and still do in the us . " culture is constantly in flux , and demographic changes , of course , bring cultural shifts with them .
but a " host " culture being taken over by a monolithic foreign group , say experts , is one thing neither americans nor germans need to fear . author : jefferson chase editor : rob mudge send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

fewer , however , lay their hats in berlin , regardless of its cool , capital status . " increased competition for clever minds " is the title of a report analyzing migration from cities with more than half a million residents .
its three authors from the institute of employment research -lrb- iab -rrb- paint a picture in which well-educated germans most readily move to places renowned for their political leanings , their solid foundations , their ability to provide work and perhaps even for their good air , be it of the sea or mountain variety .
in many ways , the findings are not surprising .
not only for the cities that did feature at the top of the popularity chart , but also for those that did not .
most notably : germany 's unconventional capital berlin , which unlike hamburg and munich , has not had the benefit of being able to continually evolve since the days of the post-war economic miracle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : munich is the most popular career destination for well-educated germans after 40 years of division and almost 20 years of reunification , berlin is still trying to find its feet , economically speaking .
as martin gornig , the head of innovation , manufacturing and service at the german institute for economic research told deutsche welle , the capital city does not boast the kind of economic framework that entices people hoping to launch prosperous careers .
" berlin does n't have bmw or allianz , " he says .
" the big companies left berlin and they have not come back . "
and nor are they likely to , given the difficulties associated with uprooting established companies .
" what berlin has to do now is grow new ones , " gornig says .
" it might be a slow process , but it has to happen . "
gornig is not talking about new car manufacturers or new insurance companies , but about berlin playing to its greatest strength : creativity .
it has always had a reputation for attracting artists , but in recent years the capital has become a veritable stomping ground for those pointedly seeking inspiration over security .
creative renown the city 's creative pool is deep .
designers , musicians , painters , fashion designers and filmmakers add to it and drink from it .
art feeds art in berlin .
and while that does not necessarily a make a booming economy , it does provide the capital with some excellent long-term prospects .
" almost everything in berlin relates in some way or another to creativity , " says volker hassemer of stiftung zukunft berlin -lrb- foundation for the future of berlin -rrb- .
" take telekom for example , they have a large creative department here , which is entirely because of the type of people that live in the city . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin has a thriving art scene and the telecommunications giant is not alone .
hassemer says businesses actively seeking creative input have picked up on the fact that it pays to offer creative jobs in berlin because they know they will stand a better chance of getting good people .
geppert goes one step further .
he says the german capital appeals to the kind of workers who are not only creative in what they do , but in the way they live their lives .
" we 're not talking here about people who want permanent contracts with all the perks of holiday and sick pay , but about those who come to berlin without work and who are willing to be freelance or take short-term contacts . "
more marketing yet for all that , there is a sense that germany 's biggest city could be doing a bit more to sell its creative vein to the commercial world , as well as to tourists and artists .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin fashion week is an annual fixture " we need to recognize the potential of what we have , " hassemer says , adding that the arts and culture landscape is currently too fractured to be of serious economic value .
he believes the capital needs to be more up front about how it wants to use the creative talent residing within its boundaries .
and for that it needs a cluster organization .
" cities should show themselves to the outside world , " hassemer said .
" berlin has a cluster for health care management , but has not managed to establish one for its creative industries , and that is a failure . "
he says that while establishing a cluster is not inherently easy , it could be done .
the major impediment is bad management on the part of politicians , who are too bound up in minor tussles to extend a hand of partnership to the creative branch .
hassemer is very clear that berlin should get on top of its potential sooner rather than later , because to squander it may well be to inflict lasting damage .
" how are we going to continue to compete as europeans when other countries are growing and producing so fast ? " he asks .
" not with manufactured products but with our cultural maturity . "

the " family literacy " project -lrb- fly -rrb- focuses on that group , which makes up 14 percent of hamburg 's population , and for that reason it was singled out for unesco 's 2010 literacy award .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de art -pipe- 08.09.2010 photographer explores beauty among women prisoners großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the women were asked how prison life had changed them a photographer in cologne has taken female inmates as the subjects of his work - a tall order , given penitentiary security .
the artist asked the women to describe what " beauty " meant to them in everyday prison life . it sounds rather macabre or , at the very least , a contradiction in terms - asking female prisoners to address the notion of beauty .
russian photographer igor chepikov , who has been living in cologne , germany since 1991 , visited a women 's penitentiary weekly for over 10 months .
there , after splashing a wall in white paint to serve as a backdrop , he took thousands pictures of some of the inmates .
those snapshots were ultimately distilled into a selection of just 56 photographs that compose the exhibition called " bad ossendorf : women in prison " now on show in cologne . the title is a play on words .
" bad " in front of the name a place normally refers to a spa town in german .
" ossendorf " is the name of the penitentiary outside of cologne .
" bad ossendorf , " then , could be translated as " resort ossendorf , " but is intended to also imply english connotations , as in " bad love , bad money , bad company . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the photographer took 24 pictures of each participant however one chooses to view the name , the subject of the exhibition - women in prison confronted with the topic of " beauty " - sounds like it 's begging for feminist critique .
after all , many of the female prisoners have more existential issues to address than philosophical matters like the definition of beauty .
they are worried about their children , who are now sitting in orphanages .
they are dismayed about the pain they have caused their relatives .
they want to liberate themselves from a vicious circle of crime . the photographer chepikov , at least , gave space to the women 's voices - choosing not just to display his photographs of them , but also to literally frame their " narratives . "
the photographer asked the women to answer certain questions in written form - to describe what beauty meant to them , if they felt they had lost time in prison , what effect prison had had on their bodies and souls ? some of the answers : " the feeling of loneliness is the worst . "
" i never thought prison could make a person look so bad . "
" there is no place to buy make-up here , or any other kind of personal hygiene products . "
" once i saw the photos , i realized how horrible the effects of the drugs have been . "
" i wish i could turn back the clock . "
" for me , ' beauty ' here in the prison essentially means being clean . " deutsche welle spoke with the photographer , igor chepikov , to get his take on " women in prison . " deutsche welle : why these photographs of women in prison ? why did you choose to do this ? igor chepikov : i came up with the idea about six years ago .
i was sitting in the moscow subway , and was looking out of the windows and thinking about the song " as time goes by . "
and then , i started reading something about prisons and got to thinking about what life is like in prisons .
a man , for instance , could be 20 years old and get 15 years in jail , but he 's only 35 when he gets out .
but when he 's 45 and gets out of prison -lsb- 15 years later -rsb- , he 's 60 .
life is over for him , and he has no possibility to change .
for women , it 's even harder - not only can they not adapt at that age , they have also lost their beauty .
i realized that i should take pictures of them before that happens . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some of the women spiffed themselves up for the photo sessions is n't that kind of loaded , this idea of women and beauty and prison ? i 'm not sure - that 's what i wanted to figure out : ' is it problematic for women , or not ? '
the prison administration was doubtful - they did n't think any of the women would want to present themselves in an exhibition , which is what my intention was from the start .
but 15 women wanted to participate , and that was a green light for my project from the get-go . what do you think the motivation was for these women to take part ? life in prison is quite boring .
participating in the project was almost like vacation - a departure from everyday life - for the women , who often sit for 23 hours a day in their cells .
for them , it was a connection to outside life . were n't the women ashamed to show themselves ? i 'm not sure .
they agreed to have their pictures taken .
some of the women were in prison for the second , third or fourth time .
one woman who agreed to take part had been free for a few months , then returned and said , ' hello , i 'm back , you can take more pictures of me . "
for her , it was like coming home again . do you have an example of one of the women 's stories , why she came to be in prison ? yes , i talked with the women , but their stories are supposed to remain private .
you can read the anonymous narratives hanging on the walls of the exhibition . some statistics show that women are victims themselves before they land in prison .
did you find that when you spoke with the women ? it was different .
you might find that in their narratives .
actually , a lot of these women were drug addicts , and many of them belong in a hospital or treatment center rather than a prison . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some felt the art project was an escape from everyday jail life what was one of the most difficult moments while you were photographing the women ? actually , it was beforehand - in convincing the prison administration to let me in .
they did n't really understand what i wanted and what my purpose was , but as soon as they got an idea of what i was aiming for - not criticizing the place , but just presenting the bit of beauty among the women in the prison - it was fine . how do you define beauty ? you have it or you do n't .
it 's not easily defined .
i can show it better than describe it in words .
each woman here in the exhibition has some form of beauty , even if it 's just something in her expression . is n't this a contrast , the idea of beauty and women in prison ? yes .
it 's difficult for people to imagine that women want to take care of themselves in jail , but many of the prisoners told me that it 's important to them , but they do n't have much of a chance to do that .
for the photo sessions , they made themselves up , had their hair cut . how did you try to make the women feel comfortable with you ? i brought cookies , cigarettes , tea .
and i talked with them - it was n't just a photo session with each , but also a chat . you trained as an architect , then switched to painting and finally , photography .
why ? i painted for 10 years - abstract painting .
but then i realized that there are just some things you can only capture in a moment , and i switched to photography .
my first photography project was in a slaughterhouse - i was impressed by the colors i could capture there , and the moment when life is extinguished .
you ca n't get this moment across in abstract paintings . do you think this project is political - the " women in prison " portraits ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some of the women said personal hygiene products are rare in prison no .
it 's human .
i do n't want to criticize anyone .
this is simply part of life , even if it 's scary at times . why women and not men ?
men can be beautiful too … because people think of women and not men when they hear the word beauty . you asked women to write some things down about beauty .
why ? because i wanted to know their opinions about the subject and not mine .
maybe they do n't think about it at all .
but from the letters , i can tell they do .
life is tough in prison , and it leaves traces on people 's faces much more than among people who are free . when one reads the narratives , it 's clear that the women are also struggling with other problems , like their drug addiction , missing their children , their safety .
is n't it a luxury to be asking questions about beauty , when the women are facing much tougher issues ? i do n't really know . interview : louisa schaefer editor : kate bowen the exhibition at the neues kunstforum in cologne runs through sept .

fewer , however , lay their hats in berlin , regardless of its cool , capital status . " increased competition for clever minds " is the title of a report analyzing migration from cities with more than half a million residents .
its three authors from the institute of employment research -lrb- iab -rrb- paint a picture in which well-educated germans most readily move to places renowned for their political leanings , their solid foundations , their ability to provide work and perhaps even for their good air , be it of the sea or mountain variety .
in many ways , the findings are not surprising .
not only for the cities that did feature at the top of the popularity chart , but also for those that did not .
most notably : germany 's unconventional capital berlin , which unlike hamburg and munich , has not had the benefit of being able to continually evolve since the days of the post-war economic miracle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : munich is the most popular career destination for well-educated germans after 40 years of division and almost 20 years of reunification , berlin is still trying to find its feet , economically speaking .
as martin gornig , the head of innovation , manufacturing and service at the german institute for economic research told deutsche welle , the capital city does not boast the kind of economic framework that entices people hoping to launch prosperous careers .
" berlin does n't have bmw or allianz , " he says .
" the big companies left berlin and they have not come back . "
and nor are they likely to , given the difficulties associated with uprooting established companies .
" what berlin has to do now is grow new ones , " gornig says .
" it might be a slow process , but it has to happen . "
gornig is not talking about new car manufacturers or new insurance companies , but about berlin playing to its greatest strength : creativity .
it has always had a reputation for attracting artists , but in recent years the capital has become a veritable stomping ground for those pointedly seeking inspiration over security .
creative renown the city 's creative pool is deep .
designers , musicians , painters , fashion designers and filmmakers add to it and drink from it .
art feeds art in berlin .
and while that does not necessarily a make a booming economy , it does provide the capital with some excellent long-term prospects .
" almost everything in berlin relates in some way or another to creativity , " says volker hassemer of stiftung zukunft berlin -lrb- foundation for the future of berlin -rrb- .
" take telekom for example , they have a large creative department here , which is entirely because of the type of people that live in the city . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin has a thriving art scene and the telecommunications giant is not alone .
hassemer says businesses actively seeking creative input have picked up on the fact that it pays to offer creative jobs in berlin because they know they will stand a better chance of getting good people .
geppert goes one step further .
he says the german capital appeals to the kind of workers who are not only creative in what they do , but in the way they live their lives .
" we 're not talking here about people who want permanent contracts with all the perks of holiday and sick pay , but about those who come to berlin without work and who are willing to be freelance or take short-term contacts . "
more marketing yet for all that , there is a sense that germany 's biggest city could be doing a bit more to sell its creative vein to the commercial world , as well as to tourists and artists .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin fashion week is an annual fixture " we need to recognize the potential of what we have , " hassemer says , adding that the arts and culture landscape is currently too fractured to be of serious economic value .
he believes the capital needs to be more up front about how it wants to use the creative talent residing within its boundaries .
and for that it needs a cluster organization .
" cities should show themselves to the outside world , " hassemer said .
" berlin has a cluster for health care management , but has not managed to establish one for its creative industries , and that is a failure . "
he says that while establishing a cluster is not inherently easy , it could be done .
the major impediment is bad management on the part of politicians , who are too bound up in minor tussles to extend a hand of partnership to the creative branch .
hassemer is very clear that berlin should get on top of its potential sooner rather than later , because to squander it may well be to inflict lasting damage .
" how are we going to continue to compete as europeans when other countries are growing and producing so fast ? " he asks .
" not with manufactured products but with our cultural maturity . "

the artist asked the women to describe what " beauty " meant to them in everyday prison life . it sounds rather macabre or , at the very least , a contradiction in terms - asking female prisoners to address the notion of beauty .
russian photographer igor chepikov , who has been living in cologne , germany since 1991 , visited a women 's penitentiary weekly for over 10 months .
there , after splashing a wall in white paint to serve as a backdrop , he took thousands pictures of some of the inmates .
those snapshots were ultimately distilled into a selection of just 56 photographs that compose the exhibition called " bad ossendorf : women in prison " now on show in cologne . the title is a play on words .
" bad " in front of the name a place normally refers to a spa town in german .
" ossendorf " is the name of the penitentiary outside of cologne .
" bad ossendorf , " then , could be translated as " resort ossendorf , " but is intended to also imply english connotations , as in " bad love , bad money , bad company . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the photographer took 24 pictures of each participant however one chooses to view the name , the subject of the exhibition - women in prison confronted with the topic of " beauty " - sounds like it 's begging for feminist critique .
after all , many of the female prisoners have more existential issues to address than philosophical matters like the definition of beauty .
they are worried about their children , who are now sitting in orphanages .
they are dismayed about the pain they have caused their relatives .
they want to liberate themselves from a vicious circle of crime . the photographer chepikov , at least , gave space to the women 's voices - choosing not just to display his photographs of them , but also to literally frame their " narratives . "
the photographer asked the women to answer certain questions in written form - to describe what beauty meant to them , if they felt they had lost time in prison , what effect prison had had on their bodies and souls ? some of the answers : " the feeling of loneliness is the worst . "
" i never thought prison could make a person look so bad . "
" there is no place to buy make-up here , or any other kind of personal hygiene products . "
" once i saw the photos , i realized how horrible the effects of the drugs have been . "
" i wish i could turn back the clock . "
" for me , ' beauty ' here in the prison essentially means being clean . " deutsche welle spoke with the photographer , igor chepikov , to get his take on " women in prison . " deutsche welle : why these photographs of women in prison ? why did you choose to do this ? igor chepikov : i came up with the idea about six years ago .
i was sitting in the moscow subway , and was looking out of the windows and thinking about the song " as time goes by . "
and then , i started reading something about prisons and got to thinking about what life is like in prisons .
a man , for instance , could be 20 years old and get 15 years in jail , but he 's only 35 when he gets out .
but when he 's 45 and gets out of prison -lsb- 15 years later -rsb- , he 's 60 .
life is over for him , and he has no possibility to change .
for women , it 's even harder - not only can they not adapt at that age , they have also lost their beauty .
i realized that i should take pictures of them before that happens . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some of the women spiffed themselves up for the photo sessions is n't that kind of loaded , this idea of women and beauty and prison ? i 'm not sure - that 's what i wanted to figure out : ' is it problematic for women , or not ? '
the prison administration was doubtful - they did n't think any of the women would want to present themselves in an exhibition , which is what my intention was from the start .
but 15 women wanted to participate , and that was a green light for my project from the get-go . what do you think the motivation was for these women to take part ? life in prison is quite boring .
participating in the project was almost like vacation - a departure from everyday life - for the women , who often sit for 23 hours a day in their cells .
for them , it was a connection to outside life . were n't the women ashamed to show themselves ? i 'm not sure .
they agreed to have their pictures taken .
some of the women were in prison for the second , third or fourth time .
one woman who agreed to take part had been free for a few months , then returned and said , ' hello , i 'm back , you can take more pictures of me . "
for her , it was like coming home again . do you have an example of one of the women 's stories , why she came to be in prison ? yes , i talked with the women , but their stories are supposed to remain private .
you can read the anonymous narratives hanging on the walls of the exhibition . some statistics show that women are victims themselves before they land in prison .
did you find that when you spoke with the women ? it was different .
you might find that in their narratives .
actually , a lot of these women were drug addicts , and many of them belong in a hospital or treatment center rather than a prison . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some felt the art project was an escape from everyday jail life what was one of the most difficult moments while you were photographing the women ? actually , it was beforehand - in convincing the prison administration to let me in .
they did n't really understand what i wanted and what my purpose was , but as soon as they got an idea of what i was aiming for - not criticizing the place , but just presenting the bit of beauty among the women in the prison - it was fine . how do you define beauty ? you have it or you do n't .
it 's not easily defined .
i can show it better than describe it in words .
each woman here in the exhibition has some form of beauty , even if it 's just something in her expression . is n't this a contrast , the idea of beauty and women in prison ? yes .
it 's difficult for people to imagine that women want to take care of themselves in jail , but many of the prisoners told me that it 's important to them , but they do n't have much of a chance to do that .
for the photo sessions , they made themselves up , had their hair cut . how did you try to make the women feel comfortable with you ? i brought cookies , cigarettes , tea .
and i talked with them - it was n't just a photo session with each , but also a chat . you trained as an architect , then switched to painting and finally , photography .
why ? i painted for 10 years - abstract painting .
but then i realized that there are just some things you can only capture in a moment , and i switched to photography .
my first photography project was in a slaughterhouse - i was impressed by the colors i could capture there , and the moment when life is extinguished .
you ca n't get this moment across in abstract paintings . do you think this project is political - the " women in prison " portraits ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some of the women said personal hygiene products are rare in prison no .
it 's human .
i do n't want to criticize anyone .
this is simply part of life , even if it 's scary at times . why women and not men ?
men can be beautiful too … because people think of women and not men when they hear the word beauty . you asked women to write some things down about beauty .
why ? because i wanted to know their opinions about the subject and not mine .
maybe they do n't think about it at all .
but from the letters , i can tell they do .
life is tough in prison , and it leaves traces on people 's faces much more than among people who are free . when one reads the narratives , it 's clear that the women are also struggling with other problems , like their drug addiction , missing their children , their safety .
is n't it a luxury to be asking questions about beauty , when the women are facing much tougher issues ? i do n't really know . interview : louisa schaefer editor : kate bowen the exhibition at the neues kunstforum in cologne runs through sept .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european ties -pipe- 08.09.2010 european neighbors warm to unified germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 2006 world cup cast a positive light on germany europeans were initially wary of the unification of divided germany .
now , 20 years on , germany has been fully accepted by its european neighbors . it was in january 1990 , during a walk along the french atlantic coast , that the then-chancellor helmut kohl convinced french president francois mitterrand to support german unification .
mitterrand was skeptical at first , but kohl persuaded him by pledging his commitment to european integration .
with france on board , helmut kohl had the backing of germany 's most important european neighbor .
french sentiment had normalized in a way that it had not done to the same degree in britain and the united states , says french political theorist and journalist alfred grosser .
" with a few exceptions , french opinion polls show that people here saw the germans as friends .
they thought it perfectly natural that the two states should become one again , " he said .
indeed , kohl did not have the same success with his british colleague , prime minister margaret thatcher .
she opposed a unified germany ; but she was replaced as british leader in november 1990 by her fellow conservative party member john major .
germany furthered european integration bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kohl 's passion about european integration convinced mitterrand kohl promised that germany would maintain the european union course of greater integration , which he reaffirmed a year later : " unified germany does not want a return to the europe of yesterday , " he declared to the bundestag .
" there can been no revival of old rivalries and nationalisms .
we want a new europe - one that does not suppress our national identity , one in which countries no longer oppose one another , where no nation stands in the shadow of another , but -lsb- a europe -rsb- in which , together , we can guarantee a future in peace and freedom , prosperity and security . "
over the 20 years since reunification , german governments of all political colors have upheld kohl 's promise : germany championed the admission of the former east bloc states into the eu ; it paid for the eu 's eastward expansion , and the germans gave up their currency , the deutschmark , for the euro . '
german unity signifies european unity ' the reservations many of germany 's neighbors still harbored about the country they had fought in world war ii gradually disappeared .
belgium , for example , had no qualms about germany 's increased size , according to political scientist dirk rochtus of lessius hogeschool university college in antwerp .
" german unity also signifies european unity , " he said .
" that was clear to us here in belgium .
if the two german nations come together again , it also signifies that we have overcome the division of europe .
we see that as a good thing . "
the older generation , which had lived through the german occupation of belgium , did have doubts though .
" naturally there are older people who still have memories of that time , " rochtus said .
" but generally it has to be said that the response has been quite matter-of-fact - and also that we make a distinction between a people , in this case the german people , and the regime that governed this people and headed the occupation regime in belgium .
we make a very big distinction between the two . "
poles and czechs skeptical germany 's neighbors to the east , poland and the czech republic , also had many initial reservations .
after the political upheaval they had experienced , poles realized that germany no longer made any claims on their country and that the german government was serious about european unity , according to janusz reiter , poland 's former ambassador to bonn -lrb- 1990-1995 -rrb- .
" nowadays , germany 's size is no reason for its neighbors to be afraid , " he said .
" the relationship between germany and poland is still not entirely free of ambivalence and tensions , but for different reasons . "
poles are well aware of germany 's economic strength , and are keen to go to their western neighbor to earn money , he added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poles like andrzej stasiuk remain cautious when it comes to germany but there are limits , according to polish author andrzej stasiuk .
" very few poles would think of going to germany on holiday , " he said .
" you do n't go to germany for fun . "
in a recent article for german magazine focus , stasiuk wrote : " germany is not to be taken for granted ; germany is equivocal .
you have to keep your eyes on germany . "
prague-based political scientist robert schuster believes that until the end of the 1990s czechs were afraid of germany - and of the possibility that germans expelled after world war ii might make claims against them .
tensions between the two only started to ease after they signed a joint declaration in 1998 .
the declaration addressed the wounds of the past , as well as crimes committed during and after world war ii ; and it also highlighted perspectives for a joint future .
" the two countries are not competing anymore , " schuster said .
" they are no longer enemies , but members of a community , the eu .
and members of nato .
this aspect of security policy should not be underestimated . "
and he added that young czechs - who have had the opportunity to travel to germany , to study there and meet germans of their own age - have a completely different image of germans to that of the generation aged 50 and over .
football instigated the breakthrough the netherlands , luxembourg , switzerland and austria at first held back , but then gave their approval to german unification .
today , the spending power of german tourists means they are more popular than ever in their neighboring countries , although opinion polls suggest that germans themselves do n't quite believe this .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 2006 world cup showed a side of the country that many had not seen before " we ca n't tell the difference any more between ossis and wessis - that is , germans from the former east or west , " said austrian historian oliver radkolb .
and germany 's northern neighbor , denmark , has also accepted the new , larger germany , according to danish writer knud romer .
for decades danes regarded the germans as a nation of perpetrators , as did many other people in europe , he pointed out .
the breakthrough came with the soccer world cup , which germany hosted in 2006 , he added .
" that was when i realized , for the first time , that the war was over .
finished .
there 's none of that anymore , " romer said .
" and the danes were cheering the germans on . "

but a comparison between debates in germany and the united states suggests they shed more heat than light . with the publication of his book " deutschland schafft sich ab " -lrb- " germany abolishes itself " -rrb- in late august , banker and politician thilo sarrazin gifted the german media an incendiary topic for the autumn .
among the book 's controversial theses is the idea that higher fertility rates would allow non-assimilated muslims to dominate germany in the not-too-distant future .
the book tapped into fears among some germans that german culture and the german way of life is in danger .
but the discussions engendered were reminiscent of similar debates in other cultures .
in the united states , the publication in 2004 of a book entitled " who are we ? " by political scientist samuel p. huntington sparked discussions about whether the increasing prevalence of spanish-speaking americans would bifurcate us culture and threaten what the author called the american " creed " of enlightenment democracy .
but though the subject matters are seemingly similar , the levels of discourse in the two debates are very different .
german immigration expert klaus j. bade praises sarrazin for pointing up abuse of the german welfare system by migrants and germans .
but he takes the author to task in other areas .
" huntington 's book was more scientifically informed , whereas sarrazin knows as much about demography as i do about his specialty , state finances : namely just bits and pieces , " bade told deutsche welle .
" in this field he 's a populist writer who partly trades in cheap commonplaces and looks for statistical evidence for pre-conceived ideas - the exact opposite of the scientific method .
it 's what we call beer-coaster demographics . "
and the difference between a demagogue and a respected professor is not the only respect in which superficial similarities fall apart .
apples and oranges bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us hispanics , including this woman voting in denver , are becoming more and more important debates in germany and the us about whether immigrants are sufficiently assimilating are inflected by the different histories and demographics of the two countries .
the united states is a nation with a growing population and a rising number of immigrants , which from its very inception embraced the idea of foreigners becoming citizens .
germany , on the other hand , has stagnant population and immigration and was traditionally wary of taking in non-germans looking to better their lots in life .
" social integration and acknowledgement of the dialogue with muslim communities - these things have developed over the past few years , " philip anderson , professor of social sciences at the university of regensburg , told deutsche welle .
" but there needs to be more of that and far less of the fear of a sullying of the german identity and sometimes even german blood . "
debates about assimilation in germany and in other western european countries are additionally heated because most of the foreign residents and immigrants in question are muslim .
but klaus bade warns against seeing them as a homogeneous group .
" there 's no such thing as a single muslim group in germany , " bade said .
" immigration from iran , for example , centered on elites who had little problem integrating into german society .
immigrant turks tended to come from rural anatolia , and not istanbul , and so there were educational problems , especially three generations ago .
but that had nothing to do with them being muslims .
problems among italian immigrants , for instance , were and still are worse . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thilo sarrazin -lrb- r . -rrb- has been doing the talk-show rounds self-fulfilling prophecies sarrazin has had to step down from his job on the board of germany 's federal bank , and may yet lose his membership in the social democratic party for his ill-advised and ill-informed opinions .
but is there anything to the points he - or huntington - raised ?
can demographic changes mean the end of a language , a culture and a way of life ?
" there is an aspect comparable between both books , namely the vision of a competition between cultures , " bade said .
" but competition is not the same thing as total war .
moreover , we should think less about groups and systems and more about individuals .
for many people the huntington book has something of a self-fulfilling prophecy .
it 's a circular argument that echoes older fears about the decline and fall of western civilization .
this seems , on a national level , comparable to sarrazin 's message . "
in other words , warnings about conflicts of civilizations - to paraphrase the title of another of huntington 's books - tend to create the sort of tension they claim to be decrying .
" generally there is far more acceptance - especially in the cities , where people lived together - than is usually acknowledged , " anderson said .
" politicians need to push that as a positive image of how people are getting on . "
for bade , reasoning that fails to distinguish and differentiate between individual attitudes among immigrants and resident aliens is inherently faulty .
" when asked ' when did you last go to a mosque , ' many european muslims may not know where the nearest one is or may respond : ' for religious or cultural reasons ? '
that 's comparable to the way many christians feel who may go to church to look at art or attend a wedding .
there 's an infinite number of hybrid forms and milieus of islam , and from one generation to another muslims themselves will - hopefully - adapt more and more to european civilization as they did and still do in the us . " culture is constantly in flux , and demographic changes , of course , bring cultural shifts with them .
but a " host " culture being taken over by a monolithic foreign group , say experts , is one thing neither americans nor germans need to fear . author : jefferson chase editor : rob mudge send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

structural changes have left urban populations in decline , and the brightest inhabitants are usually the first to go . right on germany 's eastern border the town of schwedt overlooks the river oder .
in the 1960s , this was a boom town : people moved here in tens of thousands to work in the local oil refinery .

the pr assistant in schwedt town hall insists that the mayor himself will answer any questions .
" urban restructuring is a matter for the boss , " she says .
sure enough , the mayor , juergen polzehl , a gray-haired man in his mid-50s , invites me to go for a ride with him in his official car .
he tells the chauffeur to drive us to the kuelz district .
on the way there we pass row upon row of prefabricated apartment blocks - a legacy of the final , brief heyday of the uckermark regional municipality .

workers at the refinery were laid off .
in the past 20 years , 20,000 people have moved away from schwedt .
at one time thousands of apartments stood empty .
" we had to respond to the situation , " says polzehl , pointing out of the window .
suddenly the buildings are interrupted by a wide , uneven open space .
" all this was apartment blocks , one after another .
now it 's all been returned to nature , " polzehl explains .
for a while they were demolishing as many as a thousand apartments in a year in schwedt .
now , polzehl says , it 's about 150 per year : the contraction of the town is gradually becoming more manageable .
billions of euros have been spent on urban restructuring .
demolition , reconstruction and reforestation help alleviate the sadness of the shrinking towns , but the alteration of the demographic has had a lasting effect on the makeup of the population .
polzehl is particularly concerned that so many young women have moved away .
this is a problem for many of the regions - and it has led to a severe shortage of young women in the new federal states .
the newspaper die welt reports that , in the 25-30 age bracket , in the east there are only 85 women for every 100 men .
polzehl remains optimistic .
" perhaps that will change if we locate a few businesses here and a local authority office .

the percentage of people in urban areas with access is declining . lack of access to clean sources of water remains a major problem is much of the world , said anders berntell , executive director of the stockholm international water institute -lrb- siwi -rrb- . " bad water kills more people than hiv , malaria and wars together , affecting the lives of families and the economic development of many countries around the world , " he said at the world water week conference being held in the swedish capital . the united nation 's food and agriculture organization estimates that within the next 15 years , 1.8 billion people will be living in regions with acute water scarcity , and that two-thirds of the world 's population could be facing shortages . thirsty cities bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many people in cities lack the clean water they need while the plight of those in dry , rural areas has long been examined by development aid and the work of non-governmental organizations -lrb- ngos -rrb- , people in urban areas also suffer from lack of access to water , according to gerard payen , who heads the international federation of private water operators -lrb- aquafed -rrb- . " in cities , there are today more people suffering from a poor and unsatisfactory access to safe water and sanitation than at the end of the 20th century , " payen said in a statement . access to safe drinking water was recognized as a human right by the united nations general assembly in july , yet the un , together with ngos and individual governments , has struggled for decades to get potable water to hundreds of millions of people worldwide who lack water and basic sanitation services . growing population bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in some places , a trek is necessary to get clean water population growth is one of the biggest difficulties they confront .
between 2000 and 2008 , the world 's population increased by 635 million people , 80 percent of whom live in urban areas , according to un data . " the proportion of the urban population that benefits from satisfactory access to drinking water or sanitation is decreasing , " aquafed said , pointing to un statistics showing that 114 million more people went without access to tap water at home or in the immediate vicinity at the end of the eight-year-period . at the same time , 134 million more people went without access to basic sanitation , the group said , pointing out that in both cases there had been a 20 percent hike of urban dwellers lacking access .

now , 20 years on , germany has been fully accepted by its european neighbors . it was in january 1990 , during a walk along the french atlantic coast , that the then-chancellor helmut kohl convinced french president francois mitterrand to support german unification .
mitterrand was skeptical at first , but kohl persuaded him by pledging his commitment to european integration .
with france on board , helmut kohl had the backing of germany 's most important european neighbor .
french sentiment had normalized in a way that it had not done to the same degree in britain and the united states , says french political theorist and journalist alfred grosser .
" with a few exceptions , french opinion polls show that people here saw the germans as friends .
they thought it perfectly natural that the two states should become one again , " he said .
indeed , kohl did not have the same success with his british colleague , prime minister margaret thatcher .
she opposed a unified germany ; but she was replaced as british leader in november 1990 by her fellow conservative party member john major .
germany furthered european integration bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kohl 's passion about european integration convinced mitterrand kohl promised that germany would maintain the european union course of greater integration , which he reaffirmed a year later : " unified germany does not want a return to the europe of yesterday , " he declared to the bundestag .
" there can been no revival of old rivalries and nationalisms .
we want a new europe - one that does not suppress our national identity , one in which countries no longer oppose one another , where no nation stands in the shadow of another , but -lsb- a europe -rsb- in which , together , we can guarantee a future in peace and freedom , prosperity and security . "
over the 20 years since reunification , german governments of all political colors have upheld kohl 's promise : germany championed the admission of the former east bloc states into the eu ; it paid for the eu 's eastward expansion , and the germans gave up their currency , the deutschmark , for the euro . '
german unity signifies european unity ' the reservations many of germany 's neighbors still harbored about the country they had fought in world war ii gradually disappeared .
belgium , for example , had no qualms about germany 's increased size , according to political scientist dirk rochtus of lessius hogeschool university college in antwerp .
" german unity also signifies european unity , " he said .
" that was clear to us here in belgium .
if the two german nations come together again , it also signifies that we have overcome the division of europe .
we see that as a good thing . "
the older generation , which had lived through the german occupation of belgium , did have doubts though .
" naturally there are older people who still have memories of that time , " rochtus said .
" but generally it has to be said that the response has been quite matter-of-fact - and also that we make a distinction between a people , in this case the german people , and the regime that governed this people and headed the occupation regime in belgium .
we make a very big distinction between the two . "
poles and czechs skeptical germany 's neighbors to the east , poland and the czech republic , also had many initial reservations .
after the political upheaval they had experienced , poles realized that germany no longer made any claims on their country and that the german government was serious about european unity , according to janusz reiter , poland 's former ambassador to bonn -lrb- 1990-1995 -rrb- .
" nowadays , germany 's size is no reason for its neighbors to be afraid , " he said .
" the relationship between germany and poland is still not entirely free of ambivalence and tensions , but for different reasons . "
poles are well aware of germany 's economic strength , and are keen to go to their western neighbor to earn money , he added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poles like andrzej stasiuk remain cautious when it comes to germany but there are limits , according to polish author andrzej stasiuk .
" very few poles would think of going to germany on holiday , " he said .
" you do n't go to germany for fun . "
in a recent article for german magazine focus , stasiuk wrote : " germany is not to be taken for granted ; germany is equivocal .
you have to keep your eyes on germany . "
prague-based political scientist robert schuster believes that until the end of the 1990s czechs were afraid of germany - and of the possibility that germans expelled after world war ii might make claims against them .
tensions between the two only started to ease after they signed a joint declaration in 1998 .
the declaration addressed the wounds of the past , as well as crimes committed during and after world war ii ; and it also highlighted perspectives for a joint future .
" the two countries are not competing anymore , " schuster said .
" they are no longer enemies , but members of a community , the eu .
and members of nato .
this aspect of security policy should not be underestimated . "
and he added that young czechs - who have had the opportunity to travel to germany , to study there and meet germans of their own age - have a completely different image of germans to that of the generation aged 50 and over .
football instigated the breakthrough the netherlands , luxembourg , switzerland and austria at first held back , but then gave their approval to german unification .
today , the spending power of german tourists means they are more popular than ever in their neighboring countries , although opinion polls suggest that germans themselves do n't quite believe this .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 2006 world cup showed a side of the country that many had not seen before " we ca n't tell the difference any more between ossis and wessis - that is , germans from the former east or west , " said austrian historian oliver radkolb .
and germany 's northern neighbor , denmark , has also accepted the new , larger germany , according to danish writer knud romer .
for decades danes regarded the germans as a nation of perpetrators , as did many other people in europe , he pointed out .
the breakthrough came with the soccer world cup , which germany hosted in 2006 , he added .
" that was when i realized , for the first time , that the war was over .
finished .
there 's none of that anymore , " romer said .
" and the danes were cheering the germans on . "

now , 20 years on , germany has been fully accepted by its european neighbors . it was in january 1990 , during a walk along the french atlantic coast , that the then-chancellor helmut kohl convinced french president francois mitterrand to support german unification .
mitterrand was skeptical at first , but kohl persuaded him by pledging his commitment to european integration .
with france on board , helmut kohl had the backing of germany 's most important european neighbor .
french sentiment had normalized in a way that it had not done to the same degree in britain and the united states , says french political theorist and journalist alfred grosser .
" with a few exceptions , french opinion polls show that people here saw the germans as friends .
they thought it perfectly natural that the two states should become one again , " he said .
indeed , kohl did not have the same success with his british colleague , prime minister margaret thatcher .
she opposed a unified germany ; but she was replaced as british leader in november 1990 by her fellow conservative party member john major .
germany furthered european integration bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kohl 's passion about european integration convinced mitterrand kohl promised that germany would maintain the european union course of greater integration , which he reaffirmed a year later : " unified germany does not want a return to the europe of yesterday , " he declared to the bundestag .
" there can been no revival of old rivalries and nationalisms .
we want a new europe - one that does not suppress our national identity , one in which countries no longer oppose one another , where no nation stands in the shadow of another , but -lsb- a europe -rsb- in which , together , we can guarantee a future in peace and freedom , prosperity and security . "
over the 20 years since reunification , german governments of all political colors have upheld kohl 's promise : germany championed the admission of the former east bloc states into the eu ; it paid for the eu 's eastward expansion , and the germans gave up their currency , the deutschmark , for the euro . '
german unity signifies european unity ' the reservations many of germany 's neighbors still harbored about the country they had fought in world war ii gradually disappeared .
belgium , for example , had no qualms about germany 's increased size , according to political scientist dirk rochtus of lessius hogeschool university college in antwerp .
" german unity also signifies european unity , " he said .
" that was clear to us here in belgium .
if the two german nations come together again , it also signifies that we have overcome the division of europe .
we see that as a good thing . "
the older generation , which had lived through the german occupation of belgium , did have doubts though .
" naturally there are older people who still have memories of that time , " rochtus said .
" but generally it has to be said that the response has been quite matter-of-fact - and also that we make a distinction between a people , in this case the german people , and the regime that governed this people and headed the occupation regime in belgium .
we make a very big distinction between the two . "
poles and czechs skeptical germany 's neighbors to the east , poland and the czech republic , also had many initial reservations .
after the political upheaval they had experienced , poles realized that germany no longer made any claims on their country and that the german government was serious about european unity , according to janusz reiter , poland 's former ambassador to bonn -lrb- 1990-1995 -rrb- .
" nowadays , germany 's size is no reason for its neighbors to be afraid , " he said .
" the relationship between germany and poland is still not entirely free of ambivalence and tensions , but for different reasons . "
poles are well aware of germany 's economic strength , and are keen to go to their western neighbor to earn money , he added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poles like andrzej stasiuk remain cautious when it comes to germany but there are limits , according to polish author andrzej stasiuk .
" very few poles would think of going to germany on holiday , " he said .
" you do n't go to germany for fun . "
in a recent article for german magazine focus , stasiuk wrote : " germany is not to be taken for granted ; germany is equivocal .
you have to keep your eyes on germany . "
prague-based political scientist robert schuster believes that until the end of the 1990s czechs were afraid of germany - and of the possibility that germans expelled after world war ii might make claims against them .
tensions between the two only started to ease after they signed a joint declaration in 1998 .
the declaration addressed the wounds of the past , as well as crimes committed during and after world war ii ; and it also highlighted perspectives for a joint future .
" the two countries are not competing anymore , " schuster said .
" they are no longer enemies , but members of a community , the eu .
and members of nato .
this aspect of security policy should not be underestimated . "
and he added that young czechs - who have had the opportunity to travel to germany , to study there and meet germans of their own age - have a completely different image of germans to that of the generation aged 50 and over .
football instigated the breakthrough the netherlands , luxembourg , switzerland and austria at first held back , but then gave their approval to german unification .
today , the spending power of german tourists means they are more popular than ever in their neighboring countries , although opinion polls suggest that germans themselves do n't quite believe this .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 2006 world cup showed a side of the country that many had not seen before " we ca n't tell the difference any more between ossis and wessis - that is , germans from the former east or west , " said austrian historian oliver radkolb .
and germany 's northern neighbor , denmark , has also accepted the new , larger germany , according to danish writer knud romer .
for decades danes regarded the germans as a nation of perpetrators , as did many other people in europe , he pointed out .
the breakthrough came with the soccer world cup , which germany hosted in 2006 , he added .
" that was when i realized , for the first time , that the war was over .
finished .
there 's none of that anymore , " romer said .
" and the danes were cheering the germans on . "

over the 20 years since reunification , german governments of all political colors have upheld kohl 's promise : germany championed the admission of the former east bloc states into the eu ; it paid for the eu 's eastward expansion , and the germans gave up their currency , the deutschmark , for the euro . '
german unity signifies european unity ' the reservations many of germany 's neighbors still harbored about the country they had fought in world war ii gradually disappeared .
belgium , for example , had no qualms about germany 's increased size , according to political scientist dirk rochtus of lessius hogeschool university college in antwerp .
" german unity also signifies european unity , " he said .
" that was clear to us here in belgium .
if the two german nations come together again , it also signifies that we have overcome the division of europe .
we see that as a good thing . "
the older generation , which had lived through the german occupation of belgium , did have doubts though .
" naturally there are older people who still have memories of that time , " rochtus said .
" but generally it has to be said that the response has been quite matter-of-fact - and also that we make a distinction between a people , in this case the german people , and the regime that governed this people and headed the occupation regime in belgium .
we make a very big distinction between the two . "
poles and czechs skeptical germany 's neighbors to the east , poland and the czech republic , also had many initial reservations .
after the political upheaval they had experienced , poles realized that germany no longer made any claims on their country and that the german government was serious about european unity , according to janusz reiter , poland 's former ambassador to bonn -lrb- 1990-1995 -rrb- .
" nowadays , germany 's size is no reason for its neighbors to be afraid , " he said .
" the relationship between germany and poland is still not entirely free of ambivalence and tensions , but for different reasons . "
poles are well aware of germany 's economic strength , and are keen to go to their western neighbor to earn money , he added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poles like andrzej stasiuk remain cautious when it comes to germany but there are limits , according to polish author andrzej stasiuk .
" very few poles would think of going to germany on holiday , " he said .
" you do n't go to germany for fun . "
in a recent article for german magazine focus , stasiuk wrote : " germany is not to be taken for granted ; germany is equivocal .
you have to keep your eyes on germany . "
prague-based political scientist robert schuster believes that until the end of the 1990s czechs were afraid of germany - and of the possibility that germans expelled after world war ii might make claims against them .
tensions between the two only started to ease after they signed a joint declaration in 1998 .
the declaration addressed the wounds of the past , as well as crimes committed during and after world war ii ; and it also highlighted perspectives for a joint future .
" the two countries are not competing anymore , " schuster said .
" they are no longer enemies , but members of a community , the eu .
and members of nato .
this aspect of security policy should not be underestimated . "
and he added that young czechs - who have had the opportunity to travel to germany , to study there and meet germans of their own age - have a completely different image of germans to that of the generation aged 50 and over .
football instigated the breakthrough the netherlands , luxembourg , switzerland and austria at first held back , but then gave their approval to german unification .
today , the spending power of german tourists means they are more popular than ever in their neighboring countries , although opinion polls suggest that germans themselves do n't quite believe this .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 2006 world cup showed a side of the country that many had not seen before " we ca n't tell the difference any more between ossis and wessis - that is , germans from the former east or west , " said austrian historian oliver radkolb .
and germany 's northern neighbor , denmark , has also accepted the new , larger germany , according to danish writer knud romer .
for decades danes regarded the germans as a nation of perpetrators , as did many other people in europe , he pointed out .
the breakthrough came with the soccer world cup , which germany hosted in 2006 , he added .
" that was when i realized , for the first time , that the war was over .
finished .
there 's none of that anymore , " romer said .
" and the danes were cheering the germans on . "

structural changes have left urban populations in decline , and the brightest inhabitants are usually the first to go . right on germany 's eastern border the town of schwedt overlooks the river oder .
in the 1960s , this was a boom town : people moved here in tens of thousands to work in the local oil refinery .
but since reunification that trend has been radically reversed .
the pr assistant in schwedt town hall insists that the mayor himself will answer any questions .
" urban restructuring is a matter for the boss , " she says .
sure enough , the mayor , juergen polzehl , a gray-haired man in his mid-50s , invites me to go for a ride with him in his official car .
he tells the chauffeur to drive us to the kuelz district .
on the way there we pass row upon row of prefabricated apartment blocks - a legacy of the final , brief heyday of the uckermark regional municipality .
the town 's population swelled to 52,000 after the refinery was built , and housing had to be created for all the new arrivals .
rapid decline in population bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mayor polzehl says schwedt has spent billions of euros on urban restructuring then came german reunification .
workers at the refinery were laid off .
in the past 20 years , 20,000 people have moved away from schwedt .
at one time thousands of apartments stood empty .
" we had to respond to the situation , " says polzehl , pointing out of the window .
suddenly the buildings are interrupted by a wide , uneven open space .
" all this was apartment blocks , one after another .
now it 's all been returned to nature , " polzehl explains .
for a while they were demolishing as many as a thousand apartments in a year in schwedt .
now , polzehl says , it 's about 150 per year : the contraction of the town is gradually becoming more manageable .
billions of euros have been spent on urban restructuring .
demolition , reconstruction and reforestation help alleviate the sadness of the shrinking towns , but the alteration of the demographic has had a lasting effect on the makeup of the population .
polzehl is particularly concerned that so many young women have moved away .
this is a problem for many of the regions - and it has led to a severe shortage of young women in the new federal states .
the newspaper die welt reports that , in the 25-30 age bracket , in the east there are only 85 women for every 100 men .
polzehl remains optimistic .
" perhaps that will change if we locate a few businesses here and a local authority office .
that 'll improve the job situation , " he says , hopefully .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the oil refinery was once the city 's largest employer brain drain the mayor has set himself a considerable challenge .
conditions here , as in many parts of eastern germany , are not good .
the unemployment figure for the country as a whole is less than eight percent , but the east is struggling with more than 12 percent unemployment .
in schwedt it is even higher at 16 percent .
more efficient production methods and the closing or relocation of industry have greatly reduced the number of jobs available in the east .
those who are able to leave , do .
salaries , too , are higher in the west .
the young , the intelligent and the educated are leading the exodus , leaving behind the old and those described by despairing employers as " barely trainable . "
in an interview with the berliner zeitung in 2004 , ulf matthiesen , a researcher in area studies , described them as " unemployed urban idiots with no family ties and no prospect of forming a relationship . "
in parts of brandenburg and mecklenburg-western pomerania the number of pupils dropping out of school is 50 percent higher than the national average .
more than 10 percent leave school early , according to heike liebmann , head of the city regeneration department at the leibniz institute for regional development .
she describes this as an indication of the degree to which the general level of education among the local population has fallen .
furthermore , the fewer creative and enterprising people there are in public life , the less attractive the prospect of staying here becomes for those left behind .
it 's a vicious circle .
every year , ruediger ober-bloebaum resigns himself to seeing more of schwedt 's bright young people move away .
the stocky 50-year-old is the headmaster of the town 's last remaining high school .
last summer 103 pupils graduated , but he says : " of these , only seven are staying in schwedt .
the others are all going away to study or start an apprenticeship , and only 10 of those think they might come back . "
ober-bloebaum supposes schwedt is too quiet for them ; there 's just not enough going on there .
but there 's another problem , too .
he refers to a 2007 study by the berlin institute for population and development which suggested " that the girls are leaving because they find the boys here too stupid . "
wild , wild east bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : large parts of schwedt are returning to nature before unification in 1990 , then-chancellor helmut kohl spoke of the prospect of " landscapes in bloom . "
he used the term as a metaphor for the economic development of the east , but in recent years regional planners have suggested it should be taken literally .
they have proposed returning parts of eastern germany to nature .
liebmann says it 's hard to imagine how the movement of people could be controlled in such a process , but she adds that " it is certainly useful for society to consider whether it can afford to maintain the existing infrastructure in areas that are becoming less densely populated . "
polzehl is dismissive of such ideas .
" we ca n't just let all this become a jungle .
we have our roots here ; this is our home . "
and schwedt still has good things to offer .
it is responsible for 15 percent of the industrial production of the state of brandenburg , and germany 's only meadowland national park is right next door .
on the way back to the town hall , mayor polzehl draws encouragement from his own life story .
" i moved away too , when i was young , " he says .
" and now i 'm back again . "

the european parliament has agreed on rules to closely monitor procedures , with a complete ban on using some species . animal experiments in the eu are set to become fewer in number and subject to stricter rules under a new directive backed by the european parliament on wednesday .
the european commission rules were described as a " quantum leap for animal protection " by european parliamentarian elisabeth jeggle , a german christian democrat who steered the directive through parliament .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : potocnik said the eu was setting new standards the measures , which would still allow the testing of animals for medical research , were described as setting the highest animal welfare standards in the world by eu environment commissioner janez potocnik .
under the legislation , national authorities will have to assess the animal welfare implications of every experiment carried out .
each country will be given two years to comply with the rules , and authorities must " ensure that whenever an alternative method is available , this is used instead of animal testing . "
in addition , animal welfare officials must also work at ensuring that pain experienced in experiments that actually go ahead is reduced .
ban on use of certain primates the rules also place greater restrictions on the use of primates in testing .
experiments on great apes such as chimpanzees , gorillas and orangutans are to be banned , while " strict " restrictions are to be introduced on the use of primates more generally .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the directive includes a ban on tests on great apes the legislation allows researchers to use primates in testing illnesses such as alzheimer 's disease , cancer or parkinson 's disease only where there is scientific evidence that no alternative is available .
eu health and consumer policy commissioner john dalli called the directive - which updates rules last agreed in 1986 - " a good compromise on a difficult topic . "
however , not every member of parliament was satisfied .
" i would have liked even stricter restrictions , " said ulrike rodust , a germany social democrat .
some 12 million animals are experimented upon each year in the eu .
last year the eu banned animal testing for developing cosmetics , apart from long-running toxicology tests , which will be banned in 2013 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de art -pipe- 08.09.2010 photographer explores beauty among women prisoners großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the women were asked how prison life had changed them a photographer in cologne has taken female inmates as the subjects of his work - a tall order , given penitentiary security .
the artist asked the women to describe what " beauty " meant to them in everyday prison life . it sounds rather macabre or , at the very least , a contradiction in terms - asking female prisoners to address the notion of beauty .
russian photographer igor chepikov , who has been living in cologne , germany since 1991 , visited a women 's penitentiary weekly for over 10 months .
there , after splashing a wall in white paint to serve as a backdrop , he took thousands pictures of some of the inmates .
those snapshots were ultimately distilled into a selection of just 56 photographs that compose the exhibition called " bad ossendorf : women in prison " now on show in cologne . the title is a play on words .
" bad " in front of the name a place normally refers to a spa town in german .
" ossendorf " is the name of the penitentiary outside of cologne .
" bad ossendorf , " then , could be translated as " resort ossendorf , " but is intended to also imply english connotations , as in " bad love , bad money , bad company . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the photographer took 24 pictures of each participant however one chooses to view the name , the subject of the exhibition - women in prison confronted with the topic of " beauty " - sounds like it 's begging for feminist critique .
after all , many of the female prisoners have more existential issues to address than philosophical matters like the definition of beauty .
they are worried about their children , who are now sitting in orphanages .
they are dismayed about the pain they have caused their relatives .
they want to liberate themselves from a vicious circle of crime . the photographer chepikov , at least , gave space to the women 's voices - choosing not just to display his photographs of them , but also to literally frame their " narratives . "
the photographer asked the women to answer certain questions in written form - to describe what beauty meant to them , if they felt they had lost time in prison , what effect prison had had on their bodies and souls ? some of the answers : " the feeling of loneliness is the worst . "
" i never thought prison could make a person look so bad . "
" there is no place to buy make-up here , or any other kind of personal hygiene products . "
" once i saw the photos , i realized how horrible the effects of the drugs have been . "
" i wish i could turn back the clock . "
" for me , ' beauty ' here in the prison essentially means being clean . " deutsche welle spoke with the photographer , igor chepikov , to get his take on " women in prison . " deutsche welle : why these photographs of women in prison ? why did you choose to do this ? igor chepikov : i came up with the idea about six years ago .
i was sitting in the moscow subway , and was looking out of the windows and thinking about the song " as time goes by . "
and then , i started reading something about prisons and got to thinking about what life is like in prisons .
a man , for instance , could be 20 years old and get 15 years in jail , but he 's only 35 when he gets out .
but when he 's 45 and gets out of prison -lsb- 15 years later -rsb- , he 's 60 .
life is over for him , and he has no possibility to change .
for women , it 's even harder - not only can they not adapt at that age , they have also lost their beauty .
i realized that i should take pictures of them before that happens . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some of the women spiffed themselves up for the photo sessions is n't that kind of loaded , this idea of women and beauty and prison ? i 'm not sure - that 's what i wanted to figure out : ' is it problematic for women , or not ? '
the prison administration was doubtful - they did n't think any of the women would want to present themselves in an exhibition , which is what my intention was from the start .
but 15 women wanted to participate , and that was a green light for my project from the get-go . what do you think the motivation was for these women to take part ? life in prison is quite boring .
participating in the project was almost like vacation - a departure from everyday life - for the women , who often sit for 23 hours a day in their cells .
for them , it was a connection to outside life . were n't the women ashamed to show themselves ? i 'm not sure .
they agreed to have their pictures taken .
some of the women were in prison for the second , third or fourth time .
one woman who agreed to take part had been free for a few months , then returned and said , ' hello , i 'm back , you can take more pictures of me . "
for her , it was like coming home again . do you have an example of one of the women 's stories , why she came to be in prison ? yes , i talked with the women , but their stories are supposed to remain private .
you can read the anonymous narratives hanging on the walls of the exhibition . some statistics show that women are victims themselves before they land in prison .
did you find that when you spoke with the women ? it was different .
you might find that in their narratives .
actually , a lot of these women were drug addicts , and many of them belong in a hospital or treatment center rather than a prison . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some felt the art project was an escape from everyday jail life what was one of the most difficult moments while you were photographing the women ? actually , it was beforehand - in convincing the prison administration to let me in .
they did n't really understand what i wanted and what my purpose was , but as soon as they got an idea of what i was aiming for - not criticizing the place , but just presenting the bit of beauty among the women in the prison - it was fine . how do you define beauty ? you have it or you do n't .
it 's not easily defined .
i can show it better than describe it in words .
each woman here in the exhibition has some form of beauty , even if it 's just something in her expression . is n't this a contrast , the idea of beauty and women in prison ? yes .
it 's difficult for people to imagine that women want to take care of themselves in jail , but many of the prisoners told me that it 's important to them , but they do n't have much of a chance to do that .
for the photo sessions , they made themselves up , had their hair cut . how did you try to make the women feel comfortable with you ? i brought cookies , cigarettes , tea .
and i talked with them - it was n't just a photo session with each , but also a chat . you trained as an architect , then switched to painting and finally , photography .
why ? i painted for 10 years - abstract painting .
but then i realized that there are just some things you can only capture in a moment , and i switched to photography .
my first photography project was in a slaughterhouse - i was impressed by the colors i could capture there , and the moment when life is extinguished .
you ca n't get this moment across in abstract paintings . do you think this project is political - the " women in prison " portraits ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some of the women said personal hygiene products are rare in prison no .
it 's human .
i do n't want to criticize anyone .
this is simply part of life , even if it 's scary at times . why women and not men ?
men can be beautiful too … because people think of women and not men when they hear the word beauty . you asked women to write some things down about beauty .
why ? because i wanted to know their opinions about the subject and not mine .
maybe they do n't think about it at all .
but from the letters , i can tell they do .
life is tough in prison , and it leaves traces on people 's faces much more than among people who are free . when one reads the narratives , it 's clear that the women are also struggling with other problems , like their drug addiction , missing their children , their safety .
is n't it a luxury to be asking questions about beauty , when the women are facing much tougher issues ? i do n't really know . interview : louisa schaefer editor : kate bowen the exhibition at the neues kunstforum in cologne runs through sept .

the court said the gambling laws were being applied inconsistently . the german government 's monopoly on most forms of gambling must be ended immediately , according to the european court of justice in luxembourg .
the court ruled that " the german rules do not limit games of chance in a consistent and systematic manner . " it said that the state the monopoly is not justifiable .
under german law , only the country 's 16 federal states or companies run by them can offer gambling services .
the state therefore has an effective monopoly on gambling and lotteries .
the law also bans most web-based betting , and forbids advertising such services .
the german state treaty on gambling came into force in 2008 to curb a growing trend in gambling addiction .
critics say it simply ensured that the state received a substantial chunk of the revenue from gambling .
internet betting agencies based abroad a number of private betting companies have challenged the treaty , saying it is inconsistent , because the federal states do not hold a monopoly on certain forms of gambling like slot machines and casinos .
numerous internet users place bets illegally with private online companies registered abroad , which tend to offer better odds .

sure enough , the mayor , juergen polzehl , a gray-haired man in his mid-50s , invites me to go for a ride with him in his official car .
he tells the chauffeur to drive us to the kuelz district .
on the way there we pass row upon row of prefabricated apartment blocks - a legacy of the final , brief heyday of the uckermark regional municipality .
the town 's population swelled to 52,000 after the refinery was built , and housing had to be created for all the new arrivals .
rapid decline in population bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mayor polzehl says schwedt has spent billions of euros on urban restructuring then came german reunification .
workers at the refinery were laid off .
in the past 20 years , 20,000 people have moved away from schwedt .
at one time thousands of apartments stood empty .
" we had to respond to the situation , " says polzehl , pointing out of the window .
suddenly the buildings are interrupted by a wide , uneven open space .
" all this was apartment blocks , one after another .
now it 's all been returned to nature , " polzehl explains .
for a while they were demolishing as many as a thousand apartments in a year in schwedt .
now , polzehl says , it 's about 150 per year : the contraction of the town is gradually becoming more manageable .
billions of euros have been spent on urban restructuring .
demolition , reconstruction and reforestation help alleviate the sadness of the shrinking towns , but the alteration of the demographic has had a lasting effect on the makeup of the population .
polzehl is particularly concerned that so many young women have moved away .
this is a problem for many of the regions - and it has led to a severe shortage of young women in the new federal states .
the newspaper die welt reports that , in the 25-30 age bracket , in the east there are only 85 women for every 100 men .
polzehl remains optimistic .
" perhaps that will change if we locate a few businesses here and a local authority office .
that 'll improve the job situation , " he says , hopefully .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the oil refinery was once the city 's largest employer brain drain the mayor has set himself a considerable challenge .
conditions here , as in many parts of eastern germany , are not good .
the unemployment figure for the country as a whole is less than eight percent , but the east is struggling with more than 12 percent unemployment .
in schwedt it is even higher at 16 percent .
more efficient production methods and the closing or relocation of industry have greatly reduced the number of jobs available in the east .
those who are able to leave , do .
salaries , too , are higher in the west .
the young , the intelligent and the educated are leading the exodus , leaving behind the old and those described by despairing employers as " barely trainable . "
in an interview with the berliner zeitung in 2004 , ulf matthiesen , a researcher in area studies , described them as " unemployed urban idiots with no family ties and no prospect of forming a relationship . "
in parts of brandenburg and mecklenburg-western pomerania the number of pupils dropping out of school is 50 percent higher than the national average .
more than 10 percent leave school early , according to heike liebmann , head of the city regeneration department at the leibniz institute for regional development .
she describes this as an indication of the degree to which the general level of education among the local population has fallen .
furthermore , the fewer creative and enterprising people there are in public life , the less attractive the prospect of staying here becomes for those left behind .
it 's a vicious circle .
every year , ruediger ober-bloebaum resigns himself to seeing more of schwedt 's bright young people move away .
the stocky 50-year-old is the headmaster of the town 's last remaining high school .
last summer 103 pupils graduated , but he says : " of these , only seven are staying in schwedt .
the others are all going away to study or start an apprenticeship , and only 10 of those think they might come back . "
ober-bloebaum supposes schwedt is too quiet for them ; there 's just not enough going on there .
but there 's another problem , too .
he refers to a 2007 study by the berlin institute for population and development which suggested " that the girls are leaving because they find the boys here too stupid . "
wild , wild east bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : large parts of schwedt are returning to nature before unification in 1990 , then-chancellor helmut kohl spoke of the prospect of " landscapes in bloom . "
he used the term as a metaphor for the economic development of the east , but in recent years regional planners have suggested it should be taken literally .
they have proposed returning parts of eastern germany to nature .
liebmann says it 's hard to imagine how the movement of people could be controlled in such a process , but she adds that " it is certainly useful for society to consider whether it can afford to maintain the existing infrastructure in areas that are becoming less densely populated . "
polzehl is dismissive of such ideas .
" we ca n't just let all this become a jungle .
we have our roots here ; this is our home . "
and schwedt still has good things to offer .
it is responsible for 15 percent of the industrial production of the state of brandenburg , and germany 's only meadowland national park is right next door .
on the way back to the town hall , mayor polzehl draws encouragement from his own life story .
" i moved away too , when i was young , " he says .
" and now i 'm back again . "

structural changes have left urban populations in decline , and the brightest inhabitants are usually the first to go . right on germany 's eastern border the town of schwedt overlooks the river oder .
in the 1960s , this was a boom town : people moved here in tens of thousands to work in the local oil refinery .
but since reunification that trend has been radically reversed .

now , 20 years on , germany has been fully accepted by its european neighbors . it was in january 1990 , during a walk along the french atlantic coast , that the then-chancellor helmut kohl convinced french president francois mitterrand to support german unification .
mitterrand was skeptical at first , but kohl persuaded him by pledging his commitment to european integration .
with france on board , helmut kohl had the backing of germany 's most important european neighbor .
french sentiment had normalized in a way that it had not done to the same degree in britain and the united states , says french political theorist and journalist alfred grosser .
" with a few exceptions , french opinion polls show that people here saw the germans as friends .
they thought it perfectly natural that the two states should become one again , " he said .
indeed , kohl did not have the same success with his british colleague , prime minister margaret thatcher .
she opposed a unified germany ; but she was replaced as british leader in november 1990 by her fellow conservative party member john major .
germany furthered european integration bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kohl 's passion about european integration convinced mitterrand kohl promised that germany would maintain the european union course of greater integration , which he reaffirmed a year later : " unified germany does not want a return to the europe of yesterday , " he declared to the bundestag .
" there can been no revival of old rivalries and nationalisms .
we want a new europe - one that does not suppress our national identity , one in which countries no longer oppose one another , where no nation stands in the shadow of another , but -lsb- a europe -rsb- in which , together , we can guarantee a future in peace and freedom , prosperity and security . "
over the 20 years since reunification , german governments of all political colors have upheld kohl 's promise : germany championed the admission of the former east bloc states into the eu ; it paid for the eu 's eastward expansion , and the germans gave up their currency , the deutschmark , for the euro . '
german unity signifies european unity ' the reservations many of germany 's neighbors still harbored about the country they had fought in world war ii gradually disappeared .
belgium , for example , had no qualms about germany 's increased size , according to political scientist dirk rochtus of lessius hogeschool university college in antwerp .
" german unity also signifies european unity , " he said .
" that was clear to us here in belgium .
if the two german nations come together again , it also signifies that we have overcome the division of europe .
we see that as a good thing . "
the older generation , which had lived through the german occupation of belgium , did have doubts though .
" naturally there are older people who still have memories of that time , " rochtus said .
" but generally it has to be said that the response has been quite matter-of-fact - and also that we make a distinction between a people , in this case the german people , and the regime that governed this people and headed the occupation regime in belgium .
we make a very big distinction between the two . "
poles and czechs skeptical germany 's neighbors to the east , poland and the czech republic , also had many initial reservations .
after the political upheaval they had experienced , poles realized that germany no longer made any claims on their country and that the german government was serious about european unity , according to janusz reiter , poland 's former ambassador to bonn -lrb- 1990-1995 -rrb- .
" nowadays , germany 's size is no reason for its neighbors to be afraid , " he said .
" the relationship between germany and poland is still not entirely free of ambivalence and tensions , but for different reasons . "
poles are well aware of germany 's economic strength , and are keen to go to their western neighbor to earn money , he added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poles like andrzej stasiuk remain cautious when it comes to germany but there are limits , according to polish author andrzej stasiuk .
" very few poles would think of going to germany on holiday , " he said .
" you do n't go to germany for fun . "
in a recent article for german magazine focus , stasiuk wrote : " germany is not to be taken for granted ; germany is equivocal .
you have to keep your eyes on germany . "
prague-based political scientist robert schuster believes that until the end of the 1990s czechs were afraid of germany - and of the possibility that germans expelled after world war ii might make claims against them .
tensions between the two only started to ease after they signed a joint declaration in 1998 .
the declaration addressed the wounds of the past , as well as crimes committed during and after world war ii ; and it also highlighted perspectives for a joint future .
" the two countries are not competing anymore , " schuster said .
" they are no longer enemies , but members of a community , the eu .
and members of nato .
this aspect of security policy should not be underestimated . "
and he added that young czechs - who have had the opportunity to travel to germany , to study there and meet germans of their own age - have a completely different image of germans to that of the generation aged 50 and over .
football instigated the breakthrough the netherlands , luxembourg , switzerland and austria at first held back , but then gave their approval to german unification .
today , the spending power of german tourists means they are more popular than ever in their neighboring countries , although opinion polls suggest that germans themselves do n't quite believe this .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 2006 world cup showed a side of the country that many had not seen before " we ca n't tell the difference any more between ossis and wessis - that is , germans from the former east or west , " said austrian historian oliver radkolb .
and germany 's northern neighbor , denmark , has also accepted the new , larger germany , according to danish writer knud romer .
for decades danes regarded the germans as a nation of perpetrators , as did many other people in europe , he pointed out .
the breakthrough came with the soccer world cup , which germany hosted in 2006 , he added .
" that was when i realized , for the first time , that the war was over .
finished .
there 's none of that anymore , " romer said .
" and the danes were cheering the germans on . "

the declaration addressed the wounds of the past , as well as crimes committed during and after world war ii ; and it also highlighted perspectives for a joint future .
" the two countries are not competing anymore , " schuster said .
" they are no longer enemies , but members of a community , the eu .
and members of nato .
this aspect of security policy should not be underestimated . "
and he added that young czechs - who have had the opportunity to travel to germany , to study there and meet germans of their own age - have a completely different image of germans to that of the generation aged 50 and over .

now , 20 years on , germany has been fully accepted by its european neighbors . it was in january 1990 , during a walk along the french atlantic coast , that the then-chancellor helmut kohl convinced french president francois mitterrand to support german unification .
mitterrand was skeptical at first , but kohl persuaded him by pledging his commitment to european integration .
with france on board , helmut kohl had the backing of germany 's most important european neighbor .
french sentiment had normalized in a way that it had not done to the same degree in britain and the united states , says french political theorist and journalist alfred grosser .
" with a few exceptions , french opinion polls show that people here saw the germans as friends .
they thought it perfectly natural that the two states should become one again , " he said .
indeed , kohl did not have the same success with his british colleague , prime minister margaret thatcher .
she opposed a unified germany ; but she was replaced as british leader in november 1990 by her fellow conservative party member john major .
germany furthered european integration bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kohl 's passion about european integration convinced mitterrand kohl promised that germany would maintain the european union course of greater integration , which he reaffirmed a year later : " unified germany does not want a return to the europe of yesterday , " he declared to the bundestag .
" there can been no revival of old rivalries and nationalisms .
we want a new europe - one that does not suppress our national identity , one in which countries no longer oppose one another , where no nation stands in the shadow of another , but -lsb- a europe -rsb- in which , together , we can guarantee a future in peace and freedom , prosperity and security . "
over the 20 years since reunification , german governments of all political colors have upheld kohl 's promise : germany championed the admission of the former east bloc states into the eu ; it paid for the eu 's eastward expansion , and the germans gave up their currency , the deutschmark , for the euro . '
german unity signifies european unity ' the reservations many of germany 's neighbors still harbored about the country they had fought in world war ii gradually disappeared .
belgium , for example , had no qualms about germany 's increased size , according to political scientist dirk rochtus of lessius hogeschool university college in antwerp .
" german unity also signifies european unity , " he said .
" that was clear to us here in belgium .
if the two german nations come together again , it also signifies that we have overcome the division of europe .
we see that as a good thing . "
the older generation , which had lived through the german occupation of belgium , did have doubts though .
" naturally there are older people who still have memories of that time , " rochtus said .
" but generally it has to be said that the response has been quite matter-of-fact - and also that we make a distinction between a people , in this case the german people , and the regime that governed this people and headed the occupation regime in belgium .
we make a very big distinction between the two . "
poles and czechs skeptical germany 's neighbors to the east , poland and the czech republic , also had many initial reservations .
after the political upheaval they had experienced , poles realized that germany no longer made any claims on their country and that the german government was serious about european unity , according to janusz reiter , poland 's former ambassador to bonn -lrb- 1990-1995 -rrb- .
" nowadays , germany 's size is no reason for its neighbors to be afraid , " he said .
" the relationship between germany and poland is still not entirely free of ambivalence and tensions , but for different reasons . "
poles are well aware of germany 's economic strength , and are keen to go to their western neighbor to earn money , he added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poles like andrzej stasiuk remain cautious when it comes to germany but there are limits , according to polish author andrzej stasiuk .
" very few poles would think of going to germany on holiday , " he said .

in a recent article for german magazine focus , stasiuk wrote : " germany is not to be taken for granted ; germany is equivocal .
you have to keep your eyes on germany . "

structural changes have left urban populations in decline , and the brightest inhabitants are usually the first to go . right on germany 's eastern border the town of schwedt overlooks the river oder .
in the 1960s , this was a boom town : people moved here in tens of thousands to work in the local oil refinery .
but since reunification that trend has been radically reversed .
the pr assistant in schwedt town hall insists that the mayor himself will answer any questions .
" urban restructuring is a matter for the boss , " she says .
sure enough , the mayor , juergen polzehl , a gray-haired man in his mid-50s , invites me to go for a ride with him in his official car .
he tells the chauffeur to drive us to the kuelz district .
on the way there we pass row upon row of prefabricated apartment blocks - a legacy of the final , brief heyday of the uckermark regional municipality .
the town 's population swelled to 52,000 after the refinery was built , and housing had to be created for all the new arrivals .
rapid decline in population bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mayor polzehl says schwedt has spent billions of euros on urban restructuring then came german reunification .
workers at the refinery were laid off .
in the past 20 years , 20,000 people have moved away from schwedt .
at one time thousands of apartments stood empty .
" we had to respond to the situation , " says polzehl , pointing out of the window .
suddenly the buildings are interrupted by a wide , uneven open space .
" all this was apartment blocks , one after another .
now it 's all been returned to nature , " polzehl explains .
for a while they were demolishing as many as a thousand apartments in a year in schwedt .
now , polzehl says , it 's about 150 per year : the contraction of the town is gradually becoming more manageable .
billions of euros have been spent on urban restructuring .
demolition , reconstruction and reforestation help alleviate the sadness of the shrinking towns , but the alteration of the demographic has had a lasting effect on the makeup of the population .
polzehl is particularly concerned that so many young women have moved away .
this is a problem for many of the regions - and it has led to a severe shortage of young women in the new federal states .
the newspaper die welt reports that , in the 25-30 age bracket , in the east there are only 85 women for every 100 men .
polzehl remains optimistic .
" perhaps that will change if we locate a few businesses here and a local authority office .
that 'll improve the job situation , " he says , hopefully .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the oil refinery was once the city 's largest employer brain drain the mayor has set himself a considerable challenge .
conditions here , as in many parts of eastern germany , are not good .
the unemployment figure for the country as a whole is less than eight percent , but the east is struggling with more than 12 percent unemployment .
in schwedt it is even higher at 16 percent .
more efficient production methods and the closing or relocation of industry have greatly reduced the number of jobs available in the east .
those who are able to leave , do .
salaries , too , are higher in the west .
the young , the intelligent and the educated are leading the exodus , leaving behind the old and those described by despairing employers as " barely trainable . "
in an interview with the berliner zeitung in 2004 , ulf matthiesen , a researcher in area studies , described them as " unemployed urban idiots with no family ties and no prospect of forming a relationship . "
in parts of brandenburg and mecklenburg-western pomerania the number of pupils dropping out of school is 50 percent higher than the national average .
more than 10 percent leave school early , according to heike liebmann , head of the city regeneration department at the leibniz institute for regional development .
she describes this as an indication of the degree to which the general level of education among the local population has fallen .
furthermore , the fewer creative and enterprising people there are in public life , the less attractive the prospect of staying here becomes for those left behind .
it 's a vicious circle .
every year , ruediger ober-bloebaum resigns himself to seeing more of schwedt 's bright young people move away .
the stocky 50-year-old is the headmaster of the town 's last remaining high school .
last summer 103 pupils graduated , but he says : " of these , only seven are staying in schwedt .
the others are all going away to study or start an apprenticeship , and only 10 of those think they might come back . "
ober-bloebaum supposes schwedt is too quiet for them ; there 's just not enough going on there .
but there 's another problem , too .
he refers to a 2007 study by the berlin institute for population and development which suggested " that the girls are leaving because they find the boys here too stupid . "
wild , wild east bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : large parts of schwedt are returning to nature before unification in 1990 , then-chancellor helmut kohl spoke of the prospect of " landscapes in bloom . "
he used the term as a metaphor for the economic development of the east , but in recent years regional planners have suggested it should be taken literally .
they have proposed returning parts of eastern germany to nature .
liebmann says it 's hard to imagine how the movement of people could be controlled in such a process , but she adds that " it is certainly useful for society to consider whether it can afford to maintain the existing infrastructure in areas that are becoming less densely populated . "
polzehl is dismissive of such ideas .
" we ca n't just let all this become a jungle .
we have our roots here ; this is our home . "
and schwedt still has good things to offer .
it is responsible for 15 percent of the industrial production of the state of brandenburg , and germany 's only meadowland national park is right next door .
on the way back to the town hall , mayor polzehl draws encouragement from his own life story .
" i moved away too , when i was young , " he says .
" and now i 'm back again . "

now , 20 years on , germany has been fully accepted by its european neighbors . it was in january 1990 , during a walk along the french atlantic coast , that the then-chancellor helmut kohl convinced french president francois mitterrand to support german unification .
mitterrand was skeptical at first , but kohl persuaded him by pledging his commitment to european integration .
with france on board , helmut kohl had the backing of germany 's most important european neighbor .
french sentiment had normalized in a way that it had not done to the same degree in britain and the united states , says french political theorist and journalist alfred grosser .
" with a few exceptions , french opinion polls show that people here saw the germans as friends .
they thought it perfectly natural that the two states should become one again , " he said .
indeed , kohl did not have the same success with his british colleague , prime minister margaret thatcher .
she opposed a unified germany ; but she was replaced as british leader in november 1990 by her fellow conservative party member john major .
germany furthered european integration bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kohl 's passion about european integration convinced mitterrand kohl promised that germany would maintain the european union course of greater integration , which he reaffirmed a year later : " unified germany does not want a return to the europe of yesterday , " he declared to the bundestag .
" there can been no revival of old rivalries and nationalisms .
we want a new europe - one that does not suppress our national identity , one in which countries no longer oppose one another , where no nation stands in the shadow of another , but -lsb- a europe -rsb- in which , together , we can guarantee a future in peace and freedom , prosperity and security . "
over the 20 years since reunification , german governments of all political colors have upheld kohl 's promise : germany championed the admission of the former east bloc states into the eu ; it paid for the eu 's eastward expansion , and the germans gave up their currency , the deutschmark , for the euro . '
german unity signifies european unity ' the reservations many of germany 's neighbors still harbored about the country they had fought in world war ii gradually disappeared .
belgium , for example , had no qualms about germany 's increased size , according to political scientist dirk rochtus of lessius hogeschool university college in antwerp .
" german unity also signifies european unity , " he said .
" that was clear to us here in belgium .
if the two german nations come together again , it also signifies that we have overcome the division of europe .
we see that as a good thing . "
the older generation , which had lived through the german occupation of belgium , did have doubts though .
" naturally there are older people who still have memories of that time , " rochtus said .
" but generally it has to be said that the response has been quite matter-of-fact - and also that we make a distinction between a people , in this case the german people , and the regime that governed this people and headed the occupation regime in belgium .
we make a very big distinction between the two . "
poles and czechs skeptical germany 's neighbors to the east , poland and the czech republic , also had many initial reservations .
after the political upheaval they had experienced , poles realized that germany no longer made any claims on their country and that the german government was serious about european unity , according to janusz reiter , poland 's former ambassador to bonn -lrb- 1990-1995 -rrb- .
" nowadays , germany 's size is no reason for its neighbors to be afraid , " he said .
" the relationship between germany and poland is still not entirely free of ambivalence and tensions , but for different reasons . "
poles are well aware of germany 's economic strength , and are keen to go to their western neighbor to earn money , he added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poles like andrzej stasiuk remain cautious when it comes to germany but there are limits , according to polish author andrzej stasiuk .
" very few poles would think of going to germany on holiday , " he said .
" you do n't go to germany for fun . "
in a recent article for german magazine focus , stasiuk wrote : " germany is not to be taken for granted ; germany is equivocal .
you have to keep your eyes on germany . "
prague-based political scientist robert schuster believes that until the end of the 1990s czechs were afraid of germany - and of the possibility that germans expelled after world war ii might make claims against them .
tensions between the two only started to ease after they signed a joint declaration in 1998 .
the declaration addressed the wounds of the past , as well as crimes committed during and after world war ii ; and it also highlighted perspectives for a joint future .
" the two countries are not competing anymore , " schuster said .
" they are no longer enemies , but members of a community , the eu .
and members of nato .
this aspect of security policy should not be underestimated . "
and he added that young czechs - who have had the opportunity to travel to germany , to study there and meet germans of their own age - have a completely different image of germans to that of the generation aged 50 and over .
football instigated the breakthrough the netherlands , luxembourg , switzerland and austria at first held back , but then gave their approval to german unification .
today , the spending power of german tourists means they are more popular than ever in their neighboring countries , although opinion polls suggest that germans themselves do n't quite believe this .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 2006 world cup showed a side of the country that many had not seen before " we ca n't tell the difference any more between ossis and wessis - that is , germans from the former east or west , " said austrian historian oliver radkolb .
and germany 's northern neighbor , denmark , has also accepted the new , larger germany , according to danish writer knud romer .
for decades danes regarded the germans as a nation of perpetrators , as did many other people in europe , he pointed out .
the breakthrough came with the soccer world cup , which germany hosted in 2006 , he added .
" that was when i realized , for the first time , that the war was over .
finished .
there 's none of that anymore , " romer said .
" and the danes were cheering the germans on . "

now , 20 years on , germany has been fully accepted by its european neighbors . it was in january 1990 , during a walk along the french atlantic coast , that the then-chancellor helmut kohl convinced french president francois mitterrand to support german unification .
mitterrand was skeptical at first , but kohl persuaded him by pledging his commitment to european integration .
with france on board , helmut kohl had the backing of germany 's most important european neighbor .
french sentiment had normalized in a way that it had not done to the same degree in britain and the united states , says french political theorist and journalist alfred grosser .
" with a few exceptions , french opinion polls show that people here saw the germans as friends .
they thought it perfectly natural that the two states should become one again , " he said .
indeed , kohl did not have the same success with his british colleague , prime minister margaret thatcher .
she opposed a unified germany ; but she was replaced as british leader in november 1990 by her fellow conservative party member john major .
germany furthered european integration bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kohl 's passion about european integration convinced mitterrand kohl promised that germany would maintain the european union course of greater integration , which he reaffirmed a year later : " unified germany does not want a return to the europe of yesterday , " he declared to the bundestag .
" there can been no revival of old rivalries and nationalisms .
we want a new europe - one that does not suppress our national identity , one in which countries no longer oppose one another , where no nation stands in the shadow of another , but -lsb- a europe -rsb- in which , together , we can guarantee a future in peace and freedom , prosperity and security . "
over the 20 years since reunification , german governments of all political colors have upheld kohl 's promise : germany championed the admission of the former east bloc states into the eu ; it paid for the eu 's eastward expansion , and the germans gave up their currency , the deutschmark , for the euro . '
german unity signifies european unity ' the reservations many of germany 's neighbors still harbored about the country they had fought in world war ii gradually disappeared .
belgium , for example , had no qualms about germany 's increased size , according to political scientist dirk rochtus of lessius hogeschool university college in antwerp .
" german unity also signifies european unity , " he said .
" that was clear to us here in belgium .
if the two german nations come together again , it also signifies that we have overcome the division of europe .
we see that as a good thing . "
the older generation , which had lived through the german occupation of belgium , did have doubts though .
" naturally there are older people who still have memories of that time , " rochtus said .
" but generally it has to be said that the response has been quite matter-of-fact - and also that we make a distinction between a people , in this case the german people , and the regime that governed this people and headed the occupation regime in belgium .

the court said the gambling laws were being applied inconsistently . the german government 's monopoly on most forms of gambling must be ended immediately , according to the european court of justice in luxembourg .
the court ruled that " the german rules do not limit games of chance in a consistent and systematic manner . " it said that the state the monopoly is not justifiable .
under german law , only the country 's 16 federal states or companies run by them can offer gambling services .
the state therefore has an effective monopoly on gambling and lotteries .
the law also bans most web-based betting , and forbids advertising such services .
the german state treaty on gambling came into force in 2008 to curb a growing trend in gambling addiction .
critics say it simply ensured that the state received a substantial chunk of the revenue from gambling .
internet betting agencies based abroad a number of private betting companies have challenged the treaty , saying it is inconsistent , because the federal states do not hold a monopoly on certain forms of gambling like slot machines and casinos .
numerous internet users place bets illegally with private online companies registered abroad , which tend to offer better odds .

the percentage of people in urban areas with access is declining . lack of access to clean sources of water remains a major problem is much of the world , said anders berntell , executive director of the stockholm international water institute -lrb- siwi -rrb- . " bad water kills more people than hiv , malaria and wars together , affecting the lives of families and the economic development of many countries around the world , " he said at the world water week conference being held in the swedish capital . the united nation 's food and agriculture organization estimates that within the next 15 years , 1.8 billion people will be living in regions with acute water scarcity , and that two-thirds of the world 's population could be facing shortages . thirsty cities bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many people in cities lack the clean water they need while the plight of those in dry , rural areas has long been examined by development aid and the work of non-governmental organizations -lrb- ngos -rrb- , people in urban areas also suffer from lack of access to water , according to gerard payen , who heads the international federation of private water operators -lrb- aquafed -rrb- . " in cities , there are today more people suffering from a poor and unsatisfactory access to safe water and sanitation than at the end of the 20th century , " payen said in a statement . access to safe drinking water was recognized as a human right by the united nations general assembly in july , yet the un , together with ngos and individual governments , has struggled for decades to get potable water to hundreds of millions of people worldwide who lack water and basic sanitation services . growing population bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in some places , a trek is necessary to get clean water population growth is one of the biggest difficulties they confront .
between 2000 and 2008 , the world 's population increased by 635 million people , 80 percent of whom live in urban areas , according to un data . " the proportion of the urban population that benefits from satisfactory access to drinking water or sanitation is decreasing , " aquafed said , pointing to un statistics showing that 114 million more people went without access to tap water at home or in the immediate vicinity at the end of the eight-year-period . at the same time , 134 million more people went without access to basic sanitation , the group said , pointing out that in both cases there had been a 20 percent hike of urban dwellers lacking access . " current efforts to develop access to water and sanitation in cities are outpaced by urbanization , " payen said . author : sean sinico -lrb- afp , dpa -rrb- editor : nathan witkop send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but a comparison between debates in germany and the united states suggests they shed more heat than light . with the publication of his book " deutschland schafft sich ab " -lrb- " germany abolishes itself " -rrb- in late august , banker and politician thilo sarrazin gifted the german media an incendiary topic for the autumn .
among the book 's controversial theses is the idea that higher fertility rates would allow non-assimilated muslims to dominate germany in the not-too-distant future .
the book tapped into fears among some germans that german culture and the german way of life is in danger .
but the discussions engendered were reminiscent of similar debates in other cultures .
in the united states , the publication in 2004 of a book entitled " who are we ? " by political scientist samuel p. huntington sparked discussions about whether the increasing prevalence of spanish-speaking americans would bifurcate us culture and threaten what the author called the american " creed " of enlightenment democracy .
but though the subject matters are seemingly similar , the levels of discourse in the two debates are very different .
german immigration expert klaus j. bade praises sarrazin for pointing up abuse of the german welfare system by migrants and germans .
but he takes the author to task in other areas .
" huntington 's book was more scientifically informed , whereas sarrazin knows as much about demography as i do about his specialty , state finances : namely just bits and pieces , " bade told deutsche welle .
" in this field he 's a populist writer who partly trades in cheap commonplaces and looks for statistical evidence for pre-conceived ideas - the exact opposite of the scientific method .
it 's what we call beer-coaster demographics . "
and the difference between a demagogue and a respected professor is not the only respect in which superficial similarities fall apart .
apples and oranges bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us hispanics , including this woman voting in denver , are becoming more and more important debates in germany and the us about whether immigrants are sufficiently assimilating are inflected by the different histories and demographics of the two countries .
the united states is a nation with a growing population and a rising number of immigrants , which from its very inception embraced the idea of foreigners becoming citizens .
germany , on the other hand , has stagnant population and immigration and was traditionally wary of taking in non-germans looking to better their lots in life .
" social integration and acknowledgement of the dialogue with muslim communities - these things have developed over the past few years , " philip anderson , professor of social sciences at the university of regensburg , told deutsche welle .
" but there needs to be more of that and far less of the fear of a sullying of the german identity and sometimes even german blood . "
debates about assimilation in germany and in other western european countries are additionally heated because most of the foreign residents and immigrants in question are muslim .
but klaus bade warns against seeing them as a homogeneous group .
" there 's no such thing as a single muslim group in germany , " bade said .
" immigration from iran , for example , centered on elites who had little problem integrating into german society .
immigrant turks tended to come from rural anatolia , and not istanbul , and so there were educational problems , especially three generations ago .
but that had nothing to do with them being muslims .
problems among italian immigrants , for instance , were and still are worse . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thilo sarrazin -lrb- r . -rrb- has been doing the talk-show rounds self-fulfilling prophecies sarrazin has had to step down from his job on the board of germany 's federal bank , and may yet lose his membership in the social democratic party for his ill-advised and ill-informed opinions .
but is there anything to the points he - or huntington - raised ?
can demographic changes mean the end of a language , a culture and a way of life ?
" there is an aspect comparable between both books , namely the vision of a competition between cultures , " bade said .
" but competition is not the same thing as total war .
moreover , we should think less about groups and systems and more about individuals .
for many people the huntington book has something of a self-fulfilling prophecy .
it 's a circular argument that echoes older fears about the decline and fall of western civilization .
this seems , on a national level , comparable to sarrazin 's message . "
in other words , warnings about conflicts of civilizations - to paraphrase the title of another of huntington 's books - tend to create the sort of tension they claim to be decrying .
" generally there is far more acceptance - especially in the cities , where people lived together - than is usually acknowledged , " anderson said .
" politicians need to push that as a positive image of how people are getting on . "
for bade , reasoning that fails to distinguish and differentiate between individual attitudes among immigrants and resident aliens is inherently faulty .
" when asked ' when did you last go to a mosque , ' many european muslims may not know where the nearest one is or may respond : ' for religious or cultural reasons ? '
that 's comparable to the way many christians feel who may go to church to look at art or attend a wedding .
there 's an infinite number of hybrid forms and milieus of islam , and from one generation to another muslims themselves will - hopefully - adapt more and more to european civilization as they did and still do in the us . " culture is constantly in flux , and demographic changes , of course , bring cultural shifts with them .
but a " host " culture being taken over by a monolithic foreign group , say experts , is one thing neither americans nor germans need to fear . author : jefferson chase editor : rob mudge send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but a comparison between debates in germany and the united states suggests they shed more heat than light . with the publication of his book " deutschland schafft sich ab " -lrb- " germany abolishes itself " -rrb- in late august , banker and politician thilo sarrazin gifted the german media an incendiary topic for the autumn .
among the book 's controversial theses is the idea that higher fertility rates would allow non-assimilated muslims to dominate germany in the not-too-distant future .
the book tapped into fears among some germans that german culture and the german way of life is in danger .
but the discussions engendered were reminiscent of similar debates in other cultures .
in the united states , the publication in 2004 of a book entitled " who are we ? " by political scientist samuel p. huntington sparked discussions about whether the increasing prevalence of spanish-speaking americans would bifurcate us culture and threaten what the author called the american " creed " of enlightenment democracy .
but though the subject matters are seemingly similar , the levels of discourse in the two debates are very different .
german immigration expert klaus j. bade praises sarrazin for pointing up abuse of the german welfare system by migrants and germans .
but he takes the author to task in other areas .
" huntington 's book was more scientifically informed , whereas sarrazin knows as much about demography as i do about his specialty , state finances : namely just bits and pieces , " bade told deutsche welle .
" in this field he 's a populist writer who partly trades in cheap commonplaces and looks for statistical evidence for pre-conceived ideas - the exact opposite of the scientific method .
it 's what we call beer-coaster demographics . "
and the difference between a demagogue and a respected professor is not the only respect in which superficial similarities fall apart .
apples and oranges bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us hispanics , including this woman voting in denver , are becoming more and more important debates in germany and the us about whether immigrants are sufficiently assimilating are inflected by the different histories and demographics of the two countries .
the united states is a nation with a growing population and a rising number of immigrants , which from its very inception embraced the idea of foreigners becoming citizens .
germany , on the other hand , has stagnant population and immigration and was traditionally wary of taking in non-germans looking to better their lots in life .
" social integration and acknowledgement of the dialogue with muslim communities - these things have developed over the past few years , " philip anderson , professor of social sciences at the university of regensburg , told deutsche welle .
" but there needs to be more of that and far less of the fear of a sullying of the german identity and sometimes even german blood . "
debates about assimilation in germany and in other western european countries are additionally heated because most of the foreign residents and immigrants in question are muslim .
but klaus bade warns against seeing them as a homogeneous group .
" there 's no such thing as a single muslim group in germany , " bade said .
" immigration from iran , for example , centered on elites who had little problem integrating into german society .
immigrant turks tended to come from rural anatolia , and not istanbul , and so there were educational problems , especially three generations ago .
but that had nothing to do with them being muslims .
problems among italian immigrants , for instance , were and still are worse . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thilo sarrazin -lrb- r . -rrb- has been doing the talk-show rounds self-fulfilling prophecies sarrazin has had to step down from his job on the board of germany 's federal bank , and may yet lose his membership in the social democratic party for his ill-advised and ill-informed opinions .
but is there anything to the points he - or huntington - raised ?
can demographic changes mean the end of a language , a culture and a way of life ?
" there is an aspect comparable between both books , namely the vision of a competition between cultures , " bade said .
" but competition is not the same thing as total war .
moreover , we should think less about groups and systems and more about individuals .
for many people the huntington book has something of a self-fulfilling prophecy .
it 's a circular argument that echoes older fears about the decline and fall of western civilization .
this seems , on a national level , comparable to sarrazin 's message . "
in other words , warnings about conflicts of civilizations - to paraphrase the title of another of huntington 's books - tend to create the sort of tension they claim to be decrying .
" generally there is far more acceptance - especially in the cities , where people lived together - than is usually acknowledged , " anderson said .
" politicians need to push that as a positive image of how people are getting on . "
for bade , reasoning that fails to distinguish and differentiate between individual attitudes among immigrants and resident aliens is inherently faulty .
" when asked ' when did you last go to a mosque , ' many european muslims may not know where the nearest one is or may respond : ' for religious or cultural reasons ? '
that 's comparable to the way many christians feel who may go to church to look at art or attend a wedding .
there 's an infinite number of hybrid forms and milieus of islam , and from one generation to another muslims themselves will - hopefully - adapt more and more to european civilization as they did and still do in the us . " culture is constantly in flux , and demographic changes , of course , bring cultural shifts with them .

but that had nothing to do with them being muslims .
problems among italian immigrants , for instance , were and still are worse . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thilo sarrazin -lrb- r . -rrb- has been doing the talk-show rounds self-fulfilling prophecies sarrazin has had to step down from his job on the board of germany 's federal bank , and may yet lose his membership in the social democratic party for his ill-advised and ill-informed opinions .
but is there anything to the points he - or huntington - raised ?
can demographic changes mean the end of a language , a culture and a way of life ?
" there is an aspect comparable between both books , namely the vision of a competition between cultures , " bade said .
" but competition is not the same thing as total war .
moreover , we should think less about groups and systems and more about individuals .
for many people the huntington book has something of a self-fulfilling prophecy .
it 's a circular argument that echoes older fears about the decline and fall of western civilization .
this seems , on a national level , comparable to sarrazin 's message . "
in other words , warnings about conflicts of civilizations - to paraphrase the title of another of huntington 's books - tend to create the sort of tension they claim to be decrying .
" generally there is far more acceptance - especially in the cities , where people lived together - than is usually acknowledged , " anderson said .
" politicians need to push that as a positive image of how people are getting on . "
for bade , reasoning that fails to distinguish and differentiate between individual attitudes among immigrants and resident aliens is inherently faulty .
" when asked ' when did you last go to a mosque , ' many european muslims may not know where the nearest one is or may respond : ' for religious or cultural reasons ? '
that 's comparable to the way many christians feel who may go to church to look at art or attend a wedding .
there 's an infinite number of hybrid forms and milieus of islam , and from one generation to another muslims themselves will - hopefully - adapt more and more to european civilization as they did and still do in the us . " culture is constantly in flux , and demographic changes , of course , bring cultural shifts with them .
but a " host " culture being taken over by a monolithic foreign group , say experts , is one thing neither americans nor germans need to fear . author : jefferson chase editor : rob mudge send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

exports fell by 1.5 percent in july .
however , compared to a year ago , the figures looked positive , up 18.7 percent on july 2009 . german exports sank unexpectedly in july 2010 .
german companies sold 1.5 percent fewer products abroad than in the previous month , according to the federal statistical office .
analysts had predicted better figures , after exports grew by 3.7 percent in june . in july , germany exported goods worth a total of 83 billion euros -lrb- $ 106 billion -rrb- .
however , compared to the same period a year ago , german exports increased by 18.7 percent in july 2010 on july 2009 .
at the time exports were severely affected by the global economic crisis .
this summer , business has been particularly strong with countries outside europe .
turnover rose by 25.1 percent on the previous year in the global market .
in eu states , volume of sales rose by 14.6 percent .
experts are predicting that despite germany 's relatively strong economic performance in recent months , it will be harder to grow as the effects of financial cuts in other countries kick in , and the us warns of a double-dip recession .
germany experienced its worst recession in more than six decades last year , but has bounced back strongly , predominantly on the back of improved global demand for its exports .
meanwhile imports shrank at the start of the second half of the year by 2.2 percent compared to june .
in total , commodities to the value of 69.5 billion euros were imported into germany .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de art -pipe- 08.09.2010 photographer explores beauty among women prisoners großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the women were asked how prison life had changed them a photographer in cologne has taken female inmates as the subjects of his work - a tall order , given penitentiary security .
the artist asked the women to describe what " beauty " meant to them in everyday prison life . it sounds rather macabre or , at the very least , a contradiction in terms - asking female prisoners to address the notion of beauty .
russian photographer igor chepikov , who has been living in cologne , germany since 1991 , visited a women 's penitentiary weekly for over 10 months .
there , after splashing a wall in white paint to serve as a backdrop , he took thousands pictures of some of the inmates .
those snapshots were ultimately distilled into a selection of just 56 photographs that compose the exhibition called " bad ossendorf : women in prison " now on show in cologne . the title is a play on words .
" bad " in front of the name a place normally refers to a spa town in german .
" ossendorf " is the name of the penitentiary outside of cologne .
" bad ossendorf , " then , could be translated as " resort ossendorf , " but is intended to also imply english connotations , as in " bad love , bad money , bad company . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the photographer took 24 pictures of each participant however one chooses to view the name , the subject of the exhibition - women in prison confronted with the topic of " beauty " - sounds like it 's begging for feminist critique .
after all , many of the female prisoners have more existential issues to address than philosophical matters like the definition of beauty .
they are worried about their children , who are now sitting in orphanages .
they are dismayed about the pain they have caused their relatives .
they want to liberate themselves from a vicious circle of crime . the photographer chepikov , at least , gave space to the women 's voices - choosing not just to display his photographs of them , but also to literally frame their " narratives . "
the photographer asked the women to answer certain questions in written form - to describe what beauty meant to them , if they felt they had lost time in prison , what effect prison had had on their bodies and souls ? some of the answers : " the feeling of loneliness is the worst . "
" i never thought prison could make a person look so bad . "
" there is no place to buy make-up here , or any other kind of personal hygiene products . "
" once i saw the photos , i realized how horrible the effects of the drugs have been . "
" i wish i could turn back the clock . "
" for me , ' beauty ' here in the prison essentially means being clean . " deutsche welle spoke with the photographer , igor chepikov , to get his take on " women in prison . " deutsche welle : why these photographs of women in prison ? why did you choose to do this ? igor chepikov : i came up with the idea about six years ago .
i was sitting in the moscow subway , and was looking out of the windows and thinking about the song " as time goes by . "
and then , i started reading something about prisons and got to thinking about what life is like in prisons .
a man , for instance , could be 20 years old and get 15 years in jail , but he 's only 35 when he gets out .
but when he 's 45 and gets out of prison -lsb- 15 years later -rsb- , he 's 60 .
life is over for him , and he has no possibility to change .
for women , it 's even harder - not only can they not adapt at that age , they have also lost their beauty .
i realized that i should take pictures of them before that happens . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some of the women spiffed themselves up for the photo sessions is n't that kind of loaded , this idea of women and beauty and prison ? i 'm not sure - that 's what i wanted to figure out : ' is it problematic for women , or not ? '
the prison administration was doubtful - they did n't think any of the women would want to present themselves in an exhibition , which is what my intention was from the start .
but 15 women wanted to participate , and that was a green light for my project from the get-go . what do you think the motivation was for these women to take part ? life in prison is quite boring .
participating in the project was almost like vacation - a departure from everyday life - for the women , who often sit for 23 hours a day in their cells .
for them , it was a connection to outside life . were n't the women ashamed to show themselves ? i 'm not sure .
they agreed to have their pictures taken .
some of the women were in prison for the second , third or fourth time .
one woman who agreed to take part had been free for a few months , then returned and said , ' hello , i 'm back , you can take more pictures of me . "
for her , it was like coming home again . do you have an example of one of the women 's stories , why she came to be in prison ? yes , i talked with the women , but their stories are supposed to remain private .
you can read the anonymous narratives hanging on the walls of the exhibition . some statistics show that women are victims themselves before they land in prison .
did you find that when you spoke with the women ? it was different .
you might find that in their narratives .
actually , a lot of these women were drug addicts , and many of them belong in a hospital or treatment center rather than a prison . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some felt the art project was an escape from everyday jail life what was one of the most difficult moments while you were photographing the women ? actually , it was beforehand - in convincing the prison administration to let me in .
they did n't really understand what i wanted and what my purpose was , but as soon as they got an idea of what i was aiming for - not criticizing the place , but just presenting the bit of beauty among the women in the prison - it was fine . how do you define beauty ? you have it or you do n't .
it 's not easily defined .
i can show it better than describe it in words .
each woman here in the exhibition has some form of beauty , even if it 's just something in her expression . is n't this a contrast , the idea of beauty and women in prison ? yes .
it 's difficult for people to imagine that women want to take care of themselves in jail , but many of the prisoners told me that it 's important to them , but they do n't have much of a chance to do that .
for the photo sessions , they made themselves up , had their hair cut . how did you try to make the women feel comfortable with you ? i brought cookies , cigarettes , tea .
and i talked with them - it was n't just a photo session with each , but also a chat . you trained as an architect , then switched to painting and finally , photography .
why ? i painted for 10 years - abstract painting .
but then i realized that there are just some things you can only capture in a moment , and i switched to photography .
my first photography project was in a slaughterhouse - i was impressed by the colors i could capture there , and the moment when life is extinguished .
you ca n't get this moment across in abstract paintings . do you think this project is political - the " women in prison " portraits ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some of the women said personal hygiene products are rare in prison no .
it 's human .
i do n't want to criticize anyone .
this is simply part of life , even if it 's scary at times . why women and not men ?
men can be beautiful too … because people think of women and not men when they hear the word beauty . you asked women to write some things down about beauty .
why ? because i wanted to know their opinions about the subject and not mine .
maybe they do n't think about it at all .
but from the letters , i can tell they do .
life is tough in prison , and it leaves traces on people 's faces much more than among people who are free . when one reads the narratives , it 's clear that the women are also struggling with other problems , like their drug addiction , missing their children , their safety .
is n't it a luxury to be asking questions about beauty , when the women are facing much tougher issues ? i do n't really know . interview : louisa schaefer editor : kate bowen the exhibition at the neues kunstforum in cologne runs through sept .

the photographer asked the women to answer certain questions in written form - to describe what beauty meant to them , if they felt they had lost time in prison , what effect prison had had on their bodies and souls ? some of the answers : " the feeling of loneliness is the worst . "
" i never thought prison could make a person look so bad . "
" there is no place to buy make-up here , or any other kind of personal hygiene products . "
" once i saw the photos , i realized how horrible the effects of the drugs have been . "
" i wish i could turn back the clock . "
" for me , ' beauty ' here in the prison essentially means being clean . " deutsche welle spoke with the photographer , igor chepikov , to get his take on " women in prison . " deutsche welle : why these photographs of women in prison ? why did you choose to do this ? igor chepikov : i came up with the idea about six years ago .
i was sitting in the moscow subway , and was looking out of the windows and thinking about the song " as time goes by . "
and then , i started reading something about prisons and got to thinking about what life is like in prisons .
a man , for instance , could be 20 years old and get 15 years in jail , but he 's only 35 when he gets out .
but when he 's 45 and gets out of prison -lsb- 15 years later -rsb- , he 's 60 .
life is over for him , and he has no possibility to change .
for women , it 's even harder - not only can they not adapt at that age , they have also lost their beauty .
i realized that i should take pictures of them before that happens . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some of the women spiffed themselves up for the photo sessions is n't that kind of loaded , this idea of women and beauty and prison ? i 'm not sure - that 's what i wanted to figure out : ' is it problematic for women , or not ? '
the prison administration was doubtful - they did n't think any of the women would want to present themselves in an exhibition , which is what my intention was from the start .
but 15 women wanted to participate , and that was a green light for my project from the get-go . what do you think the motivation was for these women to take part ? life in prison is quite boring .
participating in the project was almost like vacation - a departure from everyday life - for the women , who often sit for 23 hours a day in their cells .
for them , it was a connection to outside life . were n't the women ashamed to show themselves ? i 'm not sure .
they agreed to have their pictures taken .
some of the women were in prison for the second , third or fourth time .
one woman who agreed to take part had been free for a few months , then returned and said , ' hello , i 'm back , you can take more pictures of me . "
for her , it was like coming home again . do you have an example of one of the women 's stories , why she came to be in prison ? yes , i talked with the women , but their stories are supposed to remain private .
you can read the anonymous narratives hanging on the walls of the exhibition . some statistics show that women are victims themselves before they land in prison .
did you find that when you spoke with the women ? it was different .
you might find that in their narratives .
actually , a lot of these women were drug addicts , and many of them belong in a hospital or treatment center rather than a prison . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some felt the art project was an escape from everyday jail life what was one of the most difficult moments while you were photographing the women ? actually , it was beforehand - in convincing the prison administration to let me in .
they did n't really understand what i wanted and what my purpose was , but as soon as they got an idea of what i was aiming for - not criticizing the place , but just presenting the bit of beauty among the women in the prison - it was fine . how do you define beauty ? you have it or you do n't .
it 's not easily defined .
i can show it better than describe it in words .
each woman here in the exhibition has some form of beauty , even if it 's just something in her expression . is n't this a contrast , the idea of beauty and women in prison ? yes .
it 's difficult for people to imagine that women want to take care of themselves in jail , but many of the prisoners told me that it 's important to them , but they do n't have much of a chance to do that .
for the photo sessions , they made themselves up , had their hair cut . how did you try to make the women feel comfortable with you ? i brought cookies , cigarettes , tea .
and i talked with them - it was n't just a photo session with each , but also a chat . you trained as an architect , then switched to painting and finally , photography .
why ? i painted for 10 years - abstract painting .
but then i realized that there are just some things you can only capture in a moment , and i switched to photography .
my first photography project was in a slaughterhouse - i was impressed by the colors i could capture there , and the moment when life is extinguished .
you ca n't get this moment across in abstract paintings . do you think this project is political - the " women in prison " portraits ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some of the women said personal hygiene products are rare in prison no .
it 's human .
i do n't want to criticize anyone .
this is simply part of life , even if it 's scary at times . why women and not men ?
men can be beautiful too … because people think of women and not men when they hear the word beauty . you asked women to write some things down about beauty .
why ? because i wanted to know their opinions about the subject and not mine .
maybe they do n't think about it at all .
but from the letters , i can tell they do .
life is tough in prison , and it leaves traces on people 's faces much more than among people who are free . when one reads the narratives , it 's clear that the women are also struggling with other problems , like their drug addiction , missing their children , their safety .

the artist asked the women to describe what " beauty " meant to them in everyday prison life . it sounds rather macabre or , at the very least , a contradiction in terms - asking female prisoners to address the notion of beauty .
russian photographer igor chepikov , who has been living in cologne , germany since 1991 , visited a women 's penitentiary weekly for over 10 months .
there , after splashing a wall in white paint to serve as a backdrop , he took thousands pictures of some of the inmates .
those snapshots were ultimately distilled into a selection of just 56 photographs that compose the exhibition called " bad ossendorf : women in prison " now on show in cologne . the title is a play on words .
" bad " in front of the name a place normally refers to a spa town in german .
" ossendorf " is the name of the penitentiary outside of cologne .
" bad ossendorf , " then , could be translated as " resort ossendorf , " but is intended to also imply english connotations , as in " bad love , bad money , bad company . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the photographer took 24 pictures of each participant however one chooses to view the name , the subject of the exhibition - women in prison confronted with the topic of " beauty " - sounds like it 's begging for feminist critique .
after all , many of the female prisoners have more existential issues to address than philosophical matters like the definition of beauty .
they are worried about their children , who are now sitting in orphanages .
they are dismayed about the pain they have caused their relatives .
they want to liberate themselves from a vicious circle of crime . the photographer chepikov , at least , gave space to the women 's voices - choosing not just to display his photographs of them , but also to literally frame their " narratives . "

the court said the gambling laws were being applied inconsistently . the german government 's monopoly on most forms of gambling must be ended immediately , according to the european court of justice in luxembourg .
the court ruled that " the german rules do not limit games of chance in a consistent and systematic manner . " it said that the state the monopoly is not justifiable .
under german law , only the country 's 16 federal states or companies run by them can offer gambling services .
the state therefore has an effective monopoly on gambling and lotteries .
the law also bans most web-based betting , and forbids advertising such services .
the german state treaty on gambling came into force in 2008 to curb a growing trend in gambling addiction .
critics say it simply ensured that the state received a substantial chunk of the revenue from gambling .
internet betting agencies based abroad a number of private betting companies have challenged the treaty , saying it is inconsistent , because the federal states do not hold a monopoly on certain forms of gambling like slot machines and casinos .

exports fell by 1.5 percent in july .
however , compared to a year ago , the figures looked positive , up 18.7 percent on july 2009 . german exports sank unexpectedly in july 2010 .
german companies sold 1.5 percent fewer products abroad than in the previous month , according to the federal statistical office .
analysts had predicted better figures , after exports grew by 3.7 percent in june . in july , germany exported goods worth a total of 83 billion euros -lrb- $ 106 billion -rrb- .
however , compared to the same period a year ago , german exports increased by 18.7 percent in july 2010 on july 2009 .
at the time exports were severely affected by the global economic crisis .
this summer , business has been particularly strong with countries outside europe .
turnover rose by 25.1 percent on the previous year in the global market .
in eu states , volume of sales rose by 14.6 percent .
experts are predicting that despite germany 's relatively strong economic performance in recent months , it will be harder to grow as the effects of financial cuts in other countries kick in , and the us warns of a double-dip recession .
germany experienced its worst recession in more than six decades last year , but has bounced back strongly , predominantly on the back of improved global demand for its exports .
meanwhile imports shrank at the start of the second half of the year by 2.2 percent compared to june .
in total , commodities to the value of 69.5 billion euros were imported into germany .

fewer , however , lay their hats in berlin , regardless of its cool , capital status . " increased competition for clever minds " is the title of a report analyzing migration from cities with more than half a million residents .
its three authors from the institute of employment research -lrb- iab -rrb- paint a picture in which well-educated germans most readily move to places renowned for their political leanings , their solid foundations , their ability to provide work and perhaps even for their good air , be it of the sea or mountain variety .
in many ways , the findings are not surprising .
not only for the cities that did feature at the top of the popularity chart , but also for those that did not .
most notably : germany 's unconventional capital berlin , which unlike hamburg and munich , has not had the benefit of being able to continually evolve since the days of the post-war economic miracle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : munich is the most popular career destination for well-educated germans after 40 years of division and almost 20 years of reunification , berlin is still trying to find its feet , economically speaking .
as martin gornig , the head of innovation , manufacturing and service at the german institute for economic research told deutsche welle , the capital city does not boast the kind of economic framework that entices people hoping to launch prosperous careers .
" berlin does n't have bmw or allianz , " he says .
" the big companies left berlin and they have not come back . "
and nor are they likely to , given the difficulties associated with uprooting established companies .
" what berlin has to do now is grow new ones , " gornig says .
" it might be a slow process , but it has to happen . "
gornig is not talking about new car manufacturers or new insurance companies , but about berlin playing to its greatest strength : creativity .
it has always had a reputation for attracting artists , but in recent years the capital has become a veritable stomping ground for those pointedly seeking inspiration over security .
creative renown the city 's creative pool is deep .
designers , musicians , painters , fashion designers and filmmakers add to it and drink from it .
art feeds art in berlin .
and while that does not necessarily a make a booming economy , it does provide the capital with some excellent long-term prospects .
" almost everything in berlin relates in some way or another to creativity , " says volker hassemer of stiftung zukunft berlin -lrb- foundation for the future of berlin -rrb- .
" take telekom for example , they have a large creative department here , which is entirely because of the type of people that live in the city . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin has a thriving art scene and the telecommunications giant is not alone .
hassemer says businesses actively seeking creative input have picked up on the fact that it pays to offer creative jobs in berlin because they know they will stand a better chance of getting good people .
geppert goes one step further .
he says the german capital appeals to the kind of workers who are not only creative in what they do , but in the way they live their lives .
" we 're not talking here about people who want permanent contracts with all the perks of holiday and sick pay , but about those who come to berlin without work and who are willing to be freelance or take short-term contacts . "
more marketing yet for all that , there is a sense that germany 's biggest city could be doing a bit more to sell its creative vein to the commercial world , as well as to tourists and artists .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin fashion week is an annual fixture " we need to recognize the potential of what we have , " hassemer says , adding that the arts and culture landscape is currently too fractured to be of serious economic value .
he believes the capital needs to be more up front about how it wants to use the creative talent residing within its boundaries .
and for that it needs a cluster organization .
" cities should show themselves to the outside world , " hassemer said .
" berlin has a cluster for health care management , but has not managed to establish one for its creative industries , and that is a failure . "
he says that while establishing a cluster is not inherently easy , it could be done .
the major impediment is bad management on the part of politicians , who are too bound up in minor tussles to extend a hand of partnership to the creative branch .
hassemer is very clear that berlin should get on top of its potential sooner rather than later , because to squander it may well be to inflict lasting damage .
" how are we going to continue to compete as europeans when other countries are growing and producing so fast ? " he asks .
" not with manufactured products but with our cultural maturity . "

fewer , however , lay their hats in berlin , regardless of its cool , capital status . " increased competition for clever minds " is the title of a report analyzing migration from cities with more than half a million residents .
its three authors from the institute of employment research -lrb- iab -rrb- paint a picture in which well-educated germans most readily move to places renowned for their political leanings , their solid foundations , their ability to provide work and perhaps even for their good air , be it of the sea or mountain variety .
in many ways , the findings are not surprising .
not only for the cities that did feature at the top of the popularity chart , but also for those that did not .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : munich is the most popular career destination for well-educated germans after 40 years of division and almost 20 years of reunification , berlin is still trying to find its feet , economically speaking .
as martin gornig , the head of innovation , manufacturing and service at the german institute for economic research told deutsche welle , the capital city does not boast the kind of economic framework that entices people hoping to launch prosperous careers .
" berlin does n't have bmw or allianz , " he says .

and nor are they likely to , given the difficulties associated with uprooting established companies .
" what berlin has to do now is grow new ones , " gornig says .
" it might be a slow process , but it has to happen . "
gornig is not talking about new car manufacturers or new insurance companies , but about berlin playing to its greatest strength : creativity .
it has always had a reputation for attracting artists , but in recent years the capital has become a veritable stomping ground for those pointedly seeking inspiration over security .
creative renown the city 's creative pool is deep .
designers , musicians , painters , fashion designers and filmmakers add to it and drink from it .
art feeds art in berlin .
and while that does not necessarily a make a booming economy , it does provide the capital with some excellent long-term prospects .
" almost everything in berlin relates in some way or another to creativity , " says volker hassemer of stiftung zukunft berlin -lrb- foundation for the future of berlin -rrb- .
" take telekom for example , they have a large creative department here , which is entirely because of the type of people that live in the city . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin has a thriving art scene and the telecommunications giant is not alone .
hassemer says businesses actively seeking creative input have picked up on the fact that it pays to offer creative jobs in berlin because they know they will stand a better chance of getting good people .
geppert goes one step further .
he says the german capital appeals to the kind of workers who are not only creative in what they do , but in the way they live their lives .
" we 're not talking here about people who want permanent contracts with all the perks of holiday and sick pay , but about those who come to berlin without work and who are willing to be freelance or take short-term contacts . "

the court said the gambling laws were being applied inconsistently . the german government 's monopoly on most forms of gambling must be ended immediately , according to the european court of justice in luxembourg .
the court ruled that " the german rules do not limit games of chance in a consistent and systematic manner . " it said that the state the monopoly is not justifiable .
under german law , only the country 's 16 federal states or companies run by them can offer gambling services .
the state therefore has an effective monopoly on gambling and lotteries .
the law also bans most web-based betting , and forbids advertising such services .
the german state treaty on gambling came into force in 2008 to curb a growing trend in gambling addiction .
critics say it simply ensured that the state received a substantial chunk of the revenue from gambling .
internet betting agencies based abroad a number of private betting companies have challenged the treaty , saying it is inconsistent , because the federal states do not hold a monopoly on certain forms of gambling like slot machines and casinos .
numerous internet users place bets illegally with private online companies registered abroad , which tend to offer better odds .

now , 20 years on , germany has been fully accepted by its european neighbors . it was in january 1990 , during a walk along the french atlantic coast , that the then-chancellor helmut kohl convinced french president francois mitterrand to support german unification .
mitterrand was skeptical at first , but kohl persuaded him by pledging his commitment to european integration .
with france on board , helmut kohl had the backing of germany 's most important european neighbor .
french sentiment had normalized in a way that it had not done to the same degree in britain and the united states , says french political theorist and journalist alfred grosser .
" with a few exceptions , french opinion polls show that people here saw the germans as friends .
they thought it perfectly natural that the two states should become one again , " he said .
indeed , kohl did not have the same success with his british colleague , prime minister margaret thatcher .
she opposed a unified germany ; but she was replaced as british leader in november 1990 by her fellow conservative party member john major .
germany furthered european integration bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kohl 's passion about european integration convinced mitterrand kohl promised that germany would maintain the european union course of greater integration , which he reaffirmed a year later : " unified germany does not want a return to the europe of yesterday , " he declared to the bundestag .
" there can been no revival of old rivalries and nationalisms .
we want a new europe - one that does not suppress our national identity , one in which countries no longer oppose one another , where no nation stands in the shadow of another , but -lsb- a europe -rsb- in which , together , we can guarantee a future in peace and freedom , prosperity and security . "
over the 20 years since reunification , german governments of all political colors have upheld kohl 's promise : germany championed the admission of the former east bloc states into the eu ; it paid for the eu 's eastward expansion , and the germans gave up their currency , the deutschmark , for the euro . '
german unity signifies european unity ' the reservations many of germany 's neighbors still harbored about the country they had fought in world war ii gradually disappeared .
belgium , for example , had no qualms about germany 's increased size , according to political scientist dirk rochtus of lessius hogeschool university college in antwerp .
" german unity also signifies european unity , " he said .
" that was clear to us here in belgium .
if the two german nations come together again , it also signifies that we have overcome the division of europe .
we see that as a good thing . "
the older generation , which had lived through the german occupation of belgium , did have doubts though .
" naturally there are older people who still have memories of that time , " rochtus said .
" but generally it has to be said that the response has been quite matter-of-fact - and also that we make a distinction between a people , in this case the german people , and the regime that governed this people and headed the occupation regime in belgium .
we make a very big distinction between the two . "
poles and czechs skeptical germany 's neighbors to the east , poland and the czech republic , also had many initial reservations .
after the political upheaval they had experienced , poles realized that germany no longer made any claims on their country and that the german government was serious about european unity , according to janusz reiter , poland 's former ambassador to bonn -lrb- 1990-1995 -rrb- .
" nowadays , germany 's size is no reason for its neighbors to be afraid , " he said .
" the relationship between germany and poland is still not entirely free of ambivalence and tensions , but for different reasons . "
poles are well aware of germany 's economic strength , and are keen to go to their western neighbor to earn money , he added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poles like andrzej stasiuk remain cautious when it comes to germany but there are limits , according to polish author andrzej stasiuk .
" very few poles would think of going to germany on holiday , " he said .
" you do n't go to germany for fun . "
in a recent article for german magazine focus , stasiuk wrote : " germany is not to be taken for granted ; germany is equivocal .
you have to keep your eyes on germany . "
prague-based political scientist robert schuster believes that until the end of the 1990s czechs were afraid of germany - and of the possibility that germans expelled after world war ii might make claims against them .
tensions between the two only started to ease after they signed a joint declaration in 1998 .
the declaration addressed the wounds of the past , as well as crimes committed during and after world war ii ; and it also highlighted perspectives for a joint future .
" the two countries are not competing anymore , " schuster said .
" they are no longer enemies , but members of a community , the eu .
and members of nato .
this aspect of security policy should not be underestimated . "
and he added that young czechs - who have had the opportunity to travel to germany , to study there and meet germans of their own age - have a completely different image of germans to that of the generation aged 50 and over .
football instigated the breakthrough the netherlands , luxembourg , switzerland and austria at first held back , but then gave their approval to german unification .
today , the spending power of german tourists means they are more popular than ever in their neighboring countries , although opinion polls suggest that germans themselves do n't quite believe this .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 2006 world cup showed a side of the country that many had not seen before " we ca n't tell the difference any more between ossis and wessis - that is , germans from the former east or west , " said austrian historian oliver radkolb .
and germany 's northern neighbor , denmark , has also accepted the new , larger germany , according to danish writer knud romer .
for decades danes regarded the germans as a nation of perpetrators , as did many other people in europe , he pointed out .
the breakthrough came with the soccer world cup , which germany hosted in 2006 , he added .
" that was when i realized , for the first time , that the war was over .
finished .
there 's none of that anymore , " romer said .
" and the danes were cheering the germans on . "

structural changes have left urban populations in decline , and the brightest inhabitants are usually the first to go . right on germany 's eastern border the town of schwedt overlooks the river oder .
in the 1960s , this was a boom town : people moved here in tens of thousands to work in the local oil refinery .
but since reunification that trend has been radically reversed .
the pr assistant in schwedt town hall insists that the mayor himself will answer any questions .
" urban restructuring is a matter for the boss , " she says .
sure enough , the mayor , juergen polzehl , a gray-haired man in his mid-50s , invites me to go for a ride with him in his official car .
he tells the chauffeur to drive us to the kuelz district .
on the way there we pass row upon row of prefabricated apartment blocks - a legacy of the final , brief heyday of the uckermark regional municipality .
the town 's population swelled to 52,000 after the refinery was built , and housing had to be created for all the new arrivals .
rapid decline in population bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mayor polzehl says schwedt has spent billions of euros on urban restructuring then came german reunification .
workers at the refinery were laid off .
in the past 20 years , 20,000 people have moved away from schwedt .
at one time thousands of apartments stood empty .
" we had to respond to the situation , " says polzehl , pointing out of the window .
suddenly the buildings are interrupted by a wide , uneven open space .
" all this was apartment blocks , one after another .
now it 's all been returned to nature , " polzehl explains .
for a while they were demolishing as many as a thousand apartments in a year in schwedt .
now , polzehl says , it 's about 150 per year : the contraction of the town is gradually becoming more manageable .
billions of euros have been spent on urban restructuring .
demolition , reconstruction and reforestation help alleviate the sadness of the shrinking towns , but the alteration of the demographic has had a lasting effect on the makeup of the population .
polzehl is particularly concerned that so many young women have moved away .
this is a problem for many of the regions - and it has led to a severe shortage of young women in the new federal states .
the newspaper die welt reports that , in the 25-30 age bracket , in the east there are only 85 women for every 100 men .
polzehl remains optimistic .
" perhaps that will change if we locate a few businesses here and a local authority office .
that 'll improve the job situation , " he says , hopefully .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the oil refinery was once the city 's largest employer brain drain the mayor has set himself a considerable challenge .
conditions here , as in many parts of eastern germany , are not good .
the unemployment figure for the country as a whole is less than eight percent , but the east is struggling with more than 12 percent unemployment .
in schwedt it is even higher at 16 percent .
more efficient production methods and the closing or relocation of industry have greatly reduced the number of jobs available in the east .
those who are able to leave , do .
salaries , too , are higher in the west .
the young , the intelligent and the educated are leading the exodus , leaving behind the old and those described by despairing employers as " barely trainable . "
in an interview with the berliner zeitung in 2004 , ulf matthiesen , a researcher in area studies , described them as " unemployed urban idiots with no family ties and no prospect of forming a relationship . "
in parts of brandenburg and mecklenburg-western pomerania the number of pupils dropping out of school is 50 percent higher than the national average .
more than 10 percent leave school early , according to heike liebmann , head of the city regeneration department at the leibniz institute for regional development .
she describes this as an indication of the degree to which the general level of education among the local population has fallen .
furthermore , the fewer creative and enterprising people there are in public life , the less attractive the prospect of staying here becomes for those left behind .
it 's a vicious circle .
every year , ruediger ober-bloebaum resigns himself to seeing more of schwedt 's bright young people move away .
the stocky 50-year-old is the headmaster of the town 's last remaining high school .
last summer 103 pupils graduated , but he says : " of these , only seven are staying in schwedt .
the others are all going away to study or start an apprenticeship , and only 10 of those think they might come back . "
ober-bloebaum supposes schwedt is too quiet for them ; there 's just not enough going on there .
but there 's another problem , too .
he refers to a 2007 study by the berlin institute for population and development which suggested " that the girls are leaving because they find the boys here too stupid . "
wild , wild east bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : large parts of schwedt are returning to nature before unification in 1990 , then-chancellor helmut kohl spoke of the prospect of " landscapes in bloom . "
he used the term as a metaphor for the economic development of the east , but in recent years regional planners have suggested it should be taken literally .
they have proposed returning parts of eastern germany to nature .
liebmann says it 's hard to imagine how the movement of people could be controlled in such a process , but she adds that " it is certainly useful for society to consider whether it can afford to maintain the existing infrastructure in areas that are becoming less densely populated . "
polzehl is dismissive of such ideas .
" we ca n't just let all this become a jungle .
we have our roots here ; this is our home . "
and schwedt still has good things to offer .
it is responsible for 15 percent of the industrial production of the state of brandenburg , and germany 's only meadowland national park is right next door .
on the way back to the town hall , mayor polzehl draws encouragement from his own life story .
" i moved away too , when i was young , " he says .
" and now i 'm back again . "

now , 20 years on , germany has been fully accepted by its european neighbors . it was in january 1990 , during a walk along the french atlantic coast , that the then-chancellor helmut kohl convinced french president francois mitterrand to support german unification .
mitterrand was skeptical at first , but kohl persuaded him by pledging his commitment to european integration .
with france on board , helmut kohl had the backing of germany 's most important european neighbor .
french sentiment had normalized in a way that it had not done to the same degree in britain and the united states , says french political theorist and journalist alfred grosser .
" with a few exceptions , french opinion polls show that people here saw the germans as friends .
they thought it perfectly natural that the two states should become one again , " he said .
indeed , kohl did not have the same success with his british colleague , prime minister margaret thatcher .
she opposed a unified germany ; but she was replaced as british leader in november 1990 by her fellow conservative party member john major .
germany furthered european integration bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kohl 's passion about european integration convinced mitterrand kohl promised that germany would maintain the european union course of greater integration , which he reaffirmed a year later : " unified germany does not want a return to the europe of yesterday , " he declared to the bundestag .
" there can been no revival of old rivalries and nationalisms .
we want a new europe - one that does not suppress our national identity , one in which countries no longer oppose one another , where no nation stands in the shadow of another , but -lsb- a europe -rsb- in which , together , we can guarantee a future in peace and freedom , prosperity and security . "
over the 20 years since reunification , german governments of all political colors have upheld kohl 's promise : germany championed the admission of the former east bloc states into the eu ; it paid for the eu 's eastward expansion , and the germans gave up their currency , the deutschmark , for the euro . '
german unity signifies european unity ' the reservations many of germany 's neighbors still harbored about the country they had fought in world war ii gradually disappeared .
belgium , for example , had no qualms about germany 's increased size , according to political scientist dirk rochtus of lessius hogeschool university college in antwerp .
" german unity also signifies european unity , " he said .
" that was clear to us here in belgium .
if the two german nations come together again , it also signifies that we have overcome the division of europe .
we see that as a good thing . "
the older generation , which had lived through the german occupation of belgium , did have doubts though .
" naturally there are older people who still have memories of that time , " rochtus said .
" but generally it has to be said that the response has been quite matter-of-fact - and also that we make a distinction between a people , in this case the german people , and the regime that governed this people and headed the occupation regime in belgium .
we make a very big distinction between the two . "
poles and czechs skeptical germany 's neighbors to the east , poland and the czech republic , also had many initial reservations .
after the political upheaval they had experienced , poles realized that germany no longer made any claims on their country and that the german government was serious about european unity , according to janusz reiter , poland 's former ambassador to bonn -lrb- 1990-1995 -rrb- .
" nowadays , germany 's size is no reason for its neighbors to be afraid , " he said .
" the relationship between germany and poland is still not entirely free of ambivalence and tensions , but for different reasons . "
poles are well aware of germany 's economic strength , and are keen to go to their western neighbor to earn money , he added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poles like andrzej stasiuk remain cautious when it comes to germany but there are limits , according to polish author andrzej stasiuk .
" very few poles would think of going to germany on holiday , " he said .
" you do n't go to germany for fun . "
in a recent article for german magazine focus , stasiuk wrote : " germany is not to be taken for granted ; germany is equivocal .
you have to keep your eyes on germany . "
prague-based political scientist robert schuster believes that until the end of the 1990s czechs were afraid of germany - and of the possibility that germans expelled after world war ii might make claims against them .
tensions between the two only started to ease after they signed a joint declaration in 1998 .
the declaration addressed the wounds of the past , as well as crimes committed during and after world war ii ; and it also highlighted perspectives for a joint future .
" the two countries are not competing anymore , " schuster said .
" they are no longer enemies , but members of a community , the eu .
and members of nato .
this aspect of security policy should not be underestimated . "
and he added that young czechs - who have had the opportunity to travel to germany , to study there and meet germans of their own age - have a completely different image of germans to that of the generation aged 50 and over .
football instigated the breakthrough the netherlands , luxembourg , switzerland and austria at first held back , but then gave their approval to german unification .
today , the spending power of german tourists means they are more popular than ever in their neighboring countries , although opinion polls suggest that germans themselves do n't quite believe this .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 2006 world cup showed a side of the country that many had not seen before " we ca n't tell the difference any more between ossis and wessis - that is , germans from the former east or west , " said austrian historian oliver radkolb .
and germany 's northern neighbor , denmark , has also accepted the new , larger germany , according to danish writer knud romer .
for decades danes regarded the germans as a nation of perpetrators , as did many other people in europe , he pointed out .
the breakthrough came with the soccer world cup , which germany hosted in 2006 , he added .
" that was when i realized , for the first time , that the war was over .
finished .
there 's none of that anymore , " romer said .
" and the danes were cheering the germans on . "

structural changes have left urban populations in decline , and the brightest inhabitants are usually the first to go . right on germany 's eastern border the town of schwedt overlooks the river oder .
in the 1960s , this was a boom town : people moved here in tens of thousands to work in the local oil refinery .
but since reunification that trend has been radically reversed .
the pr assistant in schwedt town hall insists that the mayor himself will answer any questions .
" urban restructuring is a matter for the boss , " she says .
sure enough , the mayor , juergen polzehl , a gray-haired man in his mid-50s , invites me to go for a ride with him in his official car .
he tells the chauffeur to drive us to the kuelz district .
on the way there we pass row upon row of prefabricated apartment blocks - a legacy of the final , brief heyday of the uckermark regional municipality .
the town 's population swelled to 52,000 after the refinery was built , and housing had to be created for all the new arrivals .
rapid decline in population bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mayor polzehl says schwedt has spent billions of euros on urban restructuring then came german reunification .
workers at the refinery were laid off .
in the past 20 years , 20,000 people have moved away from schwedt .
at one time thousands of apartments stood empty .
" we had to respond to the situation , " says polzehl , pointing out of the window .
suddenly the buildings are interrupted by a wide , uneven open space .
" all this was apartment blocks , one after another .
now it 's all been returned to nature , " polzehl explains .
for a while they were demolishing as many as a thousand apartments in a year in schwedt .
now , polzehl says , it 's about 150 per year : the contraction of the town is gradually becoming more manageable .
billions of euros have been spent on urban restructuring .
demolition , reconstruction and reforestation help alleviate the sadness of the shrinking towns , but the alteration of the demographic has had a lasting effect on the makeup of the population .
polzehl is particularly concerned that so many young women have moved away .
this is a problem for many of the regions - and it has led to a severe shortage of young women in the new federal states .
the newspaper die welt reports that , in the 25-30 age bracket , in the east there are only 85 women for every 100 men .
polzehl remains optimistic .
" perhaps that will change if we locate a few businesses here and a local authority office .
that 'll improve the job situation , " he says , hopefully .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the oil refinery was once the city 's largest employer brain drain the mayor has set himself a considerable challenge .

now , 20 years on , germany has been fully accepted by its european neighbors . it was in january 1990 , during a walk along the french atlantic coast , that the then-chancellor helmut kohl convinced french president francois mitterrand to support german unification .
mitterrand was skeptical at first , but kohl persuaded him by pledging his commitment to european integration .
with france on board , helmut kohl had the backing of germany 's most important european neighbor .
french sentiment had normalized in a way that it had not done to the same degree in britain and the united states , says french political theorist and journalist alfred grosser .
" with a few exceptions , french opinion polls show that people here saw the germans as friends .
they thought it perfectly natural that the two states should become one again , " he said .
indeed , kohl did not have the same success with his british colleague , prime minister margaret thatcher .
she opposed a unified germany ; but she was replaced as british leader in november 1990 by her fellow conservative party member john major .
germany furthered european integration bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kohl 's passion about european integration convinced mitterrand kohl promised that germany would maintain the european union course of greater integration , which he reaffirmed a year later : " unified germany does not want a return to the europe of yesterday , " he declared to the bundestag .
" there can been no revival of old rivalries and nationalisms .
we want a new europe - one that does not suppress our national identity , one in which countries no longer oppose one another , where no nation stands in the shadow of another , but -lsb- a europe -rsb- in which , together , we can guarantee a future in peace and freedom , prosperity and security . "
over the 20 years since reunification , german governments of all political colors have upheld kohl 's promise : germany championed the admission of the former east bloc states into the eu ; it paid for the eu 's eastward expansion , and the germans gave up their currency , the deutschmark , for the euro . '
german unity signifies european unity ' the reservations many of germany 's neighbors still harbored about the country they had fought in world war ii gradually disappeared .
belgium , for example , had no qualms about germany 's increased size , according to political scientist dirk rochtus of lessius hogeschool university college in antwerp .
" german unity also signifies european unity , " he said .
" that was clear to us here in belgium .
if the two german nations come together again , it also signifies that we have overcome the division of europe .
we see that as a good thing . "
the older generation , which had lived through the german occupation of belgium , did have doubts though .
" naturally there are older people who still have memories of that time , " rochtus said .
" but generally it has to be said that the response has been quite matter-of-fact - and also that we make a distinction between a people , in this case the german people , and the regime that governed this people and headed the occupation regime in belgium .
we make a very big distinction between the two . "
poles and czechs skeptical germany 's neighbors to the east , poland and the czech republic , also had many initial reservations .
after the political upheaval they had experienced , poles realized that germany no longer made any claims on their country and that the german government was serious about european unity , according to janusz reiter , poland 's former ambassador to bonn -lrb- 1990-1995 -rrb- .
" nowadays , germany 's size is no reason for its neighbors to be afraid , " he said .
" the relationship between germany and poland is still not entirely free of ambivalence and tensions , but for different reasons . "
poles are well aware of germany 's economic strength , and are keen to go to their western neighbor to earn money , he added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poles like andrzej stasiuk remain cautious when it comes to germany but there are limits , according to polish author andrzej stasiuk .
" very few poles would think of going to germany on holiday , " he said .
" you do n't go to germany for fun . "
in a recent article for german magazine focus , stasiuk wrote : " germany is not to be taken for granted ; germany is equivocal .
you have to keep your eyes on germany . "
prague-based political scientist robert schuster believes that until the end of the 1990s czechs were afraid of germany - and of the possibility that germans expelled after world war ii might make claims against them .
tensions between the two only started to ease after they signed a joint declaration in 1998 .
the declaration addressed the wounds of the past , as well as crimes committed during and after world war ii ; and it also highlighted perspectives for a joint future .
" the two countries are not competing anymore , " schuster said .
" they are no longer enemies , but members of a community , the eu .
and members of nato .
this aspect of security policy should not be underestimated . "
and he added that young czechs - who have had the opportunity to travel to germany , to study there and meet germans of their own age - have a completely different image of germans to that of the generation aged 50 and over .
football instigated the breakthrough the netherlands , luxembourg , switzerland and austria at first held back , but then gave their approval to german unification .
today , the spending power of german tourists means they are more popular than ever in their neighboring countries , although opinion polls suggest that germans themselves do n't quite believe this .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 2006 world cup showed a side of the country that many had not seen before " we ca n't tell the difference any more between ossis and wessis - that is , germans from the former east or west , " said austrian historian oliver radkolb .
and germany 's northern neighbor , denmark , has also accepted the new , larger germany , according to danish writer knud romer .
for decades danes regarded the germans as a nation of perpetrators , as did many other people in europe , he pointed out .
the breakthrough came with the soccer world cup , which germany hosted in 2006 , he added .
" that was when i realized , for the first time , that the war was over .
finished .
there 's none of that anymore , " romer said .
" and the danes were cheering the germans on . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de demographics -pipe- 08.09.2010 ' the smart ones all want to leave ' großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : about 150 apartments are demolished every year twenty years after unification , the country 's east is a radically different place .
structural changes have left urban populations in decline , and the brightest inhabitants are usually the first to go . right on germany 's eastern border the town of schwedt overlooks the river oder .
in the 1960s , this was a boom town : people moved here in tens of thousands to work in the local oil refinery .
but since reunification that trend has been radically reversed .
the pr assistant in schwedt town hall insists that the mayor himself will answer any questions .
" urban restructuring is a matter for the boss , " she says .
sure enough , the mayor , juergen polzehl , a gray-haired man in his mid-50s , invites me to go for a ride with him in his official car .
he tells the chauffeur to drive us to the kuelz district .
on the way there we pass row upon row of prefabricated apartment blocks - a legacy of the final , brief heyday of the uckermark regional municipality .
the town 's population swelled to 52,000 after the refinery was built , and housing had to be created for all the new arrivals .
rapid decline in population bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mayor polzehl says schwedt has spent billions of euros on urban restructuring then came german reunification .
workers at the refinery were laid off .
in the past 20 years , 20,000 people have moved away from schwedt .
at one time thousands of apartments stood empty .
" we had to respond to the situation , " says polzehl , pointing out of the window .
suddenly the buildings are interrupted by a wide , uneven open space .
" all this was apartment blocks , one after another .
now it 's all been returned to nature , " polzehl explains .
for a while they were demolishing as many as a thousand apartments in a year in schwedt .
now , polzehl says , it 's about 150 per year : the contraction of the town is gradually becoming more manageable .
billions of euros have been spent on urban restructuring .
demolition , reconstruction and reforestation help alleviate the sadness of the shrinking towns , but the alteration of the demographic has had a lasting effect on the makeup of the population .
polzehl is particularly concerned that so many young women have moved away .
this is a problem for many of the regions - and it has led to a severe shortage of young women in the new federal states .
the newspaper die welt reports that , in the 25-30 age bracket , in the east there are only 85 women for every 100 men .
polzehl remains optimistic .
" perhaps that will change if we locate a few businesses here and a local authority office .
that 'll improve the job situation , " he says , hopefully .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the oil refinery was once the city 's largest employer brain drain the mayor has set himself a considerable challenge .
conditions here , as in many parts of eastern germany , are not good .
the unemployment figure for the country as a whole is less than eight percent , but the east is struggling with more than 12 percent unemployment .
in schwedt it is even higher at 16 percent .
more efficient production methods and the closing or relocation of industry have greatly reduced the number of jobs available in the east .
those who are able to leave , do .
salaries , too , are higher in the west .
the young , the intelligent and the educated are leading the exodus , leaving behind the old and those described by despairing employers as " barely trainable . "
in an interview with the berliner zeitung in 2004 , ulf matthiesen , a researcher in area studies , described them as " unemployed urban idiots with no family ties and no prospect of forming a relationship . "
in parts of brandenburg and mecklenburg-western pomerania the number of pupils dropping out of school is 50 percent higher than the national average .
more than 10 percent leave school early , according to heike liebmann , head of the city regeneration department at the leibniz institute for regional development .
she describes this as an indication of the degree to which the general level of education among the local population has fallen .
furthermore , the fewer creative and enterprising people there are in public life , the less attractive the prospect of staying here becomes for those left behind .
it 's a vicious circle .
every year , ruediger ober-bloebaum resigns himself to seeing more of schwedt 's bright young people move away .
the stocky 50-year-old is the headmaster of the town 's last remaining high school .
last summer 103 pupils graduated , but he says : " of these , only seven are staying in schwedt .
the others are all going away to study or start an apprenticeship , and only 10 of those think they might come back . "
ober-bloebaum supposes schwedt is too quiet for them ; there 's just not enough going on there .
but there 's another problem , too .
he refers to a 2007 study by the berlin institute for population and development which suggested " that the girls are leaving because they find the boys here too stupid . "
wild , wild east bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : large parts of schwedt are returning to nature before unification in 1990 , then-chancellor helmut kohl spoke of the prospect of " landscapes in bloom . "
he used the term as a metaphor for the economic development of the east , but in recent years regional planners have suggested it should be taken literally .
they have proposed returning parts of eastern germany to nature .
liebmann says it 's hard to imagine how the movement of people could be controlled in such a process , but she adds that " it is certainly useful for society to consider whether it can afford to maintain the existing infrastructure in areas that are becoming less densely populated . "
polzehl is dismissive of such ideas .
" we ca n't just let all this become a jungle .
we have our roots here ; this is our home . "
and schwedt still has good things to offer .
it is responsible for 15 percent of the industrial production of the state of brandenburg , and germany 's only meadowland national park is right next door .
on the way back to the town hall , mayor polzehl draws encouragement from his own life story .
" i moved away too , when i was young , " he says .
" and now i 'm back again . "

he won the nobel prize in the year 1985 for the discovery of the quantum hall effect .
now i suppose after getting the prize you were probably pretty busy .
how long did it take until you could really get back to research ? klaus von klitzing : i am always in the laboratory , so if i am at home it 's about 50 percent of my time .
no , i am always in the laboratory .
i have a big group of young students .
and i always have to be able to tell new things in order to attend conferences , so i need new material .
therefore , i need to do research and this is the most important thing .
to keep up with modern research . but life probably changed after winning the nobel prize .
i mean your opinion is now important to everybody . yes , that 's one problem .
you have to say something in fields where you are not a specialist .
so you know something about physics and you have to say something about global warming .
it 's also related to physics , but also nuclear energy , weapons , all kinds of things .
so this is much more difficult .
but you have a lot of connections to people where you can rely on their opinion and you can get some information .
and you have to do something for the public , to say this is the right direction , in my opinion , but even nobel laureates they disagree sometimes in certain fields .
and this is an interesting point to have this discussion , to have a broad range of opinion and then to find the truth . what do you think distinguishes a nobel prize laureate ?
what is so special about you ? special is that unlike with politicians , many people believe that what you are saying is the absolute truth .
to a certain degree it 's true , but we do n't know everything .
but to a certain extent you can influence the public .
this is some extra burden also because suddenly you discover that what you are saying translates as one to one .
and sometimes it 's dangerous because as a scientist you do n't always have a fixed opinion about all things .
it 's floating , you are learning all the time .
so this is a burden to all of the laureates . f rom about 802 nobel prize laureates , we 've had only about 40 women .
do you have an explanation for that ? yes , it 's always more difficult for women in some cultures.in other countries in islamic countries in jordan there were more than 50 percent of phyics students who were female .
and if you go to france even , they also have more female scientists .
so it 's got something to do with the environment with the conditions , with the tradition , what is a family .
and i think that we have to learn something in germany about how to support female scientists .
to have an environment where they can continue their research .
because if you are away for three years in research , you lose contact with the top scientific questions .
so therefore you have to find some solutions , so you can combine both : a family and science .

here , too , he was known for his extreme convictions . a german church founded and formerly led by terry jones , the american pastor who international attracted attention with controversial plans to stage a koran-burning ceremony , expressly denounced those plans on wednesday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jones ' former church is ' deeply disturbed ' by their former leader stephan baar , deputy chairman of the christliche gemeinde koeln -lrb- cgd -rrb- , the christian community of cologne , told deutsche welle that jones preached a strict , even fundamental understanding of the bible , but that no direct comparisons could be drawn between his sermons there and the radical views he is currently espousing at his new church .
" we want to make it clear that our church is opposed to what terry jones is advocating at the moment and that the cgd , even though he is the founder , has no more contact with him , " baar said .
the community asked him to leave in 2008 .
baar insisted that there were no controversies surrounding his departure .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de international relations -pipe- 08.09.2010 eu vents anger at new us tourist surcharge großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu calls new us fee a visa through the back door the introduction of a new surcharge for travelers to the united states has drawn the ire of the european commission , which has called the levy " regrettable " and " inconsistent " with visa-free travel . travelers who do not require visas for the united states - such as most citizens of europe , including germany , as well as australia , new zealand , south korea and japan - must pay a $ 14 tax -lrb- 11 euros -rrb- starting wednesday .
travelers from so-called visa waiver program -lrb- vwp -rrb- countries " must pay operational and travel promotion fees " when applying for an electronic system for travel authorization , or esta , us authorities announced .
esta is an electronic registration form for overseas visitors and has been required for travelers from vwp countries since january , 2009 .
eu set to challenge new us rules the european union home affairs commissioner , cecilia malmstroem , has warned that the new us fees amounted to introducing visas through the backdoor . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fee is " inconsistent with transatlantic mobility , " says malmstroem " i have repeatedly raised concerns about this fee and i remain convinced that these new requirements … are inconsistent with the commitment of the us to facilitate transatlantic mobility and will be an additional onus for european citizens traveling to the us , " malmstroem said in a statement . malmstroem also said that the eu would carry out a comprehensive evaluation of the esta program , once the us authorities publish the final rules . but , elmar brok , a german member of the european parliament , speaking to deutsche welle , said on wednesday that if the us did n't drop the fee , the eu might take other action . " i think we can only talk to the americans that they get rid of it ; that we convince them , or , that we come up with retaliation measures , " he said . under pressure , us parries criticism jacqueline bednarz , from the us homeland security agency , defended the new practice at a press conference on wednesday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europeans have grown accustomed to visa-free travel " we 're very confident that the system is fast and easy and very user-friendly for travelers applying for an esta to come to the us through the visa waiver program .
we certainly are ready and see this as a great way to promote tourism to our country , " bednarz said . questions on the esta form include whether a passenger has a communicable disease , a physical or mental disorder , abuses drugs , has been convicted a certain crimes , or been involved in espionage , terrorism or genocide . in europe , the system is viewed as invasive and bureaucratic contrary to us opinion , europeans view the system as an oversized bureaucratic annoyance .
and the new tourist tax adds insult to injury for europeans wanting to go to the us , said iris bellingrodt , a german travel agent in kerpen near cologne , in an interview with deutsche welle . " it 's another point they do to make people angry to go to the us .
esta is a thing people do n't like anyway , because they have to answer so many questions .
and now , they have to pay for what the government wants them to do , " she said . bellingrodt said she did n't think the new fee would keep people from going to the us because it was minimal compared to the total cost of such a trip .
but she does think it means more paperwork for her business . " in our travel agency , it 's service for our customers that we fill out the esta form , but now , since it costs money we will go on doing this , but only with their own credit cards because if we charge the amount with our card we have to print an invoice or something .
this all makes much more paperwork , so we would have to take another fee for this , " said bellingrodt . author : gregg benzow editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

travelers from so-called visa waiver program -lrb- vwp -rrb- countries " must pay operational and travel promotion fees " when applying for an electronic system for travel authorization , or esta , us authorities announced .
esta is an electronic registration form for overseas visitors and has been required for travelers from vwp countries since january , 2009 .

she also took the opportunity to condemn a planned event to burn copies of the koran as " abhorrent . "
merkel threw her weight behind westergaard , whose drawings of the prophet muhammad concealing a bomb in a turban earned him death threats after they were published in 2005 .
" it is about whether or not he can publish his cartoons , yes or no , " said merkel .
" whether they are necessary or helpful or tasteful or not does n't matter .
is he allowed to do it ?
yes , he is . "
" europe is a place where a cartoonist can draw cartoons .
that is not to contradict that europe is also a place of freedom of belief and religion .
the respect for belief and religion is a highly valued good , " she said at the ceremony .

it 's simply wrong , " merkel said .

french workers strike over pension reforms australia has proposed by the labour government of ms. julia gillard to increase the age of pensions for retirement from 65 to 67 in the future .
there has been no real opposition to this proposal like in france .
the same reasons are given by australia like in france such as an aging population and life expectancy . - stuart , australia unless the strikers can come up with a way to pay for their pensions , 62 is early .
what are they planning to do , sit around and wait to die ? - marga , us the retirement age should be raised because unaffordable benefits now will transfer the financial burden to the upcoming generations .
we will rely more and more on low wage manufacturing for affordable products , further exacerbating the problem . - steve , france the unions in france should fight against this reactionary measure and do what ever is necessary to stop the government from doing this disgraceful act against the people .

the world is facing a climate catastrophe and needs to reduce co2 emissions as soon as possible .
germany , like australia , has high co2 emissions but believes that renewables are the answer .
please do the math ; no country , including germany , has ever reduced co2 emissions using renewables .
the only successful non-carbon technology is nuclear power which your neighbors france , switzerland and sweden have successfully used to reduce co2 emissions .

the groups caused up to 6 billion euros in lost revenue , prosecutors have said . following police raids that led to the seizure of computer servers in 12 european countries on tuesday , belgian authorities provided details on wednesday about the scope , economic impact , and type of content they uncovered after breaking up four internet piracy rings . " -lsb- these are groups -rsb- that were putting pirated content online - films and television series - in dutch , or with dutch subtitles , " jean-marc meilleur , a spokesperson for the brussels prosecutor 's office also told deutsche welle . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the groups are accused of causing up to 30 million euros in revenue losses the two-year investigation targeted the " four groups most responsible for making available 80 percent of dutch language television and film production or foreign language media sub-titled in dutch , " according to a statement also released wednesday by the prosecutor 's office . meilleur said 48 servers were seized in a dozen countries across europe , including germany , france , norway , croatia , hungary , italy and sweden .
ten people the prosecutor 's statement identified as the leaders of the four groups were also questioned in belgium , norway , poland and sweden .
five of the 10 were arrested and charged with participating in a criminal organization and copyright infringement . " we estimate that this group has caused 30 million euros worth of losses in belgium , and up to 6 billion euros globally , " he said . meilleur also pointed out the vast quantity of data and servers seized .

" still -lsb- the authorities -rsb- choose to put a lot of time , energy and money into chasing filesharers .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de art -pipe- 08.09.2010 photographer explores beauty among women prisoners großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the women were asked how prison life had changed them a photographer in cologne has taken female inmates as the subjects of his work - a tall order , given penitentiary security .
the artist asked the women to describe what " beauty " meant to them in everyday prison life . it sounds rather macabre or , at the very least , a contradiction in terms - asking female prisoners to address the notion of beauty .
russian photographer igor chepikov , who has been living in cologne , germany since 1991 , visited a women 's penitentiary weekly for over 10 months .
there , after splashing a wall in white paint to serve as a backdrop , he took thousands pictures of some of the inmates .
those snapshots were ultimately distilled into a selection of just 56 photographs that compose the exhibition called " bad ossendorf : women in prison " now on show in cologne . the title is a play on words .
" bad " in front of the name a place normally refers to a spa town in german .
" ossendorf " is the name of the penitentiary outside of cologne .
" bad ossendorf , " then , could be translated as " resort ossendorf , " but is intended to also imply english connotations , as in " bad love , bad money , bad company . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the photographer took 24 pictures of each participant however one chooses to view the name , the subject of the exhibition - women in prison confronted with the topic of " beauty " - sounds like it 's begging for feminist critique .
after all , many of the female prisoners have more existential issues to address than philosophical matters like the definition of beauty .
they are worried about their children , who are now sitting in orphanages .
they are dismayed about the pain they have caused their relatives .
they want to liberate themselves from a vicious circle of crime . the photographer chepikov , at least , gave space to the women 's voices - choosing not just to display his photographs of them , but also to literally frame their " narratives . "
the photographer asked the women to answer certain questions in written form - to describe what beauty meant to them , if they felt they had lost time in prison , what effect prison had had on their bodies and souls ? some of the answers : " the feeling of loneliness is the worst . "
" i never thought prison could make a person look so bad . "
" there is no place to buy make-up here , or any other kind of personal hygiene products . "
" once i saw the photos , i realized how horrible the effects of the drugs have been . "
" i wish i could turn back the clock . "
" for me , ' beauty ' here in the prison essentially means being clean . " deutsche welle spoke with the photographer , igor chepikov , to get his take on " women in prison . " deutsche welle : why these photographs of women in prison ? why did you choose to do this ? igor chepikov : i came up with the idea about six years ago .
i was sitting in the moscow subway , and was looking out of the windows and thinking about the song " as time goes by . "
and then , i started reading something about prisons and got to thinking about what life is like in prisons .
a man , for instance , could be 20 years old and get 15 years in jail , but he 's only 35 when he gets out .
but when he 's 45 and gets out of prison -lsb- 15 years later -rsb- , he 's 60 .
life is over for him , and he has no possibility to change .
for women , it 's even harder - not only can they not adapt at that age , they have also lost their beauty .
i realized that i should take pictures of them before that happens . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some of the women spiffed themselves up for the photo sessions is n't that kind of loaded , this idea of women and beauty and prison ? i 'm not sure - that 's what i wanted to figure out : ' is it problematic for women , or not ? '
the prison administration was doubtful - they did n't think any of the women would want to present themselves in an exhibition , which is what my intention was from the start .
but 15 women wanted to participate , and that was a green light for my project from the get-go . what do you think the motivation was for these women to take part ? life in prison is quite boring .
participating in the project was almost like vacation - a departure from everyday life - for the women , who often sit for 23 hours a day in their cells .
for them , it was a connection to outside life . were n't the women ashamed to show themselves ? i 'm not sure .
they agreed to have their pictures taken .
some of the women were in prison for the second , third or fourth time .
one woman who agreed to take part had been free for a few months , then returned and said , ' hello , i 'm back , you can take more pictures of me . "
for her , it was like coming home again . do you have an example of one of the women 's stories , why she came to be in prison ? yes , i talked with the women , but their stories are supposed to remain private .
you can read the anonymous narratives hanging on the walls of the exhibition . some statistics show that women are victims themselves before they land in prison .
did you find that when you spoke with the women ? it was different .
you might find that in their narratives .
actually , a lot of these women were drug addicts , and many of them belong in a hospital or treatment center rather than a prison . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some felt the art project was an escape from everyday jail life what was one of the most difficult moments while you were photographing the women ? actually , it was beforehand - in convincing the prison administration to let me in .
they did n't really understand what i wanted and what my purpose was , but as soon as they got an idea of what i was aiming for - not criticizing the place , but just presenting the bit of beauty among the women in the prison - it was fine . how do you define beauty ? you have it or you do n't .
it 's not easily defined .
i can show it better than describe it in words .
each woman here in the exhibition has some form of beauty , even if it 's just something in her expression . is n't this a contrast , the idea of beauty and women in prison ? yes .
it 's difficult for people to imagine that women want to take care of themselves in jail , but many of the prisoners told me that it 's important to them , but they do n't have much of a chance to do that .
for the photo sessions , they made themselves up , had their hair cut . how did you try to make the women feel comfortable with you ? i brought cookies , cigarettes , tea .
and i talked with them - it was n't just a photo session with each , but also a chat . you trained as an architect , then switched to painting and finally , photography .
why ? i painted for 10 years - abstract painting .
but then i realized that there are just some things you can only capture in a moment , and i switched to photography .
my first photography project was in a slaughterhouse - i was impressed by the colors i could capture there , and the moment when life is extinguished .
you ca n't get this moment across in abstract paintings . do you think this project is political - the " women in prison " portraits ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some of the women said personal hygiene products are rare in prison no .
it 's human .
i do n't want to criticize anyone .
this is simply part of life , even if it 's scary at times . why women and not men ?
men can be beautiful too … because people think of women and not men when they hear the word beauty . you asked women to write some things down about beauty .
why ? because i wanted to know their opinions about the subject and not mine .
maybe they do n't think about it at all .
but from the letters , i can tell they do .
life is tough in prison , and it leaves traces on people 's faces much more than among people who are free . when one reads the narratives , it 's clear that the women are also struggling with other problems , like their drug addiction , missing their children , their safety .
is n't it a luxury to be asking questions about beauty , when the women are facing much tougher issues ? i do n't really know . interview : louisa schaefer editor : kate bowen the exhibition at the neues kunstforum in cologne runs through sept .

the artist asked the women to describe what " beauty " meant to them in everyday prison life . it sounds rather macabre or , at the very least , a contradiction in terms - asking female prisoners to address the notion of beauty .
russian photographer igor chepikov , who has been living in cologne , germany since 1991 , visited a women 's penitentiary weekly for over 10 months .
there , after splashing a wall in white paint to serve as a backdrop , he took thousands pictures of some of the inmates .
those snapshots were ultimately distilled into a selection of just 56 photographs that compose the exhibition called " bad ossendorf : women in prison " now on show in cologne . the title is a play on words .
" bad " in front of the name a place normally refers to a spa town in german .
" ossendorf " is the name of the penitentiary outside of cologne .
" bad ossendorf , " then , could be translated as " resort ossendorf , " but is intended to also imply english connotations , as in " bad love , bad money , bad company . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the photographer took 24 pictures of each participant however one chooses to view the name , the subject of the exhibition - women in prison confronted with the topic of " beauty " - sounds like it 's begging for feminist critique .
after all , many of the female prisoners have more existential issues to address than philosophical matters like the definition of beauty .
they are worried about their children , who are now sitting in orphanages .
they are dismayed about the pain they have caused their relatives .
they want to liberate themselves from a vicious circle of crime . the photographer chepikov , at least , gave space to the women 's voices - choosing not just to display his photographs of them , but also to literally frame their " narratives . "
the photographer asked the women to answer certain questions in written form - to describe what beauty meant to them , if they felt they had lost time in prison , what effect prison had had on their bodies and souls ? some of the answers : " the feeling of loneliness is the worst . "
" i never thought prison could make a person look so bad . "
" there is no place to buy make-up here , or any other kind of personal hygiene products . "
" once i saw the photos , i realized how horrible the effects of the drugs have been . "
" i wish i could turn back the clock . "
" for me , ' beauty ' here in the prison essentially means being clean . " deutsche welle spoke with the photographer , igor chepikov , to get his take on " women in prison . " deutsche welle : why these photographs of women in prison ? why did you choose to do this ? igor chepikov : i came up with the idea about six years ago .
i was sitting in the moscow subway , and was looking out of the windows and thinking about the song " as time goes by . "
and then , i started reading something about prisons and got to thinking about what life is like in prisons .
a man , for instance , could be 20 years old and get 15 years in jail , but he 's only 35 when he gets out .
but when he 's 45 and gets out of prison -lsb- 15 years later -rsb- , he 's 60 .
life is over for him , and he has no possibility to change .
for women , it 's even harder - not only can they not adapt at that age , they have also lost their beauty .
i realized that i should take pictures of them before that happens . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some of the women spiffed themselves up for the photo sessions is n't that kind of loaded , this idea of women and beauty and prison ? i 'm not sure - that 's what i wanted to figure out : ' is it problematic for women , or not ? '
the prison administration was doubtful - they did n't think any of the women would want to present themselves in an exhibition , which is what my intention was from the start .
but 15 women wanted to participate , and that was a green light for my project from the get-go . what do you think the motivation was for these women to take part ? life in prison is quite boring .
participating in the project was almost like vacation - a departure from everyday life - for the women , who often sit for 23 hours a day in their cells .
for them , it was a connection to outside life . were n't the women ashamed to show themselves ? i 'm not sure .
they agreed to have their pictures taken .
some of the women were in prison for the second , third or fourth time .
one woman who agreed to take part had been free for a few months , then returned and said , ' hello , i 'm back , you can take more pictures of me . "
for her , it was like coming home again . do you have an example of one of the women 's stories , why she came to be in prison ? yes , i talked with the women , but their stories are supposed to remain private .
you can read the anonymous narratives hanging on the walls of the exhibition . some statistics show that women are victims themselves before they land in prison .
did you find that when you spoke with the women ? it was different .
you might find that in their narratives .
actually , a lot of these women were drug addicts , and many of them belong in a hospital or treatment center rather than a prison . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some felt the art project was an escape from everyday jail life what was one of the most difficult moments while you were photographing the women ? actually , it was beforehand - in convincing the prison administration to let me in .
they did n't really understand what i wanted and what my purpose was , but as soon as they got an idea of what i was aiming for - not criticizing the place , but just presenting the bit of beauty among the women in the prison - it was fine . how do you define beauty ? you have it or you do n't .
it 's not easily defined .
i can show it better than describe it in words .
each woman here in the exhibition has some form of beauty , even if it 's just something in her expression . is n't this a contrast , the idea of beauty and women in prison ? yes .
it 's difficult for people to imagine that women want to take care of themselves in jail , but many of the prisoners told me that it 's important to them , but they do n't have much of a chance to do that .
for the photo sessions , they made themselves up , had their hair cut . how did you try to make the women feel comfortable with you ? i brought cookies , cigarettes , tea .
and i talked with them - it was n't just a photo session with each , but also a chat . you trained as an architect , then switched to painting and finally , photography .
why ? i painted for 10 years - abstract painting .
but then i realized that there are just some things you can only capture in a moment , and i switched to photography .
my first photography project was in a slaughterhouse - i was impressed by the colors i could capture there , and the moment when life is extinguished .
you ca n't get this moment across in abstract paintings . do you think this project is political - the " women in prison " portraits ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some of the women said personal hygiene products are rare in prison no .
it 's human .
i do n't want to criticize anyone .
this is simply part of life , even if it 's scary at times . why women and not men ?
men can be beautiful too … because people think of women and not men when they hear the word beauty . you asked women to write some things down about beauty .
why ? because i wanted to know their opinions about the subject and not mine .
maybe they do n't think about it at all .
but from the letters , i can tell they do .
life is tough in prison , and it leaves traces on people 's faces much more than among people who are free . when one reads the narratives , it 's clear that the women are also struggling with other problems , like their drug addiction , missing their children , their safety .
is n't it a luxury to be asking questions about beauty , when the women are facing much tougher issues ? i do n't really know . interview : louisa schaefer editor : kate bowen the exhibition at the neues kunstforum in cologne runs through sept .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de art -pipe- 08.09.2010 photographer explores beauty among women prisoners großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the women were asked how prison life had changed them a photographer in cologne has taken female inmates as the subjects of his work - a tall order , given penitentiary security .
the artist asked the women to describe what " beauty " meant to them in everyday prison life . it sounds rather macabre or , at the very least , a contradiction in terms - asking female prisoners to address the notion of beauty .
russian photographer igor chepikov , who has been living in cologne , germany since 1991 , visited a women 's penitentiary weekly for over 10 months .
there , after splashing a wall in white paint to serve as a backdrop , he took thousands pictures of some of the inmates .
those snapshots were ultimately distilled into a selection of just 56 photographs that compose the exhibition called " bad ossendorf : women in prison " now on show in cologne . the title is a play on words .
" bad " in front of the name a place normally refers to a spa town in german .
" ossendorf " is the name of the penitentiary outside of cologne .
" bad ossendorf , " then , could be translated as " resort ossendorf , " but is intended to also imply english connotations , as in " bad love , bad money , bad company . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the photographer took 24 pictures of each participant however one chooses to view the name , the subject of the exhibition - women in prison confronted with the topic of " beauty " - sounds like it 's begging for feminist critique .
after all , many of the female prisoners have more existential issues to address than philosophical matters like the definition of beauty .
they are worried about their children , who are now sitting in orphanages .
they are dismayed about the pain they have caused their relatives .
they want to liberate themselves from a vicious circle of crime . the photographer chepikov , at least , gave space to the women 's voices - choosing not just to display his photographs of them , but also to literally frame their " narratives . "
the photographer asked the women to answer certain questions in written form - to describe what beauty meant to them , if they felt they had lost time in prison , what effect prison had had on their bodies and souls ? some of the answers : " the feeling of loneliness is the worst . "
" i never thought prison could make a person look so bad . "
" there is no place to buy make-up here , or any other kind of personal hygiene products . "
" once i saw the photos , i realized how horrible the effects of the drugs have been . "
" i wish i could turn back the clock . "
" for me , ' beauty ' here in the prison essentially means being clean . " deutsche welle spoke with the photographer , igor chepikov , to get his take on " women in prison . " deutsche welle : why these photographs of women in prison ? why did you choose to do this ? igor chepikov : i came up with the idea about six years ago .
i was sitting in the moscow subway , and was looking out of the windows and thinking about the song " as time goes by . "
and then , i started reading something about prisons and got to thinking about what life is like in prisons .
a man , for instance , could be 20 years old and get 15 years in jail , but he 's only 35 when he gets out .
but when he 's 45 and gets out of prison -lsb- 15 years later -rsb- , he 's 60 .
life is over for him , and he has no possibility to change .
for women , it 's even harder - not only can they not adapt at that age , they have also lost their beauty .
i realized that i should take pictures of them before that happens . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some of the women spiffed themselves up for the photo sessions is n't that kind of loaded , this idea of women and beauty and prison ? i 'm not sure - that 's what i wanted to figure out : ' is it problematic for women , or not ? '
the prison administration was doubtful - they did n't think any of the women would want to present themselves in an exhibition , which is what my intention was from the start .
but 15 women wanted to participate , and that was a green light for my project from the get-go . what do you think the motivation was for these women to take part ? life in prison is quite boring .
participating in the project was almost like vacation - a departure from everyday life - for the women , who often sit for 23 hours a day in their cells .
for them , it was a connection to outside life . were n't the women ashamed to show themselves ? i 'm not sure .
they agreed to have their pictures taken .
some of the women were in prison for the second , third or fourth time .
one woman who agreed to take part had been free for a few months , then returned and said , ' hello , i 'm back , you can take more pictures of me . "
for her , it was like coming home again . do you have an example of one of the women 's stories , why she came to be in prison ? yes , i talked with the women , but their stories are supposed to remain private .
you can read the anonymous narratives hanging on the walls of the exhibition . some statistics show that women are victims themselves before they land in prison .

but a comparison between debates in germany and the united states suggests they shed more heat than light . with the publication of his book " deutschland schafft sich ab " -lrb- " germany abolishes itself " -rrb- in late august , banker and politician thilo sarrazin gifted the german media an incendiary topic for the autumn .
among the book 's controversial theses is the idea that higher fertility rates would allow non-assimilated muslims to dominate germany in the not-too-distant future .
the book tapped into fears among some germans that german culture and the german way of life is in danger .
but the discussions engendered were reminiscent of similar debates in other cultures .
in the united states , the publication in 2004 of a book entitled " who are we ? " by political scientist samuel p. huntington sparked discussions about whether the increasing prevalence of spanish-speaking americans would bifurcate us culture and threaten what the author called the american " creed " of enlightenment democracy .
but though the subject matters are seemingly similar , the levels of discourse in the two debates are very different .
german immigration expert klaus j. bade praises sarrazin for pointing up abuse of the german welfare system by migrants and germans .
but he takes the author to task in other areas .
" huntington 's book was more scientifically informed , whereas sarrazin knows as much about demography as i do about his specialty , state finances : namely just bits and pieces , " bade told deutsche welle .
" in this field he 's a populist writer who partly trades in cheap commonplaces and looks for statistical evidence for pre-conceived ideas - the exact opposite of the scientific method .
it 's what we call beer-coaster demographics . "
and the difference between a demagogue and a respected professor is not the only respect in which superficial similarities fall apart .
apples and oranges bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us hispanics , including this woman voting in denver , are becoming more and more important debates in germany and the us about whether immigrants are sufficiently assimilating are inflected by the different histories and demographics of the two countries .
the united states is a nation with a growing population and a rising number of immigrants , which from its very inception embraced the idea of foreigners becoming citizens .
germany , on the other hand , has stagnant population and immigration and was traditionally wary of taking in non-germans looking to better their lots in life .
" social integration and acknowledgement of the dialogue with muslim communities - these things have developed over the past few years , " philip anderson , professor of social sciences at the university of regensburg , told deutsche welle .
" but there needs to be more of that and far less of the fear of a sullying of the german identity and sometimes even german blood . "
debates about assimilation in germany and in other western european countries are additionally heated because most of the foreign residents and immigrants in question are muslim .
but klaus bade warns against seeing them as a homogeneous group .
" there 's no such thing as a single muslim group in germany , " bade said .
" immigration from iran , for example , centered on elites who had little problem integrating into german society .
immigrant turks tended to come from rural anatolia , and not istanbul , and so there were educational problems , especially three generations ago .
but that had nothing to do with them being muslims .
problems among italian immigrants , for instance , were and still are worse . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thilo sarrazin -lrb- r . -rrb- has been doing the talk-show rounds self-fulfilling prophecies sarrazin has had to step down from his job on the board of germany 's federal bank , and may yet lose his membership in the social democratic party for his ill-advised and ill-informed opinions .
but is there anything to the points he - or huntington - raised ?
can demographic changes mean the end of a language , a culture and a way of life ?
" there is an aspect comparable between both books , namely the vision of a competition between cultures , " bade said .
" but competition is not the same thing as total war .
moreover , we should think less about groups and systems and more about individuals .
for many people the huntington book has something of a self-fulfilling prophecy .
it 's a circular argument that echoes older fears about the decline and fall of western civilization .
this seems , on a national level , comparable to sarrazin 's message . "
in other words , warnings about conflicts of civilizations - to paraphrase the title of another of huntington 's books - tend to create the sort of tension they claim to be decrying .
" generally there is far more acceptance - especially in the cities , where people lived together - than is usually acknowledged , " anderson said .
" politicians need to push that as a positive image of how people are getting on . "
for bade , reasoning that fails to distinguish and differentiate between individual attitudes among immigrants and resident aliens is inherently faulty .
" when asked ' when did you last go to a mosque , ' many european muslims may not know where the nearest one is or may respond : ' for religious or cultural reasons ? '
that 's comparable to the way many christians feel who may go to church to look at art or attend a wedding .
there 's an infinite number of hybrid forms and milieus of islam , and from one generation to another muslims themselves will - hopefully - adapt more and more to european civilization as they did and still do in the us . " culture is constantly in flux , and demographic changes , of course , bring cultural shifts with them .
but a " host " culture being taken over by a monolithic foreign group , say experts , is one thing neither americans nor germans need to fear . author : jefferson chase editor : rob mudge send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the hamburg-based bank has been called " a key financial lifeline for iran . " the us treasury department on tuesday slapped sanctions on a german bank accused of helping iran evade international sanctions and supporting its nuclear and missile activities .
europaeisch-iranische handelsbank -lrb- eih -rrb- , based in hamburg , has handled billions of dollars in transactions on behalf of the iranian government and entities involved in its nuclear and missile programs , according to the treasury department .
the bank is also said to have previously done business with other iranian banks already under sanctions .
" as one of iran 's few remaining access points to the european financial system , eih has facilitated a tremendous volume of transactions for iranian banks previously designated for proliferation , " said stuart levey , treasury undersecretary .
levey called the bank " a key financial lifeline for iran , " adding that it had provided financial services to iranian proliferators of weapons of mass destruction .
the sanctions will isolate eih from the us financial system , and are the latest effort by the united states to pressure iran under un security council sanctions adopted in june .
the west suspects iran of trying to develop nuclear weapons , charges which tehran has denied .
in august , the treasury department placed 13 european firms under sanctions , including nine in germany .

not only for the cities that did feature at the top of the popularity chart , but also for those that did not .

hassemer says businesses actively seeking creative input have picked up on the fact that it pays to offer creative jobs in berlin because they know they will stand a better chance of getting good people .
geppert goes one step further .
he says the german capital appeals to the kind of workers who are not only creative in what they do , but in the way they live their lives .
" we 're not talking here about people who want permanent contracts with all the perks of holiday and sick pay , but about those who come to berlin without work and who are willing to be freelance or take short-term contacts . "

he believes the capital needs to be more up front about how it wants to use the creative talent residing within its boundaries .
and for that it needs a cluster organization .
" cities should show themselves to the outside world , " hassemer said .
" berlin has a cluster for health care management , but has not managed to establish one for its creative industries , and that is a failure . "
he says that while establishing a cluster is not inherently easy , it could be done .
the major impediment is bad management on the part of politicians , who are too bound up in minor tussles to extend a hand of partnership to the creative branch .
hassemer is very clear that berlin should get on top of its potential sooner rather than later , because to squander it may well be to inflict lasting damage .

the court said the gambling laws were being applied inconsistently . the german government 's monopoly on most forms of gambling must be ended immediately , according to the european court of justice in luxembourg .
the court ruled that " the german rules do not limit games of chance in a consistent and systematic manner . " it said that the state the monopoly is not justifiable .
under german law , only the country 's 16 federal states or companies run by them can offer gambling services .
the state therefore has an effective monopoly on gambling and lotteries .
the law also bans most web-based betting , and forbids advertising such services .
the german state treaty on gambling came into force in 2008 to curb a growing trend in gambling addiction .
critics say it simply ensured that the state received a substantial chunk of the revenue from gambling .
internet betting agencies based abroad a number of private betting companies have challenged the treaty , saying it is inconsistent , because the federal states do not hold a monopoly on certain forms of gambling like slot machines and casinos .
numerous internet users place bets illegally with private online companies registered abroad , which tend to offer better odds .

the project helps parents with migrant backgrounds and their children improve their literacy skills through storytelling . four million of the more than 750 million illiterate people in the world live in germany , and a disproportionate number of them are immigrants or have an immigrant background .
the " family literacy " project -lrb- fly -rrb- focuses on that group , which makes up 14 percent of hamburg 's population , and for that reason it was singled out for unesco 's 2010 literacy award .
fly , a pilot project initiated and run by the hamburg state institute for teacher training and school development , uses an intergenerational approach to ensure closer cooperation and better communication between the school and the childrens ' home " it 's our goal to get the parents interested in reading more at home with their children and in engaging more strongly with language , " gabriele rabkin , the head of fly , told deutsche welle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an intergenerational approach benefits adults and children forty-four schools in hamburg participate in the program , which was started six years ago .
nearly 1,000 parents and as many children take part in the project every year .
parents welcome every two weeks , parents join their children , mainly preschoolers and first-graders , in the classroom .
they see how their kids engage with words and storytelling - and they 're allowed to help .
fly 's teachers encourage the adults to make sure their children speak in complete sentences outside of class , take time to look at picture books together or point out individual letters on the way to school .
ute stather , who teaches first and second graders at hamburg 's osterbrook school , has been with the project from the start .
" the parents see what we are doing and that helps them understand where they have to support their child , " she said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sometimes aunts , grandmothers and siblings join the classes the families are not discouraged from speaking their native language in class .
on the contrary , teachers view multilingualism as an asset , stather said .
" if people speak and read a lot in their native tongue , their children will also learn german much more easily . "
many of the parents also see fly classes as a chance to learn german , according to rabkin .
the teachers also do n't put pressure on the adults to read and speak in german with their children at home ; what was important was for them to deal with language as such .
" we do n't see parents as assistant teachers - they are their children 's first and most important teachers , " rabkin said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de education -pipe- 08.09.2010 indian school system still to improve großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : students sitting on the floor for 60 year india had no compulsory education for children .
a new law came into effect on april 1 providing children with access to free education .
but children ’ s rights organizations complain about the implementation . it is 2 o ’ clock at a school in the old part of pune .
classes are supposed to run from 12.30 to 5.30 pm at baburao sana ’ s school , just like in other state school but there ’ s no learning going on in this classroom .
instead there is chaos .
class one ’ s teacher is not here .
the children are playing , crying , shouting , or just running around . gangu is a seven years old girl .
her black hair is short and she has a gold nose ring .
she is wearing the school uniform , a yellow blouse and a grey pinafore .
she looks upon the chaos calmly .
she knows that the teacher always comes very late .
" we play here while we wait " , she says . ngo provides education for children of migrant workers gangu belongs to the nomadic pardhi tribe who are migrant workers .
all year round , they travel the country , looking for work .
they sell flowers or balloons on the streets to earn some money .
she had never been to school before because she was always on the road .
but last year she was adopted by the ngo ekalavya .
she now lives in a home with other pardhi children and goes to school everyday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : queuing in school uniform for food it is 3pm .
priyanka gaikwad , the teacher , finally arrives .
she tells the children to calm down .
she explains that she was late because she had to fill out some official forms in the headmistress ’ office .
" we often have other duties apart from school " , gaikwad complains .
" we have to compile reports for the government or help with the census . "
because class one ’ s exams are in a couple of days the headmistress gave her this work .
moreover , her colleague from another class is on holiday so she has to teach both classes together .
but there is not enough space and it is very chaotic . problem of crowded classes instead of 30 children , there are 60 sitting here - some are even crouching on the floor .
gangu takes her seat between two other girls .
the first subject of the day is marathi – the main language of maharashtra . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : too many pupils , too less space the children first learn the letters .
then they have to name words that they know which begin with these letters .
the teacher has a stick to beat the children with if they are too loud or talk among themselves .
although she ’ s officially not allowed , she says it ’ s impossible to discipline the children otherwise . indian school system not effective many of the children are quiet however .
they know they have their exam soon .
gangu also wants to take it but she is not allowed .
she is not registered at the school because she does not have a birth certificate .
she missed the deadline to get a certificate from the local state hospital .
this means she might have to wait for a year to get a certificate and repeat the year . many pardhi children have gone back to their parents and their nomadic way of life for this very reason .
they get bored when they have to repeat the class .
gangu is adamant that this will not happen .
she wants to go into class two , be successful , build a big house for her parents and live with them .
children ’ s rights activists hope that the new law will help overcome these bureaucratic barriers , otherwise they fear for universal education in india .

french workers strike over pension reforms australia has proposed by the labour government of ms. julia gillard to increase the age of pensions for retirement from 65 to 67 in the future .
there has been no real opposition to this proposal like in france .
the same reasons are given by australia like in france such as an aging population and life expectancy . - stuart , australia unless the strikers can come up with a way to pay for their pensions , 62 is early .
what are they planning to do , sit around and wait to die ? - marga , us the retirement age should be raised because unaffordable benefits now will transfer the financial burden to the upcoming generations .
we will rely more and more on low wage manufacturing for affordable products , further exacerbating the problem . - steve , france the unions in france should fight against this reactionary measure and do what ever is necessary to stop the government from doing this disgraceful act against the people .

the decision is not good for our planet and chancellor merkel should know better , being a scientist .
but it good to see some compromise within the government debate . - stuart , australia i can not believe the german people are so blind on this subject .
the world is facing a climate catastrophe and needs to reduce co2 emissions as soon as possible .
germany , like australia , has high co2 emissions but believes that renewables are the answer .
please do the math ; no country , including germany , has ever reduced co2 emissions using renewables .
the only successful non-carbon technology is nuclear power which your neighbors france , switzerland and sweden have successfully used to reduce co2 emissions .
facts , not fantasy , must drive decision-making . - tom , australia germany must have a continuous reliable source of electricity and the present nuclear plants should run for their designed lifetimes .

but a comparison between debates in germany and the united states suggests they shed more heat than light . with the publication of his book " deutschland schafft sich ab " -lrb- " germany abolishes itself " -rrb- in late august , banker and politician thilo sarrazin gifted the german media an incendiary topic for the autumn .
among the book 's controversial theses is the idea that higher fertility rates would allow non-assimilated muslims to dominate germany in the not-too-distant future .
the book tapped into fears among some germans that german culture and the german way of life is in danger .
but the discussions engendered were reminiscent of similar debates in other cultures .
in the united states , the publication in 2004 of a book entitled " who are we ? " by political scientist samuel p. huntington sparked discussions about whether the increasing prevalence of spanish-speaking americans would bifurcate us culture and threaten what the author called the american " creed " of enlightenment democracy .
but though the subject matters are seemingly similar , the levels of discourse in the two debates are very different .
german immigration expert klaus j. bade praises sarrazin for pointing up abuse of the german welfare system by migrants and germans .
but he takes the author to task in other areas .
" huntington 's book was more scientifically informed , whereas sarrazin knows as much about demography as i do about his specialty , state finances : namely just bits and pieces , " bade told deutsche welle .
" in this field he 's a populist writer who partly trades in cheap commonplaces and looks for statistical evidence for pre-conceived ideas - the exact opposite of the scientific method .
it 's what we call beer-coaster demographics . "
and the difference between a demagogue and a respected professor is not the only respect in which superficial similarities fall apart .
apples and oranges bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us hispanics , including this woman voting in denver , are becoming more and more important debates in germany and the us about whether immigrants are sufficiently assimilating are inflected by the different histories and demographics of the two countries .
the united states is a nation with a growing population and a rising number of immigrants , which from its very inception embraced the idea of foreigners becoming citizens .
germany , on the other hand , has stagnant population and immigration and was traditionally wary of taking in non-germans looking to better their lots in life .
" social integration and acknowledgement of the dialogue with muslim communities - these things have developed over the past few years , " philip anderson , professor of social sciences at the university of regensburg , told deutsche welle .
" but there needs to be more of that and far less of the fear of a sullying of the german identity and sometimes even german blood . "
debates about assimilation in germany and in other western european countries are additionally heated because most of the foreign residents and immigrants in question are muslim .
but klaus bade warns against seeing them as a homogeneous group .
" there 's no such thing as a single muslim group in germany , " bade said .
" immigration from iran , for example , centered on elites who had little problem integrating into german society .
immigrant turks tended to come from rural anatolia , and not istanbul , and so there were educational problems , especially three generations ago .
but that had nothing to do with them being muslims .
problems among italian immigrants , for instance , were and still are worse . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thilo sarrazin -lrb- r . -rrb- has been doing the talk-show rounds self-fulfilling prophecies sarrazin has had to step down from his job on the board of germany 's federal bank , and may yet lose his membership in the social democratic party for his ill-advised and ill-informed opinions .
but is there anything to the points he - or huntington - raised ?
can demographic changes mean the end of a language , a culture and a way of life ?
" there is an aspect comparable between both books , namely the vision of a competition between cultures , " bade said .
" but competition is not the same thing as total war .
moreover , we should think less about groups and systems and more about individuals .
for many people the huntington book has something of a self-fulfilling prophecy .
it 's a circular argument that echoes older fears about the decline and fall of western civilization .
this seems , on a national level , comparable to sarrazin 's message . "
in other words , warnings about conflicts of civilizations - to paraphrase the title of another of huntington 's books - tend to create the sort of tension they claim to be decrying .
" generally there is far more acceptance - especially in the cities , where people lived together - than is usually acknowledged , " anderson said .
" politicians need to push that as a positive image of how people are getting on . "
for bade , reasoning that fails to distinguish and differentiate between individual attitudes among immigrants and resident aliens is inherently faulty .
" when asked ' when did you last go to a mosque , ' many european muslims may not know where the nearest one is or may respond : ' for religious or cultural reasons ? '
that 's comparable to the way many christians feel who may go to church to look at art or attend a wedding .
there 's an infinite number of hybrid forms and milieus of islam , and from one generation to another muslims themselves will - hopefully - adapt more and more to european civilization as they did and still do in the us . " culture is constantly in flux , and demographic changes , of course , bring cultural shifts with them .
but a " host " culture being taken over by a monolithic foreign group , say experts , is one thing neither americans nor germans need to fear . author : jefferson chase editor : rob mudge send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

here , too , he was known for his extreme convictions . a german church founded and formerly led by terry jones , the american pastor who international attracted attention with controversial plans to stage a koran-burning ceremony , expressly denounced those plans on wednesday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jones ' former church is ' deeply disturbed ' by their former leader stephan baar , deputy chairman of the christliche gemeinde koeln -lrb- cgd -rrb- , the christian community of cologne , told deutsche welle that jones preached a strict , even fundamental understanding of the bible , but that no direct comparisons could be drawn between his sermons there and the radical views he is currently espousing at his new church .
" we want to make it clear that our church is opposed to what terry jones is advocating at the moment and that the cgd , even though he is the founder , has no more contact with him , " baar said .
the community asked him to leave in 2008 .
baar insisted that there were no controversies surrounding his departure .
" he just left ; we did not witness any of the deeply disturbing things we are seeing now .
pastor terry jones was placing too much emphasis on himself and distracting our members from their christian faiths .
he and our church simply went their separate ways . "
' gate to hell ' brigitte baetz , a cologne journalist who is a regular contributor on german public radio , said jones espoused radical christian views while at the helm of the cgd .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protests against the actions have begun in kabul baetz told deutsche welle that jones commonly referred to the city of cologne as a " gate to hell " and emphasized that christians were " persecuted " there and took on the role of " innocent victims who would be rewarded for their suffering . "
" in his sermons terry jones often convinced the members that they were made to suffer hardships because they were part of the cgd .
he said again and again that the members were the victims of persecution and that it led to them losing their jobs and social status , for instance . "
baetz said that jones ' sermons bordered on fundamentalist interpretations of the bible .
she singled out his vehement opposition to cologne plans to construct a mosque in the city as an example of his extremist views .
" terry jones saw religion as wrong and right .
he told his followers here in germany that christians , and especially members of his cgd , were the only ones who were right .
this is the basis , i believe , for what he is doing right now with his new church in florida , " baetz said .
us unable to prevent controversial burning leading figures around the globe have expressed fears that jones ' planned " international burn a koran day " could seriously strain relations between muslims and the west .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : petraeus said jones would provide propaganda for rebels david petraeus , the top us and nato commander in afghanistan , warned that " burning the holy book of islam provides propaganda for insurgents and could endanger the -lsb- alliance 's -rsb- overall effort . "
petraeus ' comments were echoed later by nato secretary general anders fogh rasmussen .
in response to petraeus ' words of caution , meanwhile , jones said on tuesday : " why do n't we send a warning to them ?
why do n't we send a warning to radical islam and say , ' do n't do it ? '
if you attack us , if you attack us , we will attack you . "
the united states government appears unable to prevent jones ' september 11 commemoration plans on saturday .
although florida fire authorities have turned down jones ' application to stage the open-air burning ceremony , police will not be allowed to intervene until the korans have actually been lit .

he won the nobel prize in the year 1985 for the discovery of the quantum hall effect .
now i suppose after getting the prize you were probably pretty busy .
how long did it take until you could really get back to research ? klaus von klitzing : i am always in the laboratory , so if i am at home it 's about 50 percent of my time .
no , i am always in the laboratory .
i have a big group of young students .
and i always have to be able to tell new things in order to attend conferences , so i need new material .
therefore , i need to do research and this is the most important thing .
to keep up with modern research . but life probably changed after winning the nobel prize .
i mean your opinion is now important to everybody . yes , that 's one problem .
you have to say something in fields where you are not a specialist .
so you know something about physics and you have to say something about global warming .
it 's also related to physics , but also nuclear energy , weapons , all kinds of things .
so this is much more difficult .
but you have a lot of connections to people where you can rely on their opinion and you can get some information .
and you have to do something for the public , to say this is the right direction , in my opinion , but even nobel laureates they disagree sometimes in certain fields .
and this is an interesting point to have this discussion , to have a broad range of opinion and then to find the truth . what do you think distinguishes a nobel prize laureate ?
what is so special about you ? special is that unlike with politicians , many people believe that what you are saying is the absolute truth .
to a certain degree it 's true , but we do n't know everything .
but to a certain extent you can influence the public .
this is some extra burden also because suddenly you discover that what you are saying translates as one to one .
and sometimes it 's dangerous because as a scientist you do n't always have a fixed opinion about all things .
it 's floating , you are learning all the time .
so this is a burden to all of the laureates . f rom about 802 nobel prize laureates , we 've had only about 40 women .
do you have an explanation for that ? yes , it 's always more difficult for women in some cultures.in other countries in islamic countries in jordan there were more than 50 percent of phyics students who were female .
and if you go to france even , they also have more female scientists .
so it 's got something to do with the environment with the conditions , with the tradition , what is a family .
and i think that we have to learn something in germany about how to support female scientists .
to have an environment where they can continue their research .
because if you are away for three years in research , you lose contact with the top scientific questions .
so therefore you have to find some solutions , so you can combine both : a family and science .

no , i am always in the laboratory .
i have a big group of young students .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de demographics -pipe- 08.09.2010 ' the smart ones all want to leave ' großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : about 150 apartments are demolished every year twenty years after unification , the country 's east is a radically different place .
structural changes have left urban populations in decline , and the brightest inhabitants are usually the first to go . right on germany 's eastern border the town of schwedt overlooks the river oder .
in the 1960s , this was a boom town : people moved here in tens of thousands to work in the local oil refinery .
but since reunification that trend has been radically reversed .
the pr assistant in schwedt town hall insists that the mayor himself will answer any questions .
" urban restructuring is a matter for the boss , " she says .
sure enough , the mayor , juergen polzehl , a gray-haired man in his mid-50s , invites me to go for a ride with him in his official car .
he tells the chauffeur to drive us to the kuelz district .
on the way there we pass row upon row of prefabricated apartment blocks - a legacy of the final , brief heyday of the uckermark regional municipality .
the town 's population swelled to 52,000 after the refinery was built , and housing had to be created for all the new arrivals .
rapid decline in population bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mayor polzehl says schwedt has spent billions of euros on urban restructuring then came german reunification .
workers at the refinery were laid off .
in the past 20 years , 20,000 people have moved away from schwedt .
at one time thousands of apartments stood empty .
" we had to respond to the situation , " says polzehl , pointing out of the window .
suddenly the buildings are interrupted by a wide , uneven open space .
" all this was apartment blocks , one after another .
now it 's all been returned to nature , " polzehl explains .
for a while they were demolishing as many as a thousand apartments in a year in schwedt .
now , polzehl says , it 's about 150 per year : the contraction of the town is gradually becoming more manageable .
billions of euros have been spent on urban restructuring .
demolition , reconstruction and reforestation help alleviate the sadness of the shrinking towns , but the alteration of the demographic has had a lasting effect on the makeup of the population .
polzehl is particularly concerned that so many young women have moved away .
this is a problem for many of the regions - and it has led to a severe shortage of young women in the new federal states .
the newspaper die welt reports that , in the 25-30 age bracket , in the east there are only 85 women for every 100 men .
polzehl remains optimistic .
" perhaps that will change if we locate a few businesses here and a local authority office .
that 'll improve the job situation , " he says , hopefully .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the oil refinery was once the city 's largest employer brain drain the mayor has set himself a considerable challenge .
conditions here , as in many parts of eastern germany , are not good .
the unemployment figure for the country as a whole is less than eight percent , but the east is struggling with more than 12 percent unemployment .
in schwedt it is even higher at 16 percent .
more efficient production methods and the closing or relocation of industry have greatly reduced the number of jobs available in the east .
those who are able to leave , do .
salaries , too , are higher in the west .
the young , the intelligent and the educated are leading the exodus , leaving behind the old and those described by despairing employers as " barely trainable . "
in an interview with the berliner zeitung in 2004 , ulf matthiesen , a researcher in area studies , described them as " unemployed urban idiots with no family ties and no prospect of forming a relationship . "
in parts of brandenburg and mecklenburg-western pomerania the number of pupils dropping out of school is 50 percent higher than the national average .
more than 10 percent leave school early , according to heike liebmann , head of the city regeneration department at the leibniz institute for regional development .
she describes this as an indication of the degree to which the general level of education among the local population has fallen .
furthermore , the fewer creative and enterprising people there are in public life , the less attractive the prospect of staying here becomes for those left behind .
it 's a vicious circle .
every year , ruediger ober-bloebaum resigns himself to seeing more of schwedt 's bright young people move away .
the stocky 50-year-old is the headmaster of the town 's last remaining high school .
last summer 103 pupils graduated , but he says : " of these , only seven are staying in schwedt .
the others are all going away to study or start an apprenticeship , and only 10 of those think they might come back . "
ober-bloebaum supposes schwedt is too quiet for them ; there 's just not enough going on there .
but there 's another problem , too .
he refers to a 2007 study by the berlin institute for population and development which suggested " that the girls are leaving because they find the boys here too stupid . "
wild , wild east bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : large parts of schwedt are returning to nature before unification in 1990 , then-chancellor helmut kohl spoke of the prospect of " landscapes in bloom . "

structural changes have left urban populations in decline , and the brightest inhabitants are usually the first to go . right on germany 's eastern border the town of schwedt overlooks the river oder .
in the 1960s , this was a boom town : people moved here in tens of thousands to work in the local oil refinery .
but since reunification that trend has been radically reversed .
the pr assistant in schwedt town hall insists that the mayor himself will answer any questions .
" urban restructuring is a matter for the boss , " she says .
sure enough , the mayor , juergen polzehl , a gray-haired man in his mid-50s , invites me to go for a ride with him in his official car .
he tells the chauffeur to drive us to the kuelz district .
on the way there we pass row upon row of prefabricated apartment blocks - a legacy of the final , brief heyday of the uckermark regional municipality .
the town 's population swelled to 52,000 after the refinery was built , and housing had to be created for all the new arrivals .
rapid decline in population bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mayor polzehl says schwedt has spent billions of euros on urban restructuring then came german reunification .
workers at the refinery were laid off .
in the past 20 years , 20,000 people have moved away from schwedt .
at one time thousands of apartments stood empty .
" we had to respond to the situation , " says polzehl , pointing out of the window .
suddenly the buildings are interrupted by a wide , uneven open space .
" all this was apartment blocks , one after another .
now it 's all been returned to nature , " polzehl explains .
for a while they were demolishing as many as a thousand apartments in a year in schwedt .
now , polzehl says , it 's about 150 per year : the contraction of the town is gradually becoming more manageable .
billions of euros have been spent on urban restructuring .
demolition , reconstruction and reforestation help alleviate the sadness of the shrinking towns , but the alteration of the demographic has had a lasting effect on the makeup of the population .
polzehl is particularly concerned that so many young women have moved away .
this is a problem for many of the regions - and it has led to a severe shortage of young women in the new federal states .
the newspaper die welt reports that , in the 25-30 age bracket , in the east there are only 85 women for every 100 men .
polzehl remains optimistic .
" perhaps that will change if we locate a few businesses here and a local authority office .
that 'll improve the job situation , " he says , hopefully .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the oil refinery was once the city 's largest employer brain drain the mayor has set himself a considerable challenge .
conditions here , as in many parts of eastern germany , are not good .
the unemployment figure for the country as a whole is less than eight percent , but the east is struggling with more than 12 percent unemployment .
in schwedt it is even higher at 16 percent .
more efficient production methods and the closing or relocation of industry have greatly reduced the number of jobs available in the east .
those who are able to leave , do .
salaries , too , are higher in the west .
the young , the intelligent and the educated are leading the exodus , leaving behind the old and those described by despairing employers as " barely trainable . "
in an interview with the berliner zeitung in 2004 , ulf matthiesen , a researcher in area studies , described them as " unemployed urban idiots with no family ties and no prospect of forming a relationship . "
in parts of brandenburg and mecklenburg-western pomerania the number of pupils dropping out of school is 50 percent higher than the national average .
more than 10 percent leave school early , according to heike liebmann , head of the city regeneration department at the leibniz institute for regional development .
she describes this as an indication of the degree to which the general level of education among the local population has fallen .
furthermore , the fewer creative and enterprising people there are in public life , the less attractive the prospect of staying here becomes for those left behind .
it 's a vicious circle .
every year , ruediger ober-bloebaum resigns himself to seeing more of schwedt 's bright young people move away .
the stocky 50-year-old is the headmaster of the town 's last remaining high school .
last summer 103 pupils graduated , but he says : " of these , only seven are staying in schwedt .
the others are all going away to study or start an apprenticeship , and only 10 of those think they might come back . "
ober-bloebaum supposes schwedt is too quiet for them ; there 's just not enough going on there .
but there 's another problem , too .
he refers to a 2007 study by the berlin institute for population and development which suggested " that the girls are leaving because they find the boys here too stupid . "
wild , wild east bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : large parts of schwedt are returning to nature before unification in 1990 , then-chancellor helmut kohl spoke of the prospect of " landscapes in bloom . "
he used the term as a metaphor for the economic development of the east , but in recent years regional planners have suggested it should be taken literally .
they have proposed returning parts of eastern germany to nature .
liebmann says it 's hard to imagine how the movement of people could be controlled in such a process , but she adds that " it is certainly useful for society to consider whether it can afford to maintain the existing infrastructure in areas that are becoming less densely populated . "

structural changes have left urban populations in decline , and the brightest inhabitants are usually the first to go . right on germany 's eastern border the town of schwedt overlooks the river oder .
in the 1960s , this was a boom town : people moved here in tens of thousands to work in the local oil refinery .
but since reunification that trend has been radically reversed .
the pr assistant in schwedt town hall insists that the mayor himself will answer any questions .
" urban restructuring is a matter for the boss , " she says .
sure enough , the mayor , juergen polzehl , a gray-haired man in his mid-50s , invites me to go for a ride with him in his official car .
he tells the chauffeur to drive us to the kuelz district .
on the way there we pass row upon row of prefabricated apartment blocks - a legacy of the final , brief heyday of the uckermark regional municipality .
the town 's population swelled to 52,000 after the refinery was built , and housing had to be created for all the new arrivals .
rapid decline in population bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mayor polzehl says schwedt has spent billions of euros on urban restructuring then came german reunification .
workers at the refinery were laid off .
in the past 20 years , 20,000 people have moved away from schwedt .
at one time thousands of apartments stood empty .
" we had to respond to the situation , " says polzehl , pointing out of the window .
suddenly the buildings are interrupted by a wide , uneven open space .
" all this was apartment blocks , one after another .
now it 's all been returned to nature , " polzehl explains .
for a while they were demolishing as many as a thousand apartments in a year in schwedt .
now , polzehl says , it 's about 150 per year : the contraction of the town is gradually becoming more manageable .
billions of euros have been spent on urban restructuring .
demolition , reconstruction and reforestation help alleviate the sadness of the shrinking towns , but the alteration of the demographic has had a lasting effect on the makeup of the population .
polzehl is particularly concerned that so many young women have moved away .
this is a problem for many of the regions - and it has led to a severe shortage of young women in the new federal states .
the newspaper die welt reports that , in the 25-30 age bracket , in the east there are only 85 women for every 100 men .
polzehl remains optimistic .
" perhaps that will change if we locate a few businesses here and a local authority office .
that 'll improve the job situation , " he says , hopefully .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the oil refinery was once the city 's largest employer brain drain the mayor has set himself a considerable challenge .
conditions here , as in many parts of eastern germany , are not good .
the unemployment figure for the country as a whole is less than eight percent , but the east is struggling with more than 12 percent unemployment .
in schwedt it is even higher at 16 percent .
more efficient production methods and the closing or relocation of industry have greatly reduced the number of jobs available in the east .
those who are able to leave , do .
salaries , too , are higher in the west .
the young , the intelligent and the educated are leading the exodus , leaving behind the old and those described by despairing employers as " barely trainable . "
in an interview with the berliner zeitung in 2004 , ulf matthiesen , a researcher in area studies , described them as " unemployed urban idiots with no family ties and no prospect of forming a relationship . "
in parts of brandenburg and mecklenburg-western pomerania the number of pupils dropping out of school is 50 percent higher than the national average .
more than 10 percent leave school early , according to heike liebmann , head of the city regeneration department at the leibniz institute for regional development .
she describes this as an indication of the degree to which the general level of education among the local population has fallen .
furthermore , the fewer creative and enterprising people there are in public life , the less attractive the prospect of staying here becomes for those left behind .
it 's a vicious circle .
every year , ruediger ober-bloebaum resigns himself to seeing more of schwedt 's bright young people move away .
the stocky 50-year-old is the headmaster of the town 's last remaining high school .
last summer 103 pupils graduated , but he says : " of these , only seven are staying in schwedt .
the others are all going away to study or start an apprenticeship , and only 10 of those think they might come back . "
ober-bloebaum supposes schwedt is too quiet for them ; there 's just not enough going on there .
but there 's another problem , too .
he refers to a 2007 study by the berlin institute for population and development which suggested " that the girls are leaving because they find the boys here too stupid . "
wild , wild east bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : large parts of schwedt are returning to nature before unification in 1990 , then-chancellor helmut kohl spoke of the prospect of " landscapes in bloom . "
he used the term as a metaphor for the economic development of the east , but in recent years regional planners have suggested it should be taken literally .
they have proposed returning parts of eastern germany to nature .
liebmann says it 's hard to imagine how the movement of people could be controlled in such a process , but she adds that " it is certainly useful for society to consider whether it can afford to maintain the existing infrastructure in areas that are becoming less densely populated . "
polzehl is dismissive of such ideas .
" we ca n't just let all this become a jungle .
we have our roots here ; this is our home . "
and schwedt still has good things to offer .
it is responsible for 15 percent of the industrial production of the state of brandenburg , and germany 's only meadowland national park is right next door .
on the way back to the town hall , mayor polzehl draws encouragement from his own life story .
" i moved away too , when i was young , " he says .
" and now i 'm back again . "

now , 20 years on , germany has been fully accepted by its european neighbors . it was in january 1990 , during a walk along the french atlantic coast , that the then-chancellor helmut kohl convinced french president francois mitterrand to support german unification .
mitterrand was skeptical at first , but kohl persuaded him by pledging his commitment to european integration .
with france on board , helmut kohl had the backing of germany 's most important european neighbor .
french sentiment had normalized in a way that it had not done to the same degree in britain and the united states , says french political theorist and journalist alfred grosser .
" with a few exceptions , french opinion polls show that people here saw the germans as friends .
they thought it perfectly natural that the two states should become one again , " he said .
indeed , kohl did not have the same success with his british colleague , prime minister margaret thatcher .
she opposed a unified germany ; but she was replaced as british leader in november 1990 by her fellow conservative party member john major .
germany furthered european integration bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kohl 's passion about european integration convinced mitterrand kohl promised that germany would maintain the european union course of greater integration , which he reaffirmed a year later : " unified germany does not want a return to the europe of yesterday , " he declared to the bundestag .
" there can been no revival of old rivalries and nationalisms .
we want a new europe - one that does not suppress our national identity , one in which countries no longer oppose one another , where no nation stands in the shadow of another , but -lsb- a europe -rsb- in which , together , we can guarantee a future in peace and freedom , prosperity and security . "
over the 20 years since reunification , german governments of all political colors have upheld kohl 's promise : germany championed the admission of the former east bloc states into the eu ; it paid for the eu 's eastward expansion , and the germans gave up their currency , the deutschmark , for the euro . '
german unity signifies european unity ' the reservations many of germany 's neighbors still harbored about the country they had fought in world war ii gradually disappeared .
belgium , for example , had no qualms about germany 's increased size , according to political scientist dirk rochtus of lessius hogeschool university college in antwerp .
" german unity also signifies european unity , " he said .
" that was clear to us here in belgium .
if the two german nations come together again , it also signifies that we have overcome the division of europe .
we see that as a good thing . "
the older generation , which had lived through the german occupation of belgium , did have doubts though .
" naturally there are older people who still have memories of that time , " rochtus said .
" but generally it has to be said that the response has been quite matter-of-fact - and also that we make a distinction between a people , in this case the german people , and the regime that governed this people and headed the occupation regime in belgium .
we make a very big distinction between the two . "
poles and czechs skeptical germany 's neighbors to the east , poland and the czech republic , also had many initial reservations .
after the political upheaval they had experienced , poles realized that germany no longer made any claims on their country and that the german government was serious about european unity , according to janusz reiter , poland 's former ambassador to bonn -lrb- 1990-1995 -rrb- .
" nowadays , germany 's size is no reason for its neighbors to be afraid , " he said .
" the relationship between germany and poland is still not entirely free of ambivalence and tensions , but for different reasons . "
poles are well aware of germany 's economic strength , and are keen to go to their western neighbor to earn money , he added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poles like andrzej stasiuk remain cautious when it comes to germany but there are limits , according to polish author andrzej stasiuk .
" very few poles would think of going to germany on holiday , " he said .
" you do n't go to germany for fun . "
in a recent article for german magazine focus , stasiuk wrote : " germany is not to be taken for granted ; germany is equivocal .
you have to keep your eyes on germany . "
prague-based political scientist robert schuster believes that until the end of the 1990s czechs were afraid of germany - and of the possibility that germans expelled after world war ii might make claims against them .
tensions between the two only started to ease after they signed a joint declaration in 1998 .
the declaration addressed the wounds of the past , as well as crimes committed during and after world war ii ; and it also highlighted perspectives for a joint future .
" the two countries are not competing anymore , " schuster said .
" they are no longer enemies , but members of a community , the eu .
and members of nato .
this aspect of security policy should not be underestimated . "
and he added that young czechs - who have had the opportunity to travel to germany , to study there and meet germans of their own age - have a completely different image of germans to that of the generation aged 50 and over .
football instigated the breakthrough the netherlands , luxembourg , switzerland and austria at first held back , but then gave their approval to german unification .
today , the spending power of german tourists means they are more popular than ever in their neighboring countries , although opinion polls suggest that germans themselves do n't quite believe this .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 2006 world cup showed a side of the country that many had not seen before " we ca n't tell the difference any more between ossis and wessis - that is , germans from the former east or west , " said austrian historian oliver radkolb .
and germany 's northern neighbor , denmark , has also accepted the new , larger germany , according to danish writer knud romer .
for decades danes regarded the germans as a nation of perpetrators , as did many other people in europe , he pointed out .
the breakthrough came with the soccer world cup , which germany hosted in 2006 , he added .
" that was when i realized , for the first time , that the war was over .
finished .
there 's none of that anymore , " romer said .
" and the danes were cheering the germans on . "

now , 20 years on , germany has been fully accepted by its european neighbors . it was in january 1990 , during a walk along the french atlantic coast , that the then-chancellor helmut kohl convinced french president francois mitterrand to support german unification .
mitterrand was skeptical at first , but kohl persuaded him by pledging his commitment to european integration .
with france on board , helmut kohl had the backing of germany 's most important european neighbor .
french sentiment had normalized in a way that it had not done to the same degree in britain and the united states , says french political theorist and journalist alfred grosser .
" with a few exceptions , french opinion polls show that people here saw the germans as friends .
they thought it perfectly natural that the two states should become one again , " he said .
indeed , kohl did not have the same success with his british colleague , prime minister margaret thatcher .
she opposed a unified germany ; but she was replaced as british leader in november 1990 by her fellow conservative party member john major .
germany furthered european integration bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kohl 's passion about european integration convinced mitterrand kohl promised that germany would maintain the european union course of greater integration , which he reaffirmed a year later : " unified germany does not want a return to the europe of yesterday , " he declared to the bundestag .
" there can been no revival of old rivalries and nationalisms .
we want a new europe - one that does not suppress our national identity , one in which countries no longer oppose one another , where no nation stands in the shadow of another , but -lsb- a europe -rsb- in which , together , we can guarantee a future in peace and freedom , prosperity and security . "
over the 20 years since reunification , german governments of all political colors have upheld kohl 's promise : germany championed the admission of the former east bloc states into the eu ; it paid for the eu 's eastward expansion , and the germans gave up their currency , the deutschmark , for the euro . '
german unity signifies european unity ' the reservations many of germany 's neighbors still harbored about the country they had fought in world war ii gradually disappeared .
belgium , for example , had no qualms about germany 's increased size , according to political scientist dirk rochtus of lessius hogeschool university college in antwerp .
" german unity also signifies european unity , " he said .
" that was clear to us here in belgium .
if the two german nations come together again , it also signifies that we have overcome the division of europe .
we see that as a good thing . "
the older generation , which had lived through the german occupation of belgium , did have doubts though .
" naturally there are older people who still have memories of that time , " rochtus said .
" but generally it has to be said that the response has been quite matter-of-fact - and also that we make a distinction between a people , in this case the german people , and the regime that governed this people and headed the occupation regime in belgium .
we make a very big distinction between the two . "

now , 20 years on , germany has been fully accepted by its european neighbors . it was in january 1990 , during a walk along the french atlantic coast , that the then-chancellor helmut kohl convinced french president francois mitterrand to support german unification .
mitterrand was skeptical at first , but kohl persuaded him by pledging his commitment to european integration .
with france on board , helmut kohl had the backing of germany 's most important european neighbor .
french sentiment had normalized in a way that it had not done to the same degree in britain and the united states , says french political theorist and journalist alfred grosser .
" with a few exceptions , french opinion polls show that people here saw the germans as friends .
they thought it perfectly natural that the two states should become one again , " he said .
indeed , kohl did not have the same success with his british colleague , prime minister margaret thatcher .
she opposed a unified germany ; but she was replaced as british leader in november 1990 by her fellow conservative party member john major .
germany furthered european integration bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kohl 's passion about european integration convinced mitterrand kohl promised that germany would maintain the european union course of greater integration , which he reaffirmed a year later : " unified germany does not want a return to the europe of yesterday , " he declared to the bundestag .
" there can been no revival of old rivalries and nationalisms .
we want a new europe - one that does not suppress our national identity , one in which countries no longer oppose one another , where no nation stands in the shadow of another , but -lsb- a europe -rsb- in which , together , we can guarantee a future in peace and freedom , prosperity and security . "
over the 20 years since reunification , german governments of all political colors have upheld kohl 's promise : germany championed the admission of the former east bloc states into the eu ; it paid for the eu 's eastward expansion , and the germans gave up their currency , the deutschmark , for the euro . '
german unity signifies european unity ' the reservations many of germany 's neighbors still harbored about the country they had fought in world war ii gradually disappeared .
belgium , for example , had no qualms about germany 's increased size , according to political scientist dirk rochtus of lessius hogeschool university college in antwerp .
" german unity also signifies european unity , " he said .
" that was clear to us here in belgium .
if the two german nations come together again , it also signifies that we have overcome the division of europe .
we see that as a good thing . "
the older generation , which had lived through the german occupation of belgium , did have doubts though .
" naturally there are older people who still have memories of that time , " rochtus said .
" but generally it has to be said that the response has been quite matter-of-fact - and also that we make a distinction between a people , in this case the german people , and the regime that governed this people and headed the occupation regime in belgium .
we make a very big distinction between the two . "
poles and czechs skeptical germany 's neighbors to the east , poland and the czech republic , also had many initial reservations .
after the political upheaval they had experienced , poles realized that germany no longer made any claims on their country and that the german government was serious about european unity , according to janusz reiter , poland 's former ambassador to bonn -lrb- 1990-1995 -rrb- .
" nowadays , germany 's size is no reason for its neighbors to be afraid , " he said .
" the relationship between germany and poland is still not entirely free of ambivalence and tensions , but for different reasons . "
poles are well aware of germany 's economic strength , and are keen to go to their western neighbor to earn money , he added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poles like andrzej stasiuk remain cautious when it comes to germany but there are limits , according to polish author andrzej stasiuk .
" very few poles would think of going to germany on holiday , " he said .
" you do n't go to germany for fun . "
in a recent article for german magazine focus , stasiuk wrote : " germany is not to be taken for granted ; germany is equivocal .
you have to keep your eyes on germany . "
prague-based political scientist robert schuster believes that until the end of the 1990s czechs were afraid of germany - and of the possibility that germans expelled after world war ii might make claims against them .
tensions between the two only started to ease after they signed a joint declaration in 1998 .
the declaration addressed the wounds of the past , as well as crimes committed during and after world war ii ; and it also highlighted perspectives for a joint future .
" the two countries are not competing anymore , " schuster said .
" they are no longer enemies , but members of a community , the eu .
and members of nato .
this aspect of security policy should not be underestimated . "
and he added that young czechs - who have had the opportunity to travel to germany , to study there and meet germans of their own age - have a completely different image of germans to that of the generation aged 50 and over .
football instigated the breakthrough the netherlands , luxembourg , switzerland and austria at first held back , but then gave their approval to german unification .
today , the spending power of german tourists means they are more popular than ever in their neighboring countries , although opinion polls suggest that germans themselves do n't quite believe this .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 2006 world cup showed a side of the country that many had not seen before " we ca n't tell the difference any more between ossis and wessis - that is , germans from the former east or west , " said austrian historian oliver radkolb .
and germany 's northern neighbor , denmark , has also accepted the new , larger germany , according to danish writer knud romer .
for decades danes regarded the germans as a nation of perpetrators , as did many other people in europe , he pointed out .
the breakthrough came with the soccer world cup , which germany hosted in 2006 , he added .
" that was when i realized , for the first time , that the war was over .
finished .
there 's none of that anymore , " romer said .
" and the danes were cheering the germans on . "

mitterrand was skeptical at first , but kohl persuaded him by pledging his commitment to european integration .
with france on board , helmut kohl had the backing of germany 's most important european neighbor .
french sentiment had normalized in a way that it had not done to the same degree in britain and the united states , says french political theorist and journalist alfred grosser .
" with a few exceptions , french opinion polls show that people here saw the germans as friends .
they thought it perfectly natural that the two states should become one again , " he said .
indeed , kohl did not have the same success with his british colleague , prime minister margaret thatcher .
she opposed a unified germany ; but she was replaced as british leader in november 1990 by her fellow conservative party member john major .
germany furthered european integration bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kohl 's passion about european integration convinced mitterrand kohl promised that germany would maintain the european union course of greater integration , which he reaffirmed a year later : " unified germany does not want a return to the europe of yesterday , " he declared to the bundestag .
" there can been no revival of old rivalries and nationalisms .
we want a new europe - one that does not suppress our national identity , one in which countries no longer oppose one another , where no nation stands in the shadow of another , but -lsb- a europe -rsb- in which , together , we can guarantee a future in peace and freedom , prosperity and security . "
over the 20 years since reunification , german governments of all political colors have upheld kohl 's promise : germany championed the admission of the former east bloc states into the eu ; it paid for the eu 's eastward expansion , and the germans gave up their currency , the deutschmark , for the euro . '
german unity signifies european unity ' the reservations many of germany 's neighbors still harbored about the country they had fought in world war ii gradually disappeared .
belgium , for example , had no qualms about germany 's increased size , according to political scientist dirk rochtus of lessius hogeschool university college in antwerp .
" german unity also signifies european unity , " he said .
" that was clear to us here in belgium .
if the two german nations come together again , it also signifies that we have overcome the division of europe .
we see that as a good thing . "
the older generation , which had lived through the german occupation of belgium , did have doubts though .
" naturally there are older people who still have memories of that time , " rochtus said .
" but generally it has to be said that the response has been quite matter-of-fact - and also that we make a distinction between a people , in this case the german people , and the regime that governed this people and headed the occupation regime in belgium .
we make a very big distinction between the two . "
poles and czechs skeptical germany 's neighbors to the east , poland and the czech republic , also had many initial reservations .
after the political upheaval they had experienced , poles realized that germany no longer made any claims on their country and that the german government was serious about european unity , according to janusz reiter , poland 's former ambassador to bonn -lrb- 1990-1995 -rrb- .
" nowadays , germany 's size is no reason for its neighbors to be afraid , " he said .
" the relationship between germany and poland is still not entirely free of ambivalence and tensions , but for different reasons . "
poles are well aware of germany 's economic strength , and are keen to go to their western neighbor to earn money , he added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poles like andrzej stasiuk remain cautious when it comes to germany but there are limits , according to polish author andrzej stasiuk .
" very few poles would think of going to germany on holiday , " he said .
" you do n't go to germany for fun . "
in a recent article for german magazine focus , stasiuk wrote : " germany is not to be taken for granted ; germany is equivocal .
you have to keep your eyes on germany . "
prague-based political scientist robert schuster believes that until the end of the 1990s czechs were afraid of germany - and of the possibility that germans expelled after world war ii might make claims against them .
tensions between the two only started to ease after they signed a joint declaration in 1998 .
the declaration addressed the wounds of the past , as well as crimes committed during and after world war ii ; and it also highlighted perspectives for a joint future .
" the two countries are not competing anymore , " schuster said .
" they are no longer enemies , but members of a community , the eu .
and members of nato .
this aspect of security policy should not be underestimated . "
and he added that young czechs - who have had the opportunity to travel to germany , to study there and meet germans of their own age - have a completely different image of germans to that of the generation aged 50 and over .
football instigated the breakthrough the netherlands , luxembourg , switzerland and austria at first held back , but then gave their approval to german unification .
today , the spending power of german tourists means they are more popular than ever in their neighboring countries , although opinion polls suggest that germans themselves do n't quite believe this .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 2006 world cup showed a side of the country that many had not seen before " we ca n't tell the difference any more between ossis and wessis - that is , germans from the former east or west , " said austrian historian oliver radkolb .
and germany 's northern neighbor , denmark , has also accepted the new , larger germany , according to danish writer knud romer .
for decades danes regarded the germans as a nation of perpetrators , as did many other people in europe , he pointed out .
the breakthrough came with the soccer world cup , which germany hosted in 2006 , he added .
" that was when i realized , for the first time , that the war was over .
finished .
there 's none of that anymore , " romer said .
" and the danes were cheering the germans on . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de art -pipe- 08.09.2010 photographer explores beauty among women prisoners großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the women were asked how prison life had changed them a photographer in cologne has taken female inmates as the subjects of his work - a tall order , given penitentiary security .
the artist asked the women to describe what " beauty " meant to them in everyday prison life . it sounds rather macabre or , at the very least , a contradiction in terms - asking female prisoners to address the notion of beauty .
russian photographer igor chepikov , who has been living in cologne , germany since 1991 , visited a women 's penitentiary weekly for over 10 months .
there , after splashing a wall in white paint to serve as a backdrop , he took thousands pictures of some of the inmates .
those snapshots were ultimately distilled into a selection of just 56 photographs that compose the exhibition called " bad ossendorf : women in prison " now on show in cologne . the title is a play on words .
" bad " in front of the name a place normally refers to a spa town in german .
" ossendorf " is the name of the penitentiary outside of cologne .
" bad ossendorf , " then , could be translated as " resort ossendorf , " but is intended to also imply english connotations , as in " bad love , bad money , bad company . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the photographer took 24 pictures of each participant however one chooses to view the name , the subject of the exhibition - women in prison confronted with the topic of " beauty " - sounds like it 's begging for feminist critique .
after all , many of the female prisoners have more existential issues to address than philosophical matters like the definition of beauty .
they are worried about their children , who are now sitting in orphanages .
they are dismayed about the pain they have caused their relatives .
they want to liberate themselves from a vicious circle of crime . the photographer chepikov , at least , gave space to the women 's voices - choosing not just to display his photographs of them , but also to literally frame their " narratives . "
the photographer asked the women to answer certain questions in written form - to describe what beauty meant to them , if they felt they had lost time in prison , what effect prison had had on their bodies and souls ? some of the answers : " the feeling of loneliness is the worst . "
" i never thought prison could make a person look so bad . "
" there is no place to buy make-up here , or any other kind of personal hygiene products . "
" once i saw the photos , i realized how horrible the effects of the drugs have been . "
" i wish i could turn back the clock . "
" for me , ' beauty ' here in the prison essentially means being clean . " deutsche welle spoke with the photographer , igor chepikov , to get his take on " women in prison . " deutsche welle : why these photographs of women in prison ? why did you choose to do this ? igor chepikov : i came up with the idea about six years ago .
i was sitting in the moscow subway , and was looking out of the windows and thinking about the song " as time goes by . "
and then , i started reading something about prisons and got to thinking about what life is like in prisons .
a man , for instance , could be 20 years old and get 15 years in jail , but he 's only 35 when he gets out .
but when he 's 45 and gets out of prison -lsb- 15 years later -rsb- , he 's 60 .
life is over for him , and he has no possibility to change .
for women , it 's even harder - not only can they not adapt at that age , they have also lost their beauty .
i realized that i should take pictures of them before that happens . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some of the women spiffed themselves up for the photo sessions is n't that kind of loaded , this idea of women and beauty and prison ? i 'm not sure - that 's what i wanted to figure out : ' is it problematic for women , or not ? '
the prison administration was doubtful - they did n't think any of the women would want to present themselves in an exhibition , which is what my intention was from the start .
but 15 women wanted to participate , and that was a green light for my project from the get-go . what do you think the motivation was for these women to take part ? life in prison is quite boring .
participating in the project was almost like vacation - a departure from everyday life - for the women , who often sit for 23 hours a day in their cells .
for them , it was a connection to outside life . were n't the women ashamed to show themselves ? i 'm not sure .
they agreed to have their pictures taken .
some of the women were in prison for the second , third or fourth time .
one woman who agreed to take part had been free for a few months , then returned and said , ' hello , i 'm back , you can take more pictures of me . "
for her , it was like coming home again . do you have an example of one of the women 's stories , why she came to be in prison ? yes , i talked with the women , but their stories are supposed to remain private .
you can read the anonymous narratives hanging on the walls of the exhibition . some statistics show that women are victims themselves before they land in prison .
did you find that when you spoke with the women ? it was different .
you might find that in their narratives .
actually , a lot of these women were drug addicts , and many of them belong in a hospital or treatment center rather than a prison . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some felt the art project was an escape from everyday jail life what was one of the most difficult moments while you were photographing the women ? actually , it was beforehand - in convincing the prison administration to let me in .
they did n't really understand what i wanted and what my purpose was , but as soon as they got an idea of what i was aiming for - not criticizing the place , but just presenting the bit of beauty among the women in the prison - it was fine . how do you define beauty ? you have it or you do n't .
it 's not easily defined .
i can show it better than describe it in words .
each woman here in the exhibition has some form of beauty , even if it 's just something in her expression . is n't this a contrast , the idea of beauty and women in prison ? yes .
it 's difficult for people to imagine that women want to take care of themselves in jail , but many of the prisoners told me that it 's important to them , but they do n't have much of a chance to do that .
for the photo sessions , they made themselves up , had their hair cut . how did you try to make the women feel comfortable with you ? i brought cookies , cigarettes , tea .
and i talked with them - it was n't just a photo session with each , but also a chat . you trained as an architect , then switched to painting and finally , photography .
why ? i painted for 10 years - abstract painting .
but then i realized that there are just some things you can only capture in a moment , and i switched to photography .
my first photography project was in a slaughterhouse - i was impressed by the colors i could capture there , and the moment when life is extinguished .
you ca n't get this moment across in abstract paintings . do you think this project is political - the " women in prison " portraits ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some of the women said personal hygiene products are rare in prison no .
it 's human .
i do n't want to criticize anyone .
this is simply part of life , even if it 's scary at times . why women and not men ?
men can be beautiful too … because people think of women and not men when they hear the word beauty . you asked women to write some things down about beauty .
why ? because i wanted to know their opinions about the subject and not mine .
maybe they do n't think about it at all .

" berlin has a cluster for health care management , but has not managed to establish one for its creative industries , and that is a failure . "
he says that while establishing a cluster is not inherently easy , it could be done .

the artist asked the women to describe what " beauty " meant to them in everyday prison life . it sounds rather macabre or , at the very least , a contradiction in terms - asking female prisoners to address the notion of beauty .
russian photographer igor chepikov , who has been living in cologne , germany since 1991 , visited a women 's penitentiary weekly for over 10 months .
there , after splashing a wall in white paint to serve as a backdrop , he took thousands pictures of some of the inmates .
those snapshots were ultimately distilled into a selection of just 56 photographs that compose the exhibition called " bad ossendorf : women in prison " now on show in cologne . the title is a play on words .
" bad " in front of the name a place normally refers to a spa town in german .
" ossendorf " is the name of the penitentiary outside of cologne .
" bad ossendorf , " then , could be translated as " resort ossendorf , " but is intended to also imply english connotations , as in " bad love , bad money , bad company . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the photographer took 24 pictures of each participant however one chooses to view the name , the subject of the exhibition - women in prison confronted with the topic of " beauty " - sounds like it 's begging for feminist critique .
after all , many of the female prisoners have more existential issues to address than philosophical matters like the definition of beauty .
they are worried about their children , who are now sitting in orphanages .
they are dismayed about the pain they have caused their relatives .
they want to liberate themselves from a vicious circle of crime . the photographer chepikov , at least , gave space to the women 's voices - choosing not just to display his photographs of them , but also to literally frame their " narratives . "
the photographer asked the women to answer certain questions in written form - to describe what beauty meant to them , if they felt they had lost time in prison , what effect prison had had on their bodies and souls ? some of the answers : " the feeling of loneliness is the worst . "
" i never thought prison could make a person look so bad . "
" there is no place to buy make-up here , or any other kind of personal hygiene products . "
" once i saw the photos , i realized how horrible the effects of the drugs have been . "
" i wish i could turn back the clock . "
" for me , ' beauty ' here in the prison essentially means being clean . " deutsche welle spoke with the photographer , igor chepikov , to get his take on " women in prison . " deutsche welle : why these photographs of women in prison ? why did you choose to do this ? igor chepikov : i came up with the idea about six years ago .
i was sitting in the moscow subway , and was looking out of the windows and thinking about the song " as time goes by . "
and then , i started reading something about prisons and got to thinking about what life is like in prisons .
a man , for instance , could be 20 years old and get 15 years in jail , but he 's only 35 when he gets out .
but when he 's 45 and gets out of prison -lsb- 15 years later -rsb- , he 's 60 .
life is over for him , and he has no possibility to change .
for women , it 's even harder - not only can they not adapt at that age , they have also lost their beauty .
i realized that i should take pictures of them before that happens . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some of the women spiffed themselves up for the photo sessions is n't that kind of loaded , this idea of women and beauty and prison ? i 'm not sure - that 's what i wanted to figure out : ' is it problematic for women , or not ? '
the prison administration was doubtful - they did n't think any of the women would want to present themselves in an exhibition , which is what my intention was from the start .
but 15 women wanted to participate , and that was a green light for my project from the get-go . what do you think the motivation was for these women to take part ? life in prison is quite boring .
participating in the project was almost like vacation - a departure from everyday life - for the women , who often sit for 23 hours a day in their cells .
for them , it was a connection to outside life . were n't the women ashamed to show themselves ? i 'm not sure .
they agreed to have their pictures taken .
some of the women were in prison for the second , third or fourth time .
one woman who agreed to take part had been free for a few months , then returned and said , ' hello , i 'm back , you can take more pictures of me . "
for her , it was like coming home again . do you have an example of one of the women 's stories , why she came to be in prison ? yes , i talked with the women , but their stories are supposed to remain private .
you can read the anonymous narratives hanging on the walls of the exhibition . some statistics show that women are victims themselves before they land in prison .
did you find that when you spoke with the women ? it was different .
you might find that in their narratives .
actually , a lot of these women were drug addicts , and many of them belong in a hospital or treatment center rather than a prison . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some felt the art project was an escape from everyday jail life what was one of the most difficult moments while you were photographing the women ? actually , it was beforehand - in convincing the prison administration to let me in .
they did n't really understand what i wanted and what my purpose was , but as soon as they got an idea of what i was aiming for - not criticizing the place , but just presenting the bit of beauty among the women in the prison - it was fine . how do you define beauty ? you have it or you do n't .
it 's not easily defined .
i can show it better than describe it in words .
each woman here in the exhibition has some form of beauty , even if it 's just something in her expression . is n't this a contrast , the idea of beauty and women in prison ? yes .
it 's difficult for people to imagine that women want to take care of themselves in jail , but many of the prisoners told me that it 's important to them , but they do n't have much of a chance to do that .
for the photo sessions , they made themselves up , had their hair cut . how did you try to make the women feel comfortable with you ? i brought cookies , cigarettes , tea .
and i talked with them - it was n't just a photo session with each , but also a chat . you trained as an architect , then switched to painting and finally , photography .
why ? i painted for 10 years - abstract painting .
but then i realized that there are just some things you can only capture in a moment , and i switched to photography .
my first photography project was in a slaughterhouse - i was impressed by the colors i could capture there , and the moment when life is extinguished .
you ca n't get this moment across in abstract paintings . do you think this project is political - the " women in prison " portraits ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some of the women said personal hygiene products are rare in prison no .
it 's human .
i do n't want to criticize anyone .
this is simply part of life , even if it 's scary at times . why women and not men ?
men can be beautiful too … because people think of women and not men when they hear the word beauty . you asked women to write some things down about beauty .
why ? because i wanted to know their opinions about the subject and not mine .
maybe they do n't think about it at all .
but from the letters , i can tell they do .
life is tough in prison , and it leaves traces on people 's faces much more than among people who are free . when one reads the narratives , it 's clear that the women are also struggling with other problems , like their drug addiction , missing their children , their safety .
is n't it a luxury to be asking questions about beauty , when the women are facing much tougher issues ? i do n't really know . interview : louisa schaefer editor : kate bowen the exhibition at the neues kunstforum in cologne runs through sept .

the project helps parents with migrant backgrounds and their children improve their literacy skills through storytelling . four million of the more than 750 million illiterate people in the world live in germany , and a disproportionate number of them are immigrants or have an immigrant background .
the " family literacy " project -lrb- fly -rrb- focuses on that group , which makes up 14 percent of hamburg 's population , and for that reason it was singled out for unesco 's 2010 literacy award .
fly , a pilot project initiated and run by the hamburg state institute for teacher training and school development , uses an intergenerational approach to ensure closer cooperation and better communication between the school and the childrens ' home " it 's our goal to get the parents interested in reading more at home with their children and in engaging more strongly with language , " gabriele rabkin , the head of fly , told deutsche welle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an intergenerational approach benefits adults and children forty-four schools in hamburg participate in the program , which was started six years ago .
nearly 1,000 parents and as many children take part in the project every year .
parents welcome every two weeks , parents join their children , mainly preschoolers and first-graders , in the classroom .
they see how their kids engage with words and storytelling - and they 're allowed to help .
fly 's teachers encourage the adults to make sure their children speak in complete sentences outside of class , take time to look at picture books together or point out individual letters on the way to school .
ute stather , who teaches first and second graders at hamburg 's osterbrook school , has been with the project from the start .
" the parents see what we are doing and that helps them understand where they have to support their child , " she said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sometimes aunts , grandmothers and siblings join the classes the families are not discouraged from speaking their native language in class .
on the contrary , teachers view multilingualism as an asset , stather said .
" if people speak and read a lot in their native tongue , their children will also learn german much more easily . "
many of the parents also see fly classes as a chance to learn german , according to rabkin .
the teachers also do n't put pressure on the adults to read and speak in german with their children at home ; what was important was for them to deal with language as such .
" we do n't see parents as assistant teachers - they are their children 's first and most important teachers , " rabkin said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 08.09.2010 economists say berlin needs to embrace its creativity großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin wall remnants are a canvas for the city 's creatives a new study of german cities shows that the creme-de-la-creme of young professional minds are attracted to hamburg and munich .
fewer , however , lay their hats in berlin , regardless of its cool , capital status . " increased competition for clever minds " is the title of a report analyzing migration from cities with more than half a million residents .
its three authors from the institute of employment research -lrb- iab -rrb- paint a picture in which well-educated germans most readily move to places renowned for their political leanings , their solid foundations , their ability to provide work and perhaps even for their good air , be it of the sea or mountain variety .
in many ways , the findings are not surprising .
not only for the cities that did feature at the top of the popularity chart , but also for those that did not .
most notably : germany 's unconventional capital berlin , which unlike hamburg and munich , has not had the benefit of being able to continually evolve since the days of the post-war economic miracle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : munich is the most popular career destination for well-educated germans after 40 years of division and almost 20 years of reunification , berlin is still trying to find its feet , economically speaking .
as martin gornig , the head of innovation , manufacturing and service at the german institute for economic research told deutsche welle , the capital city does not boast the kind of economic framework that entices people hoping to launch prosperous careers .
" berlin does n't have bmw or allianz , " he says .
" the big companies left berlin and they have not come back . "
and nor are they likely to , given the difficulties associated with uprooting established companies .
" what berlin has to do now is grow new ones , " gornig says .
" it might be a slow process , but it has to happen . "
gornig is not talking about new car manufacturers or new insurance companies , but about berlin playing to its greatest strength : creativity .
it has always had a reputation for attracting artists , but in recent years the capital has become a veritable stomping ground for those pointedly seeking inspiration over security .
creative renown the city 's creative pool is deep .
designers , musicians , painters , fashion designers and filmmakers add to it and drink from it .
art feeds art in berlin .
and while that does not necessarily a make a booming economy , it does provide the capital with some excellent long-term prospects .
" almost everything in berlin relates in some way or another to creativity , " says volker hassemer of stiftung zukunft berlin -lrb- foundation for the future of berlin -rrb- .
" take telekom for example , they have a large creative department here , which is entirely because of the type of people that live in the city . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin has a thriving art scene and the telecommunications giant is not alone .
hassemer says businesses actively seeking creative input have picked up on the fact that it pays to offer creative jobs in berlin because they know they will stand a better chance of getting good people .
geppert goes one step further .
he says the german capital appeals to the kind of workers who are not only creative in what they do , but in the way they live their lives .
" we 're not talking here about people who want permanent contracts with all the perks of holiday and sick pay , but about those who come to berlin without work and who are willing to be freelance or take short-term contacts . "
more marketing yet for all that , there is a sense that germany 's biggest city could be doing a bit more to sell its creative vein to the commercial world , as well as to tourists and artists .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin fashion week is an annual fixture " we need to recognize the potential of what we have , " hassemer says , adding that the arts and culture landscape is currently too fractured to be of serious economic value .
he believes the capital needs to be more up front about how it wants to use the creative talent residing within its boundaries .
and for that it needs a cluster organization .
" cities should show themselves to the outside world , " hassemer said .
" berlin has a cluster for health care management , but has not managed to establish one for its creative industries , and that is a failure . "
he says that while establishing a cluster is not inherently easy , it could be done .
the major impediment is bad management on the part of politicians , who are too bound up in minor tussles to extend a hand of partnership to the creative branch .
hassemer is very clear that berlin should get on top of its potential sooner rather than later , because to squander it may well be to inflict lasting damage .
" how are we going to continue to compete as europeans when other countries are growing and producing so fast ? " he asks .
" not with manufactured products but with our cultural maturity . "

i realized that i should take pictures of them before that happens . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some of the women spiffed themselves up for the photo sessions is n't that kind of loaded , this idea of women and beauty and prison ? i 'm not sure - that 's what i wanted to figure out : ' is it problematic for women , or not ? '
the prison administration was doubtful - they did n't think any of the women would want to present themselves in an exhibition , which is what my intention was from the start .
but 15 women wanted to participate , and that was a green light for my project from the get-go . what do you think the motivation was for these women to take part ? life in prison is quite boring .
participating in the project was almost like vacation - a departure from everyday life - for the women , who often sit for 23 hours a day in their cells .
for them , it was a connection to outside life . were n't the women ashamed to show themselves ? i 'm not sure .
they agreed to have their pictures taken .
some of the women were in prison for the second , third or fourth time .
one woman who agreed to take part had been free for a few months , then returned and said , ' hello , i 'm back , you can take more pictures of me . "
for her , it was like coming home again . do you have an example of one of the women 's stories , why she came to be in prison ? yes , i talked with the women , but their stories are supposed to remain private .
you can read the anonymous narratives hanging on the walls of the exhibition . some statistics show that women are victims themselves before they land in prison .
did you find that when you spoke with the women ? it was different .
you might find that in their narratives .
actually , a lot of these women were drug addicts , and many of them belong in a hospital or treatment center rather than a prison . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some felt the art project was an escape from everyday jail life what was one of the most difficult moments while you were photographing the women ? actually , it was beforehand - in convincing the prison administration to let me in .
they did n't really understand what i wanted and what my purpose was , but as soon as they got an idea of what i was aiming for - not criticizing the place , but just presenting the bit of beauty among the women in the prison - it was fine . how do you define beauty ? you have it or you do n't .
it 's not easily defined .
i can show it better than describe it in words .
each woman here in the exhibition has some form of beauty , even if it 's just something in her expression . is n't this a contrast , the idea of beauty and women in prison ? yes .
it 's difficult for people to imagine that women want to take care of themselves in jail , but many of the prisoners told me that it 's important to them , but they do n't have much of a chance to do that .
for the photo sessions , they made themselves up , had their hair cut . how did you try to make the women feel comfortable with you ? i brought cookies , cigarettes , tea .
and i talked with them - it was n't just a photo session with each , but also a chat . you trained as an architect , then switched to painting and finally , photography .
why ? i painted for 10 years - abstract painting .
but then i realized that there are just some things you can only capture in a moment , and i switched to photography .
my first photography project was in a slaughterhouse - i was impressed by the colors i could capture there , and the moment when life is extinguished .
you ca n't get this moment across in abstract paintings . do you think this project is political - the " women in prison " portraits ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some of the women said personal hygiene products are rare in prison no .
it 's human .
i do n't want to criticize anyone .
this is simply part of life , even if it 's scary at times . why women and not men ?
men can be beautiful too … because people think of women and not men when they hear the word beauty . you asked women to write some things down about beauty .
why ? because i wanted to know their opinions about the subject and not mine .
maybe they do n't think about it at all .
but from the letters , i can tell they do .
life is tough in prison , and it leaves traces on people 's faces much more than among people who are free . when one reads the narratives , it 's clear that the women are also struggling with other problems , like their drug addiction , missing their children , their safety .
is n't it a luxury to be asking questions about beauty , when the women are facing much tougher issues ? i do n't really know . interview : louisa schaefer editor : kate bowen the exhibition at the neues kunstforum in cologne runs through sept .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de religion -pipe- 08.09.2010 former terry jones church in germany denounces koran-burning plan großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jones insists on going through with his plan pastor terry jones , whose call to " burn the koran " has led to fears of global repercussions , worked as missionary for decades in germany .
here , too , he was known for his extreme convictions . a german church founded and formerly led by terry jones , the american pastor who international attracted attention with controversial plans to stage a koran-burning ceremony , expressly denounced those plans on wednesday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jones ' former church is ' deeply disturbed ' by their former leader stephan baar , deputy chairman of the christliche gemeinde koeln -lrb- cgd -rrb- , the christian community of cologne , told deutsche welle that jones preached a strict , even fundamental understanding of the bible , but that no direct comparisons could be drawn between his sermons there and the radical views he is currently espousing at his new church .
" we want to make it clear that our church is opposed to what terry jones is advocating at the moment and that the cgd , even though he is the founder , has no more contact with him , " baar said .
the community asked him to leave in 2008 .
baar insisted that there were no controversies surrounding his departure .
" he just left ; we did not witness any of the deeply disturbing things we are seeing now .
pastor terry jones was placing too much emphasis on himself and distracting our members from their christian faiths .
he and our church simply went their separate ways . "
' gate to hell ' brigitte baetz , a cologne journalist who is a regular contributor on german public radio , said jones espoused radical christian views while at the helm of the cgd .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protests against the actions have begun in kabul baetz told deutsche welle that jones commonly referred to the city of cologne as a " gate to hell " and emphasized that christians were " persecuted " there and took on the role of " innocent victims who would be rewarded for their suffering . "
" in his sermons terry jones often convinced the members that they were made to suffer hardships because they were part of the cgd .
he said again and again that the members were the victims of persecution and that it led to them losing their jobs and social status , for instance . "
baetz said that jones ' sermons bordered on fundamentalist interpretations of the bible .
she singled out his vehement opposition to cologne plans to construct a mosque in the city as an example of his extremist views .
" terry jones saw religion as wrong and right .
he told his followers here in germany that christians , and especially members of his cgd , were the only ones who were right .
this is the basis , i believe , for what he is doing right now with his new church in florida , " baetz said .
us unable to prevent controversial burning leading figures around the globe have expressed fears that jones ' planned " international burn a koran day " could seriously strain relations between muslims and the west .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : petraeus said jones would provide propaganda for rebels david petraeus , the top us and nato commander in afghanistan , warned that " burning the holy book of islam provides propaganda for insurgents and could endanger the -lsb- alliance 's -rsb- overall effort .

the court said the gambling laws were being applied inconsistently . the german government 's monopoly on most forms of gambling must be ended immediately , according to the european court of justice in luxembourg .
the court ruled that " the german rules do not limit games of chance in a consistent and systematic manner . " it said that the state the monopoly is not justifiable .
under german law , only the country 's 16 federal states or companies run by them can offer gambling services .
the state therefore has an effective monopoly on gambling and lotteries .
the law also bans most web-based betting , and forbids advertising such services .
the german state treaty on gambling came into force in 2008 to curb a growing trend in gambling addiction .
critics say it simply ensured that the state received a substantial chunk of the revenue from gambling .
internet betting agencies based abroad a number of private betting companies have challenged the treaty , saying it is inconsistent , because the federal states do not hold a monopoly on certain forms of gambling like slot machines and casinos .
numerous internet users place bets illegally with private online companies registered abroad , which tend to offer better odds .

he won the nobel prize in the year 1985 for the discovery of the quantum hall effect .
now i suppose after getting the prize you were probably pretty busy .
how long did it take until you could really get back to research ? klaus von klitzing : i am always in the laboratory , so if i am at home it 's about 50 percent of my time .
no , i am always in the laboratory .
i have a big group of young students .
and i always have to be able to tell new things in order to attend conferences , so i need new material .
therefore , i need to do research and this is the most important thing .
to keep up with modern research . but life probably changed after winning the nobel prize .
i mean your opinion is now important to everybody . yes , that 's one problem .
you have to say something in fields where you are not a specialist .
so you know something about physics and you have to say something about global warming .
it 's also related to physics , but also nuclear energy , weapons , all kinds of things .
so this is much more difficult .
but you have a lot of connections to people where you can rely on their opinion and you can get some information .
and you have to do something for the public , to say this is the right direction , in my opinion , but even nobel laureates they disagree sometimes in certain fields .
and this is an interesting point to have this discussion , to have a broad range of opinion and then to find the truth . what do you think distinguishes a nobel prize laureate ?
what is so special about you ? special is that unlike with politicians , many people believe that what you are saying is the absolute truth .
to a certain degree it 's true , but we do n't know everything .
but to a certain extent you can influence the public .
this is some extra burden also because suddenly you discover that what you are saying translates as one to one .
and sometimes it 's dangerous because as a scientist you do n't always have a fixed opinion about all things .
it 's floating , you are learning all the time .
so this is a burden to all of the laureates . f rom about 802 nobel prize laureates , we 've had only about 40 women .
do you have an explanation for that ? yes , it 's always more difficult for women in some cultures.in other countries in islamic countries in jordan there were more than 50 percent of phyics students who were female .
and if you go to france even , they also have more female scientists .
so it 's got something to do with the environment with the conditions , with the tradition , what is a family .
and i think that we have to learn something in germany about how to support female scientists .
to have an environment where they can continue their research .
because if you are away for three years in research , you lose contact with the top scientific questions .
so therefore you have to find some solutions , so you can combine both : a family and science .

so this is much more difficult .
but you have a lot of connections to people where you can rely on their opinion and you can get some information .
and you have to do something for the public , to say this is the right direction , in my opinion , but even nobel laureates they disagree sometimes in certain fields .
and this is an interesting point to have this discussion , to have a broad range of opinion and then to find the truth . what do you think distinguishes a nobel prize laureate ?
what is so special about you ? special is that unlike with politicians , many people believe that what you are saying is the absolute truth .
to a certain degree it 's true , but we do n't know everything .
but to a certain extent you can influence the public .
this is some extra burden also because suddenly you discover that what you are saying translates as one to one .
and sometimes it 's dangerous because as a scientist you do n't always have a fixed opinion about all things .
it 's floating , you are learning all the time .
so this is a burden to all of the laureates . f rom about 802 nobel prize laureates , we 've had only about 40 women .
do you have an explanation for that ? yes , it 's always more difficult for women in some cultures.in other countries in islamic countries in jordan there were more than 50 percent of phyics students who were female .
and if you go to france even , they also have more female scientists .
so it 's got something to do with the environment with the conditions , with the tradition , what is a family .
and i think that we have to learn something in germany about how to support female scientists .
to have an environment where they can continue their research .
because if you are away for three years in research , you lose contact with the top scientific questions .
so therefore you have to find some solutions , so you can combine both : a family and science .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de art -pipe- 08.09.2010 photographer explores beauty among women prisoners großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the women were asked how prison life had changed them a photographer in cologne has taken female inmates as the subjects of his work - a tall order , given penitentiary security .
the artist asked the women to describe what " beauty " meant to them in everyday prison life . it sounds rather macabre or , at the very least , a contradiction in terms - asking female prisoners to address the notion of beauty .
russian photographer igor chepikov , who has been living in cologne , germany since 1991 , visited a women 's penitentiary weekly for over 10 months .
there , after splashing a wall in white paint to serve as a backdrop , he took thousands pictures of some of the inmates .
those snapshots were ultimately distilled into a selection of just 56 photographs that compose the exhibition called " bad ossendorf : women in prison " now on show in cologne . the title is a play on words .
" bad " in front of the name a place normally refers to a spa town in german .
" ossendorf " is the name of the penitentiary outside of cologne .
" bad ossendorf , " then , could be translated as " resort ossendorf , " but is intended to also imply english connotations , as in " bad love , bad money , bad company . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the photographer took 24 pictures of each participant however one chooses to view the name , the subject of the exhibition - women in prison confronted with the topic of " beauty " - sounds like it 's begging for feminist critique .
after all , many of the female prisoners have more existential issues to address than philosophical matters like the definition of beauty .
they are worried about their children , who are now sitting in orphanages .
they are dismayed about the pain they have caused their relatives .
they want to liberate themselves from a vicious circle of crime . the photographer chepikov , at least , gave space to the women 's voices - choosing not just to display his photographs of them , but also to literally frame their " narratives . "
the photographer asked the women to answer certain questions in written form - to describe what beauty meant to them , if they felt they had lost time in prison , what effect prison had had on their bodies and souls ? some of the answers : " the feeling of loneliness is the worst . "
" i never thought prison could make a person look so bad . "
" there is no place to buy make-up here , or any other kind of personal hygiene products . "
" once i saw the photos , i realized how horrible the effects of the drugs have been . "
" i wish i could turn back the clock . "
" for me , ' beauty ' here in the prison essentially means being clean . " deutsche welle spoke with the photographer , igor chepikov , to get his take on " women in prison . " deutsche welle : why these photographs of women in prison ? why did you choose to do this ? igor chepikov : i came up with the idea about six years ago .
i was sitting in the moscow subway , and was looking out of the windows and thinking about the song " as time goes by . "
and then , i started reading something about prisons and got to thinking about what life is like in prisons .
a man , for instance , could be 20 years old and get 15 years in jail , but he 's only 35 when he gets out .
but when he 's 45 and gets out of prison -lsb- 15 years later -rsb- , he 's 60 .
life is over for him , and he has no possibility to change .
for women , it 's even harder - not only can they not adapt at that age , they have also lost their beauty .
i realized that i should take pictures of them before that happens . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some of the women spiffed themselves up for the photo sessions is n't that kind of loaded , this idea of women and beauty and prison ? i 'm not sure - that 's what i wanted to figure out : ' is it problematic for women , or not ? '
the prison administration was doubtful - they did n't think any of the women would want to present themselves in an exhibition , which is what my intention was from the start .
but 15 women wanted to participate , and that was a green light for my project from the get-go . what do you think the motivation was for these women to take part ? life in prison is quite boring .
participating in the project was almost like vacation - a departure from everyday life - for the women , who often sit for 23 hours a day in their cells .
for them , it was a connection to outside life . were n't the women ashamed to show themselves ? i 'm not sure .
they agreed to have their pictures taken .
some of the women were in prison for the second , third or fourth time .
one woman who agreed to take part had been free for a few months , then returned and said , ' hello , i 'm back , you can take more pictures of me . "
for her , it was like coming home again . do you have an example of one of the women 's stories , why she came to be in prison ? yes , i talked with the women , but their stories are supposed to remain private .
you can read the anonymous narratives hanging on the walls of the exhibition . some statistics show that women are victims themselves before they land in prison .
did you find that when you spoke with the women ? it was different .
you might find that in their narratives .
actually , a lot of these women were drug addicts , and many of them belong in a hospital or treatment center rather than a prison . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some felt the art project was an escape from everyday jail life what was one of the most difficult moments while you were photographing the women ? actually , it was beforehand - in convincing the prison administration to let me in .
they did n't really understand what i wanted and what my purpose was , but as soon as they got an idea of what i was aiming for - not criticizing the place , but just presenting the bit of beauty among the women in the prison - it was fine . how do you define beauty ? you have it or you do n't .
it 's not easily defined .
i can show it better than describe it in words .
each woman here in the exhibition has some form of beauty , even if it 's just something in her expression . is n't this a contrast , the idea of beauty and women in prison ? yes .
it 's difficult for people to imagine that women want to take care of themselves in jail , but many of the prisoners told me that it 's important to them , but they do n't have much of a chance to do that .
for the photo sessions , they made themselves up , had their hair cut . how did you try to make the women feel comfortable with you ? i brought cookies , cigarettes , tea .
and i talked with them - it was n't just a photo session with each , but also a chat . you trained as an architect , then switched to painting and finally , photography .
why ? i painted for 10 years - abstract painting .
but then i realized that there are just some things you can only capture in a moment , and i switched to photography .
my first photography project was in a slaughterhouse - i was impressed by the colors i could capture there , and the moment when life is extinguished .
you ca n't get this moment across in abstract paintings . do you think this project is political - the " women in prison " portraits ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some of the women said personal hygiene products are rare in prison no .
it 's human .
i do n't want to criticize anyone .
this is simply part of life , even if it 's scary at times . why women and not men ?
men can be beautiful too … because people think of women and not men when they hear the word beauty . you asked women to write some things down about beauty .
why ? because i wanted to know their opinions about the subject and not mine .
maybe they do n't think about it at all .
but from the letters , i can tell they do .
life is tough in prison , and it leaves traces on people 's faces much more than among people who are free . when one reads the narratives , it 's clear that the women are also struggling with other problems , like their drug addiction , missing their children , their safety .
is n't it a luxury to be asking questions about beauty , when the women are facing much tougher issues ? i do n't really know . interview : louisa schaefer editor : kate bowen the exhibition at the neues kunstforum in cologne runs through sept .

you ca n't get this moment across in abstract paintings . do you think this project is political - the " women in prison " portraits ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some of the women said personal hygiene products are rare in prison no .
it 's human .
i do n't want to criticize anyone .
this is simply part of life , even if it 's scary at times . why women and not men ?
men can be beautiful too … because people think of women and not men when they hear the word beauty . you asked women to write some things down about beauty .
why ? because i wanted to know their opinions about the subject and not mine .
maybe they do n't think about it at all .
but from the letters , i can tell they do .
life is tough in prison , and it leaves traces on people 's faces much more than among people who are free . when one reads the narratives , it 's clear that the women are also struggling with other problems , like their drug addiction , missing their children , their safety .
is n't it a luxury to be asking questions about beauty , when the women are facing much tougher issues ? i do n't really know . interview : louisa schaefer editor : kate bowen the exhibition at the neues kunstforum in cologne runs through sept .

but a comparison between debates in germany and the united states suggests they shed more heat than light . with the publication of his book " deutschland schafft sich ab " -lrb- " germany abolishes itself " -rrb- in late august , banker and politician thilo sarrazin gifted the german media an incendiary topic for the autumn .
among the book 's controversial theses is the idea that higher fertility rates would allow non-assimilated muslims to dominate germany in the not-too-distant future .
the book tapped into fears among some germans that german culture and the german way of life is in danger .
but the discussions engendered were reminiscent of similar debates in other cultures .
in the united states , the publication in 2004 of a book entitled " who are we ? " by political scientist samuel p. huntington sparked discussions about whether the increasing prevalence of spanish-speaking americans would bifurcate us culture and threaten what the author called the american " creed " of enlightenment democracy .
but though the subject matters are seemingly similar , the levels of discourse in the two debates are very different .
german immigration expert klaus j. bade praises sarrazin for pointing up abuse of the german welfare system by migrants and germans .
but he takes the author to task in other areas .
" huntington 's book was more scientifically informed , whereas sarrazin knows as much about demography as i do about his specialty , state finances : namely just bits and pieces , " bade told deutsche welle .
" in this field he 's a populist writer who partly trades in cheap commonplaces and looks for statistical evidence for pre-conceived ideas - the exact opposite of the scientific method .
it 's what we call beer-coaster demographics . "
and the difference between a demagogue and a respected professor is not the only respect in which superficial similarities fall apart .
apples and oranges bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us hispanics , including this woman voting in denver , are becoming more and more important debates in germany and the us about whether immigrants are sufficiently assimilating are inflected by the different histories and demographics of the two countries .
the united states is a nation with a growing population and a rising number of immigrants , which from its very inception embraced the idea of foreigners becoming citizens .
germany , on the other hand , has stagnant population and immigration and was traditionally wary of taking in non-germans looking to better their lots in life .
" social integration and acknowledgement of the dialogue with muslim communities - these things have developed over the past few years , " philip anderson , professor of social sciences at the university of regensburg , told deutsche welle .
" but there needs to be more of that and far less of the fear of a sullying of the german identity and sometimes even german blood . "
debates about assimilation in germany and in other western european countries are additionally heated because most of the foreign residents and immigrants in question are muslim .
but klaus bade warns against seeing them as a homogeneous group .
" there 's no such thing as a single muslim group in germany , " bade said .
" immigration from iran , for example , centered on elites who had little problem integrating into german society .
immigrant turks tended to come from rural anatolia , and not istanbul , and so there were educational problems , especially three generations ago .
but that had nothing to do with them being muslims .
problems among italian immigrants , for instance , were and still are worse . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thilo sarrazin -lrb- r . -rrb- has been doing the talk-show rounds self-fulfilling prophecies sarrazin has had to step down from his job on the board of germany 's federal bank , and may yet lose his membership in the social democratic party for his ill-advised and ill-informed opinions .
but is there anything to the points he - or huntington - raised ?
can demographic changes mean the end of a language , a culture and a way of life ?
" there is an aspect comparable between both books , namely the vision of a competition between cultures , " bade said .
" but competition is not the same thing as total war .
moreover , we should think less about groups and systems and more about individuals .
for many people the huntington book has something of a self-fulfilling prophecy .
it 's a circular argument that echoes older fears about the decline and fall of western civilization .
this seems , on a national level , comparable to sarrazin 's message . "
in other words , warnings about conflicts of civilizations - to paraphrase the title of another of huntington 's books - tend to create the sort of tension they claim to be decrying .
" generally there is far more acceptance - especially in the cities , where people lived together - than is usually acknowledged , " anderson said .
" politicians need to push that as a positive image of how people are getting on . "
for bade , reasoning that fails to distinguish and differentiate between individual attitudes among immigrants and resident aliens is inherently faulty .
" when asked ' when did you last go to a mosque , ' many european muslims may not know where the nearest one is or may respond : ' for religious or cultural reasons ? '
that 's comparable to the way many christians feel who may go to church to look at art or attend a wedding .
there 's an infinite number of hybrid forms and milieus of islam , and from one generation to another muslims themselves will - hopefully - adapt more and more to european civilization as they did and still do in the us .

the project helps parents with migrant backgrounds and their children improve their literacy skills through storytelling . four million of the more than 750 million illiterate people in the world live in germany , and a disproportionate number of them are immigrants or have an immigrant background .
the " family literacy " project -lrb- fly -rrb- focuses on that group , which makes up 14 percent of hamburg 's population , and for that reason it was singled out for unesco 's 2010 literacy award .
fly , a pilot project initiated and run by the hamburg state institute for teacher training and school development , uses an intergenerational approach to ensure closer cooperation and better communication between the school and the childrens ' home " it 's our goal to get the parents interested in reading more at home with their children and in engaging more strongly with language , " gabriele rabkin , the head of fly , told deutsche welle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an intergenerational approach benefits adults and children forty-four schools in hamburg participate in the program , which was started six years ago .
nearly 1,000 parents and as many children take part in the project every year .
parents welcome every two weeks , parents join their children , mainly preschoolers and first-graders , in the classroom .
they see how their kids engage with words and storytelling - and they 're allowed to help .
fly 's teachers encourage the adults to make sure their children speak in complete sentences outside of class , take time to look at picture books together or point out individual letters on the way to school .
ute stather , who teaches first and second graders at hamburg 's osterbrook school , has been with the project from the start .
" the parents see what we are doing and that helps them understand where they have to support their child , " she said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sometimes aunts , grandmothers and siblings join the classes the families are not discouraged from speaking their native language in class .
on the contrary , teachers view multilingualism as an asset , stather said .
" if people speak and read a lot in their native tongue , their children will also learn german much more easily . "
many of the parents also see fly classes as a chance to learn german , according to rabkin .
the teachers also do n't put pressure on the adults to read and speak in german with their children at home ; what was important was for them to deal with language as such .
" we do n't see parents as assistant teachers - they are their children 's first and most important teachers , " rabkin said .

the project helps parents with migrant backgrounds and their children improve their literacy skills through storytelling . four million of the more than 750 million illiterate people in the world live in germany , and a disproportionate number of them are immigrants or have an immigrant background .
the " family literacy " project -lrb- fly -rrb- focuses on that group , which makes up 14 percent of hamburg 's population , and for that reason it was singled out for unesco 's 2010 literacy award .
fly , a pilot project initiated and run by the hamburg state institute for teacher training and school development , uses an intergenerational approach to ensure closer cooperation and better communication between the school and the childrens ' home " it 's our goal to get the parents interested in reading more at home with their children and in engaging more strongly with language , " gabriele rabkin , the head of fly , told deutsche welle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an intergenerational approach benefits adults and children forty-four schools in hamburg participate in the program , which was started six years ago .
nearly 1,000 parents and as many children take part in the project every year .
parents welcome every two weeks , parents join their children , mainly preschoolers and first-graders , in the classroom .
they see how their kids engage with words and storytelling - and they 're allowed to help .
fly 's teachers encourage the adults to make sure their children speak in complete sentences outside of class , take time to look at picture books together or point out individual letters on the way to school .
ute stather , who teaches first and second graders at hamburg 's osterbrook school , has been with the project from the start .
" the parents see what we are doing and that helps them understand where they have to support their child , " she said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sometimes aunts , grandmothers and siblings join the classes the families are not discouraged from speaking their native language in class .
on the contrary , teachers view multilingualism as an asset , stather said .
" if people speak and read a lot in their native tongue , their children will also learn german much more easily . "
many of the parents also see fly classes as a chance to learn german , according to rabkin .
the teachers also do n't put pressure on the adults to read and speak in german with their children at home ; what was important was for them to deal with language as such .
" we do n't see parents as assistant teachers - they are their children 's first and most important teachers , " rabkin said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 08.09.2010 economists say berlin needs to embrace its creativity großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin wall remnants are a canvas for the city 's creatives a new study of german cities shows that the creme-de-la-creme of young professional minds are attracted to hamburg and munich .
fewer , however , lay their hats in berlin , regardless of its cool , capital status . " increased competition for clever minds " is the title of a report analyzing migration from cities with more than half a million residents .
its three authors from the institute of employment research -lrb- iab -rrb- paint a picture in which well-educated germans most readily move to places renowned for their political leanings , their solid foundations , their ability to provide work and perhaps even for their good air , be it of the sea or mountain variety .
in many ways , the findings are not surprising .
not only for the cities that did feature at the top of the popularity chart , but also for those that did not .
most notably : germany 's unconventional capital berlin , which unlike hamburg and munich , has not had the benefit of being able to continually evolve since the days of the post-war economic miracle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : munich is the most popular career destination for well-educated germans after 40 years of division and almost 20 years of reunification , berlin is still trying to find its feet , economically speaking .
as martin gornig , the head of innovation , manufacturing and service at the german institute for economic research told deutsche welle , the capital city does not boast the kind of economic framework that entices people hoping to launch prosperous careers .
" berlin does n't have bmw or allianz , " he says .
" the big companies left berlin and they have not come back . "
and nor are they likely to , given the difficulties associated with uprooting established companies .
" what berlin has to do now is grow new ones , " gornig says .
" it might be a slow process , but it has to happen . "
gornig is not talking about new car manufacturers or new insurance companies , but about berlin playing to its greatest strength : creativity .
it has always had a reputation for attracting artists , but in recent years the capital has become a veritable stomping ground for those pointedly seeking inspiration over security .
creative renown the city 's creative pool is deep .
designers , musicians , painters , fashion designers and filmmakers add to it and drink from it .
art feeds art in berlin .
and while that does not necessarily a make a booming economy , it does provide the capital with some excellent long-term prospects .
" almost everything in berlin relates in some way or another to creativity , " says volker hassemer of stiftung zukunft berlin -lrb- foundation for the future of berlin -rrb- .
" take telekom for example , they have a large creative department here , which is entirely because of the type of people that live in the city . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin has a thriving art scene and the telecommunications giant is not alone .
hassemer says businesses actively seeking creative input have picked up on the fact that it pays to offer creative jobs in berlin because they know they will stand a better chance of getting good people .
geppert goes one step further .
he says the german capital appeals to the kind of workers who are not only creative in what they do , but in the way they live their lives .
" we 're not talking here about people who want permanent contracts with all the perks of holiday and sick pay , but about those who come to berlin without work and who are willing to be freelance or take short-term contacts . "
more marketing yet for all that , there is a sense that germany 's biggest city could be doing a bit more to sell its creative vein to the commercial world , as well as to tourists and artists .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin fashion week is an annual fixture " we need to recognize the potential of what we have , " hassemer says , adding that the arts and culture landscape is currently too fractured to be of serious economic value .
he believes the capital needs to be more up front about how it wants to use the creative talent residing within its boundaries .
and for that it needs a cluster organization .
" cities should show themselves to the outside world , " hassemer said .
" berlin has a cluster for health care management , but has not managed to establish one for its creative industries , and that is a failure . "
he says that while establishing a cluster is not inherently easy , it could be done .
the major impediment is bad management on the part of politicians , who are too bound up in minor tussles to extend a hand of partnership to the creative branch .
hassemer is very clear that berlin should get on top of its potential sooner rather than later , because to squander it may well be to inflict lasting damage .
" how are we going to continue to compete as europeans when other countries are growing and producing so fast ? " he asks .
" not with manufactured products but with our cultural maturity . "

but a comparison between debates in germany and the united states suggests they shed more heat than light . with the publication of his book " deutschland schafft sich ab " -lrb- " germany abolishes itself " -rrb- in late august , banker and politician thilo sarrazin gifted the german media an incendiary topic for the autumn .
among the book 's controversial theses is the idea that higher fertility rates would allow non-assimilated muslims to dominate germany in the not-too-distant future .
the book tapped into fears among some germans that german culture and the german way of life is in danger .
but the discussions engendered were reminiscent of similar debates in other cultures .
in the united states , the publication in 2004 of a book entitled " who are we ? " by political scientist samuel p. huntington sparked discussions about whether the increasing prevalence of spanish-speaking americans would bifurcate us culture and threaten what the author called the american " creed " of enlightenment democracy .
but though the subject matters are seemingly similar , the levels of discourse in the two debates are very different .
german immigration expert klaus j. bade praises sarrazin for pointing up abuse of the german welfare system by migrants and germans .
but he takes the author to task in other areas .
" huntington 's book was more scientifically informed , whereas sarrazin knows as much about demography as i do about his specialty , state finances : namely just bits and pieces , " bade told deutsche welle .
" in this field he 's a populist writer who partly trades in cheap commonplaces and looks for statistical evidence for pre-conceived ideas - the exact opposite of the scientific method .
it 's what we call beer-coaster demographics . "
and the difference between a demagogue and a respected professor is not the only respect in which superficial similarities fall apart .
apples and oranges bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us hispanics , including this woman voting in denver , are becoming more and more important debates in germany and the us about whether immigrants are sufficiently assimilating are inflected by the different histories and demographics of the two countries .
the united states is a nation with a growing population and a rising number of immigrants , which from its very inception embraced the idea of foreigners becoming citizens .
germany , on the other hand , has stagnant population and immigration and was traditionally wary of taking in non-germans looking to better their lots in life .
" social integration and acknowledgement of the dialogue with muslim communities - these things have developed over the past few years , " philip anderson , professor of social sciences at the university of regensburg , told deutsche welle .
" but there needs to be more of that and far less of the fear of a sullying of the german identity and sometimes even german blood . "
debates about assimilation in germany and in other western european countries are additionally heated because most of the foreign residents and immigrants in question are muslim .
but klaus bade warns against seeing them as a homogeneous group .
" there 's no such thing as a single muslim group in germany , " bade said .
" immigration from iran , for example , centered on elites who had little problem integrating into german society .
immigrant turks tended to come from rural anatolia , and not istanbul , and so there were educational problems , especially three generations ago .
but that had nothing to do with them being muslims .
problems among italian immigrants , for instance , were and still are worse . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thilo sarrazin -lrb- r . -rrb- has been doing the talk-show rounds self-fulfilling prophecies sarrazin has had to step down from his job on the board of germany 's federal bank , and may yet lose his membership in the social democratic party for his ill-advised and ill-informed opinions .
but is there anything to the points he - or huntington - raised ?
can demographic changes mean the end of a language , a culture and a way of life ?
" there is an aspect comparable between both books , namely the vision of a competition between cultures , " bade said .
" but competition is not the same thing as total war .
moreover , we should think less about groups and systems and more about individuals .
for many people the huntington book has something of a self-fulfilling prophecy .
it 's a circular argument that echoes older fears about the decline and fall of western civilization .
this seems , on a national level , comparable to sarrazin 's message . "
in other words , warnings about conflicts of civilizations - to paraphrase the title of another of huntington 's books - tend to create the sort of tension they claim to be decrying .
" generally there is far more acceptance - especially in the cities , where people lived together - than is usually acknowledged , " anderson said .
" politicians need to push that as a positive image of how people are getting on . "
for bade , reasoning that fails to distinguish and differentiate between individual attitudes among immigrants and resident aliens is inherently faulty .
" when asked ' when did you last go to a mosque , ' many european muslims may not know where the nearest one is or may respond : ' for religious or cultural reasons ? '
that 's comparable to the way many christians feel who may go to church to look at art or attend a wedding .
there 's an infinite number of hybrid forms and milieus of islam , and from one generation to another muslims themselves will - hopefully - adapt more and more to european civilization as they did and still do in the us . " culture is constantly in flux , and demographic changes , of course , bring cultural shifts with them .

a new law came into effect on april 1 providing children with access to free education .
but children ’ s rights organizations complain about the implementation . it is 2 o ’ clock at a school in the old part of pune .
classes are supposed to run from 12.30 to 5.30 pm at baburao sana ’ s school , just like in other state school but there ’ s no learning going on in this classroom .
instead there is chaos .
class one ’ s teacher is not here .
the children are playing , crying , shouting , or just running around . gangu is a seven years old girl .
her black hair is short and she has a gold nose ring .
she is wearing the school uniform , a yellow blouse and a grey pinafore .
she looks upon the chaos calmly .
she knows that the teacher always comes very late .
" we play here while we wait " , she says . ngo provides education for children of migrant workers gangu belongs to the nomadic pardhi tribe who are migrant workers .
all year round , they travel the country , looking for work .
they sell flowers or balloons on the streets to earn some money .
she had never been to school before because she was always on the road .
but last year she was adopted by the ngo ekalavya .
she now lives in a home with other pardhi children and goes to school everyday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : queuing in school uniform for food it is 3pm .
priyanka gaikwad , the teacher , finally arrives .
she tells the children to calm down .
she explains that she was late because she had to fill out some official forms in the headmistress ’ office .
" we often have other duties apart from school " , gaikwad complains .
" we have to compile reports for the government or help with the census . "
because class one ’ s exams are in a couple of days the headmistress gave her this work .
moreover , her colleague from another class is on holiday so she has to teach both classes together .
but there is not enough space and it is very chaotic . problem of crowded classes instead of 30 children , there are 60 sitting here - some are even crouching on the floor .
gangu takes her seat between two other girls .
the first subject of the day is marathi – the main language of maharashtra . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : too many pupils , too less space the children first learn the letters .
then they have to name words that they know which begin with these letters .
the teacher has a stick to beat the children with if they are too loud or talk among themselves .
although she ’ s officially not allowed , she says it ’ s impossible to discipline the children otherwise . indian school system not effective many of the children are quiet however .
they know they have their exam soon .
gangu also wants to take it but she is not allowed .
she is not registered at the school because she does not have a birth certificate .
she missed the deadline to get a certificate from the local state hospital .
this means she might have to wait for a year to get a certificate and repeat the year . many pardhi children have gone back to their parents and their nomadic way of life for this very reason .
they get bored when they have to repeat the class .
gangu is adamant that this will not happen .
she wants to go into class two , be successful , build a big house for her parents and live with them .
children ’ s rights activists hope that the new law will help overcome these bureaucratic barriers , otherwise they fear for universal education in india .

the percentage of people in urban areas with access is declining . lack of access to clean sources of water remains a major problem is much of the world , said anders berntell , executive director of the stockholm international water institute -lrb- siwi -rrb- . " bad water kills more people than hiv , malaria and wars together , affecting the lives of families and the economic development of many countries around the world , " he said at the world water week conference being held in the swedish capital . the united nation 's food and agriculture organization estimates that within the next 15 years , 1.8 billion people will be living in regions with acute water scarcity , and that two-thirds of the world 's population could be facing shortages . thirsty cities bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many people in cities lack the clean water they need while the plight of those in dry , rural areas has long been examined by development aid and the work of non-governmental organizations -lrb- ngos -rrb- , people in urban areas also suffer from lack of access to water , according to gerard payen , who heads the international federation of private water operators -lrb- aquafed -rrb- . " in cities , there are today more people suffering from a poor and unsatisfactory access to safe water and sanitation than at the end of the 20th century , " payen said in a statement . access to safe drinking water was recognized as a human right by the united nations general assembly in july , yet the un , together with ngos and individual governments , has struggled for decades to get potable water to hundreds of millions of people worldwide who lack water and basic sanitation services . growing population bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in some places , a trek is necessary to get clean water population growth is one of the biggest difficulties they confront .
between 2000 and 2008 , the world 's population increased by 635 million people , 80 percent of whom live in urban areas , according to un data . " the proportion of the urban population that benefits from satisfactory access to drinking water or sanitation is decreasing , " aquafed said , pointing to un statistics showing that 114 million more people went without access to tap water at home or in the immediate vicinity at the end of the eight-year-period . at the same time , 134 million more people went without access to basic sanitation , the group said , pointing out that in both cases there had been a 20 percent hike of urban dwellers lacking access . " current efforts to develop access to water and sanitation in cities are outpaced by urbanization , " payen said . author : sean sinico -lrb- afp , dpa -rrb- editor : nathan witkop send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the court said the gambling laws were being applied inconsistently . the german government 's monopoly on most forms of gambling must be ended immediately , according to the european court of justice in luxembourg .
the court ruled that " the german rules do not limit games of chance in a consistent and systematic manner . " it said that the state the monopoly is not justifiable .
under german law , only the country 's 16 federal states or companies run by them can offer gambling services .
the state therefore has an effective monopoly on gambling and lotteries .
the law also bans most web-based betting , and forbids advertising such services .
the german state treaty on gambling came into force in 2008 to curb a growing trend in gambling addiction .
critics say it simply ensured that the state received a substantial chunk of the revenue from gambling .
internet betting agencies based abroad a number of private betting companies have challenged the treaty , saying it is inconsistent , because the federal states do not hold a monopoly on certain forms of gambling like slot machines and casinos .
numerous internet users place bets illegally with private online companies registered abroad , which tend to offer better odds .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de art -pipe- 08.09.2010 photographer explores beauty among women prisoners großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the women were asked how prison life had changed them a photographer in cologne has taken female inmates as the subjects of his work - a tall order , given penitentiary security .
the artist asked the women to describe what " beauty " meant to them in everyday prison life . it sounds rather macabre or , at the very least , a contradiction in terms - asking female prisoners to address the notion of beauty .
russian photographer igor chepikov , who has been living in cologne , germany since 1991 , visited a women 's penitentiary weekly for over 10 months .
there , after splashing a wall in white paint to serve as a backdrop , he took thousands pictures of some of the inmates .
those snapshots were ultimately distilled into a selection of just 56 photographs that compose the exhibition called " bad ossendorf : women in prison " now on show in cologne . the title is a play on words .
" bad " in front of the name a place normally refers to a spa town in german .
" ossendorf " is the name of the penitentiary outside of cologne .
" bad ossendorf , " then , could be translated as " resort ossendorf , " but is intended to also imply english connotations , as in " bad love , bad money , bad company . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the photographer took 24 pictures of each participant however one chooses to view the name , the subject of the exhibition - women in prison confronted with the topic of " beauty " - sounds like it 's begging for feminist critique .
after all , many of the female prisoners have more existential issues to address than philosophical matters like the definition of beauty .
they are worried about their children , who are now sitting in orphanages .
they are dismayed about the pain they have caused their relatives .
they want to liberate themselves from a vicious circle of crime . the photographer chepikov , at least , gave space to the women 's voices - choosing not just to display his photographs of them , but also to literally frame their " narratives . "
the photographer asked the women to answer certain questions in written form - to describe what beauty meant to them , if they felt they had lost time in prison , what effect prison had had on their bodies and souls ? some of the answers : " the feeling of loneliness is the worst . "
" i never thought prison could make a person look so bad . "
" there is no place to buy make-up here , or any other kind of personal hygiene products . "
" once i saw the photos , i realized how horrible the effects of the drugs have been . "
" i wish i could turn back the clock . "
" for me , ' beauty ' here in the prison essentially means being clean . " deutsche welle spoke with the photographer , igor chepikov , to get his take on " women in prison . " deutsche welle : why these photographs of women in prison ? why did you choose to do this ? igor chepikov : i came up with the idea about six years ago .
i was sitting in the moscow subway , and was looking out of the windows and thinking about the song " as time goes by . "
and then , i started reading something about prisons and got to thinking about what life is like in prisons .
a man , for instance , could be 20 years old and get 15 years in jail , but he 's only 35 when he gets out .
but when he 's 45 and gets out of prison -lsb- 15 years later -rsb- , he 's 60 .
life is over for him , and he has no possibility to change .
for women , it 's even harder - not only can they not adapt at that age , they have also lost their beauty .
i realized that i should take pictures of them before that happens . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some of the women spiffed themselves up for the photo sessions is n't that kind of loaded , this idea of women and beauty and prison ? i 'm not sure - that 's what i wanted to figure out : ' is it problematic for women , or not ? '
the prison administration was doubtful - they did n't think any of the women would want to present themselves in an exhibition , which is what my intention was from the start .
but 15 women wanted to participate , and that was a green light for my project from the get-go . what do you think the motivation was for these women to take part ? life in prison is quite boring .
participating in the project was almost like vacation - a departure from everyday life - for the women , who often sit for 23 hours a day in their cells .
for them , it was a connection to outside life . were n't the women ashamed to show themselves ? i 'm not sure .
they agreed to have their pictures taken .
some of the women were in prison for the second , third or fourth time .
one woman who agreed to take part had been free for a few months , then returned and said , ' hello , i 'm back , you can take more pictures of me . "
for her , it was like coming home again . do you have an example of one of the women 's stories , why she came to be in prison ? yes , i talked with the women , but their stories are supposed to remain private .
you can read the anonymous narratives hanging on the walls of the exhibition . some statistics show that women are victims themselves before they land in prison .
did you find that when you spoke with the women ? it was different .
you might find that in their narratives .
actually , a lot of these women were drug addicts , and many of them belong in a hospital or treatment center rather than a prison . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some felt the art project was an escape from everyday jail life what was one of the most difficult moments while you were photographing the women ? actually , it was beforehand - in convincing the prison administration to let me in .
they did n't really understand what i wanted and what my purpose was , but as soon as they got an idea of what i was aiming for - not criticizing the place , but just presenting the bit of beauty among the women in the prison - it was fine . how do you define beauty ? you have it or you do n't .
it 's not easily defined .
i can show it better than describe it in words .
each woman here in the exhibition has some form of beauty , even if it 's just something in her expression . is n't this a contrast , the idea of beauty and women in prison ? yes .
it 's difficult for people to imagine that women want to take care of themselves in jail , but many of the prisoners told me that it 's important to them , but they do n't have much of a chance to do that .
for the photo sessions , they made themselves up , had their hair cut . how did you try to make the women feel comfortable with you ? i brought cookies , cigarettes , tea .
and i talked with them - it was n't just a photo session with each , but also a chat . you trained as an architect , then switched to painting and finally , photography .
why ? i painted for 10 years - abstract painting .
but then i realized that there are just some things you can only capture in a moment , and i switched to photography .
my first photography project was in a slaughterhouse - i was impressed by the colors i could capture there , and the moment when life is extinguished .
you ca n't get this moment across in abstract paintings . do you think this project is political - the " women in prison " portraits ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some of the women said personal hygiene products are rare in prison no .
it 's human .
i do n't want to criticize anyone .
this is simply part of life , even if it 's scary at times . why women and not men ?
men can be beautiful too … because people think of women and not men when they hear the word beauty . you asked women to write some things down about beauty .
why ? because i wanted to know their opinions about the subject and not mine .
maybe they do n't think about it at all .
but from the letters , i can tell they do .
life is tough in prison , and it leaves traces on people 's faces much more than among people who are free . when one reads the narratives , it 's clear that the women are also struggling with other problems , like their drug addiction , missing their children , their safety .
is n't it a luxury to be asking questions about beauty , when the women are facing much tougher issues ? i do n't really know . interview : louisa schaefer editor : kate bowen the exhibition at the neues kunstforum in cologne runs through sept .

the artist asked the women to describe what " beauty " meant to them in everyday prison life . it sounds rather macabre or , at the very least , a contradiction in terms - asking female prisoners to address the notion of beauty .
russian photographer igor chepikov , who has been living in cologne , germany since 1991 , visited a women 's penitentiary weekly for over 10 months .
there , after splashing a wall in white paint to serve as a backdrop , he took thousands pictures of some of the inmates .
those snapshots were ultimately distilled into a selection of just 56 photographs that compose the exhibition called " bad ossendorf : women in prison " now on show in cologne . the title is a play on words .
" bad " in front of the name a place normally refers to a spa town in german .
" ossendorf " is the name of the penitentiary outside of cologne .
" bad ossendorf , " then , could be translated as " resort ossendorf , " but is intended to also imply english connotations , as in " bad love , bad money , bad company . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the photographer took 24 pictures of each participant however one chooses to view the name , the subject of the exhibition - women in prison confronted with the topic of " beauty " - sounds like it 's begging for feminist critique .
after all , many of the female prisoners have more existential issues to address than philosophical matters like the definition of beauty .
they are worried about their children , who are now sitting in orphanages .
they are dismayed about the pain they have caused their relatives .
they want to liberate themselves from a vicious circle of crime . the photographer chepikov , at least , gave space to the women 's voices - choosing not just to display his photographs of them , but also to literally frame their " narratives . "
the photographer asked the women to answer certain questions in written form - to describe what beauty meant to them , if they felt they had lost time in prison , what effect prison had had on their bodies and souls ? some of the answers : " the feeling of loneliness is the worst . "
" i never thought prison could make a person look so bad . "
" there is no place to buy make-up here , or any other kind of personal hygiene products . "
" once i saw the photos , i realized how horrible the effects of the drugs have been . "
" i wish i could turn back the clock . "
" for me , ' beauty ' here in the prison essentially means being clean . " deutsche welle spoke with the photographer , igor chepikov , to get his take on " women in prison . " deutsche welle : why these photographs of women in prison ? why did you choose to do this ? igor chepikov : i came up with the idea about six years ago .
i was sitting in the moscow subway , and was looking out of the windows and thinking about the song " as time goes by . "
and then , i started reading something about prisons and got to thinking about what life is like in prisons .
a man , for instance , could be 20 years old and get 15 years in jail , but he 's only 35 when he gets out .
but when he 's 45 and gets out of prison -lsb- 15 years later -rsb- , he 's 60 .
life is over for him , and he has no possibility to change .
for women , it 's even harder - not only can they not adapt at that age , they have also lost their beauty .
i realized that i should take pictures of them before that happens . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some of the women spiffed themselves up for the photo sessions is n't that kind of loaded , this idea of women and beauty and prison ? i 'm not sure - that 's what i wanted to figure out : ' is it problematic for women , or not ? '
the prison administration was doubtful - they did n't think any of the women would want to present themselves in an exhibition , which is what my intention was from the start .
but 15 women wanted to participate , and that was a green light for my project from the get-go . what do you think the motivation was for these women to take part ? life in prison is quite boring .
participating in the project was almost like vacation - a departure from everyday life - for the women , who often sit for 23 hours a day in their cells .
for them , it was a connection to outside life . were n't the women ashamed to show themselves ? i 'm not sure .
they agreed to have their pictures taken .
some of the women were in prison for the second , third or fourth time .
one woman who agreed to take part had been free for a few months , then returned and said , ' hello , i 'm back , you can take more pictures of me . "
for her , it was like coming home again . do you have an example of one of the women 's stories , why she came to be in prison ? yes , i talked with the women , but their stories are supposed to remain private .
you can read the anonymous narratives hanging on the walls of the exhibition . some statistics show that women are victims themselves before they land in prison .
did you find that when you spoke with the women ? it was different .
you might find that in their narratives .
actually , a lot of these women were drug addicts , and many of them belong in a hospital or treatment center rather than a prison . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some felt the art project was an escape from everyday jail life what was one of the most difficult moments while you were photographing the women ? actually , it was beforehand - in convincing the prison administration to let me in .
they did n't really understand what i wanted and what my purpose was , but as soon as they got an idea of what i was aiming for - not criticizing the place , but just presenting the bit of beauty among the women in the prison - it was fine . how do you define beauty ? you have it or you do n't .
it 's not easily defined .
i can show it better than describe it in words .
each woman here in the exhibition has some form of beauty , even if it 's just something in her expression . is n't this a contrast , the idea of beauty and women in prison ? yes .
it 's difficult for people to imagine that women want to take care of themselves in jail , but many of the prisoners told me that it 's important to them , but they do n't have much of a chance to do that .
for the photo sessions , they made themselves up , had their hair cut . how did you try to make the women feel comfortable with you ? i brought cookies , cigarettes , tea .
and i talked with them - it was n't just a photo session with each , but also a chat . you trained as an architect , then switched to painting and finally , photography .
why ? i painted for 10 years - abstract painting .
but then i realized that there are just some things you can only capture in a moment , and i switched to photography .
my first photography project was in a slaughterhouse - i was impressed by the colors i could capture there , and the moment when life is extinguished .
you ca n't get this moment across in abstract paintings . do you think this project is political - the " women in prison " portraits ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some of the women said personal hygiene products are rare in prison no .
it 's human .
i do n't want to criticize anyone .
this is simply part of life , even if it 's scary at times . why women and not men ?
men can be beautiful too … because people think of women and not men when they hear the word beauty . you asked women to write some things down about beauty .
why ? because i wanted to know their opinions about the subject and not mine .
maybe they do n't think about it at all .
but from the letters , i can tell they do .
life is tough in prison , and it leaves traces on people 's faces much more than among people who are free . when one reads the narratives , it 's clear that the women are also struggling with other problems , like their drug addiction , missing their children , their safety .
is n't it a luxury to be asking questions about beauty , when the women are facing much tougher issues ? i do n't really know . interview : louisa schaefer editor : kate bowen the exhibition at the neues kunstforum in cologne runs through sept .

the european parliament has agreed on rules to closely monitor procedures , with a complete ban on using some species . animal experiments in the eu are set to become fewer in number and subject to stricter rules under a new directive backed by the european parliament on wednesday .
the european commission rules were described as a " quantum leap for animal protection " by european parliamentarian elisabeth jeggle , a german christian democrat who steered the directive through parliament .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : potocnik said the eu was setting new standards the measures , which would still allow the testing of animals for medical research , were described as setting the highest animal welfare standards in the world by eu environment commissioner janez potocnik .
under the legislation , national authorities will have to assess the animal welfare implications of every experiment carried out .
each country will be given two years to comply with the rules , and authorities must " ensure that whenever an alternative method is available , this is used instead of animal testing . "
in addition , animal welfare officials must also work at ensuring that pain experienced in experiments that actually go ahead is reduced .
ban on use of certain primates the rules also place greater restrictions on the use of primates in testing .
experiments on great apes such as chimpanzees , gorillas and orangutans are to be banned , while " strict " restrictions are to be introduced on the use of primates more generally .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the directive includes a ban on tests on great apes the legislation allows researchers to use primates in testing illnesses such as alzheimer 's disease , cancer or parkinson 's disease only where there is scientific evidence that no alternative is available .
eu health and consumer policy commissioner john dalli called the directive - which updates rules last agreed in 1986 - " a good compromise on a difficult topic . "
however , not every member of parliament was satisfied .
" i would have liked even stricter restrictions , " said ulrike rodust , a germany social democrat .
some 12 million animals are experimented upon each year in the eu .
last year the eu banned animal testing for developing cosmetics , apart from long-running toxicology tests , which will be banned in 2013 .

the court said the gambling laws were being applied inconsistently . the german government 's monopoly on most forms of gambling must be ended immediately , according to the european court of justice in luxembourg .
the court ruled that " the german rules do not limit games of chance in a consistent and systematic manner . " it said that the state the monopoly is not justifiable .
under german law , only the country 's 16 federal states or companies run by them can offer gambling services .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de demographics -pipe- 08.09.2010 ' the smart ones all want to leave ' großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : about 150 apartments are demolished every year twenty years after unification , the country 's east is a radically different place .
structural changes have left urban populations in decline , and the brightest inhabitants are usually the first to go . right on germany 's eastern border the town of schwedt overlooks the river oder .
in the 1960s , this was a boom town : people moved here in tens of thousands to work in the local oil refinery .
but since reunification that trend has been radically reversed .
the pr assistant in schwedt town hall insists that the mayor himself will answer any questions .
" urban restructuring is a matter for the boss , " she says .
sure enough , the mayor , juergen polzehl , a gray-haired man in his mid-50s , invites me to go for a ride with him in his official car .
he tells the chauffeur to drive us to the kuelz district .
on the way there we pass row upon row of prefabricated apartment blocks - a legacy of the final , brief heyday of the uckermark regional municipality .
the town 's population swelled to 52,000 after the refinery was built , and housing had to be created for all the new arrivals .
rapid decline in population bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mayor polzehl says schwedt has spent billions of euros on urban restructuring then came german reunification .
workers at the refinery were laid off .
in the past 20 years , 20,000 people have moved away from schwedt .
at one time thousands of apartments stood empty .
" we had to respond to the situation , " says polzehl , pointing out of the window .
suddenly the buildings are interrupted by a wide , uneven open space .
" all this was apartment blocks , one after another .
now it 's all been returned to nature , " polzehl explains .
for a while they were demolishing as many as a thousand apartments in a year in schwedt .
now , polzehl says , it 's about 150 per year : the contraction of the town is gradually becoming more manageable .
billions of euros have been spent on urban restructuring .
demolition , reconstruction and reforestation help alleviate the sadness of the shrinking towns , but the alteration of the demographic has had a lasting effect on the makeup of the population .
polzehl is particularly concerned that so many young women have moved away .
this is a problem for many of the regions - and it has led to a severe shortage of young women in the new federal states .
the newspaper die welt reports that , in the 25-30 age bracket , in the east there are only 85 women for every 100 men .
polzehl remains optimistic .
" perhaps that will change if we locate a few businesses here and a local authority office .
that 'll improve the job situation , " he says , hopefully .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the oil refinery was once the city 's largest employer brain drain the mayor has set himself a considerable challenge .
conditions here , as in many parts of eastern germany , are not good .
the unemployment figure for the country as a whole is less than eight percent , but the east is struggling with more than 12 percent unemployment .
in schwedt it is even higher at 16 percent .
more efficient production methods and the closing or relocation of industry have greatly reduced the number of jobs available in the east .
those who are able to leave , do .
salaries , too , are higher in the west .
the young , the intelligent and the educated are leading the exodus , leaving behind the old and those described by despairing employers as " barely trainable . "
in an interview with the berliner zeitung in 2004 , ulf matthiesen , a researcher in area studies , described them as " unemployed urban idiots with no family ties and no prospect of forming a relationship . "
in parts of brandenburg and mecklenburg-western pomerania the number of pupils dropping out of school is 50 percent higher than the national average .
more than 10 percent leave school early , according to heike liebmann , head of the city regeneration department at the leibniz institute for regional development .
she describes this as an indication of the degree to which the general level of education among the local population has fallen .
furthermore , the fewer creative and enterprising people there are in public life , the less attractive the prospect of staying here becomes for those left behind .
it 's a vicious circle .
every year , ruediger ober-bloebaum resigns himself to seeing more of schwedt 's bright young people move away .
the stocky 50-year-old is the headmaster of the town 's last remaining high school .
last summer 103 pupils graduated , but he says : " of these , only seven are staying in schwedt .
the others are all going away to study or start an apprenticeship , and only 10 of those think they might come back . "
ober-bloebaum supposes schwedt is too quiet for them ; there 's just not enough going on there .
but there 's another problem , too .
he refers to a 2007 study by the berlin institute for population and development which suggested " that the girls are leaving because they find the boys here too stupid . "
wild , wild east bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : large parts of schwedt are returning to nature before unification in 1990 , then-chancellor helmut kohl spoke of the prospect of " landscapes in bloom . "
he used the term as a metaphor for the economic development of the east , but in recent years regional planners have suggested it should be taken literally .
they have proposed returning parts of eastern germany to nature .
liebmann says it 's hard to imagine how the movement of people could be controlled in such a process , but she adds that " it is certainly useful for society to consider whether it can afford to maintain the existing infrastructure in areas that are becoming less densely populated . "
polzehl is dismissive of such ideas .
" we ca n't just let all this become a jungle .
we have our roots here ; this is our home . "
and schwedt still has good things to offer .
it is responsible for 15 percent of the industrial production of the state of brandenburg , and germany 's only meadowland national park is right next door .
on the way back to the town hall , mayor polzehl draws encouragement from his own life story .
" i moved away too , when i was young , " he says .
" and now i 'm back again . "

now , 20 years on , germany has been fully accepted by its european neighbors . it was in january 1990 , during a walk along the french atlantic coast , that the then-chancellor helmut kohl convinced french president francois mitterrand to support german unification .
mitterrand was skeptical at first , but kohl persuaded him by pledging his commitment to european integration .
with france on board , helmut kohl had the backing of germany 's most important european neighbor .
french sentiment had normalized in a way that it had not done to the same degree in britain and the united states , says french political theorist and journalist alfred grosser .
" with a few exceptions , french opinion polls show that people here saw the germans as friends .
they thought it perfectly natural that the two states should become one again , " he said .
indeed , kohl did not have the same success with his british colleague , prime minister margaret thatcher .
she opposed a unified germany ; but she was replaced as british leader in november 1990 by her fellow conservative party member john major .
germany furthered european integration bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kohl 's passion about european integration convinced mitterrand kohl promised that germany would maintain the european union course of greater integration , which he reaffirmed a year later : " unified germany does not want a return to the europe of yesterday , " he declared to the bundestag .
" there can been no revival of old rivalries and nationalisms .
we want a new europe - one that does not suppress our national identity , one in which countries no longer oppose one another , where no nation stands in the shadow of another , but -lsb- a europe -rsb- in which , together , we can guarantee a future in peace and freedom , prosperity and security . "
over the 20 years since reunification , german governments of all political colors have upheld kohl 's promise : germany championed the admission of the former east bloc states into the eu ; it paid for the eu 's eastward expansion , and the germans gave up their currency , the deutschmark , for the euro . '
german unity signifies european unity ' the reservations many of germany 's neighbors still harbored about the country they had fought in world war ii gradually disappeared .
belgium , for example , had no qualms about germany 's increased size , according to political scientist dirk rochtus of lessius hogeschool university college in antwerp .
" german unity also signifies european unity , " he said .
" that was clear to us here in belgium .
if the two german nations come together again , it also signifies that we have overcome the division of europe .
we see that as a good thing . "
the older generation , which had lived through the german occupation of belgium , did have doubts though .
" naturally there are older people who still have memories of that time , " rochtus said .
" but generally it has to be said that the response has been quite matter-of-fact - and also that we make a distinction between a people , in this case the german people , and the regime that governed this people and headed the occupation regime in belgium .
we make a very big distinction between the two . "
poles and czechs skeptical germany 's neighbors to the east , poland and the czech republic , also had many initial reservations .
after the political upheaval they had experienced , poles realized that germany no longer made any claims on their country and that the german government was serious about european unity , according to janusz reiter , poland 's former ambassador to bonn -lrb- 1990-1995 -rrb- .
" nowadays , germany 's size is no reason for its neighbors to be afraid , " he said .
" the relationship between germany and poland is still not entirely free of ambivalence and tensions , but for different reasons . "
poles are well aware of germany 's economic strength , and are keen to go to their western neighbor to earn money , he added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poles like andrzej stasiuk remain cautious when it comes to germany but there are limits , according to polish author andrzej stasiuk .
" very few poles would think of going to germany on holiday , " he said .
" you do n't go to germany for fun . "
in a recent article for german magazine focus , stasiuk wrote : " germany is not to be taken for granted ; germany is equivocal .
you have to keep your eyes on germany . "
prague-based political scientist robert schuster believes that until the end of the 1990s czechs were afraid of germany - and of the possibility that germans expelled after world war ii might make claims against them .
tensions between the two only started to ease after they signed a joint declaration in 1998 .
the declaration addressed the wounds of the past , as well as crimes committed during and after world war ii ; and it also highlighted perspectives for a joint future .
" the two countries are not competing anymore , " schuster said .
" they are no longer enemies , but members of a community , the eu .
and members of nato .
this aspect of security policy should not be underestimated . "
and he added that young czechs - who have had the opportunity to travel to germany , to study there and meet germans of their own age - have a completely different image of germans to that of the generation aged 50 and over .
football instigated the breakthrough the netherlands , luxembourg , switzerland and austria at first held back , but then gave their approval to german unification .
today , the spending power of german tourists means they are more popular than ever in their neighboring countries , although opinion polls suggest that germans themselves do n't quite believe this .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 2006 world cup showed a side of the country that many had not seen before " we ca n't tell the difference any more between ossis and wessis - that is , germans from the former east or west , " said austrian historian oliver radkolb .
and germany 's northern neighbor , denmark , has also accepted the new , larger germany , according to danish writer knud romer .
for decades danes regarded the germans as a nation of perpetrators , as did many other people in europe , he pointed out .
the breakthrough came with the soccer world cup , which germany hosted in 2006 , he added .
" that was when i realized , for the first time , that the war was over .
finished .
there 's none of that anymore , " romer said .
" and the danes were cheering the germans on . "

" nowadays , germany 's size is no reason for its neighbors to be afraid , " he said .
" the relationship between germany and poland is still not entirely free of ambivalence and tensions , but for different reasons . "
poles are well aware of germany 's economic strength , and are keen to go to their western neighbor to earn money , he added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poles like andrzej stasiuk remain cautious when it comes to germany but there are limits , according to polish author andrzej stasiuk .
" very few poles would think of going to germany on holiday , " he said .
" you do n't go to germany for fun . "
in a recent article for german magazine focus , stasiuk wrote : " germany is not to be taken for granted ; germany is equivocal .
you have to keep your eyes on germany . "
prague-based political scientist robert schuster believes that until the end of the 1990s czechs were afraid of germany - and of the possibility that germans expelled after world war ii might make claims against them .
tensions between the two only started to ease after they signed a joint declaration in 1998 .
the declaration addressed the wounds of the past , as well as crimes committed during and after world war ii ; and it also highlighted perspectives for a joint future .
" the two countries are not competing anymore , " schuster said .
" they are no longer enemies , but members of a community , the eu .
and members of nato .
this aspect of security policy should not be underestimated . "
and he added that young czechs - who have had the opportunity to travel to germany , to study there and meet germans of their own age - have a completely different image of germans to that of the generation aged 50 and over .
football instigated the breakthrough the netherlands , luxembourg , switzerland and austria at first held back , but then gave their approval to german unification .
today , the spending power of german tourists means they are more popular than ever in their neighboring countries , although opinion polls suggest that germans themselves do n't quite believe this .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 2006 world cup showed a side of the country that many had not seen before " we ca n't tell the difference any more between ossis and wessis - that is , germans from the former east or west , " said austrian historian oliver radkolb .
and germany 's northern neighbor , denmark , has also accepted the new , larger germany , according to danish writer knud romer .
for decades danes regarded the germans as a nation of perpetrators , as did many other people in europe , he pointed out .
the breakthrough came with the soccer world cup , which germany hosted in 2006 , he added .
" that was when i realized , for the first time , that the war was over .
finished .
there 's none of that anymore , " romer said .
" and the danes were cheering the germans on . "

the groups caused up to 6 billion euros in lost revenue , prosecutors have said . following police raids that led to the seizure of computer servers in 12 european countries on tuesday , belgian authorities provided details on wednesday about the scope , economic impact , and type of content they uncovered after breaking up four internet piracy rings .

the project helps parents with migrant backgrounds and their children improve their literacy skills through storytelling . four million of the more than 750 million illiterate people in the world live in germany , and a disproportionate number of them are immigrants or have an immigrant background .
the " family literacy " project -lrb- fly -rrb- focuses on that group , which makes up 14 percent of hamburg 's population , and for that reason it was singled out for unesco 's 2010 literacy award .
fly , a pilot project initiated and run by the hamburg state institute for teacher training and school development , uses an intergenerational approach to ensure closer cooperation and better communication between the school and the childrens ' home " it 's our goal to get the parents interested in reading more at home with their children and in engaging more strongly with language , " gabriele rabkin , the head of fly , told deutsche welle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an intergenerational approach benefits adults and children forty-four schools in hamburg participate in the program , which was started six years ago .
nearly 1,000 parents and as many children take part in the project every year .
parents welcome every two weeks , parents join their children , mainly preschoolers and first-graders , in the classroom .
they see how their kids engage with words and storytelling - and they 're allowed to help .
fly 's teachers encourage the adults to make sure their children speak in complete sentences outside of class , take time to look at picture books together or point out individual letters on the way to school .
ute stather , who teaches first and second graders at hamburg 's osterbrook school , has been with the project from the start .
" the parents see what we are doing and that helps them understand where they have to support their child , " she said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sometimes aunts , grandmothers and siblings join the classes the families are not discouraged from speaking their native language in class .
on the contrary , teachers view multilingualism as an asset , stather said .
" if people speak and read a lot in their native tongue , their children will also learn german much more easily . "
many of the parents also see fly classes as a chance to learn german , according to rabkin .
the teachers also do n't put pressure on the adults to read and speak in german with their children at home ; what was important was for them to deal with language as such .
" we do n't see parents as assistant teachers - they are their children 's first and most important teachers , " rabkin said .

a new law came into effect on april 1 providing children with access to free education .
but children ’ s rights organizations complain about the implementation . it is 2 o ’ clock at a school in the old part of pune .
classes are supposed to run from 12.30 to 5.30 pm at baburao sana ’ s school , just like in other state school but there ’ s no learning going on in this classroom .
instead there is chaos .
class one ’ s teacher is not here .
the children are playing , crying , shouting , or just running around . gangu is a seven years old girl .
her black hair is short and she has a gold nose ring .
she is wearing the school uniform , a yellow blouse and a grey pinafore .
she looks upon the chaos calmly .
she knows that the teacher always comes very late .
" we play here while we wait " , she says . ngo provides education for children of migrant workers gangu belongs to the nomadic pardhi tribe who are migrant workers .
all year round , they travel the country , looking for work .
they sell flowers or balloons on the streets to earn some money .
she had never been to school before because she was always on the road .
but last year she was adopted by the ngo ekalavya .
she now lives in a home with other pardhi children and goes to school everyday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : queuing in school uniform for food it is 3pm .
priyanka gaikwad , the teacher , finally arrives .
she tells the children to calm down .
she explains that she was late because she had to fill out some official forms in the headmistress ’ office .
" we often have other duties apart from school " , gaikwad complains .
" we have to compile reports for the government or help with the census . "
because class one ’ s exams are in a couple of days the headmistress gave her this work .
moreover , her colleague from another class is on holiday so she has to teach both classes together .
but there is not enough space and it is very chaotic . problem of crowded classes instead of 30 children , there are 60 sitting here - some are even crouching on the floor .
gangu takes her seat between two other girls .
the first subject of the day is marathi – the main language of maharashtra . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : too many pupils , too less space the children first learn the letters .
then they have to name words that they know which begin with these letters .
the teacher has a stick to beat the children with if they are too loud or talk among themselves .
although she ’ s officially not allowed , she says it ’ s impossible to discipline the children otherwise . indian school system not effective many of the children are quiet however .
they know they have their exam soon .
gangu also wants to take it but she is not allowed .
she is not registered at the school because she does not have a birth certificate .
she missed the deadline to get a certificate from the local state hospital .
this means she might have to wait for a year to get a certificate and repeat the year . many pardhi children have gone back to their parents and their nomadic way of life for this very reason .
they get bored when they have to repeat the class .
gangu is adamant that this will not happen .
she wants to go into class two , be successful , build a big house for her parents and live with them .
children ’ s rights activists hope that the new law will help overcome these bureaucratic barriers , otherwise they fear for universal education in india .

the same reasons are given by australia like in france such as an aging population and life expectancy . - stuart , australia unless the strikers can come up with a way to pay for their pensions , 62 is early .
what are they planning to do , sit around and wait to die ? - marga , us the retirement age should be raised because unaffordable benefits now will transfer the financial burden to the upcoming generations .
we will rely more and more on low wage manufacturing for affordable products , further exacerbating the problem . - steve , france the unions in france should fight against this reactionary measure and do what ever is necessary to stop the government from doing this disgraceful act against the people .
the president of france is similar to adolphe thiers who in 1871 ordered the french troops to eliminate the working class of paris .
what the french government is doing should be condemned by the working class every where in the world . - stan , canada german energy policy it really would be the greenest energy policy , relatively speaking , if the remaining energy in the spent nuclear fuel was used for something .
that would reduce the toxicity of spent fuel .
anything else would be irresponsible . - gene , us nein !
non !
no !
the decision is not good for our planet and chancellor merkel should know better , being a scientist .
but it good to see some compromise within the government debate . - stuart , australia i can not believe the german people are so blind on this subject .
the world is facing a climate catastrophe and needs to reduce co2 emissions as soon as possible .
germany , like australia , has high co2 emissions but believes that renewables are the answer .
please do the math ; no country , including germany , has ever reduced co2 emissions using renewables .
the only successful non-carbon technology is nuclear power which your neighbors france , switzerland and sweden have successfully used to reduce co2 emissions .
facts , not fantasy , must drive decision-making . - tom , australia germany must have a continuous reliable source of electricity and the present nuclear plants should run for their designed lifetimes .
there should not be any further construction of fossil fuel power stations unless they replace older ones that have reached the end of their most efficient lifespan . - roland , new zealand i think germany needs to review their energy policy , now that the country is not so vulnerable to geopolitical controls on natural gas .

the artist asked the women to describe what " beauty " meant to them in everyday prison life . it sounds rather macabre or , at the very least , a contradiction in terms - asking female prisoners to address the notion of beauty .
russian photographer igor chepikov , who has been living in cologne , germany since 1991 , visited a women 's penitentiary weekly for over 10 months .
there , after splashing a wall in white paint to serve as a backdrop , he took thousands pictures of some of the inmates .
those snapshots were ultimately distilled into a selection of just 56 photographs that compose the exhibition called " bad ossendorf : women in prison " now on show in cologne . the title is a play on words .
" bad " in front of the name a place normally refers to a spa town in german .
" ossendorf " is the name of the penitentiary outside of cologne .
" bad ossendorf , " then , could be translated as " resort ossendorf , " but is intended to also imply english connotations , as in " bad love , bad money , bad company . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the photographer took 24 pictures of each participant however one chooses to view the name , the subject of the exhibition - women in prison confronted with the topic of " beauty " - sounds like it 's begging for feminist critique .
after all , many of the female prisoners have more existential issues to address than philosophical matters like the definition of beauty .
they are worried about their children , who are now sitting in orphanages .
they are dismayed about the pain they have caused their relatives .
they want to liberate themselves from a vicious circle of crime . the photographer chepikov , at least , gave space to the women 's voices - choosing not just to display his photographs of them , but also to literally frame their " narratives . "
the photographer asked the women to answer certain questions in written form - to describe what beauty meant to them , if they felt they had lost time in prison , what effect prison had had on their bodies and souls ? some of the answers : " the feeling of loneliness is the worst . "
" i never thought prison could make a person look so bad . "
" there is no place to buy make-up here , or any other kind of personal hygiene products . "
" once i saw the photos , i realized how horrible the effects of the drugs have been . "
" i wish i could turn back the clock . "
" for me , ' beauty ' here in the prison essentially means being clean . " deutsche welle spoke with the photographer , igor chepikov , to get his take on " women in prison . " deutsche welle : why these photographs of women in prison ? why did you choose to do this ? igor chepikov : i came up with the idea about six years ago .
i was sitting in the moscow subway , and was looking out of the windows and thinking about the song " as time goes by . "
and then , i started reading something about prisons and got to thinking about what life is like in prisons .
a man , for instance , could be 20 years old and get 15 years in jail , but he 's only 35 when he gets out .
but when he 's 45 and gets out of prison -lsb- 15 years later -rsb- , he 's 60 .
life is over for him , and he has no possibility to change .
for women , it 's even harder - not only can they not adapt at that age , they have also lost their beauty .
i realized that i should take pictures of them before that happens . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some of the women spiffed themselves up for the photo sessions is n't that kind of loaded , this idea of women and beauty and prison ? i 'm not sure - that 's what i wanted to figure out : ' is it problematic for women , or not ? '
the prison administration was doubtful - they did n't think any of the women would want to present themselves in an exhibition , which is what my intention was from the start .
but 15 women wanted to participate , and that was a green light for my project from the get-go . what do you think the motivation was for these women to take part ? life in prison is quite boring .
participating in the project was almost like vacation - a departure from everyday life - for the women , who often sit for 23 hours a day in their cells .
for them , it was a connection to outside life . were n't the women ashamed to show themselves ? i 'm not sure .
they agreed to have their pictures taken .
some of the women were in prison for the second , third or fourth time .
one woman who agreed to take part had been free for a few months , then returned and said , ' hello , i 'm back , you can take more pictures of me . "
for her , it was like coming home again . do you have an example of one of the women 's stories , why she came to be in prison ? yes , i talked with the women , but their stories are supposed to remain private .
you can read the anonymous narratives hanging on the walls of the exhibition . some statistics show that women are victims themselves before they land in prison .
did you find that when you spoke with the women ? it was different .
you might find that in their narratives .
actually , a lot of these women were drug addicts , and many of them belong in a hospital or treatment center rather than a prison . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some felt the art project was an escape from everyday jail life what was one of the most difficult moments while you were photographing the women ? actually , it was beforehand - in convincing the prison administration to let me in .
they did n't really understand what i wanted and what my purpose was , but as soon as they got an idea of what i was aiming for - not criticizing the place , but just presenting the bit of beauty among the women in the prison - it was fine . how do you define beauty ? you have it or you do n't .
it 's not easily defined .
i can show it better than describe it in words .
each woman here in the exhibition has some form of beauty , even if it 's just something in her expression . is n't this a contrast , the idea of beauty and women in prison ? yes .
it 's difficult for people to imagine that women want to take care of themselves in jail , but many of the prisoners told me that it 's important to them , but they do n't have much of a chance to do that .
for the photo sessions , they made themselves up , had their hair cut . how did you try to make the women feel comfortable with you ? i brought cookies , cigarettes , tea .
and i talked with them - it was n't just a photo session with each , but also a chat . you trained as an architect , then switched to painting and finally , photography .
why ? i painted for 10 years - abstract painting .
but then i realized that there are just some things you can only capture in a moment , and i switched to photography .
my first photography project was in a slaughterhouse - i was impressed by the colors i could capture there , and the moment when life is extinguished .

why ? because i wanted to know their opinions about the subject and not mine .
maybe they do n't think about it at all .
but from the letters , i can tell they do .
life is tough in prison , and it leaves traces on people 's faces much more than among people who are free . when one reads the narratives , it 's clear that the women are also struggling with other problems , like their drug addiction , missing their children , their safety .
is n't it a luxury to be asking questions about beauty , when the women are facing much tougher issues ? i do n't really know . interview : louisa schaefer editor : kate bowen the exhibition at the neues kunstforum in cologne runs through sept .

program guide programs tomorrow today video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de home / dw-tv latinoamerica : tomorrow today science -pipe- 08.09.2010 interview with physics prize nobel laureate klaus von klitzing großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dw-tv : joining us here is physics prize nobel laureate klaus von klitzing .
he won the nobel prize in the year 1985 for the discovery of the quantum hall effect .
now i suppose after getting the prize you were probably pretty busy .
how long did it take until you could really get back to research ? klaus von klitzing : i am always in the laboratory , so if i am at home it 's about 50 percent of my time .
no , i am always in the laboratory .
i have a big group of young students .
and i always have to be able to tell new things in order to attend conferences , so i need new material .
therefore , i need to do research and this is the most important thing .
to keep up with modern research . but life probably changed after winning the nobel prize .
i mean your opinion is now important to everybody . yes , that 's one problem .
you have to say something in fields where you are not a specialist .
so you know something about physics and you have to say something about global warming .
it 's also related to physics , but also nuclear energy , weapons , all kinds of things .
so this is much more difficult .
but you have a lot of connections to people where you can rely on their opinion and you can get some information .
and you have to do something for the public , to say this is the right direction , in my opinion , but even nobel laureates they disagree sometimes in certain fields .
and this is an interesting point to have this discussion , to have a broad range of opinion and then to find the truth . what do you think distinguishes a nobel prize laureate ?
what is so special about you ? special is that unlike with politicians , many people believe that what you are saying is the absolute truth .
to a certain degree it 's true , but we do n't know everything .
but to a certain extent you can influence the public .
this is some extra burden also because suddenly you discover that what you are saying translates as one to one .
and sometimes it 's dangerous because as a scientist you do n't always have a fixed opinion about all things .
it 's floating , you are learning all the time .
so this is a burden to all of the laureates . f rom about 802 nobel prize laureates , we 've had only about 40 women .
do you have an explanation for that ? yes , it 's always more difficult for women in some cultures.in other countries in islamic countries in jordan there were more than 50 percent of phyics students who were female .
and if you go to france even , they also have more female scientists .
so it 's got something to do with the environment with the conditions , with the tradition , what is a family .
and i think that we have to learn something in germany about how to support female scientists .
to have an environment where they can continue their research .
because if you are away for three years in research , you lose contact with the top scientific questions .
so therefore you have to find some solutions , so you can combine both : a family and science .

fewer , however , lay their hats in berlin , regardless of its cool , capital status . " increased competition for clever minds " is the title of a report analyzing migration from cities with more than half a million residents .
its three authors from the institute of employment research -lrb- iab -rrb- paint a picture in which well-educated germans most readily move to places renowned for their political leanings , their solid foundations , their ability to provide work and perhaps even for their good air , be it of the sea or mountain variety .
in many ways , the findings are not surprising .
not only for the cities that did feature at the top of the popularity chart , but also for those that did not .
most notably : germany 's unconventional capital berlin , which unlike hamburg and munich , has not had the benefit of being able to continually evolve since the days of the post-war economic miracle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : munich is the most popular career destination for well-educated germans after 40 years of division and almost 20 years of reunification , berlin is still trying to find its feet , economically speaking .
as martin gornig , the head of innovation , manufacturing and service at the german institute for economic research told deutsche welle , the capital city does not boast the kind of economic framework that entices people hoping to launch prosperous careers .
" berlin does n't have bmw or allianz , " he says .
" the big companies left berlin and they have not come back . "
and nor are they likely to , given the difficulties associated with uprooting established companies .
" what berlin has to do now is grow new ones , " gornig says .
" it might be a slow process , but it has to happen . "
gornig is not talking about new car manufacturers or new insurance companies , but about berlin playing to its greatest strength : creativity .
it has always had a reputation for attracting artists , but in recent years the capital has become a veritable stomping ground for those pointedly seeking inspiration over security .
creative renown the city 's creative pool is deep .
designers , musicians , painters , fashion designers and filmmakers add to it and drink from it .
art feeds art in berlin .
and while that does not necessarily a make a booming economy , it does provide the capital with some excellent long-term prospects .
" almost everything in berlin relates in some way or another to creativity , " says volker hassemer of stiftung zukunft berlin -lrb- foundation for the future of berlin -rrb- .
" take telekom for example , they have a large creative department here , which is entirely because of the type of people that live in the city . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin has a thriving art scene and the telecommunications giant is not alone .
hassemer says businesses actively seeking creative input have picked up on the fact that it pays to offer creative jobs in berlin because they know they will stand a better chance of getting good people .
geppert goes one step further .
he says the german capital appeals to the kind of workers who are not only creative in what they do , but in the way they live their lives .
" we 're not talking here about people who want permanent contracts with all the perks of holiday and sick pay , but about those who come to berlin without work and who are willing to be freelance or take short-term contacts . "
more marketing yet for all that , there is a sense that germany 's biggest city could be doing a bit more to sell its creative vein to the commercial world , as well as to tourists and artists .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin fashion week is an annual fixture " we need to recognize the potential of what we have , " hassemer says , adding that the arts and culture landscape is currently too fractured to be of serious economic value .
he believes the capital needs to be more up front about how it wants to use the creative talent residing within its boundaries .
and for that it needs a cluster organization .
" cities should show themselves to the outside world , " hassemer said .
" berlin has a cluster for health care management , but has not managed to establish one for its creative industries , and that is a failure . "
he says that while establishing a cluster is not inherently easy , it could be done .
the major impediment is bad management on the part of politicians , who are too bound up in minor tussles to extend a hand of partnership to the creative branch .
hassemer is very clear that berlin should get on top of its potential sooner rather than later , because to squander it may well be to inflict lasting damage .
" how are we going to continue to compete as europeans when other countries are growing and producing so fast ? " he asks .
" not with manufactured products but with our cultural maturity . "

the major impediment is bad management on the part of politicians , who are too bound up in minor tussles to extend a hand of partnership to the creative branch .
hassemer is very clear that berlin should get on top of its potential sooner rather than later , because to squander it may well be to inflict lasting damage .
" how are we going to continue to compete as europeans when other countries are growing and producing so fast ? " he asks .
" not with manufactured products but with our cultural maturity . "

but a comparison between debates in germany and the united states suggests they shed more heat than light . with the publication of his book " deutschland schafft sich ab " -lrb- " germany abolishes itself " -rrb- in late august , banker and politician thilo sarrazin gifted the german media an incendiary topic for the autumn .
among the book 's controversial theses is the idea that higher fertility rates would allow non-assimilated muslims to dominate germany in the not-too-distant future .
the book tapped into fears among some germans that german culture and the german way of life is in danger .
but the discussions engendered were reminiscent of similar debates in other cultures .
in the united states , the publication in 2004 of a book entitled " who are we ? " by political scientist samuel p. huntington sparked discussions about whether the increasing prevalence of spanish-speaking americans would bifurcate us culture and threaten what the author called the american " creed " of enlightenment democracy .
but though the subject matters are seemingly similar , the levels of discourse in the two debates are very different .
german immigration expert klaus j. bade praises sarrazin for pointing up abuse of the german welfare system by migrants and germans .
but he takes the author to task in other areas .
" huntington 's book was more scientifically informed , whereas sarrazin knows as much about demography as i do about his specialty , state finances : namely just bits and pieces , " bade told deutsche welle .
" in this field he 's a populist writer who partly trades in cheap commonplaces and looks for statistical evidence for pre-conceived ideas - the exact opposite of the scientific method .

the united states is a nation with a growing population and a rising number of immigrants , which from its very inception embraced the idea of foreigners becoming citizens .
germany , on the other hand , has stagnant population and immigration and was traditionally wary of taking in non-germans looking to better their lots in life .
" social integration and acknowledgement of the dialogue with muslim communities - these things have developed over the past few years , " philip anderson , professor of social sciences at the university of regensburg , told deutsche welle .
" but there needs to be more of that and far less of the fear of a sullying of the german identity and sometimes even german blood . "
debates about assimilation in germany and in other western european countries are additionally heated because most of the foreign residents and immigrants in question are muslim .
but klaus bade warns against seeing them as a homogeneous group .
" there 's no such thing as a single muslim group in germany , " bade said .
" immigration from iran , for example , centered on elites who had little problem integrating into german society .
immigrant turks tended to come from rural anatolia , and not istanbul , and so there were educational problems , especially three generations ago .
but that had nothing to do with them being muslims .
problems among italian immigrants , for instance , were and still are worse . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thilo sarrazin -lrb- r . -rrb- has been doing the talk-show rounds self-fulfilling prophecies sarrazin has had to step down from his job on the board of germany 's federal bank , and may yet lose his membership in the social democratic party for his ill-advised and ill-informed opinions .
but is there anything to the points he - or huntington - raised ?
can demographic changes mean the end of a language , a culture and a way of life ?
" there is an aspect comparable between both books , namely the vision of a competition between cultures , " bade said .
" but competition is not the same thing as total war .
moreover , we should think less about groups and systems and more about individuals .
for many people the huntington book has something of a self-fulfilling prophecy .
it 's a circular argument that echoes older fears about the decline and fall of western civilization .
this seems , on a national level , comparable to sarrazin 's message . "
in other words , warnings about conflicts of civilizations - to paraphrase the title of another of huntington 's books - tend to create the sort of tension they claim to be decrying .
" generally there is far more acceptance - especially in the cities , where people lived together - than is usually acknowledged , " anderson said .
" politicians need to push that as a positive image of how people are getting on . "
for bade , reasoning that fails to distinguish and differentiate between individual attitudes among immigrants and resident aliens is inherently faulty .
" when asked ' when did you last go to a mosque , ' many european muslims may not know where the nearest one is or may respond : ' for religious or cultural reasons ? '
that 's comparable to the way many christians feel who may go to church to look at art or attend a wedding .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 08.09.2010 economists say berlin needs to embrace its creativity großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin wall remnants are a canvas for the city 's creatives a new study of german cities shows that the creme-de-la-creme of young professional minds are attracted to hamburg and munich .
fewer , however , lay their hats in berlin , regardless of its cool , capital status . " increased competition for clever minds " is the title of a report analyzing migration from cities with more than half a million residents .
its three authors from the institute of employment research -lrb- iab -rrb- paint a picture in which well-educated germans most readily move to places renowned for their political leanings , their solid foundations , their ability to provide work and perhaps even for their good air , be it of the sea or mountain variety .
in many ways , the findings are not surprising .
not only for the cities that did feature at the top of the popularity chart , but also for those that did not .
most notably : germany 's unconventional capital berlin , which unlike hamburg and munich , has not had the benefit of being able to continually evolve since the days of the post-war economic miracle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : munich is the most popular career destination for well-educated germans after 40 years of division and almost 20 years of reunification , berlin is still trying to find its feet , economically speaking .
as martin gornig , the head of innovation , manufacturing and service at the german institute for economic research told deutsche welle , the capital city does not boast the kind of economic framework that entices people hoping to launch prosperous careers .
" berlin does n't have bmw or allianz , " he says .
" the big companies left berlin and they have not come back . "
and nor are they likely to , given the difficulties associated with uprooting established companies .
" what berlin has to do now is grow new ones , " gornig says .
" it might be a slow process , but it has to happen . "
gornig is not talking about new car manufacturers or new insurance companies , but about berlin playing to its greatest strength : creativity .
it has always had a reputation for attracting artists , but in recent years the capital has become a veritable stomping ground for those pointedly seeking inspiration over security .
creative renown the city 's creative pool is deep .
designers , musicians , painters , fashion designers and filmmakers add to it and drink from it .
art feeds art in berlin .
and while that does not necessarily a make a booming economy , it does provide the capital with some excellent long-term prospects .
" almost everything in berlin relates in some way or another to creativity , " says volker hassemer of stiftung zukunft berlin -lrb- foundation for the future of berlin -rrb- .
" take telekom for example , they have a large creative department here , which is entirely because of the type of people that live in the city . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin has a thriving art scene and the telecommunications giant is not alone .
hassemer says businesses actively seeking creative input have picked up on the fact that it pays to offer creative jobs in berlin because they know they will stand a better chance of getting good people .
geppert goes one step further .
he says the german capital appeals to the kind of workers who are not only creative in what they do , but in the way they live their lives .
" we 're not talking here about people who want permanent contracts with all the perks of holiday and sick pay , but about those who come to berlin without work and who are willing to be freelance or take short-term contacts . "
more marketing yet for all that , there is a sense that germany 's biggest city could be doing a bit more to sell its creative vein to the commercial world , as well as to tourists and artists .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin fashion week is an annual fixture " we need to recognize the potential of what we have , " hassemer says , adding that the arts and culture landscape is currently too fractured to be of serious economic value .
he believes the capital needs to be more up front about how it wants to use the creative talent residing within its boundaries .
and for that it needs a cluster organization .
" cities should show themselves to the outside world , " hassemer said .
" berlin has a cluster for health care management , but has not managed to establish one for its creative industries , and that is a failure . "
he says that while establishing a cluster is not inherently easy , it could be done .
the major impediment is bad management on the part of politicians , who are too bound up in minor tussles to extend a hand of partnership to the creative branch .
hassemer is very clear that berlin should get on top of its potential sooner rather than later , because to squander it may well be to inflict lasting damage .
" how are we going to continue to compete as europeans when other countries are growing and producing so fast ? " he asks .
" not with manufactured products but with our cultural maturity . "

here , too , he was known for his extreme convictions . a german church founded and formerly led by terry jones , the american pastor who international attracted attention with controversial plans to stage a koran-burning ceremony , expressly denounced those plans on wednesday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jones ' former church is ' deeply disturbed ' by their former leader stephan baar , deputy chairman of the christliche gemeinde koeln -lrb- cgd -rrb- , the christian community of cologne , told deutsche welle that jones preached a strict , even fundamental understanding of the bible , but that no direct comparisons could be drawn between his sermons there and the radical views he is currently espousing at his new church .
" we want to make it clear that our church is opposed to what terry jones is advocating at the moment and that the cgd , even though he is the founder , has no more contact with him , " baar said .
the community asked him to leave in 2008 .
baar insisted that there were no controversies surrounding his departure .
" he just left ; we did not witness any of the deeply disturbing things we are seeing now .
pastor terry jones was placing too much emphasis on himself and distracting our members from their christian faiths .
he and our church simply went their separate ways . "
' gate to hell ' brigitte baetz , a cologne journalist who is a regular contributor on german public radio , said jones espoused radical christian views while at the helm of the cgd .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protests against the actions have begun in kabul baetz told deutsche welle that jones commonly referred to the city of cologne as a " gate to hell " and emphasized that christians were " persecuted " there and took on the role of " innocent victims who would be rewarded for their suffering . "
" in his sermons terry jones often convinced the members that they were made to suffer hardships because they were part of the cgd .
he said again and again that the members were the victims of persecution and that it led to them losing their jobs and social status , for instance . "
baetz said that jones ' sermons bordered on fundamentalist interpretations of the bible .
she singled out his vehement opposition to cologne plans to construct a mosque in the city as an example of his extremist views .
" terry jones saw religion as wrong and right .
he told his followers here in germany that christians , and especially members of his cgd , were the only ones who were right .
this is the basis , i believe , for what he is doing right now with his new church in florida , " baetz said .
us unable to prevent controversial burning leading figures around the globe have expressed fears that jones ' planned " international burn a koran day " could seriously strain relations between muslims and the west .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : petraeus said jones would provide propaganda for rebels david petraeus , the top us and nato commander in afghanistan , warned that " burning the holy book of islam provides propaganda for insurgents and could endanger the -lsb- alliance 's -rsb- overall effort . "
petraeus ' comments were echoed later by nato secretary general anders fogh rasmussen .
in response to petraeus ' words of caution , meanwhile , jones said on tuesday : " why do n't we send a warning to them ?
why do n't we send a warning to radical islam and say , ' do n't do it ? '
if you attack us , if you attack us , we will attack you . "
the united states government appears unable to prevent jones ' september 11 commemoration plans on saturday .
although florida fire authorities have turned down jones ' application to stage the open-air burning ceremony , police will not be allowed to intervene until the korans have actually been lit .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european ties -pipe- 08.09.2010 european neighbors warm to unified germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 2006 world cup cast a positive light on germany europeans were initially wary of the unification of divided germany .
now , 20 years on , germany has been fully accepted by its european neighbors . it was in january 1990 , during a walk along the french atlantic coast , that the then-chancellor helmut kohl convinced french president francois mitterrand to support german unification .
mitterrand was skeptical at first , but kohl persuaded him by pledging his commitment to european integration .
with france on board , helmut kohl had the backing of germany 's most important european neighbor .
french sentiment had normalized in a way that it had not done to the same degree in britain and the united states , says french political theorist and journalist alfred grosser .
" with a few exceptions , french opinion polls show that people here saw the germans as friends .
they thought it perfectly natural that the two states should become one again , " he said .
indeed , kohl did not have the same success with his british colleague , prime minister margaret thatcher .
she opposed a unified germany ; but she was replaced as british leader in november 1990 by her fellow conservative party member john major .
germany furthered european integration bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kohl 's passion about european integration convinced mitterrand kohl promised that germany would maintain the european union course of greater integration , which he reaffirmed a year later : " unified germany does not want a return to the europe of yesterday , " he declared to the bundestag .
" there can been no revival of old rivalries and nationalisms .
we want a new europe - one that does not suppress our national identity , one in which countries no longer oppose one another , where no nation stands in the shadow of another , but -lsb- a europe -rsb- in which , together , we can guarantee a future in peace and freedom , prosperity and security . "
over the 20 years since reunification , german governments of all political colors have upheld kohl 's promise : germany championed the admission of the former east bloc states into the eu ; it paid for the eu 's eastward expansion , and the germans gave up their currency , the deutschmark , for the euro . '
german unity signifies european unity ' the reservations many of germany 's neighbors still harbored about the country they had fought in world war ii gradually disappeared .
belgium , for example , had no qualms about germany 's increased size , according to political scientist dirk rochtus of lessius hogeschool university college in antwerp .
" german unity also signifies european unity , " he said .
" that was clear to us here in belgium .
if the two german nations come together again , it also signifies that we have overcome the division of europe .
we see that as a good thing . "
the older generation , which had lived through the german occupation of belgium , did have doubts though .
" naturally there are older people who still have memories of that time , " rochtus said .
" but generally it has to be said that the response has been quite matter-of-fact - and also that we make a distinction between a people , in this case the german people , and the regime that governed this people and headed the occupation regime in belgium .
we make a very big distinction between the two . "
poles and czechs skeptical germany 's neighbors to the east , poland and the czech republic , also had many initial reservations .
after the political upheaval they had experienced , poles realized that germany no longer made any claims on their country and that the german government was serious about european unity , according to janusz reiter , poland 's former ambassador to bonn -lrb- 1990-1995 -rrb- .
" nowadays , germany 's size is no reason for its neighbors to be afraid , " he said .
" the relationship between germany and poland is still not entirely free of ambivalence and tensions , but for different reasons . "
poles are well aware of germany 's economic strength , and are keen to go to their western neighbor to earn money , he added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poles like andrzej stasiuk remain cautious when it comes to germany but there are limits , according to polish author andrzej stasiuk .
" very few poles would think of going to germany on holiday , " he said .
" you do n't go to germany for fun . "
in a recent article for german magazine focus , stasiuk wrote : " germany is not to be taken for granted ; germany is equivocal .
you have to keep your eyes on germany . "
prague-based political scientist robert schuster believes that until the end of the 1990s czechs were afraid of germany - and of the possibility that germans expelled after world war ii might make claims against them .
tensions between the two only started to ease after they signed a joint declaration in 1998 .
the declaration addressed the wounds of the past , as well as crimes committed during and after world war ii ; and it also highlighted perspectives for a joint future .
" the two countries are not competing anymore , " schuster said .
" they are no longer enemies , but members of a community , the eu .
and members of nato .
this aspect of security policy should not be underestimated . "
and he added that young czechs - who have had the opportunity to travel to germany , to study there and meet germans of their own age - have a completely different image of germans to that of the generation aged 50 and over .
football instigated the breakthrough the netherlands , luxembourg , switzerland and austria at first held back , but then gave their approval to german unification .
today , the spending power of german tourists means they are more popular than ever in their neighboring countries , although opinion polls suggest that germans themselves do n't quite believe this .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 2006 world cup showed a side of the country that many had not seen before " we ca n't tell the difference any more between ossis and wessis - that is , germans from the former east or west , " said austrian historian oliver radkolb .
and germany 's northern neighbor , denmark , has also accepted the new , larger germany , according to danish writer knud romer .
for decades danes regarded the germans as a nation of perpetrators , as did many other people in europe , he pointed out .
the breakthrough came with the soccer world cup , which germany hosted in 2006 , he added .
" that was when i realized , for the first time , that the war was over .
finished .
there 's none of that anymore , " romer said .
" and the danes were cheering the germans on . "

structural changes have left urban populations in decline , and the brightest inhabitants are usually the first to go . right on germany 's eastern border the town of schwedt overlooks the river oder .
in the 1960s , this was a boom town : people moved here in tens of thousands to work in the local oil refinery .
but since reunification that trend has been radically reversed .
the pr assistant in schwedt town hall insists that the mayor himself will answer any questions .
" urban restructuring is a matter for the boss , " she says .
sure enough , the mayor , juergen polzehl , a gray-haired man in his mid-50s , invites me to go for a ride with him in his official car .
he tells the chauffeur to drive us to the kuelz district .
on the way there we pass row upon row of prefabricated apartment blocks - a legacy of the final , brief heyday of the uckermark regional municipality .
the town 's population swelled to 52,000 after the refinery was built , and housing had to be created for all the new arrivals .
rapid decline in population bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mayor polzehl says schwedt has spent billions of euros on urban restructuring then came german reunification .
workers at the refinery were laid off .
in the past 20 years , 20,000 people have moved away from schwedt .
at one time thousands of apartments stood empty .
" we had to respond to the situation , " says polzehl , pointing out of the window .
suddenly the buildings are interrupted by a wide , uneven open space .
" all this was apartment blocks , one after another .
now it 's all been returned to nature , " polzehl explains .
for a while they were demolishing as many as a thousand apartments in a year in schwedt .
now , polzehl says , it 's about 150 per year : the contraction of the town is gradually becoming more manageable .
billions of euros have been spent on urban restructuring .
demolition , reconstruction and reforestation help alleviate the sadness of the shrinking towns , but the alteration of the demographic has had a lasting effect on the makeup of the population .
polzehl is particularly concerned that so many young women have moved away .
this is a problem for many of the regions - and it has led to a severe shortage of young women in the new federal states .
the newspaper die welt reports that , in the 25-30 age bracket , in the east there are only 85 women for every 100 men .
polzehl remains optimistic .
" perhaps that will change if we locate a few businesses here and a local authority office .
that 'll improve the job situation , " he says , hopefully .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the oil refinery was once the city 's largest employer brain drain the mayor has set himself a considerable challenge .
conditions here , as in many parts of eastern germany , are not good .
the unemployment figure for the country as a whole is less than eight percent , but the east is struggling with more than 12 percent unemployment .
in schwedt it is even higher at 16 percent .
more efficient production methods and the closing or relocation of industry have greatly reduced the number of jobs available in the east .
those who are able to leave , do .
salaries , too , are higher in the west .
the young , the intelligent and the educated are leading the exodus , leaving behind the old and those described by despairing employers as " barely trainable . "
in an interview with the berliner zeitung in 2004 , ulf matthiesen , a researcher in area studies , described them as " unemployed urban idiots with no family ties and no prospect of forming a relationship . "
in parts of brandenburg and mecklenburg-western pomerania the number of pupils dropping out of school is 50 percent higher than the national average .
more than 10 percent leave school early , according to heike liebmann , head of the city regeneration department at the leibniz institute for regional development .
she describes this as an indication of the degree to which the general level of education among the local population has fallen .
furthermore , the fewer creative and enterprising people there are in public life , the less attractive the prospect of staying here becomes for those left behind .
it 's a vicious circle .
every year , ruediger ober-bloebaum resigns himself to seeing more of schwedt 's bright young people move away .
the stocky 50-year-old is the headmaster of the town 's last remaining high school .
last summer 103 pupils graduated , but he says : " of these , only seven are staying in schwedt .
the others are all going away to study or start an apprenticeship , and only 10 of those think they might come back . "
ober-bloebaum supposes schwedt is too quiet for them ; there 's just not enough going on there .
but there 's another problem , too .
he refers to a 2007 study by the berlin institute for population and development which suggested " that the girls are leaving because they find the boys here too stupid . "
wild , wild east bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : large parts of schwedt are returning to nature before unification in 1990 , then-chancellor helmut kohl spoke of the prospect of " landscapes in bloom . "
he used the term as a metaphor for the economic development of the east , but in recent years regional planners have suggested it should be taken literally .
they have proposed returning parts of eastern germany to nature .
liebmann says it 's hard to imagine how the movement of people could be controlled in such a process , but she adds that " it is certainly useful for society to consider whether it can afford to maintain the existing infrastructure in areas that are becoming less densely populated . "
polzehl is dismissive of such ideas .
" we ca n't just let all this become a jungle .
we have our roots here ; this is our home . "
and schwedt still has good things to offer .
it is responsible for 15 percent of the industrial production of the state of brandenburg , and germany 's only meadowland national park is right next door .
on the way back to the town hall , mayor polzehl draws encouragement from his own life story .
" i moved away too , when i was young , " he says .
" and now i 'm back again . "

it is responsible for 15 percent of the industrial production of the state of brandenburg , and germany 's only meadowland national park is right next door .

now , 20 years on , germany has been fully accepted by its european neighbors . it was in january 1990 , during a walk along the french atlantic coast , that the then-chancellor helmut kohl convinced french president francois mitterrand to support german unification .
mitterrand was skeptical at first , but kohl persuaded him by pledging his commitment to european integration .
with france on board , helmut kohl had the backing of germany 's most important european neighbor .
french sentiment had normalized in a way that it had not done to the same degree in britain and the united states , says french political theorist and journalist alfred grosser .
" with a few exceptions , french opinion polls show that people here saw the germans as friends .
they thought it perfectly natural that the two states should become one again , " he said .
indeed , kohl did not have the same success with his british colleague , prime minister margaret thatcher .
she opposed a unified germany ; but she was replaced as british leader in november 1990 by her fellow conservative party member john major .
germany furthered european integration bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kohl 's passion about european integration convinced mitterrand kohl promised that germany would maintain the european union course of greater integration , which he reaffirmed a year later : " unified germany does not want a return to the europe of yesterday , " he declared to the bundestag .
" there can been no revival of old rivalries and nationalisms .
we want a new europe - one that does not suppress our national identity , one in which countries no longer oppose one another , where no nation stands in the shadow of another , but -lsb- a europe -rsb- in which , together , we can guarantee a future in peace and freedom , prosperity and security . "
over the 20 years since reunification , german governments of all political colors have upheld kohl 's promise : germany championed the admission of the former east bloc states into the eu ; it paid for the eu 's eastward expansion , and the germans gave up their currency , the deutschmark , for the euro . '
german unity signifies european unity ' the reservations many of germany 's neighbors still harbored about the country they had fought in world war ii gradually disappeared .
belgium , for example , had no qualms about germany 's increased size , according to political scientist dirk rochtus of lessius hogeschool university college in antwerp .
" german unity also signifies european unity , " he said .
" that was clear to us here in belgium .
if the two german nations come together again , it also signifies that we have overcome the division of europe .
we see that as a good thing . "
the older generation , which had lived through the german occupation of belgium , did have doubts though .
" naturally there are older people who still have memories of that time , " rochtus said .
" but generally it has to be said that the response has been quite matter-of-fact - and also that we make a distinction between a people , in this case the german people , and the regime that governed this people and headed the occupation regime in belgium .
we make a very big distinction between the two . "
poles and czechs skeptical germany 's neighbors to the east , poland and the czech republic , also had many initial reservations .
after the political upheaval they had experienced , poles realized that germany no longer made any claims on their country and that the german government was serious about european unity , according to janusz reiter , poland 's former ambassador to bonn -lrb- 1990-1995 -rrb- .
" nowadays , germany 's size is no reason for its neighbors to be afraid , " he said .
" the relationship between germany and poland is still not entirely free of ambivalence and tensions , but for different reasons . "
poles are well aware of germany 's economic strength , and are keen to go to their western neighbor to earn money , he added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poles like andrzej stasiuk remain cautious when it comes to germany but there are limits , according to polish author andrzej stasiuk .
" very few poles would think of going to germany on holiday , " he said .
" you do n't go to germany for fun . "
in a recent article for german magazine focus , stasiuk wrote : " germany is not to be taken for granted ; germany is equivocal .
you have to keep your eyes on germany . "
prague-based political scientist robert schuster believes that until the end of the 1990s czechs were afraid of germany - and of the possibility that germans expelled after world war ii might make claims against them .
tensions between the two only started to ease after they signed a joint declaration in 1998 .
the declaration addressed the wounds of the past , as well as crimes committed during and after world war ii ; and it also highlighted perspectives for a joint future .
" the two countries are not competing anymore , " schuster said .
" they are no longer enemies , but members of a community , the eu .
and members of nato .
this aspect of security policy should not be underestimated . "
and he added that young czechs - who have had the opportunity to travel to germany , to study there and meet germans of their own age - have a completely different image of germans to that of the generation aged 50 and over .
football instigated the breakthrough the netherlands , luxembourg , switzerland and austria at first held back , but then gave their approval to german unification .
today , the spending power of german tourists means they are more popular than ever in their neighboring countries , although opinion polls suggest that germans themselves do n't quite believe this .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 2006 world cup showed a side of the country that many had not seen before " we ca n't tell the difference any more between ossis and wessis - that is , germans from the former east or west , " said austrian historian oliver radkolb .
and germany 's northern neighbor , denmark , has also accepted the new , larger germany , according to danish writer knud romer .
for decades danes regarded the germans as a nation of perpetrators , as did many other people in europe , he pointed out .
the breakthrough came with the soccer world cup , which germany hosted in 2006 , he added .
" that was when i realized , for the first time , that the war was over .
finished .
there 's none of that anymore , " romer said .
" and the danes were cheering the germans on . "

structural changes have left urban populations in decline , and the brightest inhabitants are usually the first to go . right on germany 's eastern border the town of schwedt overlooks the river oder .
in the 1960s , this was a boom town : people moved here in tens of thousands to work in the local oil refinery .
but since reunification that trend has been radically reversed .
the pr assistant in schwedt town hall insists that the mayor himself will answer any questions .
" urban restructuring is a matter for the boss , " she says .
sure enough , the mayor , juergen polzehl , a gray-haired man in his mid-50s , invites me to go for a ride with him in his official car .
he tells the chauffeur to drive us to the kuelz district .
on the way there we pass row upon row of prefabricated apartment blocks - a legacy of the final , brief heyday of the uckermark regional municipality .
the town 's population swelled to 52,000 after the refinery was built , and housing had to be created for all the new arrivals .
rapid decline in population bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mayor polzehl says schwedt has spent billions of euros on urban restructuring then came german reunification .
workers at the refinery were laid off .
in the past 20 years , 20,000 people have moved away from schwedt .
at one time thousands of apartments stood empty .
" we had to respond to the situation , " says polzehl , pointing out of the window .
suddenly the buildings are interrupted by a wide , uneven open space .
" all this was apartment blocks , one after another .
now it 's all been returned to nature , " polzehl explains .
for a while they were demolishing as many as a thousand apartments in a year in schwedt .
now , polzehl says , it 's about 150 per year : the contraction of the town is gradually becoming more manageable .
billions of euros have been spent on urban restructuring .
demolition , reconstruction and reforestation help alleviate the sadness of the shrinking towns , but the alteration of the demographic has had a lasting effect on the makeup of the population .
polzehl is particularly concerned that so many young women have moved away .
this is a problem for many of the regions - and it has led to a severe shortage of young women in the new federal states .
the newspaper die welt reports that , in the 25-30 age bracket , in the east there are only 85 women for every 100 men .
polzehl remains optimistic .
" perhaps that will change if we locate a few businesses here and a local authority office .
that 'll improve the job situation , " he says , hopefully .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the oil refinery was once the city 's largest employer brain drain the mayor has set himself a considerable challenge .
conditions here , as in many parts of eastern germany , are not good .
the unemployment figure for the country as a whole is less than eight percent , but the east is struggling with more than 12 percent unemployment .
in schwedt it is even higher at 16 percent .
more efficient production methods and the closing or relocation of industry have greatly reduced the number of jobs available in the east .
those who are able to leave , do .
salaries , too , are higher in the west .
the young , the intelligent and the educated are leading the exodus , leaving behind the old and those described by despairing employers as " barely trainable . "
in an interview with the berliner zeitung in 2004 , ulf matthiesen , a researcher in area studies , described them as " unemployed urban idiots with no family ties and no prospect of forming a relationship . "
in parts of brandenburg and mecklenburg-western pomerania the number of pupils dropping out of school is 50 percent higher than the national average .
more than 10 percent leave school early , according to heike liebmann , head of the city regeneration department at the leibniz institute for regional development .
she describes this as an indication of the degree to which the general level of education among the local population has fallen .
furthermore , the fewer creative and enterprising people there are in public life , the less attractive the prospect of staying here becomes for those left behind .
it 's a vicious circle .
every year , ruediger ober-bloebaum resigns himself to seeing more of schwedt 's bright young people move away .
the stocky 50-year-old is the headmaster of the town 's last remaining high school .
last summer 103 pupils graduated , but he says : " of these , only seven are staying in schwedt .
the others are all going away to study or start an apprenticeship , and only 10 of those think they might come back . "
ober-bloebaum supposes schwedt is too quiet for them ; there 's just not enough going on there .
but there 's another problem , too .
he refers to a 2007 study by the berlin institute for population and development which suggested " that the girls are leaving because they find the boys here too stupid . "
wild , wild east bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : large parts of schwedt are returning to nature before unification in 1990 , then-chancellor helmut kohl spoke of the prospect of " landscapes in bloom . "
he used the term as a metaphor for the economic development of the east , but in recent years regional planners have suggested it should be taken literally .
they have proposed returning parts of eastern germany to nature .
liebmann says it 's hard to imagine how the movement of people could be controlled in such a process , but she adds that " it is certainly useful for society to consider whether it can afford to maintain the existing infrastructure in areas that are becoming less densely populated . "
polzehl is dismissive of such ideas .
" we ca n't just let all this become a jungle .
we have our roots here ; this is our home . "
and schwedt still has good things to offer .
it is responsible for 15 percent of the industrial production of the state of brandenburg , and germany 's only meadowland national park is right next door .
on the way back to the town hall , mayor polzehl draws encouragement from his own life story .
" i moved away too , when i was young , " he says .
" and now i 'm back again . "

now , 20 years on , germany has been fully accepted by its european neighbors . it was in january 1990 , during a walk along the french atlantic coast , that the then-chancellor helmut kohl convinced french president francois mitterrand to support german unification .
mitterrand was skeptical at first , but kohl persuaded him by pledging his commitment to european integration .
with france on board , helmut kohl had the backing of germany 's most important european neighbor .
french sentiment had normalized in a way that it had not done to the same degree in britain and the united states , says french political theorist and journalist alfred grosser .
" with a few exceptions , french opinion polls show that people here saw the germans as friends .
they thought it perfectly natural that the two states should become one again , " he said .
indeed , kohl did not have the same success with his british colleague , prime minister margaret thatcher .
she opposed a unified germany ; but she was replaced as british leader in november 1990 by her fellow conservative party member john major .
germany furthered european integration bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kohl 's passion about european integration convinced mitterrand kohl promised that germany would maintain the european union course of greater integration , which he reaffirmed a year later : " unified germany does not want a return to the europe of yesterday , " he declared to the bundestag .
" there can been no revival of old rivalries and nationalisms .
we want a new europe - one that does not suppress our national identity , one in which countries no longer oppose one another , where no nation stands in the shadow of another , but -lsb- a europe -rsb- in which , together , we can guarantee a future in peace and freedom , prosperity and security . "
over the 20 years since reunification , german governments of all political colors have upheld kohl 's promise : germany championed the admission of the former east bloc states into the eu ; it paid for the eu 's eastward expansion , and the germans gave up their currency , the deutschmark , for the euro . '
german unity signifies european unity ' the reservations many of germany 's neighbors still harbored about the country they had fought in world war ii gradually disappeared .
belgium , for example , had no qualms about germany 's increased size , according to political scientist dirk rochtus of lessius hogeschool university college in antwerp .
" german unity also signifies european unity , " he said .
" that was clear to us here in belgium .
if the two german nations come together again , it also signifies that we have overcome the division of europe .
we see that as a good thing . "
the older generation , which had lived through the german occupation of belgium , did have doubts though .
" naturally there are older people who still have memories of that time , " rochtus said .
" but generally it has to be said that the response has been quite matter-of-fact - and also that we make a distinction between a people , in this case the german people , and the regime that governed this people and headed the occupation regime in belgium .
we make a very big distinction between the two . "
poles and czechs skeptical germany 's neighbors to the east , poland and the czech republic , also had many initial reservations .
after the political upheaval they had experienced , poles realized that germany no longer made any claims on their country and that the german government was serious about european unity , according to janusz reiter , poland 's former ambassador to bonn -lrb- 1990-1995 -rrb- .
" nowadays , germany 's size is no reason for its neighbors to be afraid , " he said .
" the relationship between germany and poland is still not entirely free of ambivalence and tensions , but for different reasons . "
poles are well aware of germany 's economic strength , and are keen to go to their western neighbor to earn money , he added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poles like andrzej stasiuk remain cautious when it comes to germany but there are limits , according to polish author andrzej stasiuk .
" very few poles would think of going to germany on holiday , " he said .
" you do n't go to germany for fun . "
in a recent article for german magazine focus , stasiuk wrote : " germany is not to be taken for granted ; germany is equivocal .
you have to keep your eyes on germany . "
prague-based political scientist robert schuster believes that until the end of the 1990s czechs were afraid of germany - and of the possibility that germans expelled after world war ii might make claims against them .
tensions between the two only started to ease after they signed a joint declaration in 1998 .
the declaration addressed the wounds of the past , as well as crimes committed during and after world war ii ; and it also highlighted perspectives for a joint future .
" the two countries are not competing anymore , " schuster said .
" they are no longer enemies , but members of a community , the eu .
and members of nato .
this aspect of security policy should not be underestimated . "
and he added that young czechs - who have had the opportunity to travel to germany , to study there and meet germans of their own age - have a completely different image of germans to that of the generation aged 50 and over .
football instigated the breakthrough the netherlands , luxembourg , switzerland and austria at first held back , but then gave their approval to german unification .
today , the spending power of german tourists means they are more popular than ever in their neighboring countries , although opinion polls suggest that germans themselves do n't quite believe this .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 2006 world cup showed a side of the country that many had not seen before " we ca n't tell the difference any more between ossis and wessis - that is , germans from the former east or west , " said austrian historian oliver radkolb .
and germany 's northern neighbor , denmark , has also accepted the new , larger germany , according to danish writer knud romer .
for decades danes regarded the germans as a nation of perpetrators , as did many other people in europe , he pointed out .
the breakthrough came with the soccer world cup , which germany hosted in 2006 , he added .
" that was when i realized , for the first time , that the war was over .
finished .
there 's none of that anymore , " romer said .
" and the danes were cheering the germans on . "

structural changes have left urban populations in decline , and the brightest inhabitants are usually the first to go . right on germany 's eastern border the town of schwedt overlooks the river oder .
in the 1960s , this was a boom town : people moved here in tens of thousands to work in the local oil refinery .
but since reunification that trend has been radically reversed .
the pr assistant in schwedt town hall insists that the mayor himself will answer any questions .
" urban restructuring is a matter for the boss , " she says .
sure enough , the mayor , juergen polzehl , a gray-haired man in his mid-50s , invites me to go for a ride with him in his official car .
he tells the chauffeur to drive us to the kuelz district .
on the way there we pass row upon row of prefabricated apartment blocks - a legacy of the final , brief heyday of the uckermark regional municipality .
the town 's population swelled to 52,000 after the refinery was built , and housing had to be created for all the new arrivals .
rapid decline in population bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mayor polzehl says schwedt has spent billions of euros on urban restructuring then came german reunification .
workers at the refinery were laid off .
in the past 20 years , 20,000 people have moved away from schwedt .
at one time thousands of apartments stood empty .
" we had to respond to the situation , " says polzehl , pointing out of the window .
suddenly the buildings are interrupted by a wide , uneven open space .
" all this was apartment blocks , one after another .
now it 's all been returned to nature , " polzehl explains .
for a while they were demolishing as many as a thousand apartments in a year in schwedt .
now , polzehl says , it 's about 150 per year : the contraction of the town is gradually becoming more manageable .
billions of euros have been spent on urban restructuring .
demolition , reconstruction and reforestation help alleviate the sadness of the shrinking towns , but the alteration of the demographic has had a lasting effect on the makeup of the population .
polzehl is particularly concerned that so many young women have moved away .
this is a problem for many of the regions - and it has led to a severe shortage of young women in the new federal states .
the newspaper die welt reports that , in the 25-30 age bracket , in the east there are only 85 women for every 100 men .
polzehl remains optimistic .
" perhaps that will change if we locate a few businesses here and a local authority office .
that 'll improve the job situation , " he says , hopefully .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the oil refinery was once the city 's largest employer brain drain the mayor has set himself a considerable challenge .
conditions here , as in many parts of eastern germany , are not good .
the unemployment figure for the country as a whole is less than eight percent , but the east is struggling with more than 12 percent unemployment .
in schwedt it is even higher at 16 percent .
more efficient production methods and the closing or relocation of industry have greatly reduced the number of jobs available in the east .
those who are able to leave , do .
salaries , too , are higher in the west .
the young , the intelligent and the educated are leading the exodus , leaving behind the old and those described by despairing employers as " barely trainable . "
in an interview with the berliner zeitung in 2004 , ulf matthiesen , a researcher in area studies , described them as " unemployed urban idiots with no family ties and no prospect of forming a relationship . "
in parts of brandenburg and mecklenburg-western pomerania the number of pupils dropping out of school is 50 percent higher than the national average .
more than 10 percent leave school early , according to heike liebmann , head of the city regeneration department at the leibniz institute for regional development .
she describes this as an indication of the degree to which the general level of education among the local population has fallen .
furthermore , the fewer creative and enterprising people there are in public life , the less attractive the prospect of staying here becomes for those left behind .
it 's a vicious circle .
every year , ruediger ober-bloebaum resigns himself to seeing more of schwedt 's bright young people move away .
the stocky 50-year-old is the headmaster of the town 's last remaining high school .
last summer 103 pupils graduated , but he says : " of these , only seven are staying in schwedt .
the others are all going away to study or start an apprenticeship , and only 10 of those think they might come back . "
ober-bloebaum supposes schwedt is too quiet for them ; there 's just not enough going on there .
but there 's another problem , too .
he refers to a 2007 study by the berlin institute for population and development which suggested " that the girls are leaving because they find the boys here too stupid . "
wild , wild east bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : large parts of schwedt are returning to nature before unification in 1990 , then-chancellor helmut kohl spoke of the prospect of " landscapes in bloom . "
he used the term as a metaphor for the economic development of the east , but in recent years regional planners have suggested it should be taken literally .
they have proposed returning parts of eastern germany to nature .
liebmann says it 's hard to imagine how the movement of people could be controlled in such a process , but she adds that " it is certainly useful for society to consider whether it can afford to maintain the existing infrastructure in areas that are becoming less densely populated . "
polzehl is dismissive of such ideas .
" we ca n't just let all this become a jungle .
we have our roots here ; this is our home . "
and schwedt still has good things to offer .
it is responsible for 15 percent of the industrial production of the state of brandenburg , and germany 's only meadowland national park is right next door .
on the way back to the town hall , mayor polzehl draws encouragement from his own life story .
" i moved away too , when i was young , " he says .
" and now i 'm back again . "

" but generally it has to be said that the response has been quite matter-of-fact - and also that we make a distinction between a people , in this case the german people , and the regime that governed this people and headed the occupation regime in belgium .
we make a very big distinction between the two . "
poles and czechs skeptical germany 's neighbors to the east , poland and the czech republic , also had many initial reservations .
after the political upheaval they had experienced , poles realized that germany no longer made any claims on their country and that the german government was serious about european unity , according to janusz reiter , poland 's former ambassador to bonn -lrb- 1990-1995 -rrb- .
" nowadays , germany 's size is no reason for its neighbors to be afraid , " he said .
" the relationship between germany and poland is still not entirely free of ambivalence and tensions , but for different reasons . "
poles are well aware of germany 's economic strength , and are keen to go to their western neighbor to earn money , he added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poles like andrzej stasiuk remain cautious when it comes to germany but there are limits , according to polish author andrzej stasiuk .
" very few poles would think of going to germany on holiday , " he said .
" you do n't go to germany for fun . "
in a recent article for german magazine focus , stasiuk wrote : " germany is not to be taken for granted ; germany is equivocal .
you have to keep your eyes on germany . "
prague-based political scientist robert schuster believes that until the end of the 1990s czechs were afraid of germany - and of the possibility that germans expelled after world war ii might make claims against them .
tensions between the two only started to ease after they signed a joint declaration in 1998 .
the declaration addressed the wounds of the past , as well as crimes committed during and after world war ii ; and it also highlighted perspectives for a joint future .
" the two countries are not competing anymore , " schuster said .
" they are no longer enemies , but members of a community , the eu .
and members of nato .
this aspect of security policy should not be underestimated . "
and he added that young czechs - who have had the opportunity to travel to germany , to study there and meet germans of their own age - have a completely different image of germans to that of the generation aged 50 and over .
football instigated the breakthrough the netherlands , luxembourg , switzerland and austria at first held back , but then gave their approval to german unification .
today , the spending power of german tourists means they are more popular than ever in their neighboring countries , although opinion polls suggest that germans themselves do n't quite believe this .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 2006 world cup showed a side of the country that many had not seen before " we ca n't tell the difference any more between ossis and wessis - that is , germans from the former east or west , " said austrian historian oliver radkolb .
and germany 's northern neighbor , denmark , has also accepted the new , larger germany , according to danish writer knud romer .
for decades danes regarded the germans as a nation of perpetrators , as did many other people in europe , he pointed out .
the breakthrough came with the soccer world cup , which germany hosted in 2006 , he added .
" that was when i realized , for the first time , that the war was over .
finished .
there 's none of that anymore , " romer said .
" and the danes were cheering the germans on . "

structural changes have left urban populations in decline , and the brightest inhabitants are usually the first to go . right on germany 's eastern border the town of schwedt overlooks the river oder .
in the 1960s , this was a boom town : people moved here in tens of thousands to work in the local oil refinery .
but since reunification that trend has been radically reversed .
the pr assistant in schwedt town hall insists that the mayor himself will answer any questions .
" urban restructuring is a matter for the boss , " she says .
sure enough , the mayor , juergen polzehl , a gray-haired man in his mid-50s , invites me to go for a ride with him in his official car .
he tells the chauffeur to drive us to the kuelz district .
on the way there we pass row upon row of prefabricated apartment blocks - a legacy of the final , brief heyday of the uckermark regional municipality .
the town 's population swelled to 52,000 after the refinery was built , and housing had to be created for all the new arrivals .
rapid decline in population bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mayor polzehl says schwedt has spent billions of euros on urban restructuring then came german reunification .
workers at the refinery were laid off .
in the past 20 years , 20,000 people have moved away from schwedt .
at one time thousands of apartments stood empty .
" we had to respond to the situation , " says polzehl , pointing out of the window .
suddenly the buildings are interrupted by a wide , uneven open space .
" all this was apartment blocks , one after another .
now it 's all been returned to nature , " polzehl explains .
for a while they were demolishing as many as a thousand apartments in a year in schwedt .
now , polzehl says , it 's about 150 per year : the contraction of the town is gradually becoming more manageable .
billions of euros have been spent on urban restructuring .
demolition , reconstruction and reforestation help alleviate the sadness of the shrinking towns , but the alteration of the demographic has had a lasting effect on the makeup of the population .
polzehl is particularly concerned that so many young women have moved away .
this is a problem for many of the regions - and it has led to a severe shortage of young women in the new federal states .
the newspaper die welt reports that , in the 25-30 age bracket , in the east there are only 85 women for every 100 men .
polzehl remains optimistic .
" perhaps that will change if we locate a few businesses here and a local authority office .
that 'll improve the job situation , " he says , hopefully .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the oil refinery was once the city 's largest employer brain drain the mayor has set himself a considerable challenge .
conditions here , as in many parts of eastern germany , are not good .
the unemployment figure for the country as a whole is less than eight percent , but the east is struggling with more than 12 percent unemployment .
in schwedt it is even higher at 16 percent .
more efficient production methods and the closing or relocation of industry have greatly reduced the number of jobs available in the east .
those who are able to leave , do .
salaries , too , are higher in the west .
the young , the intelligent and the educated are leading the exodus , leaving behind the old and those described by despairing employers as " barely trainable . "
in an interview with the berliner zeitung in 2004 , ulf matthiesen , a researcher in area studies , described them as " unemployed urban idiots with no family ties and no prospect of forming a relationship . "
in parts of brandenburg and mecklenburg-western pomerania the number of pupils dropping out of school is 50 percent higher than the national average .
more than 10 percent leave school early , according to heike liebmann , head of the city regeneration department at the leibniz institute for regional development .
she describes this as an indication of the degree to which the general level of education among the local population has fallen .
furthermore , the fewer creative and enterprising people there are in public life , the less attractive the prospect of staying here becomes for those left behind .
it 's a vicious circle .
every year , ruediger ober-bloebaum resigns himself to seeing more of schwedt 's bright young people move away .
the stocky 50-year-old is the headmaster of the town 's last remaining high school .
last summer 103 pupils graduated , but he says : " of these , only seven are staying in schwedt .
the others are all going away to study or start an apprenticeship , and only 10 of those think they might come back . "
ober-bloebaum supposes schwedt is too quiet for them ; there 's just not enough going on there .
but there 's another problem , too .
he refers to a 2007 study by the berlin institute for population and development which suggested " that the girls are leaving because they find the boys here too stupid . "
wild , wild east bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : large parts of schwedt are returning to nature before unification in 1990 , then-chancellor helmut kohl spoke of the prospect of " landscapes in bloom . "
he used the term as a metaphor for the economic development of the east , but in recent years regional planners have suggested it should be taken literally .
they have proposed returning parts of eastern germany to nature .
liebmann says it 's hard to imagine how the movement of people could be controlled in such a process , but she adds that " it is certainly useful for society to consider whether it can afford to maintain the existing infrastructure in areas that are becoming less densely populated . "
polzehl is dismissive of such ideas .
" we ca n't just let all this become a jungle .
we have our roots here ; this is our home . "
and schwedt still has good things to offer .
it is responsible for 15 percent of the industrial production of the state of brandenburg , and germany 's only meadowland national park is right next door .
on the way back to the town hall , mayor polzehl draws encouragement from his own life story .
" i moved away too , when i was young , " he says .
" and now i 'm back again . "

french workers strike over pension reforms australia has proposed by the labour government of ms. julia gillard to increase the age of pensions for retirement from 65 to 67 in the future .
there has been no real opposition to this proposal like in france .
the same reasons are given by australia like in france such as an aging population and life expectancy . - stuart , australia unless the strikers can come up with a way to pay for their pensions , 62 is early .
what are they planning to do , sit around and wait to die ? - marga , us the retirement age should be raised because unaffordable benefits now will transfer the financial burden to the upcoming generations .
we will rely more and more on low wage manufacturing for affordable products , further exacerbating the problem . - steve , france the unions in france should fight against this reactionary measure and do what ever is necessary to stop the government from doing this disgraceful act against the people .
the president of france is similar to adolphe thiers who in 1871 ordered the french troops to eliminate the working class of paris .
what the french government is doing should be condemned by the working class every where in the world . - stan , canada german energy policy it really would be the greenest energy policy , relatively speaking , if the remaining energy in the spent nuclear fuel was used for something .
that would reduce the toxicity of spent fuel .
anything else would be irresponsible . - gene , us nein !
non !
no !
the decision is not good for our planet and chancellor merkel should know better , being a scientist .
but it good to see some compromise within the government debate . - stuart , australia i can not believe the german people are so blind on this subject .
the world is facing a climate catastrophe and needs to reduce co2 emissions as soon as possible .
germany , like australia , has high co2 emissions but believes that renewables are the answer .
please do the math ; no country , including germany , has ever reduced co2 emissions using renewables .
the only successful non-carbon technology is nuclear power which your neighbors france , switzerland and sweden have successfully used to reduce co2 emissions .
facts , not fantasy , must drive decision-making . - tom , australia germany must have a continuous reliable source of electricity and the present nuclear plants should run for their designed lifetimes .
there should not be any further construction of fossil fuel power stations unless they replace older ones that have reached the end of their most efficient lifespan . - roland , new zealand i think germany needs to review their energy policy , now that the country is not so vulnerable to geopolitical controls on natural gas .

a new law came into effect on april 1 providing children with access to free education .
but children ’ s rights organizations complain about the implementation . it is 2 o ’ clock at a school in the old part of pune .
classes are supposed to run from 12.30 to 5.30 pm at baburao sana ’ s school , just like in other state school but there ’ s no learning going on in this classroom .
instead there is chaos .
class one ’ s teacher is not here .
the children are playing , crying , shouting , or just running around . gangu is a seven years old girl .
her black hair is short and she has a gold nose ring .
she is wearing the school uniform , a yellow blouse and a grey pinafore .
she looks upon the chaos calmly .
she knows that the teacher always comes very late .
" we play here while we wait " , she says . ngo provides education for children of migrant workers gangu belongs to the nomadic pardhi tribe who are migrant workers .
all year round , they travel the country , looking for work .
they sell flowers or balloons on the streets to earn some money .
she had never been to school before because she was always on the road .
but last year she was adopted by the ngo ekalavya .
she now lives in a home with other pardhi children and goes to school everyday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : queuing in school uniform for food it is 3pm .
priyanka gaikwad , the teacher , finally arrives .
she tells the children to calm down .
she explains that she was late because she had to fill out some official forms in the headmistress ’ office .
" we often have other duties apart from school " , gaikwad complains .
" we have to compile reports for the government or help with the census . "
because class one ’ s exams are in a couple of days the headmistress gave her this work .
moreover , her colleague from another class is on holiday so she has to teach both classes together .
but there is not enough space and it is very chaotic . problem of crowded classes instead of 30 children , there are 60 sitting here - some are even crouching on the floor .
gangu takes her seat between two other girls .
the first subject of the day is marathi – the main language of maharashtra . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : too many pupils , too less space the children first learn the letters .

although she ’ s officially not allowed , she says it ’ s impossible to discipline the children otherwise . indian school system not effective many of the children are quiet however .
they know they have their exam soon .
gangu also wants to take it but she is not allowed .
she is not registered at the school because she does not have a birth certificate .
she missed the deadline to get a certificate from the local state hospital .
this means she might have to wait for a year to get a certificate and repeat the year . many pardhi children have gone back to their parents and their nomadic way of life for this very reason .
they get bored when they have to repeat the class .
gangu is adamant that this will not happen .
she wants to go into class two , be successful , build a big house for her parents and live with them .
children ’ s rights activists hope that the new law will help overcome these bureaucratic barriers , otherwise they fear for universal education in india .

french workers strike over pension reforms australia has proposed by the labour government of ms. julia gillard to increase the age of pensions for retirement from 65 to 67 in the future .
there has been no real opposition to this proposal like in france .
the same reasons are given by australia like in france such as an aging population and life expectancy . - stuart , australia unless the strikers can come up with a way to pay for their pensions , 62 is early .
what are they planning to do , sit around and wait to die ? - marga , us the retirement age should be raised because unaffordable benefits now will transfer the financial burden to the upcoming generations .
we will rely more and more on low wage manufacturing for affordable products , further exacerbating the problem . - steve , france the unions in france should fight against this reactionary measure and do what ever is necessary to stop the government from doing this disgraceful act against the people .

the decision is not good for our planet and chancellor merkel should know better , being a scientist .
but it good to see some compromise within the government debate . - stuart , australia i can not believe the german people are so blind on this subject .
the world is facing a climate catastrophe and needs to reduce co2 emissions as soon as possible .
germany , like australia , has high co2 emissions but believes that renewables are the answer .
please do the math ; no country , including germany , has ever reduced co2 emissions using renewables .
the only successful non-carbon technology is nuclear power which your neighbors france , switzerland and sweden have successfully used to reduce co2 emissions .
facts , not fantasy , must drive decision-making . - tom , australia germany must have a continuous reliable source of electricity and the present nuclear plants should run for their designed lifetimes .
there should not be any further construction of fossil fuel power stations unless they replace older ones that have reached the end of their most efficient lifespan . - roland , new zealand i think germany needs to review their energy policy , now that the country is not so vulnerable to geopolitical controls on natural gas .

the project helps parents with migrant backgrounds and their children improve their literacy skills through storytelling . four million of the more than 750 million illiterate people in the world live in germany , and a disproportionate number of them are immigrants or have an immigrant background .
the " family literacy " project -lrb- fly -rrb- focuses on that group , which makes up 14 percent of hamburg 's population , and for that reason it was singled out for unesco 's 2010 literacy award .
fly , a pilot project initiated and run by the hamburg state institute for teacher training and school development , uses an intergenerational approach to ensure closer cooperation and better communication between the school and the childrens ' home " it 's our goal to get the parents interested in reading more at home with their children and in engaging more strongly with language , " gabriele rabkin , the head of fly , told deutsche welle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an intergenerational approach benefits adults and children forty-four schools in hamburg participate in the program , which was started six years ago .
nearly 1,000 parents and as many children take part in the project every year .
parents welcome every two weeks , parents join their children , mainly preschoolers and first-graders , in the classroom .
they see how their kids engage with words and storytelling - and they 're allowed to help .

the project helps parents with migrant backgrounds and their children improve their literacy skills through storytelling . four million of the more than 750 million illiterate people in the world live in germany , and a disproportionate number of them are immigrants or have an immigrant background .
the " family literacy " project -lrb- fly -rrb- focuses on that group , which makes up 14 percent of hamburg 's population , and for that reason it was singled out for unesco 's 2010 literacy award .
fly , a pilot project initiated and run by the hamburg state institute for teacher training and school development , uses an intergenerational approach to ensure closer cooperation and better communication between the school and the childrens ' home " it 's our goal to get the parents interested in reading more at home with their children and in engaging more strongly with language , " gabriele rabkin , the head of fly , told deutsche welle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an intergenerational approach benefits adults and children forty-four schools in hamburg participate in the program , which was started six years ago .
nearly 1,000 parents and as many children take part in the project every year .
parents welcome every two weeks , parents join their children , mainly preschoolers and first-graders , in the classroom .
they see how their kids engage with words and storytelling - and they 're allowed to help .
fly 's teachers encourage the adults to make sure their children speak in complete sentences outside of class , take time to look at picture books together or point out individual letters on the way to school .
ute stather , who teaches first and second graders at hamburg 's osterbrook school , has been with the project from the start .
" the parents see what we are doing and that helps them understand where they have to support their child , " she said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sometimes aunts , grandmothers and siblings join the classes the families are not discouraged from speaking their native language in class .
on the contrary , teachers view multilingualism as an asset , stather said .
" if people speak and read a lot in their native tongue , their children will also learn german much more easily . "
many of the parents also see fly classes as a chance to learn german , according to rabkin .
the teachers also do n't put pressure on the adults to read and speak in german with their children at home ; what was important was for them to deal with language as such .
" we do n't see parents as assistant teachers - they are their children 's first and most important teachers , " rabkin said .

he won the nobel prize in the year 1985 for the discovery of the quantum hall effect .
now i suppose after getting the prize you were probably pretty busy .
how long did it take until you could really get back to research ? klaus von klitzing : i am always in the laboratory , so if i am at home it 's about 50 percent of my time .
no , i am always in the laboratory .
i have a big group of young students .
and i always have to be able to tell new things in order to attend conferences , so i need new material .
therefore , i need to do research and this is the most important thing .
to keep up with modern research . but life probably changed after winning the nobel prize .
i mean your opinion is now important to everybody . yes , that 's one problem .
you have to say something in fields where you are not a specialist .
so you know something about physics and you have to say something about global warming .
it 's also related to physics , but also nuclear energy , weapons , all kinds of things .
so this is much more difficult .
but you have a lot of connections to people where you can rely on their opinion and you can get some information .
and you have to do something for the public , to say this is the right direction , in my opinion , but even nobel laureates they disagree sometimes in certain fields .
and this is an interesting point to have this discussion , to have a broad range of opinion and then to find the truth . what do you think distinguishes a nobel prize laureate ?
what is so special about you ? special is that unlike with politicians , many people believe that what you are saying is the absolute truth .
to a certain degree it 's true , but we do n't know everything .
but to a certain extent you can influence the public .
this is some extra burden also because suddenly you discover that what you are saying translates as one to one .
and sometimes it 's dangerous because as a scientist you do n't always have a fixed opinion about all things .
it 's floating , you are learning all the time .
so this is a burden to all of the laureates . f rom about 802 nobel prize laureates , we 've had only about 40 women .
do you have an explanation for that ? yes , it 's always more difficult for women in some cultures.in other countries in islamic countries in jordan there were more than 50 percent of phyics students who were female .
and if you go to france even , they also have more female scientists .
so it 's got something to do with the environment with the conditions , with the tradition , what is a family .
and i think that we have to learn something in germany about how to support female scientists .
to have an environment where they can continue their research .
because if you are away for three years in research , you lose contact with the top scientific questions .
so therefore you have to find some solutions , so you can combine both : a family and science .

he won the nobel prize in the year 1985 for the discovery of the quantum hall effect .
now i suppose after getting the prize you were probably pretty busy .
how long did it take until you could really get back to research ? klaus von klitzing : i am always in the laboratory , so if i am at home it 's about 50 percent of my time .
no , i am always in the laboratory .
i have a big group of young students .
and i always have to be able to tell new things in order to attend conferences , so i need new material .
therefore , i need to do research and this is the most important thing .
to keep up with modern research . but life probably changed after winning the nobel prize .
i mean your opinion is now important to everybody . yes , that 's one problem .
you have to say something in fields where you are not a specialist .
so you know something about physics and you have to say something about global warming .
it 's also related to physics , but also nuclear energy , weapons , all kinds of things .
so this is much more difficult .
but you have a lot of connections to people where you can rely on their opinion and you can get some information .
and you have to do something for the public , to say this is the right direction , in my opinion , but even nobel laureates they disagree sometimes in certain fields .
and this is an interesting point to have this discussion , to have a broad range of opinion and then to find the truth . what do you think distinguishes a nobel prize laureate ?
what is so special about you ? special is that unlike with politicians , many people believe that what you are saying is the absolute truth .
to a certain degree it 's true , but we do n't know everything .
but to a certain extent you can influence the public .
this is some extra burden also because suddenly you discover that what you are saying translates as one to one .
and sometimes it 's dangerous because as a scientist you do n't always have a fixed opinion about all things .
it 's floating , you are learning all the time .
so this is a burden to all of the laureates . f rom about 802 nobel prize laureates , we 've had only about 40 women .
do you have an explanation for that ? yes , it 's always more difficult for women in some cultures.in other countries in islamic countries in jordan there were more than 50 percent of phyics students who were female .
and if you go to france even , they also have more female scientists .
so it 's got something to do with the environment with the conditions , with the tradition , what is a family .
and i think that we have to learn something in germany about how to support female scientists .
to have an environment where they can continue their research .
because if you are away for three years in research , you lose contact with the top scientific questions .
so therefore you have to find some solutions , so you can combine both : a family and science .

program guide programs tomorrow today video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de home / dw-tv asia + : tomorrow today science -pipe- 08.09.2010 interview with physics prize nobel laureate klaus von klitzing großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dw-tv : joining us here is physics prize nobel laureate klaus von klitzing .
he won the nobel prize in the year 1985 for the discovery of the quantum hall effect .
now i suppose after getting the prize you were probably pretty busy .
how long did it take until you could really get back to research ? klaus von klitzing : i am always in the laboratory , so if i am at home it 's about 50 percent of my time .
no , i am always in the laboratory .
i have a big group of young students .
and i always have to be able to tell new things in order to attend conferences , so i need new material .
therefore , i need to do research and this is the most important thing .
to keep up with modern research . but life probably changed after winning the nobel prize .
i mean your opinion is now important to everybody . yes , that 's one problem .
you have to say something in fields where you are not a specialist .
so you know something about physics and you have to say something about global warming .
it 's also related to physics , but also nuclear energy , weapons , all kinds of things .
so this is much more difficult .
but you have a lot of connections to people where you can rely on their opinion and you can get some information .
and you have to do something for the public , to say this is the right direction , in my opinion , but even nobel laureates they disagree sometimes in certain fields .
and this is an interesting point to have this discussion , to have a broad range of opinion and then to find the truth . what do you think distinguishes a nobel prize laureate ?
what is so special about you ? special is that unlike with politicians , many people believe that what you are saying is the absolute truth .
to a certain degree it 's true , but we do n't know everything .
but to a certain extent you can influence the public .
this is some extra burden also because suddenly you discover that what you are saying translates as one to one .
and sometimes it 's dangerous because as a scientist you do n't always have a fixed opinion about all things .
it 's floating , you are learning all the time .
so this is a burden to all of the laureates . f rom about 802 nobel prize laureates , we 've had only about 40 women .
do you have an explanation for that ? yes , it 's always more difficult for women in some cultures.in other countries in islamic countries in jordan there were more than 50 percent of phyics students who were female .
and if you go to france even , they also have more female scientists .
so it 's got something to do with the environment with the conditions , with the tradition , what is a family .
and i think that we have to learn something in germany about how to support female scientists .
to have an environment where they can continue their research .
because if you are away for three years in research , you lose contact with the top scientific questions .
so therefore you have to find some solutions , so you can combine both : a family and science .

" despite the raids , there have been no criminal charges filed in sweden , pinter said , adding that authorities questioned and released seven suspects . he said the confiscated servers are being held in sweden but may be sent to brussels for further analysis . pirate party criticizes raids the pirate party in sweden quickly spoke out against the raids in their country , posting a comment on its blog yesterday .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de religion -pipe- 08.09.2010 former terry jones church in germany denounces koran-burning plan großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jones insists on going through with his plan pastor terry jones , whose call to " burn the koran " has led to fears of global repercussions , worked as missionary for decades in germany .
here , too , he was known for his extreme convictions . a german church founded and formerly led by terry jones , the american pastor who international attracted attention with controversial plans to stage a koran-burning ceremony , expressly denounced those plans on wednesday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jones ' former church is ' deeply disturbed ' by their former leader stephan baar , deputy chairman of the christliche gemeinde koeln -lrb- cgd -rrb- , the christian community of cologne , told deutsche welle that jones preached a strict , even fundamental understanding of the bible , but that no direct comparisons could be drawn between his sermons there and the radical views he is currently espousing at his new church .
" we want to make it clear that our church is opposed to what terry jones is advocating at the moment and that the cgd , even though he is the founder , has no more contact with him , " baar said .
the community asked him to leave in 2008 .
baar insisted that there were no controversies surrounding his departure .
" he just left ; we did not witness any of the deeply disturbing things we are seeing now .
pastor terry jones was placing too much emphasis on himself and distracting our members from their christian faiths .
he and our church simply went their separate ways . "
' gate to hell ' brigitte baetz , a cologne journalist who is a regular contributor on german public radio , said jones espoused radical christian views while at the helm of the cgd .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protests against the actions have begun in kabul baetz told deutsche welle that jones commonly referred to the city of cologne as a " gate to hell " and emphasized that christians were " persecuted " there and took on the role of " innocent victims who would be rewarded for their suffering . "
" in his sermons terry jones often convinced the members that they were made to suffer hardships because they were part of the cgd .
he said again and again that the members were the victims of persecution and that it led to them losing their jobs and social status , for instance . "
baetz said that jones ' sermons bordered on fundamentalist interpretations of the bible .
she singled out his vehement opposition to cologne plans to construct a mosque in the city as an example of his extremist views .
" terry jones saw religion as wrong and right .
he told his followers here in germany that christians , and especially members of his cgd , were the only ones who were right .
this is the basis , i believe , for what he is doing right now with his new church in florida , " baetz said .
us unable to prevent controversial burning leading figures around the globe have expressed fears that jones ' planned " international burn a koran day " could seriously strain relations between muslims and the west .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : petraeus said jones would provide propaganda for rebels david petraeus , the top us and nato commander in afghanistan , warned that " burning the holy book of islam provides propaganda for insurgents and could endanger the -lsb- alliance 's -rsb- overall effort . "
petraeus ' comments were echoed later by nato secretary general anders fogh rasmussen .
in response to petraeus ' words of caution , meanwhile , jones said on tuesday : " why do n't we send a warning to them ?
why do n't we send a warning to radical islam and say , ' do n't do it ? '
if you attack us , if you attack us , we will attack you . "
the united states government appears unable to prevent jones ' september 11 commemoration plans on saturday .
although florida fire authorities have turned down jones ' application to stage the open-air burning ceremony , police will not be allowed to intervene until the korans have actually been lit .

the percentage of people in urban areas with access is declining . lack of access to clean sources of water remains a major problem is much of the world , said anders berntell , executive director of the stockholm international water institute -lrb- siwi -rrb- . " bad water kills more people than hiv , malaria and wars together , affecting the lives of families and the economic development of many countries around the world , " he said at the world water week conference being held in the swedish capital . the united nation 's food and agriculture organization estimates that within the next 15 years , 1.8 billion people will be living in regions with acute water scarcity , and that two-thirds of the world 's population could be facing shortages . thirsty cities bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many people in cities lack the clean water they need while the plight of those in dry , rural areas has long been examined by development aid and the work of non-governmental organizations -lrb- ngos -rrb- , people in urban areas also suffer from lack of access to water , according to gerard payen , who heads the international federation of private water operators -lrb- aquafed -rrb- . " in cities , there are today more people suffering from a poor and unsatisfactory access to safe water and sanitation than at the end of the 20th century , " payen said in a statement . access to safe drinking water was recognized as a human right by the united nations general assembly in july , yet the un , together with ngos and individual governments , has struggled for decades to get potable water to hundreds of millions of people worldwide who lack water and basic sanitation services . growing population bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in some places , a trek is necessary to get clean water population growth is one of the biggest difficulties they confront .
between 2000 and 2008 , the world 's population increased by 635 million people , 80 percent of whom live in urban areas , according to un data . " the proportion of the urban population that benefits from satisfactory access to drinking water or sanitation is decreasing , " aquafed said , pointing to un statistics showing that 114 million more people went without access to tap water at home or in the immediate vicinity at the end of the eight-year-period . at the same time , 134 million more people went without access to basic sanitation , the group said , pointing out that in both cases there had been a 20 percent hike of urban dwellers lacking access .

the percentage of people in urban areas with access is declining . lack of access to clean sources of water remains a major problem is much of the world , said anders berntell , executive director of the stockholm international water institute -lrb- siwi -rrb- . " bad water kills more people than hiv , malaria and wars together , affecting the lives of families and the economic development of many countries around the world , " he said at the world water week conference being held in the swedish capital . the united nation 's food and agriculture organization estimates that within the next 15 years , 1.8 billion people will be living in regions with acute water scarcity , and that two-thirds of the world 's population could be facing shortages . thirsty cities bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many people in cities lack the clean water they need while the plight of those in dry , rural areas has long been examined by development aid and the work of non-governmental organizations -lrb- ngos -rrb- , people in urban areas also suffer from lack of access to water , according to gerard payen , who heads the international federation of private water operators -lrb- aquafed -rrb- . " in cities , there are today more people suffering from a poor and unsatisfactory access to safe water and sanitation than at the end of the 20th century , " payen said in a statement . access to safe drinking water was recognized as a human right by the united nations general assembly in july , yet the un , together with ngos and individual governments , has struggled for decades to get potable water to hundreds of millions of people worldwide who lack water and basic sanitation services . growing population bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in some places , a trek is necessary to get clean water population growth is one of the biggest difficulties they confront .
between 2000 and 2008 , the world 's population increased by 635 million people , 80 percent of whom live in urban areas , according to un data . " the proportion of the urban population that benefits from satisfactory access to drinking water or sanitation is decreasing , " aquafed said , pointing to un statistics showing that 114 million more people went without access to tap water at home or in the immediate vicinity at the end of the eight-year-period . at the same time , 134 million more people went without access to basic sanitation , the group said , pointing out that in both cases there had been a 20 percent hike of urban dwellers lacking access .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de religion -pipe- 08.09.2010 former terry jones church in germany denounces koran-burning plan großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jones insists on going through with his plan pastor terry jones , whose call to " burn the koran " has led to fears of global repercussions , worked as missionary for decades in germany .
here , too , he was known for his extreme convictions . a german church founded and formerly led by terry jones , the american pastor who international attracted attention with controversial plans to stage a koran-burning ceremony , expressly denounced those plans on wednesday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jones ' former church is ' deeply disturbed ' by their former leader stephan baar , deputy chairman of the christliche gemeinde koeln -lrb- cgd -rrb- , the christian community of cologne , told deutsche welle that jones preached a strict , even fundamental understanding of the bible , but that no direct comparisons could be drawn between his sermons there and the radical views he is currently espousing at his new church .
" we want to make it clear that our church is opposed to what terry jones is advocating at the moment and that the cgd , even though he is the founder , has no more contact with him , " baar said .
the community asked him to leave in 2008 .
baar insisted that there were no controversies surrounding his departure .
" he just left ; we did not witness any of the deeply disturbing things we are seeing now .
pastor terry jones was placing too much emphasis on himself and distracting our members from their christian faiths .
he and our church simply went their separate ways . "
' gate to hell ' brigitte baetz , a cologne journalist who is a regular contributor on german public radio , said jones espoused radical christian views while at the helm of the cgd .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protests against the actions have begun in kabul baetz told deutsche welle that jones commonly referred to the city of cologne as a " gate to hell " and emphasized that christians were " persecuted " there and took on the role of " innocent victims who would be rewarded for their suffering . "
" in his sermons terry jones often convinced the members that they were made to suffer hardships because they were part of the cgd .
he said again and again that the members were the victims of persecution and that it led to them losing their jobs and social status , for instance . "
baetz said that jones ' sermons bordered on fundamentalist interpretations of the bible .
she singled out his vehement opposition to cologne plans to construct a mosque in the city as an example of his extremist views .
" terry jones saw religion as wrong and right .
he told his followers here in germany that christians , and especially members of his cgd , were the only ones who were right .
this is the basis , i believe , for what he is doing right now with his new church in florida , " baetz said .
us unable to prevent controversial burning leading figures around the globe have expressed fears that jones ' planned " international burn a koran day " could seriously strain relations between muslims and the west .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : petraeus said jones would provide propaganda for rebels david petraeus , the top us and nato commander in afghanistan , warned that " burning the holy book of islam provides propaganda for insurgents and could endanger the -lsb- alliance 's -rsb- overall effort . "
petraeus ' comments were echoed later by nato secretary general anders fogh rasmussen .
in response to petraeus ' words of caution , meanwhile , jones said on tuesday : " why do n't we send a warning to them ?
why do n't we send a warning to radical islam and say , ' do n't do it ? '
if you attack us , if you attack us , we will attack you . "
the united states government appears unable to prevent jones ' september 11 commemoration plans on saturday .
although florida fire authorities have turned down jones ' application to stage the open-air burning ceremony , police will not be allowed to intervene until the korans have actually been lit .

the court said the gambling laws were being applied inconsistently . the german government 's monopoly on most forms of gambling must be ended immediately , according to the european court of justice in luxembourg .
the court ruled that " the german rules do not limit games of chance in a consistent and systematic manner . " it said that the state the monopoly is not justifiable .
under german law , only the country 's 16 federal states or companies run by them can offer gambling services .
the state therefore has an effective monopoly on gambling and lotteries .

the german state treaty on gambling came into force in 2008 to curb a growing trend in gambling addiction .
critics say it simply ensured that the state received a substantial chunk of the revenue from gambling .
internet betting agencies based abroad a number of private betting companies have challenged the treaty , saying it is inconsistent , because the federal states do not hold a monopoly on certain forms of gambling like slot machines and casinos .

the court said the gambling laws were being applied inconsistently . the german government 's monopoly on most forms of gambling must be ended immediately , according to the european court of justice in luxembourg .
the court ruled that " the german rules do not limit games of chance in a consistent and systematic manner . " it said that the state the monopoly is not justifiable .
under german law , only the country 's 16 federal states or companies run by them can offer gambling services .
the state therefore has an effective monopoly on gambling and lotteries .
the law also bans most web-based betting , and forbids advertising such services .
the german state treaty on gambling came into force in 2008 to curb a growing trend in gambling addiction .
critics say it simply ensured that the state received a substantial chunk of the revenue from gambling .
internet betting agencies based abroad a number of private betting companies have challenged the treaty , saying it is inconsistent , because the federal states do not hold a monopoly on certain forms of gambling like slot machines and casinos .
numerous internet users place bets illegally with private online companies registered abroad , which tend to offer better odds .

here , too , he was known for his extreme convictions . a german church founded and formerly led by terry jones , the american pastor who international attracted attention with controversial plans to stage a koran-burning ceremony , expressly denounced those plans on wednesday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jones ' former church is ' deeply disturbed ' by their former leader stephan baar , deputy chairman of the christliche gemeinde koeln -lrb- cgd -rrb- , the christian community of cologne , told deutsche welle that jones preached a strict , even fundamental understanding of the bible , but that no direct comparisons could be drawn between his sermons there and the radical views he is currently espousing at his new church .
" we want to make it clear that our church is opposed to what terry jones is advocating at the moment and that the cgd , even though he is the founder , has no more contact with him , " baar said .
the community asked him to leave in 2008 .
baar insisted that there were no controversies surrounding his departure .
" he just left ; we did not witness any of the deeply disturbing things we are seeing now .
pastor terry jones was placing too much emphasis on himself and distracting our members from their christian faiths .
he and our church simply went their separate ways . "
' gate to hell ' brigitte baetz , a cologne journalist who is a regular contributor on german public radio , said jones espoused radical christian views while at the helm of the cgd .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protests against the actions have begun in kabul baetz told deutsche welle that jones commonly referred to the city of cologne as a " gate to hell " and emphasized that christians were " persecuted " there and took on the role of " innocent victims who would be rewarded for their suffering . "
" in his sermons terry jones often convinced the members that they were made to suffer hardships because they were part of the cgd .
he said again and again that the members were the victims of persecution and that it led to them losing their jobs and social status , for instance . "
baetz said that jones ' sermons bordered on fundamentalist interpretations of the bible .
she singled out his vehement opposition to cologne plans to construct a mosque in the city as an example of his extremist views .
" terry jones saw religion as wrong and right .
he told his followers here in germany that christians , and especially members of his cgd , were the only ones who were right .
this is the basis , i believe , for what he is doing right now with his new church in florida , " baetz said .
us unable to prevent controversial burning leading figures around the globe have expressed fears that jones ' planned " international burn a koran day " could seriously strain relations between muslims and the west .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : petraeus said jones would provide propaganda for rebels david petraeus , the top us and nato commander in afghanistan , warned that " burning the holy book of islam provides propaganda for insurgents and could endanger the -lsb- alliance 's -rsb- overall effort . "
petraeus ' comments were echoed later by nato secretary general anders fogh rasmussen .
in response to petraeus ' words of caution , meanwhile , jones said on tuesday : " why do n't we send a warning to them ?
why do n't we send a warning to radical islam and say , ' do n't do it ? '
if you attack us , if you attack us , we will attack you . "
the united states government appears unable to prevent jones ' september 11 commemoration plans on saturday .
although florida fire authorities have turned down jones ' application to stage the open-air burning ceremony , police will not be allowed to intervene until the korans have actually been lit .

the european parliament has agreed on rules to closely monitor procedures , with a complete ban on using some species . animal experiments in the eu are set to become fewer in number and subject to stricter rules under a new directive backed by the european parliament on wednesday .
the european commission rules were described as a " quantum leap for animal protection " by european parliamentarian elisabeth jeggle , a german christian democrat who steered the directive through parliament .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : potocnik said the eu was setting new standards the measures , which would still allow the testing of animals for medical research , were described as setting the highest animal welfare standards in the world by eu environment commissioner janez potocnik .
under the legislation , national authorities will have to assess the animal welfare implications of every experiment carried out .
each country will be given two years to comply with the rules , and authorities must " ensure that whenever an alternative method is available , this is used instead of animal testing . "
in addition , animal welfare officials must also work at ensuring that pain experienced in experiments that actually go ahead is reduced .
ban on use of certain primates the rules also place greater restrictions on the use of primates in testing .
experiments on great apes such as chimpanzees , gorillas and orangutans are to be banned , while " strict " restrictions are to be introduced on the use of primates more generally .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the directive includes a ban on tests on great apes the legislation allows researchers to use primates in testing illnesses such as alzheimer 's disease , cancer or parkinson 's disease only where there is scientific evidence that no alternative is available .
eu health and consumer policy commissioner john dalli called the directive - which updates rules last agreed in 1986 - " a good compromise on a difficult topic . "
however , not every member of parliament was satisfied .
" i would have liked even stricter restrictions , " said ulrike rodust , a germany social democrat .
some 12 million animals are experimented upon each year in the eu .
last year the eu banned animal testing for developing cosmetics , apart from long-running toxicology tests , which will be banned in 2013 .

the european parliament has agreed on rules to closely monitor procedures , with a complete ban on using some species . animal experiments in the eu are set to become fewer in number and subject to stricter rules under a new directive backed by the european parliament on wednesday .
the european commission rules were described as a " quantum leap for animal protection " by european parliamentarian elisabeth jeggle , a german christian democrat who steered the directive through parliament .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : potocnik said the eu was setting new standards the measures , which would still allow the testing of animals for medical research , were described as setting the highest animal welfare standards in the world by eu environment commissioner janez potocnik .
under the legislation , national authorities will have to assess the animal welfare implications of every experiment carried out .
each country will be given two years to comply with the rules , and authorities must " ensure that whenever an alternative method is available , this is used instead of animal testing . "
in addition , animal welfare officials must also work at ensuring that pain experienced in experiments that actually go ahead is reduced .
ban on use of certain primates the rules also place greater restrictions on the use of primates in testing .
experiments on great apes such as chimpanzees , gorillas and orangutans are to be banned , while " strict " restrictions are to be introduced on the use of primates more generally .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the directive includes a ban on tests on great apes the legislation allows researchers to use primates in testing illnesses such as alzheimer 's disease , cancer or parkinson 's disease only where there is scientific evidence that no alternative is available .
eu health and consumer policy commissioner john dalli called the directive - which updates rules last agreed in 1986 - " a good compromise on a difficult topic . "
however , not every member of parliament was satisfied .
" i would have liked even stricter restrictions , " said ulrike rodust , a germany social democrat .
some 12 million animals are experimented upon each year in the eu .
last year the eu banned animal testing for developing cosmetics , apart from long-running toxicology tests , which will be banned in 2013 .

the court said the gambling laws were being applied inconsistently . the german government 's monopoly on most forms of gambling must be ended immediately , according to the european court of justice in luxembourg .
the court ruled that " the german rules do not limit games of chance in a consistent and systematic manner . " it said that the state the monopoly is not justifiable .
under german law , only the country 's 16 federal states or companies run by them can offer gambling services .
the state therefore has an effective monopoly on gambling and lotteries .
the law also bans most web-based betting , and forbids advertising such services .
the german state treaty on gambling came into force in 2008 to curb a growing trend in gambling addiction .
critics say it simply ensured that the state received a substantial chunk of the revenue from gambling .
internet betting agencies based abroad a number of private betting companies have challenged the treaty , saying it is inconsistent , because the federal states do not hold a monopoly on certain forms of gambling like slot machines and casinos .
numerous internet users place bets illegally with private online companies registered abroad , which tend to offer better odds .

what are they planning to do , sit around and wait to die ? - marga , us the retirement age should be raised because unaffordable benefits now will transfer the financial burden to the upcoming generations .
we will rely more and more on low wage manufacturing for affordable products , further exacerbating the problem . - steve , france the unions in france should fight against this reactionary measure and do what ever is necessary to stop the government from doing this disgraceful act against the people .
the president of france is similar to adolphe thiers who in 1871 ordered the french troops to eliminate the working class of paris .
what the french government is doing should be condemned by the working class every where in the world . - stan , canada german energy policy it really would be the greenest energy policy , relatively speaking , if the remaining energy in the spent nuclear fuel was used for something .
that would reduce the toxicity of spent fuel .
anything else would be irresponsible . - gene , us nein !
non !
no !
the decision is not good for our planet and chancellor merkel should know better , being a scientist .
but it good to see some compromise within the government debate . - stuart , australia i can not believe the german people are so blind on this subject .
the world is facing a climate catastrophe and needs to reduce co2 emissions as soon as possible .
germany , like australia , has high co2 emissions but believes that renewables are the answer .
please do the math ; no country , including germany , has ever reduced co2 emissions using renewables .
the only successful non-carbon technology is nuclear power which your neighbors france , switzerland and sweden have successfully used to reduce co2 emissions .
facts , not fantasy , must drive decision-making . - tom , australia germany must have a continuous reliable source of electricity and the present nuclear plants should run for their designed lifetimes .
there should not be any further construction of fossil fuel power stations unless they replace older ones that have reached the end of their most efficient lifespan . - roland , new zealand i think germany needs to review their energy policy , now that the country is not so vulnerable to geopolitical controls on natural gas .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de religion -pipe- 08.09.2010 former terry jones church in germany denounces koran-burning plan großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jones insists on going through with his plan pastor terry jones , whose call to " burn the koran " has led to fears of global repercussions , worked as missionary for decades in germany .
here , too , he was known for his extreme convictions . a german church founded and formerly led by terry jones , the american pastor who international attracted attention with controversial plans to stage a koran-burning ceremony , expressly denounced those plans on wednesday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jones ' former church is ' deeply disturbed ' by their former leader stephan baar , deputy chairman of the christliche gemeinde koeln -lrb- cgd -rrb- , the christian community of cologne , told deutsche welle that jones preached a strict , even fundamental understanding of the bible , but that no direct comparisons could be drawn between his sermons there and the radical views he is currently espousing at his new church .
" we want to make it clear that our church is opposed to what terry jones is advocating at the moment and that the cgd , even though he is the founder , has no more contact with him , " baar said .
the community asked him to leave in 2008 .
baar insisted that there were no controversies surrounding his departure .
" he just left ; we did not witness any of the deeply disturbing things we are seeing now .
pastor terry jones was placing too much emphasis on himself and distracting our members from their christian faiths .
he and our church simply went their separate ways . "
' gate to hell ' brigitte baetz , a cologne journalist who is a regular contributor on german public radio , said jones espoused radical christian views while at the helm of the cgd .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protests against the actions have begun in kabul baetz told deutsche welle that jones commonly referred to the city of cologne as a " gate to hell " and emphasized that christians were " persecuted " there and took on the role of " innocent victims who would be rewarded for their suffering . "
" in his sermons terry jones often convinced the members that they were made to suffer hardships because they were part of the cgd .
he said again and again that the members were the victims of persecution and that it led to them losing their jobs and social status , for instance . "
baetz said that jones ' sermons bordered on fundamentalist interpretations of the bible .
she singled out his vehement opposition to cologne plans to construct a mosque in the city as an example of his extremist views .
" terry jones saw religion as wrong and right .
he told his followers here in germany that christians , and especially members of his cgd , were the only ones who were right .
this is the basis , i believe , for what he is doing right now with his new church in florida , " baetz said .
us unable to prevent controversial burning leading figures around the globe have expressed fears that jones ' planned " international burn a koran day " could seriously strain relations between muslims and the west .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : petraeus said jones would provide propaganda for rebels david petraeus , the top us and nato commander in afghanistan , warned that " burning the holy book of islam provides propaganda for insurgents and could endanger the -lsb- alliance 's -rsb- overall effort . "
petraeus ' comments were echoed later by nato secretary general anders fogh rasmussen .
in response to petraeus ' words of caution , meanwhile , jones said on tuesday : " why do n't we send a warning to them ?
why do n't we send a warning to radical islam and say , ' do n't do it ? '
if you attack us , if you attack us , we will attack you . "
the united states government appears unable to prevent jones ' september 11 commemoration plans on saturday .
although florida fire authorities have turned down jones ' application to stage the open-air burning ceremony , police will not be allowed to intervene until the korans have actually been lit .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de animals -pipe- 08.09.2010 european parliament agrees to tougher rules on animal testing großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some 12 million animals are used in eu-wide tests per year animal experiments will be reduced in number and subject to stricter regulations across europe .
the european parliament has agreed on rules to closely monitor procedures , with a complete ban on using some species . animal experiments in the eu are set to become fewer in number and subject to stricter rules under a new directive backed by the european parliament on wednesday .
the european commission rules were described as a " quantum leap for animal protection " by european parliamentarian elisabeth jeggle , a german christian democrat who steered the directive through parliament .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : potocnik said the eu was setting new standards the measures , which would still allow the testing of animals for medical research , were described as setting the highest animal welfare standards in the world by eu environment commissioner janez potocnik .
under the legislation , national authorities will have to assess the animal welfare implications of every experiment carried out .
each country will be given two years to comply with the rules , and authorities must " ensure that whenever an alternative method is available , this is used instead of animal testing . "
in addition , animal welfare officials must also work at ensuring that pain experienced in experiments that actually go ahead is reduced .
ban on use of certain primates the rules also place greater restrictions on the use of primates in testing .
experiments on great apes such as chimpanzees , gorillas and orangutans are to be banned , while " strict " restrictions are to be introduced on the use of primates more generally .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the directive includes a ban on tests on great apes the legislation allows researchers to use primates in testing illnesses such as alzheimer 's disease , cancer or parkinson 's disease only where there is scientific evidence that no alternative is available .
eu health and consumer policy commissioner john dalli called the directive - which updates rules last agreed in 1986 - " a good compromise on a difficult topic . "
however , not every member of parliament was satisfied .
" i would have liked even stricter restrictions , " said ulrike rodust , a germany social democrat .
some 12 million animals are experimented upon each year in the eu .
last year the eu banned animal testing for developing cosmetics , apart from long-running toxicology tests , which will be banned in 2013 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de religion -pipe- 08.09.2010 former terry jones church in germany denounces koran-burning plan großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jones insists on going through with his plan pastor terry jones , whose call to " burn the koran " has led to fears of global repercussions , worked as missionary for decades in germany .
here , too , he was known for his extreme convictions . a german church founded and formerly led by terry jones , the american pastor who international attracted attention with controversial plans to stage a koran-burning ceremony , expressly denounced those plans on wednesday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jones ' former church is ' deeply disturbed ' by their former leader stephan baar , deputy chairman of the christliche gemeinde koeln -lrb- cgd -rrb- , the christian community of cologne , told deutsche welle that jones preached a strict , even fundamental understanding of the bible , but that no direct comparisons could be drawn between his sermons there and the radical views he is currently espousing at his new church .
" we want to make it clear that our church is opposed to what terry jones is advocating at the moment and that the cgd , even though he is the founder , has no more contact with him , " baar said .
the community asked him to leave in 2008 .
baar insisted that there were no controversies surrounding his departure .
" he just left ; we did not witness any of the deeply disturbing things we are seeing now .
pastor terry jones was placing too much emphasis on himself and distracting our members from their christian faiths .
he and our church simply went their separate ways . "
' gate to hell ' brigitte baetz , a cologne journalist who is a regular contributor on german public radio , said jones espoused radical christian views while at the helm of the cgd .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protests against the actions have begun in kabul baetz told deutsche welle that jones commonly referred to the city of cologne as a " gate to hell " and emphasized that christians were " persecuted " there and took on the role of " innocent victims who would be rewarded for their suffering . "
" in his sermons terry jones often convinced the members that they were made to suffer hardships because they were part of the cgd .
he said again and again that the members were the victims of persecution and that it led to them losing their jobs and social status , for instance . "
baetz said that jones ' sermons bordered on fundamentalist interpretations of the bible .
she singled out his vehement opposition to cologne plans to construct a mosque in the city as an example of his extremist views .
" terry jones saw religion as wrong and right .
he told his followers here in germany that christians , and especially members of his cgd , were the only ones who were right .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de religion -pipe- 08.09.2010 former terry jones church in germany denounces koran-burning plan großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jones insists on going through with his plan pastor terry jones , whose call to " burn the koran " has led to fears of global repercussions , worked as missionary for decades in germany .
here , too , he was known for his extreme convictions . a german church founded and formerly led by terry jones , the american pastor who international attracted attention with controversial plans to stage a koran-burning ceremony , expressly denounced those plans on wednesday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jones ' former church is ' deeply disturbed ' by their former leader stephan baar , deputy chairman of the christliche gemeinde koeln -lrb- cgd -rrb- , the christian community of cologne , told deutsche welle that jones preached a strict , even fundamental understanding of the bible , but that no direct comparisons could be drawn between his sermons there and the radical views he is currently espousing at his new church .
" we want to make it clear that our church is opposed to what terry jones is advocating at the moment and that the cgd , even though he is the founder , has no more contact with him , " baar said .
the community asked him to leave in 2008 .
baar insisted that there were no controversies surrounding his departure .
" he just left ; we did not witness any of the deeply disturbing things we are seeing now .
pastor terry jones was placing too much emphasis on himself and distracting our members from their christian faiths .
he and our church simply went their separate ways . "
' gate to hell ' brigitte baetz , a cologne journalist who is a regular contributor on german public radio , said jones espoused radical christian views while at the helm of the cgd .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protests against the actions have begun in kabul baetz told deutsche welle that jones commonly referred to the city of cologne as a " gate to hell " and emphasized that christians were " persecuted " there and took on the role of " innocent victims who would be rewarded for their suffering . "
" in his sermons terry jones often convinced the members that they were made to suffer hardships because they were part of the cgd .
he said again and again that the members were the victims of persecution and that it led to them losing their jobs and social status , for instance . "
baetz said that jones ' sermons bordered on fundamentalist interpretations of the bible .
she singled out his vehement opposition to cologne plans to construct a mosque in the city as an example of his extremist views .
" terry jones saw religion as wrong and right .
he told his followers here in germany that christians , and especially members of his cgd , were the only ones who were right .
this is the basis , i believe , for what he is doing right now with his new church in florida , " baetz said .
us unable to prevent controversial burning leading figures around the globe have expressed fears that jones ' planned " international burn a koran day " could seriously strain relations between muslims and the west .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : petraeus said jones would provide propaganda for rebels david petraeus , the top us and nato commander in afghanistan , warned that " burning the holy book of islam provides propaganda for insurgents and could endanger the -lsb- alliance 's -rsb- overall effort . "
petraeus ' comments were echoed later by nato secretary general anders fogh rasmussen .
in response to petraeus ' words of caution , meanwhile , jones said on tuesday : " why do n't we send a warning to them ?
why do n't we send a warning to radical islam and say , ' do n't do it ? '
if you attack us , if you attack us , we will attack you . "
the united states government appears unable to prevent jones ' september 11 commemoration plans on saturday .
although florida fire authorities have turned down jones ' application to stage the open-air burning ceremony , police will not be allowed to intervene until the korans have actually been lit .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de demographics -pipe- 08.09.2010 ' the smart ones all want to leave ' großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : about 150 apartments are demolished every year twenty years after unification , the country 's east is a radically different place .
structural changes have left urban populations in decline , and the brightest inhabitants are usually the first to go . right on germany 's eastern border the town of schwedt overlooks the river oder .
in the 1960s , this was a boom town : people moved here in tens of thousands to work in the local oil refinery .
but since reunification that trend has been radically reversed .
the pr assistant in schwedt town hall insists that the mayor himself will answer any questions .
" urban restructuring is a matter for the boss , " she says .
sure enough , the mayor , juergen polzehl , a gray-haired man in his mid-50s , invites me to go for a ride with him in his official car .
he tells the chauffeur to drive us to the kuelz district .
on the way there we pass row upon row of prefabricated apartment blocks - a legacy of the final , brief heyday of the uckermark regional municipality .
the town 's population swelled to 52,000 after the refinery was built , and housing had to be created for all the new arrivals .
rapid decline in population bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mayor polzehl says schwedt has spent billions of euros on urban restructuring then came german reunification .
workers at the refinery were laid off .
in the past 20 years , 20,000 people have moved away from schwedt .
at one time thousands of apartments stood empty .
" we had to respond to the situation , " says polzehl , pointing out of the window .
suddenly the buildings are interrupted by a wide , uneven open space .
" all this was apartment blocks , one after another .
now it 's all been returned to nature , " polzehl explains .
for a while they were demolishing as many as a thousand apartments in a year in schwedt .
now , polzehl says , it 's about 150 per year : the contraction of the town is gradually becoming more manageable .
billions of euros have been spent on urban restructuring .
demolition , reconstruction and reforestation help alleviate the sadness of the shrinking towns , but the alteration of the demographic has had a lasting effect on the makeup of the population .
polzehl is particularly concerned that so many young women have moved away .
this is a problem for many of the regions - and it has led to a severe shortage of young women in the new federal states .
the newspaper die welt reports that , in the 25-30 age bracket , in the east there are only 85 women for every 100 men .
polzehl remains optimistic .
" perhaps that will change if we locate a few businesses here and a local authority office .
that 'll improve the job situation , " he says , hopefully .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the oil refinery was once the city 's largest employer brain drain the mayor has set himself a considerable challenge .
conditions here , as in many parts of eastern germany , are not good .
the unemployment figure for the country as a whole is less than eight percent , but the east is struggling with more than 12 percent unemployment .
in schwedt it is even higher at 16 percent .
more efficient production methods and the closing or relocation of industry have greatly reduced the number of jobs available in the east .
those who are able to leave , do .
salaries , too , are higher in the west .
the young , the intelligent and the educated are leading the exodus , leaving behind the old and those described by despairing employers as " barely trainable . "
in an interview with the berliner zeitung in 2004 , ulf matthiesen , a researcher in area studies , described them as " unemployed urban idiots with no family ties and no prospect of forming a relationship . "
in parts of brandenburg and mecklenburg-western pomerania the number of pupils dropping out of school is 50 percent higher than the national average .
more than 10 percent leave school early , according to heike liebmann , head of the city regeneration department at the leibniz institute for regional development .
she describes this as an indication of the degree to which the general level of education among the local population has fallen .
furthermore , the fewer creative and enterprising people there are in public life , the less attractive the prospect of staying here becomes for those left behind .
it 's a vicious circle .
every year , ruediger ober-bloebaum resigns himself to seeing more of schwedt 's bright young people move away .
the stocky 50-year-old is the headmaster of the town 's last remaining high school .
last summer 103 pupils graduated , but he says : " of these , only seven are staying in schwedt .
the others are all going away to study or start an apprenticeship , and only 10 of those think they might come back . "
ober-bloebaum supposes schwedt is too quiet for them ; there 's just not enough going on there .
but there 's another problem , too .
he refers to a 2007 study by the berlin institute for population and development which suggested " that the girls are leaving because they find the boys here too stupid . "
wild , wild east bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : large parts of schwedt are returning to nature before unification in 1990 , then-chancellor helmut kohl spoke of the prospect of " landscapes in bloom . "
he used the term as a metaphor for the economic development of the east , but in recent years regional planners have suggested it should be taken literally .
they have proposed returning parts of eastern germany to nature .
liebmann says it 's hard to imagine how the movement of people could be controlled in such a process , but she adds that " it is certainly useful for society to consider whether it can afford to maintain the existing infrastructure in areas that are becoming less densely populated . "
polzehl is dismissive of such ideas .
" we ca n't just let all this become a jungle .
we have our roots here ; this is our home . "
and schwedt still has good things to offer .
it is responsible for 15 percent of the industrial production of the state of brandenburg , and germany 's only meadowland national park is right next door .
on the way back to the town hall , mayor polzehl draws encouragement from his own life story .
" i moved away too , when i was young , " he says .
" and now i 'm back again . "

structural changes have left urban populations in decline , and the brightest inhabitants are usually the first to go . right on germany 's eastern border the town of schwedt overlooks the river oder .
in the 1960s , this was a boom town : people moved here in tens of thousands to work in the local oil refinery .
but since reunification that trend has been radically reversed .
the pr assistant in schwedt town hall insists that the mayor himself will answer any questions .
" urban restructuring is a matter for the boss , " she says .
sure enough , the mayor , juergen polzehl , a gray-haired man in his mid-50s , invites me to go for a ride with him in his official car .
he tells the chauffeur to drive us to the kuelz district .
on the way there we pass row upon row of prefabricated apartment blocks - a legacy of the final , brief heyday of the uckermark regional municipality .
the town 's population swelled to 52,000 after the refinery was built , and housing had to be created for all the new arrivals .
rapid decline in population bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mayor polzehl says schwedt has spent billions of euros on urban restructuring then came german reunification .
workers at the refinery were laid off .
in the past 20 years , 20,000 people have moved away from schwedt .
at one time thousands of apartments stood empty .
" we had to respond to the situation , " says polzehl , pointing out of the window .
suddenly the buildings are interrupted by a wide , uneven open space .
" all this was apartment blocks , one after another .
now it 's all been returned to nature , " polzehl explains .
for a while they were demolishing as many as a thousand apartments in a year in schwedt .
now , polzehl says , it 's about 150 per year : the contraction of the town is gradually becoming more manageable .
billions of euros have been spent on urban restructuring .
demolition , reconstruction and reforestation help alleviate the sadness of the shrinking towns , but the alteration of the demographic has had a lasting effect on the makeup of the population .
polzehl is particularly concerned that so many young women have moved away .
this is a problem for many of the regions - and it has led to a severe shortage of young women in the new federal states .
the newspaper die welt reports that , in the 25-30 age bracket , in the east there are only 85 women for every 100 men .
polzehl remains optimistic .
" perhaps that will change if we locate a few businesses here and a local authority office .
that 'll improve the job situation , " he says , hopefully .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the oil refinery was once the city 's largest employer brain drain the mayor has set himself a considerable challenge .
conditions here , as in many parts of eastern germany , are not good .
the unemployment figure for the country as a whole is less than eight percent , but the east is struggling with more than 12 percent unemployment .
in schwedt it is even higher at 16 percent .
more efficient production methods and the closing or relocation of industry have greatly reduced the number of jobs available in the east .
those who are able to leave , do .
salaries , too , are higher in the west .
the young , the intelligent and the educated are leading the exodus , leaving behind the old and those described by despairing employers as " barely trainable . "
in an interview with the berliner zeitung in 2004 , ulf matthiesen , a researcher in area studies , described them as " unemployed urban idiots with no family ties and no prospect of forming a relationship . "
in parts of brandenburg and mecklenburg-western pomerania the number of pupils dropping out of school is 50 percent higher than the national average .
more than 10 percent leave school early , according to heike liebmann , head of the city regeneration department at the leibniz institute for regional development .
she describes this as an indication of the degree to which the general level of education among the local population has fallen .
furthermore , the fewer creative and enterprising people there are in public life , the less attractive the prospect of staying here becomes for those left behind .
it 's a vicious circle .
every year , ruediger ober-bloebaum resigns himself to seeing more of schwedt 's bright young people move away .
the stocky 50-year-old is the headmaster of the town 's last remaining high school .
last summer 103 pupils graduated , but he says : " of these , only seven are staying in schwedt .
the others are all going away to study or start an apprenticeship , and only 10 of those think they might come back . "
ober-bloebaum supposes schwedt is too quiet for them ; there 's just not enough going on there .
but there 's another problem , too .
he refers to a 2007 study by the berlin institute for population and development which suggested " that the girls are leaving because they find the boys here too stupid . "
wild , wild east bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : large parts of schwedt are returning to nature before unification in 1990 , then-chancellor helmut kohl spoke of the prospect of " landscapes in bloom . "
he used the term as a metaphor for the economic development of the east , but in recent years regional planners have suggested it should be taken literally .
they have proposed returning parts of eastern germany to nature .
liebmann says it 's hard to imagine how the movement of people could be controlled in such a process , but she adds that " it is certainly useful for society to consider whether it can afford to maintain the existing infrastructure in areas that are becoming less densely populated . "
polzehl is dismissive of such ideas .
" we ca n't just let all this become a jungle .
we have our roots here ; this is our home . "
and schwedt still has good things to offer .

now , 20 years on , germany has been fully accepted by its european neighbors . it was in january 1990 , during a walk along the french atlantic coast , that the then-chancellor helmut kohl convinced french president francois mitterrand to support german unification .
mitterrand was skeptical at first , but kohl persuaded him by pledging his commitment to european integration .
with france on board , helmut kohl had the backing of germany 's most important european neighbor .
french sentiment had normalized in a way that it had not done to the same degree in britain and the united states , says french political theorist and journalist alfred grosser .
" with a few exceptions , french opinion polls show that people here saw the germans as friends .
they thought it perfectly natural that the two states should become one again , " he said .
indeed , kohl did not have the same success with his british colleague , prime minister margaret thatcher .
she opposed a unified germany ; but she was replaced as british leader in november 1990 by her fellow conservative party member john major .
germany furthered european integration bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kohl 's passion about european integration convinced mitterrand kohl promised that germany would maintain the european union course of greater integration , which he reaffirmed a year later : " unified germany does not want a return to the europe of yesterday , " he declared to the bundestag .
" there can been no revival of old rivalries and nationalisms .
we want a new europe - one that does not suppress our national identity , one in which countries no longer oppose one another , where no nation stands in the shadow of another , but -lsb- a europe -rsb- in which , together , we can guarantee a future in peace and freedom , prosperity and security . "
over the 20 years since reunification , german governments of all political colors have upheld kohl 's promise : germany championed the admission of the former east bloc states into the eu ; it paid for the eu 's eastward expansion , and the germans gave up their currency , the deutschmark , for the euro . '
german unity signifies european unity ' the reservations many of germany 's neighbors still harbored about the country they had fought in world war ii gradually disappeared .
belgium , for example , had no qualms about germany 's increased size , according to political scientist dirk rochtus of lessius hogeschool university college in antwerp .
" german unity also signifies european unity , " he said .
" that was clear to us here in belgium .
if the two german nations come together again , it also signifies that we have overcome the division of europe .
we see that as a good thing . "
the older generation , which had lived through the german occupation of belgium , did have doubts though .
" naturally there are older people who still have memories of that time , " rochtus said .
" but generally it has to be said that the response has been quite matter-of-fact - and also that we make a distinction between a people , in this case the german people , and the regime that governed this people and headed the occupation regime in belgium .
we make a very big distinction between the two . "
poles and czechs skeptical germany 's neighbors to the east , poland and the czech republic , also had many initial reservations .
after the political upheaval they had experienced , poles realized that germany no longer made any claims on their country and that the german government was serious about european unity , according to janusz reiter , poland 's former ambassador to bonn -lrb- 1990-1995 -rrb- .
" nowadays , germany 's size is no reason for its neighbors to be afraid , " he said .
" the relationship between germany and poland is still not entirely free of ambivalence and tensions , but for different reasons . "
poles are well aware of germany 's economic strength , and are keen to go to their western neighbor to earn money , he added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poles like andrzej stasiuk remain cautious when it comes to germany but there are limits , according to polish author andrzej stasiuk .
" very few poles would think of going to germany on holiday , " he said .
" you do n't go to germany for fun . "
in a recent article for german magazine focus , stasiuk wrote : " germany is not to be taken for granted ; germany is equivocal .
you have to keep your eyes on germany . "
prague-based political scientist robert schuster believes that until the end of the 1990s czechs were afraid of germany - and of the possibility that germans expelled after world war ii might make claims against them .
tensions between the two only started to ease after they signed a joint declaration in 1998 .
the declaration addressed the wounds of the past , as well as crimes committed during and after world war ii ; and it also highlighted perspectives for a joint future .
" the two countries are not competing anymore , " schuster said .
" they are no longer enemies , but members of a community , the eu .
and members of nato .
this aspect of security policy should not be underestimated . "
and he added that young czechs - who have had the opportunity to travel to germany , to study there and meet germans of their own age - have a completely different image of germans to that of the generation aged 50 and over .
football instigated the breakthrough the netherlands , luxembourg , switzerland and austria at first held back , but then gave their approval to german unification .
today , the spending power of german tourists means they are more popular than ever in their neighboring countries , although opinion polls suggest that germans themselves do n't quite believe this .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 2006 world cup showed a side of the country that many had not seen before " we ca n't tell the difference any more between ossis and wessis - that is , germans from the former east or west , " said austrian historian oliver radkolb .
and germany 's northern neighbor , denmark , has also accepted the new , larger germany , according to danish writer knud romer .
for decades danes regarded the germans as a nation of perpetrators , as did many other people in europe , he pointed out .
the breakthrough came with the soccer world cup , which germany hosted in 2006 , he added .
" that was when i realized , for the first time , that the war was over .
finished .
there 's none of that anymore , " romer said .
" and the danes were cheering the germans on . "

structural changes have left urban populations in decline , and the brightest inhabitants are usually the first to go . right on germany 's eastern border the town of schwedt overlooks the river oder .
in the 1960s , this was a boom town : people moved here in tens of thousands to work in the local oil refinery .
but since reunification that trend has been radically reversed .
the pr assistant in schwedt town hall insists that the mayor himself will answer any questions .
" urban restructuring is a matter for the boss , " she says .
sure enough , the mayor , juergen polzehl , a gray-haired man in his mid-50s , invites me to go for a ride with him in his official car .
he tells the chauffeur to drive us to the kuelz district .
on the way there we pass row upon row of prefabricated apartment blocks - a legacy of the final , brief heyday of the uckermark regional municipality .
the town 's population swelled to 52,000 after the refinery was built , and housing had to be created for all the new arrivals .
rapid decline in population bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mayor polzehl says schwedt has spent billions of euros on urban restructuring then came german reunification .
workers at the refinery were laid off .
in the past 20 years , 20,000 people have moved away from schwedt .
at one time thousands of apartments stood empty .
" we had to respond to the situation , " says polzehl , pointing out of the window .
suddenly the buildings are interrupted by a wide , uneven open space .
" all this was apartment blocks , one after another .
now it 's all been returned to nature , " polzehl explains .
for a while they were demolishing as many as a thousand apartments in a year in schwedt .
now , polzehl says , it 's about 150 per year : the contraction of the town is gradually becoming more manageable .
billions of euros have been spent on urban restructuring .
demolition , reconstruction and reforestation help alleviate the sadness of the shrinking towns , but the alteration of the demographic has had a lasting effect on the makeup of the population .
polzehl is particularly concerned that so many young women have moved away .
this is a problem for many of the regions - and it has led to a severe shortage of young women in the new federal states .
the newspaper die welt reports that , in the 25-30 age bracket , in the east there are only 85 women for every 100 men .
polzehl remains optimistic .
" perhaps that will change if we locate a few businesses here and a local authority office .
that 'll improve the job situation , " he says , hopefully .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the oil refinery was once the city 's largest employer brain drain the mayor has set himself a considerable challenge .
conditions here , as in many parts of eastern germany , are not good .
the unemployment figure for the country as a whole is less than eight percent , but the east is struggling with more than 12 percent unemployment .
in schwedt it is even higher at 16 percent .
more efficient production methods and the closing or relocation of industry have greatly reduced the number of jobs available in the east .
those who are able to leave , do .
salaries , too , are higher in the west .
the young , the intelligent and the educated are leading the exodus , leaving behind the old and those described by despairing employers as " barely trainable . "
in an interview with the berliner zeitung in 2004 , ulf matthiesen , a researcher in area studies , described them as " unemployed urban idiots with no family ties and no prospect of forming a relationship . "
in parts of brandenburg and mecklenburg-western pomerania the number of pupils dropping out of school is 50 percent higher than the national average .
more than 10 percent leave school early , according to heike liebmann , head of the city regeneration department at the leibniz institute for regional development .
she describes this as an indication of the degree to which the general level of education among the local population has fallen .
furthermore , the fewer creative and enterprising people there are in public life , the less attractive the prospect of staying here becomes for those left behind .
it 's a vicious circle .
every year , ruediger ober-bloebaum resigns himself to seeing more of schwedt 's bright young people move away .
the stocky 50-year-old is the headmaster of the town 's last remaining high school .
last summer 103 pupils graduated , but he says : " of these , only seven are staying in schwedt .
the others are all going away to study or start an apprenticeship , and only 10 of those think they might come back . "
ober-bloebaum supposes schwedt is too quiet for them ; there 's just not enough going on there .
but there 's another problem , too .
he refers to a 2007 study by the berlin institute for population and development which suggested " that the girls are leaving because they find the boys here too stupid . "
wild , wild east bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : large parts of schwedt are returning to nature before unification in 1990 , then-chancellor helmut kohl spoke of the prospect of " landscapes in bloom . "
he used the term as a metaphor for the economic development of the east , but in recent years regional planners have suggested it should be taken literally .
they have proposed returning parts of eastern germany to nature .
liebmann says it 's hard to imagine how the movement of people could be controlled in such a process , but she adds that " it is certainly useful for society to consider whether it can afford to maintain the existing infrastructure in areas that are becoming less densely populated . "
polzehl is dismissive of such ideas .
" we ca n't just let all this become a jungle .
we have our roots here ; this is our home . "
and schwedt still has good things to offer .
it is responsible for 15 percent of the industrial production of the state of brandenburg , and germany 's only meadowland national park is right next door .
on the way back to the town hall , mayor polzehl draws encouragement from his own life story .
" i moved away too , when i was young , " he says .
" and now i 'm back again . "

now , 20 years on , germany has been fully accepted by its european neighbors . it was in january 1990 , during a walk along the french atlantic coast , that the then-chancellor helmut kohl convinced french president francois mitterrand to support german unification .
mitterrand was skeptical at first , but kohl persuaded him by pledging his commitment to european integration .
with france on board , helmut kohl had the backing of germany 's most important european neighbor .
french sentiment had normalized in a way that it had not done to the same degree in britain and the united states , says french political theorist and journalist alfred grosser .
" with a few exceptions , french opinion polls show that people here saw the germans as friends .
they thought it perfectly natural that the two states should become one again , " he said .
indeed , kohl did not have the same success with his british colleague , prime minister margaret thatcher .
she opposed a unified germany ; but she was replaced as british leader in november 1990 by her fellow conservative party member john major .
germany furthered european integration bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kohl 's passion about european integration convinced mitterrand kohl promised that germany would maintain the european union course of greater integration , which he reaffirmed a year later : " unified germany does not want a return to the europe of yesterday , " he declared to the bundestag .
" there can been no revival of old rivalries and nationalisms .
we want a new europe - one that does not suppress our national identity , one in which countries no longer oppose one another , where no nation stands in the shadow of another , but -lsb- a europe -rsb- in which , together , we can guarantee a future in peace and freedom , prosperity and security . "
over the 20 years since reunification , german governments of all political colors have upheld kohl 's promise : germany championed the admission of the former east bloc states into the eu ; it paid for the eu 's eastward expansion , and the germans gave up their currency , the deutschmark , for the euro . '
german unity signifies european unity ' the reservations many of germany 's neighbors still harbored about the country they had fought in world war ii gradually disappeared .
belgium , for example , had no qualms about germany 's increased size , according to political scientist dirk rochtus of lessius hogeschool university college in antwerp .
" german unity also signifies european unity , " he said .
" that was clear to us here in belgium .
if the two german nations come together again , it also signifies that we have overcome the division of europe .
we see that as a good thing . "
the older generation , which had lived through the german occupation of belgium , did have doubts though .
" naturally there are older people who still have memories of that time , " rochtus said .
" but generally it has to be said that the response has been quite matter-of-fact - and also that we make a distinction between a people , in this case the german people , and the regime that governed this people and headed the occupation regime in belgium .
we make a very big distinction between the two . "
poles and czechs skeptical germany 's neighbors to the east , poland and the czech republic , also had many initial reservations .
after the political upheaval they had experienced , poles realized that germany no longer made any claims on their country and that the german government was serious about european unity , according to janusz reiter , poland 's former ambassador to bonn -lrb- 1990-1995 -rrb- .
" nowadays , germany 's size is no reason for its neighbors to be afraid , " he said .
" the relationship between germany and poland is still not entirely free of ambivalence and tensions , but for different reasons . "
poles are well aware of germany 's economic strength , and are keen to go to their western neighbor to earn money , he added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poles like andrzej stasiuk remain cautious when it comes to germany but there are limits , according to polish author andrzej stasiuk .
" very few poles would think of going to germany on holiday , " he said .
" you do n't go to germany for fun . "
in a recent article for german magazine focus , stasiuk wrote : " germany is not to be taken for granted ; germany is equivocal .
you have to keep your eyes on germany . "
prague-based political scientist robert schuster believes that until the end of the 1990s czechs were afraid of germany - and of the possibility that germans expelled after world war ii might make claims against them .
tensions between the two only started to ease after they signed a joint declaration in 1998 .
the declaration addressed the wounds of the past , as well as crimes committed during and after world war ii ; and it also highlighted perspectives for a joint future .
" the two countries are not competing anymore , " schuster said .
" they are no longer enemies , but members of a community , the eu .
and members of nato .
this aspect of security policy should not be underestimated . "
and he added that young czechs - who have had the opportunity to travel to germany , to study there and meet germans of their own age - have a completely different image of germans to that of the generation aged 50 and over .
football instigated the breakthrough the netherlands , luxembourg , switzerland and austria at first held back , but then gave their approval to german unification .
today , the spending power of german tourists means they are more popular than ever in their neighboring countries , although opinion polls suggest that germans themselves do n't quite believe this .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 2006 world cup showed a side of the country that many had not seen before " we ca n't tell the difference any more between ossis and wessis - that is , germans from the former east or west , " said austrian historian oliver radkolb .
and germany 's northern neighbor , denmark , has also accepted the new , larger germany , according to danish writer knud romer .
for decades danes regarded the germans as a nation of perpetrators , as did many other people in europe , he pointed out .
the breakthrough came with the soccer world cup , which germany hosted in 2006 , he added .
" that was when i realized , for the first time , that the war was over .
finished .
there 's none of that anymore , " romer said .
" and the danes were cheering the germans on . "
